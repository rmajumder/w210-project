  "<p>A Connecticut judge ruled on Friday that a group of families cannot hold gun companies liable for manufacturing, distributing or selling the AR-15-style rifle used to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/sandy-hook-newtown-victims-trial-gun-manufacturers-adam-lanza\">Families of Newtown victims take on gun manufacturers in regulation case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gun companies are protected by a 2005 federal law designed to shield gun companies from liability when their products are misused by criminals, Connecticut superior court judge Barbara Bellis ruled, granting the gun companies\u2019 motion to strike the case. </p> <p>The Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/gun-violence-prevention/\">pledged to repeal</a> this 2005 law if elected. Clinton\u2019s campaign has argued that the law \u201clets gun manufacturers and dealers act without consequence\u201d and that \u201cending the gun industry\u2019s legal immunity is an important step in tackling the epidemic of gun violence in this country\u201d.</p> <p>Gun rights advocates and gun companies say the law, which protects gun companies from liability \u201cfor the harm purely caused by criminal or unlawful use of firearm products\u201d, is common sense and shields the industry from politically motivated attacks. </p> <p>The Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle used in the 2012 school shooting had been legally purchased by shooter Adam Lanza\u2019s mother. Lanza shot and killed her before driving to a local elementary school and murdering dozens of people. </p> <p>Clinton championed the Sandy Hook families involved in the lawsuit earlier this year as part of a series of attacks on her then opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, who had voted in favor of the law. But her campaign said at the time that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act ensured that the families\u2019 chance of success in the case was \u201cslim\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the families are obviously disappointed with the judge\u2019s decision, this is not the end of the fight. We will appeal this decision immediately and continue our work to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening,\u201d Josh Koskoff, one of the lawyers representing the Sandy Hook families, said in a statement on Friday. </p> <p>The defendants in the lawsuit include Bushmaster, the company that made the rifle; Camfour, a firearms distributor; and Riverview Gun Sales, the store where the gun was bought. According to court filings, Bushmaster merged into Remington Arms, which is also named in the lawsuit, in 2011. Both companies are part of the Freedom Group, which calls itself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading innovator, designer, manufacturer and marketer of firearms\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"688d34ef04ce5215f039134788ed60eef6b8f5de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/688d34ef04ce5215f039134788ed60eef6b8f5de/0_100_5267_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Hockley, who lost her child, Dylan Hockley, 6, in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut, testifies on assault weapon legislation at the state senate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicole Hockley, who lost her child, Dylan Hockley, 6, in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut, testifies on assault weapon legislation at the state senate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Perlman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does not shield gun companies and dealers from all legal liability. They can still be sued over defective products, if they break the laws governing gun sales, and for \u201cnegligent entrustment\u201d, or selling the gun to someone who would obviously misuse it.</p> <p>To get around the shield law, lawyers for the Sandy Hook families had tried to argue that the manufacturer, distributor and dealer were all \u201cnegligent\u201d to market and sell powerful military-style weapons to civilians. The Connecticut judge rejected this argument.</p> <p>Agreeing with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 legal theory \u201cwould imply that the general public lacks the ordinary prudence to handle an object that Congress regards as appropriate for sale to the general public. This the court is unwilling to do,\u201d the judge ruled.</p> <p>Millions of Americans own AR-15s, which are one of the most popular styles of consumer rifles in America. FBI data suggests that only 3.55% of all gun murders are committed with any type of rifle. Most gun murders are committed with handguns.</p> <p>\u201cRemington is pleased with the court\u2019s decision today to strike the plaintiff\u2019s complaint,\u201d Remington lawyer James Vogts said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that the court has dismissed the case based on the PLCAA,\u201d Larry Keane, the general counsel to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry\u2019s trade group, said in a statement. \u201cThis law passed Congress over a dozen years ago by a broad bipartisan margin. It does not provide \u2018blanket immunity\u2019, as some have claimed. It merely bars lawsuits that seek to hold manufacturers and dealers responsible for the criminal misuse of legal, non-defective products that were lawfully sold.\u201d</p> <p>Among the family members that filed the lawsuit against the gun companies were Mark and Jackie Barden, who lost their seven-year-old son, Daniel; Nicole and Ian Hockley, who lost their six-year-old son, Dylan; and Bill Sherlach, who lost his wife, Mary, the school\u2019s psychologist.</p> <p>When Jackie Barden researched the gun used to kill her son, she was shocked at the military language and images Bushmaster used to market its weapons. \u201cConsider your man card reissued,\u201d one ad read, with a photo of a black rifle. \u201cForces of opposition, bow down,\u201d read another.</p> <p>\u201cHere you have this machine that was designed for use by the military being sold to civilians, to untrained civilians, with aggressive military battlefield language,\u201d her husband, Mark, told the Guardian in April. \u201cAnd guess what? History has shown that these people who are suicidal, disturbed individuals who are bent on killing large numbers of people \u2013 that\u2019s the weapon they choose.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/gun-control-orlando-attack-newtown-mass-shooting\">Can the US break its cycle of gun control failure?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Several parents involved with the lawsuit said they thought gun companies\u2019 marketing made the weapons more attractive to disturbed, violent young men like the one who killed their children.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of guns that our shooter could have chosen from his arsenal and his mother\u2019s arsenal,\u201d Nicole Hockley said at a press conference in February. \u201cHe chose the AR-15. He was aware of how many shots it could get out, how lethal it was, how it would serve his objective of killing as many people as possible in as short a time as possible ... and the manufacturers need to be held responsible for that.\u201d</p> <p>Family members said they knew the lawsuit would be an uphill battle. They were told early on that \u201cgun manufacturers are untouchable\u201d, Jackie Barden said.</p> <p>Gun control groups criticized the decision and said PLCAA \u201cinfringed\u201d on victims\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cClaiming to protect one right, the gun lobby has infringed on another: the right to have your day in court,\u201d Robyn Thomas, the executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement. \u201cThe dismissal of the Newtown families\u2019 case doesn\u2019t mean their claims lack merit \u2013 it means that our system is rigged in favor of the gun industry and our leaders refuse to hold the manufacturers of deadly weapons of war accountable for the carnage they wreak in our communities, on our streets, and even in our first-grade classrooms. PLCAA is a disgrace that Congress must repeal.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Parliamentary committee hearings often get heated. </p> <p>Politicians, from all parties, have made names for themselves with sharp and persistent questions that expose important information or embarrassing facts, or sometimes just provide a look-at-me shouty grab for the evening news. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the then senator Bronwyn Bishop shot to public prominence with her combative questioning of the then tax commissioner Trevor Boucher in the joint committee on public accounts, accusing him \u2013 among other things \u2013 of bankrupting the tax office. Labor senators John Faulkner and Robert Ray were the bane of the public service with clinically calm forensic questioning that often lasted late into the night.</p> <p>Sometimes the witnesses came off best \u2013 most famously when the late Kerry Packer fronted the print media inquiry. He introduced himself as \u201cKerry Francis Bullmore Packer. I appear here this afternoon reluctantly\u201d and after much interrupting and table thumping left having stared down or batted back every question.</p> <p>But the Queensland Liberal National party senator Ian Macdonald has perfected a whole new Senate committee style, sometimes in tandem with a couple of colleagues \u2013 highly disrespectful questioning that almost never elicits significant information.</p> <p>Macdonald, you may recall, was the chair of the Senate estimates committee when it took evidence from the Human Rights Commission president, Gillian Triggs, last year at a time when the government was alleging she was biased and pressuring her to resign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/former-solicitor-general-slams-george-brandis-rules-for-the-job\">Former solicitor general criticises George Brandis' rules for the job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Presumably his job back then \u2013 in the nine-hour grilling \u2013 was to force the leading international and human rights lawyer to provide some evidence to back the government\u2019s claim that the HRC\u2019s \u201cForgotten Children\u201d report on children in immigration detention was biased.</p> <p>Instead, the hearing is remembered for Macdonald\u2019s admission that he had not even read the report because he did not want to \u201cwaste my time on a report which was clearly partisan\u201d, which does seem to prejudge the question.</p> <p>He also got to express his deep concern about the title. \u201cWith so much time and money being spent on children\u2019s welfare, how can anyone call them forgotten children?\u201d he complained, rhetorically.</p> <p>Triggs kept her cool throughout the highly combative questioning and will see out her five-year term as HRC president next year.</p> <p>Macdonald rejected the outcry about what was widely viewed as hectoring with a rambling statement insisting the report he had not read was inaccurate.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to all of those who have kindly (and not so kindly \u2013 they are the majority and are all Labor/Greens staffers, union heavies and staff and good old GetUp and old leftie journalists) \u2013 made media and social media comment on recent media reports on the Senate estimate committee on Professor Triggs and the partisan-ly titled report on children in detention, Forgotten Children.</p> <p>\u201cIf any of those who have abused me for not reading this partisan, inaccurate report had themselves bothered to read the facts on children in detention from any number of estimates on immigration \u2013 which sadly the Human Rights Commission [AHRC] itself didn\u2019t bother to read \u2013 then they may have not been so quick to rush to social media,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/did-george-brandis-mislead-parliament-over-solicitor-general-changes\">Did George Brandis mislead parliament over solicitor general changes? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday, Macdonald engaged in a similar performance with another highly respected lawyer and statutory office holder \u2013 the solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, who is locked in a very public argument with the attorney general, George Brandis.</p> <p>The argument centres on a directive from Brandis to Gleeson that says no one in government, including the prime minister, can seek Gleeson\u2019s advice without the attorney general\u2019s permission. Gleeson says he considers the directive unlawful. His predecessor as solicitor general, Gavan Griffiths, says it is akin to treating the solicitor general as a \u201cdog on a lead\u201d. Brandis says it did not constrain Gleeson in any additional way.</p> <p>There is also a related stoush over whether Brandis misled the parliament on the issue with a claim that he had consulted Gleeson over the directive, a disagreement which Brandis says rests entirely on the Oxford dictionary meaning of the word \u201cconsult\u201d and Gleeson says hinges on the fact that the specific new directive was not discussed, something Brandis now concedes.</p> <p>Despite their very public and vehement differences of opinion, Brandis and Gleeson got through their Senate committee appearances without making any nasty personal criticism of each other. </p> <p>There was plenty of disagreement about the substantive matters \u2013 Gleeson regarding the directive, and Brandis of the fact that Gleeson had taken a phone call during the election campaign from the shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus where it was discussed.</p> <p>And while the politeness was sometimes through gritted teeth, the first and second law offices of the land quite properly refrained from an all-in slanging match.</p> <p>Not so Macdonald, who persistently interrupted Gleeson and at one point interjected: \u201cIf you want to get into the political game, join the parliament\u201d \u2013 a statement he was quickly forced to retract.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/first-dog-on-the-moon-reads-george-brandiss-diaries\">First Dog on the Moon reads George Brandis's diaries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the chair, Labor\u2019s Louise Pratt, tried to call him into line, he again stunned those listening.</p> <p>\u201cSenator Macdonald.

Your dealings with witnesses need to be conducted with respect and courtesy, \u201c Pratt said.</p> <p>\u201cI always give witnesses the respect they deserve, madam chair,\u201d Macdonald replied.</p> <p>Quite apart from the fact that his treatment of Gleeson was highly inappropriate, if he paid any attention to the history of Senate committees, Macdonald would quickly learn that tough but respectful questioning usually gets better results. </p>",

On that comedy (the first two episodes are available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVpJDVp_Vmg\">for free on YouTube</a>), Nick Nolte plays a George W Bush-esque ex-president who realizes that he was, perhaps, the worst president ever and tries to remake his legacy with a bunch of crazy and charitable acts. </p> <p>But these two new additions aren\u2019t the tube\u2019s only fictional commanders-in-chief.

While he always managed to escape with the help of Jack Bauer, he eventually quit his re-election campaign and let a Republican become president. It was a fatal mistake, because that man\u2019s vice-president would eventually conspire to kill Palmer. Oh, and his personal life was a mess between his scheming wife, his chief of staff brother, and a lover whose scandal nearly derailed his campaign. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Approval rating: 40%</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/trump-dangerous-clinton-mirrors-the-most-shocking-presidential-attack-ads-ever-aired\">The mud-slingers: the most shocking presidential attack ads ever aired</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Conrad Dalton (Keith Carradine), Madam Secretary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0ba990df776006b7416aaa60dbea28530d0f85c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ba990df776006b7416aaa60dbea28530d0f85c/0_59_1333_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President of the bowties.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The worst part about Dalton, honestly, is his collection of bowties.

Stuck with an administration that didn\u2019t want her and a show plagued with behind-the-scenes turmoil, Allen didn\u2019t even get to finish serving out her first term when the show was cancelled after one season. <strong>Approval rating</strong>: <strong>20%</strong></p> <h2>Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Veep</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmCcFNQEzqE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EmCcFNQEzqE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like Mackenzie Allen before her, this female president found herself in power after the president stepped down.

During her re-election campaign, Meyer found herself in an unprecedented electoral college tie, which eventually led to, through a series of hilarious coincidences, her being ousted from office entirely.

  "<p>Contrary to the throaty moans of TV pundits and the aggrieved posts clogging your social media feeds, there is a miraculous silver lining to this methodical meat grinder of a presidential election. Something magnificent has occurred that only a once-in-a-lifetime pile of spoiled bologna like Donald Trump could manifest. The pearl-clutching, holy-rolling conservative media is exposing itself. Not literally, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-tv-producer\">Roger Ailes</a> has thought about it once or twice after one too many highballs at the country club.</p> <p>Former Boston Red Sox pitcher <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/real-time/Curt-Schilling-attempts-to-defend-Trumps-sexual-comments-about-a-10-year-old-girl.html\">Curt Schilling has found a new appreciation for his very \u201cbeautiful\u201d son </a>and sees no problem marveling at the attractiveness of underage girls. Rush Limbaugh, once a man committed to making Bill Clinton pay for his marital infidelity, has seen the light and now does not blink twice at stepping out on your wife<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rush-limbaugh-defends-trump-assault-229751\"> if they \u201clet you do anything\u201d</a>. Observing this is like watching a cat try to escape a burlap sack. The moral majority is struggling to find comfort with the most immoral candidate they could find.</p> <p>Now, seeing that their position is uniquely untenable, they are gamely attempting to claim that it is the Democrats who are the true hypocrites. After all, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rush-limbaugh-defends-trump-assault-229751\">Obama listens to hip-hop and has invited rappers to the White House</a>. Ann Coulter tweeted that Michelle Obama should be ashamed of herself for chastising Trump while giving credence to the notion that Beyonc\u00e9 is a role model for young girls, even though she has, in song, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/irl/ann-coulter-beyonce-twitter/\">declared that her is \u201cpussy curvalicious, served delicious\u201d</a>. Only human strawman Ann Coulter could find any equivalency between extoling the virtues of one\u2019s genitals and claiming someone else\u2019s as yours to do with as you please \u2013 and in any case, that line (from Feeling Myself) was delivered by Nicki Minaj.</p> <p>The thing is, Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, and Kanye West are not running for president (yet). No one is wondering if Fetty Wap is fit to run the most powerful military in the world or knows how to solve the Syrian refugee crisis. I have yet to find much support for a last-minute J Cole write-in candidacy, though I feel like DJ Khaled is subtly preparing to run for his local school board.</p> <p>If the above sounds preposterous to you, try to remember how we all felt when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. It seemed like the universe was taking the collective piss out of all of us, declaring that any dimwit possessing enough Twitter followers and a penchant for personal embarrassment could be a viable option for the highest office in the land. This ambulatory piece of salmon jerky can offer himself up for public service and it\u2019s treated as totally normal. The only thing Donald Trump has ever done that remotely resembles a selfless act was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/billy-bush-donald-trump-lewd-comments-tape-arianne-zucker\">when he inadvertently got Billy Bush fired from the Today Show</a>.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9 is not running for president, but Donald Trump is, which is why his words are the ones that matter here. The line for what is acceptable has moved so far, so fast, that the idea of a rapper in the White House should not be so unpleasant to the average Bible-humping conservative. As the Republican party further normalizes outrageous behavior by supporting their wholly unqualified, monstrous candidate, they welcome the very thing they seem so afraid of. </p> <p>There is no such thing as morality in politics any more. What we define as \u201cgood\u201d is irrelevant. Conservative pundits have torn down the wall between them and the popular culture with a glee and aplomb that borders on mania. People who claim faith like Ralph Reed have willfully turned themselves into bigger jokes than they were four years ago. When Desiigner becomes president in 12 years and changes the lyrics of the Star-Spangled Banner to some mindless gibberish about BMWs, it will be their fault.</p>",

The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman. It is cruel. It\u2019s frightening. And the truth is, it hurts.\u201d</p> <p>In her 25-minute speech, Obama did not mention black women or women of color but she didn\u2019t have to. That it was her \u2013 a black mother of two daughters she raised in a \u201chouse built by slaves\u201d \u2013 who delivered the definitive rebuke to Trump and his treatment of women registered the point that all women are vulnerable to sexism, sexual harassment and assault. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about this,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\u2019t have predicted. So while I\u2019d love nothing more than to pretend like this isn\u2019t happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.\u201d</p> <p>More than a year before the tape\u2019s release and the allegations, Trump lost his temper over a debate question about his history of making offensive and lewd remarks about women. In the months between, Trump attacked a grieving Gold Star mother, who is Muslim, and body-shamed a Latina beauty queen who revealed that he had called her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d.<br></p> <p>All the while Republicans largely stood by his side. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/women-needed-to-hear-michelle-obamas-new-hampshire-speech.html\">As many have noted</a>, Republicans and the media only drew the line on his behavior <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/07/social-media-reacts-to-trumps-remarks-about-women.html\">in response to instances of impropriety </a>\u2013 and later allegations of sexual assault \u2013 against white women.</p> <p>The Obamas, as articulated often by her husband, have long believed that the \u201carc of the moral universe\u201d bends away from people like Donald Trump, but the 2016 election has surely tested their faith. At turns, it\u2019s hard not to see 2016 and the rise of Donald Trump as a referendum on history, a sharp rebuke to the candidacy of the first black president and a blockade against the first woman president. In so many ways, he is everything Obama and Clinton are not. </p> <p>\u201cIt reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe thought all of that was ancient history, didn\u2019t we \u2026 but here we are, in 2016, and we\u2019re hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle Obama, who has carefully cultivated an everywoman appeal, is indisputably Clinton\u2019s most powerful \u2013 and popular \u2013 surrogate on the trail. And perhaps only Trump could have brought together the former rivals and first ladies \u2013 one who cannot wait to leave the White House and the other who cannot wait to get back in. </p> <p>During the second presidential debate on Sunday, Trump tried to step between the women. He <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-claim-about-michelle-obama-criti/\">falsely</a> claimed that Obama had run \u201csome of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d against Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary. </p> <p>\u201cYou talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>But to anyone paying attention, the attack on their friendship felt empty. Obama\u2019s New Hampshire speech was her sixth campaign event for Clinton in a month. In battleground states across the country, Obama has aggressively made the case for Clinton in a way no one else \u2013 not even Bill Clinton \u2013 has been able to crystallize. </p> <p>\u201cIn Hillary, we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service, someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting,\u201d Obama said on Thursday. \u201cShe is an outstanding mother. She has raised a phenomenal young woman. She is a loving, loyal wife. She\u2019s a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days. </p> <p>\u201cAnd if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton, we would be so proud. We would be proud.\u201d </p>",

That\u2019s very sweet of you. I love you guys too. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s just a few weeks before election day, as we come together to support the next president and vice-president of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! And New Hampshire is going to be important, as always.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to get a little serious here, because I think we can all agree that this has been a rough week in an already rough election. This week has been particularly interesting for me personally because it has been a week of profound contrast.</p> <p>See, on Tuesday, at the White House, we celebrated the International Day of the Girl and Let Girls Learn, and it was a wonderful celebration. It was the last event that I\u2019m going to be doing as first lady for Let Girls Learn. And I had the pleasure of spending hours talking to some of the most amazing young women you will ever meet, young girls here in the US and all around the world. And we talked about their hopes and their dreams. We talked about their aspirations. See, because many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school, jeopardizing their personal safety, their freedom, risking the rejection of their families and communities.</p> <p>So I thought it would be important to remind these young women how valuable and precious they are. I wanted them to understand that the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls. And I told them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them, and that they should make their voices heard in the world. And I walked away feeling so inspired, just like I\u2019m inspired by all the young people here \u2013 and I was so uplifted by these girls. That was Tuesday.</p> <p>And now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election where we have consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women \u2013 language that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women, but as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring, respectful adults, and as citizens who think that our nation\u2019s leaders should meet basic standards of human decency.</p> <p>The fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for president of the United States who, over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today. And last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. And I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</p> <p>And I have to tell you that I can\u2019t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\u2019t have predicted. So while I\u2019d love nothing more than to pretend like this isn\u2019t happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous of me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.</p> <p>This is not something that we can ignore. It\u2019s not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. Because this was not just a \u201clewd conversation\u201d. This wasn\u2019t just locker-room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.</p> <p>And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. It\u2019s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life. And I have to tell you that I listen to all of this and I feel it so personally, and I\u2019m sure that many of you do too, particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies. The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman.</p> <p>It is cruel. It\u2019s frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts. It\u2019s like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you\u2019re walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or when you see that guy at work that stands just a little too close, stares a little too long, and makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.</p> <p>It\u2019s that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt when someone has grabbed them, or forced himself on them and they\u2019ve said no but he didn\u2019t listen \u2013 something that we know happens on college campuses and countless other places every single day. It reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough.</p> <p>We thought all of that was ancient history, didn\u2019t we? And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect, but here we are in 2016 and we\u2019re hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail. We are drowning in it. And all of us are doing what women have always done: we\u2019re trying to keep our heads above water, just trying to get through it, trying to pretend like this doesn\u2019t really bother us maybe because we think that admitting how much it hurts makes us as women look weak.</p> <p>Maybe we\u2019re afraid to be that vulnerable. Maybe we\u2019ve grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet, because we\u2019ve seen that people often won\u2019t take our word over his. Or maybe we don\u2019t want to believe that there are still people out there who think so little of us as women. Too many are treating this as just another day\u2019s headline, as if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted, as if this is normal, just politics as usual.</p> <p>But, New Hampshire, be clear: this is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. And it doesn\u2019t matter what party you belong to \u2013 Democrat, Republican, independent \u2013 no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse.</p> <p>And I know it\u2019s a campaign, but this isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about basic human decency. It\u2019s about right and wrong. And we simply cannot endure this, or expose our children to this any \u2013 not for another minute, and let alone for four years. Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough. This has got to stop right now.</p> <p>Because consider this: if all of this is painful to us as grown women, what do you think this is doing to our children? What message are our little girls hearing about who they should look like, how they should act? What lessons are they learning about their value as professionals, as human beings, about their dreams and aspirations? And how is this affecting men and boys in this country? Because I can tell you that the men in my life do not talk about women like this. And I know that my family is not unusual. And to dismiss this as everyday locker-room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere.</p> <p>The men that you and I know don\u2019t treat women this way. They are loving fathers who are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language about women. They are husbands and brothers and sons who don\u2019t tolerate women being treated and demeaned and disrespected. And like us, these men are worried about the impact this election is having on our boys who are looking for role models of what it means to be a man.</p> <p>In fact, someone recently told me a story about their six-year-old son who one day was watching the news \u2013 they were watching the news together. And the little boy, out of the blue, said, \u201cI think Hillary Clinton will be president.\u201d And his mom said, \u201cWell, why do you say that?\u201d And this little six-year-old said, \u201cBecause the other guy called someone a piggy and,\u201d he said, \u201cYou cannot be president if you call someone a piggy.\u201d</p> <p>So even a six-year-old knows better. A six-year-old knows that this is not how adults behave. This is not how decent human beings behave. And this is certainly not how someone who wants to be president of the United States behaves.</p> <p>Because let\u2019s be very clear: strong men \u2013 men who are truly role models \u2013 don\u2019t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful. People who are truly strong lift others up. People who are truly powerful bring others together. And that is what we need in our next president. We need someone who is a uniting force in this country. We need someone who will heal the wounds that divide us, someone who truly cares about us and our children, someone with strength and compassion to lead this country forward.</p> <p>And let me tell you, I\u2019m here today because I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president.</p> <p>See, we know that Hillary is the right person for the job because we\u2019ve seen her character and commitment not just in this campaign, but over the course of her entire life. The fact is that Hillary embodies so many of the values that we try so hard to teach our young people. We tell our young people \u201cwork hard in school, get a good education\u201d. We encourage them to use that education to help others \u2013 which is exactly what Hillary did with her college and law degrees, advocating for kids with disabilities, fighting for children\u2019s healthcare as first lady, affordable childcare in the Senate.</p> <p>We teach our kids the value of being a team player, which is what Hillary exemplified when she lost the 2008 election and actually agreed to work for her opponent as our secretary of state \u2013 earning sky-high approval ratings serving her country once again.</p> <p>We also teach our kids that you don\u2019t take shortcuts in life, and you strive for meaningful success in whatever job you do. Well, Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, a US senator, secretary of state. And she has been successful in every role, gaining more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime \u2013 more than Barack, more than Bill. And, yes, she happens to be a woman.</p> <p>And finally, we teach our kids that when you hit challenges in life, you don\u2019t give up, you stick with it. Well, during her four years as secretary of state alone, Hillary has faced her share of challenges. She\u2019s traveled to 112 countries, negotiated a ceasefire, a peace agreement, a release of dissidents. She spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee. We know that when things get tough, Hillary doesn\u2019t complain. She doesn\u2019t blame others. She doesn\u2019t abandon ship for something easier. No, Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life.</p> <p>So in Hillary, we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service, someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting. She is an outstanding mother. She has raised a phenomenal young woman. She is a loving, loyal wife. She\u2019s a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days. And if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton, we would be so proud. We would be proud.</p> <p>And regardless of who her opponent might be, no one could be more qualified for this job than Hillary \u2013 no one. And in this election, if we turn away from her, if we just stand by and allow her opponent to be elected, then what are we teaching our children about the values they should hold, about the kind of life they should lead? What are we saying?</p> <p>In our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary\u2019s opponent win this election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they\u2019re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK. We are validating it. We are endorsing it. We\u2019re telling our sons that it\u2019s OK to humiliate women. We\u2019re telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We\u2019re telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country. Is that what we want for our children?</p> <p>And remember, we won\u2019t just be setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire world. Because for so long, America has been a model for countries across the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting that they give more rights to their women. But if we have a president who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world? How can we continue to be a beacon of freedom and justice and human dignity?</p> <p>Well, fortunately, New Hampshire, here\u2019s the beauty: we have everything we need to stop this madness. You see, while our mothers and grandmothers were often powerless to change their circumstances, today, we as women have all the power we need to determine the outcome of this election.</p> <p>We have knowledge. We have a voice. We have a vote. And on November the 8th, we as women, we as Americans, we as decent human beings can come together and declare that enough is enough, and we do not tolerate this kind of behavior in this country.</p> <p>Remember this: in 2012, women\u2019s votes were the difference between Barack winning and losing in key swing states, including right here in New Hampshire. So for anyone who might be thinking that your one vote doesn\u2019t really matter, or that one person can\u2019t really make a difference, consider this: back in 2012, Barack won New Hampshire by about 40,000 votes, which sounds like a lot. But when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was only 66 votes per precinct. Just take that in. If 66 people in each precinct had gone the other way, Barack would have lost.</p> <p>So each of you right here today could help swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your families, and your friends and neighbors out to vote. You can do it right here. But you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary\u2019s opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration.</p> <p>Because here\u2019s the truth: either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected president this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don\u2019t vote at all, then you are helping to elect her opponent. And just think about how you will feel if that happens. Imagine waking up on November the 9th and looking into the eyes of your daughter or son, or looking into your own eyes as you stare into the mirror. Imagine how you\u2019ll feel if you stayed home, or if you didn\u2019t do everything possible to elect Hillary.</p> <p>We simply cannot let that happen. We cannot allow ourselves to be so disgusted that we just shut off the TV and walk away. And we can\u2019t just sit around wringing our hands. Now, we need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country. We need you to roll up your sleeves. We need to get to work. Because remember this: When they go low, we go \u2026</p> <p>Audience: High!</p> <p>Yes, we do.</p> <p>And voting ourselves is a great start, but we also have to step up and start organizing. So we need you to make calls and knock on doors and get folks to the polls on election day and sign up to volunteer with one of the Hillary campaign folks who are here today just waiting for you to step up.</p> <p>And, young people and not-so-young people, get on social media. Share your own story of why this election matters, why it should matter for all people of conscience in this country. There is so much at stake in this election.</p> <p>See, the choice you make November 8 could determine whether we have a president who treats people with respect \u2013 or not. A president who will fight for kids, for good schools, for good jobs for our families \u2013 or not. A president who thinks that women deserve the right to make our own choices about our bodies and our health \u2013 or not. That\u2019s just a little bit of what\u2019s at stake.</p> <p>So we cannot afford to be tired or turned off. And we cannot afford to stay home on election day. Because on November the 8th, we have the power to show our children that America\u2019s greatness comes from recognizing the innate dignity and worth of all our people. On November the 8th, we can show our children that this country is big enough to have a place for us all \u2013 men and women, folks of every background and walk of life \u2013 and that each of us is a precious part of this great American story, and we are always stronger together.</p> <p>On November 8, we can show our children that here in America, we reject hatred and fear and in difficult times, we don\u2019t discard our highest ideals. No, we rise up to meet them. We rise up to perfect our union. We rise up to defend our blessings of liberty. We rise up to embody the values of equality and opportunity and sacrifice that have always made this country the greatest nation on Earth.</p> <p>That is who we are. And don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you differently. Hope is important. Hope is important for our young people. And we deserve a president who can see those truths in us \u2013 a president who can bring us together and bring out the very best in us. Hillary Clinton will be that president.</p> <p>So for the next 26 days, we need to do everything we can to help her and Tim Kaine win this election. I know I\u2019m going to be doing it. Are you with me? Are you all with me? You ready to roll up your sleeves? Get to work knocking on doors?</p> <p>All right, let\u2019s get to work. Thank you all. God bless.</p> <p><em>This transcript was released by the White House Office of the First Lady</em></p>",
  "<p>At the end of a devastating week for Republican election hopes, many Democrats felt that all that was left to do was refer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-donald-trump-misconduct-frightening\">Michelle Obama\u2019s emotional evisceration of Donald Trump</a> and shrug: \u201cWhat she said.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThe speech that she gave, I think put into words what so many people are feeling,\u201d Hillary Clinton told Ellen DeGeneres, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/clinton-california-calls-landslide-victory-trump-bigotry-bullying\">urging a landslide victory</a> on 8 November as a \u201crebuke of all the bigotry and bullying\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf you want to hear the best case for Hillary Clinton, if you want to hear the very real stakes in this election, I would advise you to link up to Michelle\u2019s speech from earlier today in New Hampshire,\u201d added her husband Barack in Ohio before focusing on the state\u2019s Senate race instead.</p> <p>Not long ago, it would have looked like complacency.

The clearest indication of what his campaign thinks in private came this week, when <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/13/trump-campaign-withdraws-from-virginia/\">aides confirmed reports</a> they were pulling staff and advertising out of Virginia to preserve resources for battleground states where the campaign still thinks there is a chance of turning things around in the 24 days left.</p> <p>With diverse swing states like Virginia and Colorado now firmly off any realistic target list, Trump\u2019s sole remaining path to victory relies on winning Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, states where he is currently an <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">average of two points, three points, eight points and three points behind, respectively</a>. </p> <p>Instead, Democrats are now increasingly focused on attacking Republican strongholds rather than defending Rust Belt swing states that once looked vulnerable to Trump\u2019s populist surge.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, has spoken of his growing confidence about winning Arizona and Georgia. Other \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/12/clinton-campaign-eyes-expansion-states-of-utah-arizona-and-georgia/\">expansion states</a>\u201d that the Democrats have their eyes on in the hope of the landslide include Utah, where an unknown independent candidate Evan McMullin is destroying Trump\u2019s natural lead among religious conservatives. Even Trump\u2019s lead in Texas is now down within the margin of error in some polls.</p> <p>Republicans still hope there is time to push back. One of Trump\u2019s few remaining loyal supporters in the party, running mate Mike Pence, has promised his boss will respond swiftly and specifically to the deluge of recent sexual abuse allegations. Others, such as a former candidate Ben Carson, say \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Trump accusers are \u201clying or not\u201d because bigger issues are at stake for America. What matters is that \u201cthe train is going off the cliff\u201d, Trump\u2019s erstwhile opponent told CNN on Friday.</p> <p>But the reason that many other party leaders, such as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">deserted their candidate</a> in recent days is that the real battle has now shifted from the White House to Congress.</p> <p>Despite a naturally favourable set of Senate races up for Democrats this cycle, Republicans had hoped there was a chance of holding on to control of the upper chamber thanks to strong candidates such as Marco Rubio in Florida and John McCain in Arizona. But the Trump effect now seems to be hurting them whether they distance themselves from the nominee or not. The <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-ahead-florida-pennsylvania-n662076\">latest Florida poll</a> shows Rubio clinging to just a two-point lead, while McCain has finally unendorsed Trump.</p> <p>For Democrats, the dithering of uncertain Republicans is irresistible. \u201cI understand that Ted [Strickland]\u2019s opponent has finally withdrawn his support from Donald Trump, after looking at the polling, now that it\u2019s politically expedient,\u201d Obama said of his party\u2019s rival in Ohio. \u201cBut he supported him up until last week. So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were unpatriotic, and insulting Gold Star moms, and making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn\u2019t quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/voter-turnout-promo/\" data-alt=\"election turnout quiz\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/voter-turnout-promo/\">election turnout quiz</a> </figure>  <p>Even the uphill battle to regain control of the House of Representatives is now seen as possibly winnable.

All &quot;literature&quot; was originally oral. For example The Odyssey, Beowulf and The Mahabharata were sung to illiterate audiences by bards with highly trained memories....writing wasn\u2019t invented until 3000 BC. Dylan's had an impact on contemporary culture at least as great as Homer, I reckon. The effect is most obvious among other songwriters. But he has left an indelible mark on even the highest brow forms of art which is so pervasive that we can't see it clearly any longer. From my own limited reading I would argue Salman Rushdie, Thomas Pynchon, E. Annie Proulx, Martin Amis, David Foster Wallace and Cormac McCarthy all bear his stamp - just as the sponge-like Dylan has received and transmitted things from them. Someone today said imagine a gathering of survivors after McCarty's nuclear holocaust where all paper and electronic devices had gone up in smoke - they suggested people would find it easier to reconstruct Dylan songs from their memories than the output any star of contemporary &quot;literary&quot; London!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T15:17:56.569Z\">at 4.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5800a6dae4b047a4eaafc5e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tobymoses\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T14:05:54.466Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">An extract from Mariella Frostrup: put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>This week I commissioned an article from UK-based journalist and television presenter Mariella Frostrup on the resurgence of erotic writing. Here\u2019s an extract from her piece:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Erotica is so different from pornography, which is almost exclusively designed to cater to men. Any relationship that existed between men and erotica dates back to the Victorian era when it was one of the few ways to access the sexy stuff. Now the tsunami of pornography has all but obliterated any particular interest the majority of men might have had in reading erotica. For women, sex is part of a whole sensory experience and I think that is less true of men. If you look at the pornography that has been designed to appeal to male viewers, particularly in the 21st century, it is very much about the physical act and very little else. That is why it is less satisfying for a lot of women.</p> <p>There\u2019s a huge difference between the perfunctory plots sometimes used in pornography and the experience of immersing yourself in a story, characters and a considered environment \u2013 all those elements of the intellectual exchange involved in reading. In pornography, the literal act is simply placed right before your eyes. It is skin deep and, increasingly in the modern world, what you\u2019re watching is the poor, dispossessed and desperate trying to earn a crust in whatever way they can. How many people who participate in porn do so because that\u2019s what they grew up wanting to do? The sex industry as a whole is a bit like the drug industry. It\u2019s an end product that involves an awful lot of misery for an awful lot of people along the way.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/porn-sex-erotica-erotic-writing\">Put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica | Mariella Frostrup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What do you think?

He\u2019ll be the first one to tell you that wasn\u2019t the case years ago when he was touring huge venues with <a href=\"http://www.crosbystillsnash.com/\">Crosby, Stills and Nash </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/crosbystillsnashandyoung\">CSNY</a> in between bouts of his public struggles with drugs, alcohol and prison (he was jailed for five months in 1986 for <a href=\"http://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-crosby-sentenced-to-prison/\">on weapons and drugs charges</a>).</p> <p>But with <a href=\"http://www.davidcrosby.com/news/2016/07/david-crosby-crafts-raw-intimate-set-new-album-lighthouse-out-october-21-groundup\">Lighthouse</a>, a new album due this month, Crosby continues the hot streak he started in 2014 with <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-crosby-returns-from-20-year-hiatus-with-croz-album-premiere-20140121\">Croz</a>, his first solo album in 20 years. As a founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills and Nash \u2013 and one of the finest voices of his generation \u2013 Crosby could well be sitting on his laurels. But the stunning material on Lighthouse, which is focused squarely on his vocals and guitar, suggest he is more creatively engaged than he has been since his much younger days.</p> <p><strong>This is your second solo album in two years and you say you just finished recording a third that\u2019ll be out next year. Where is the productivity coming from?</strong></p> <p>I think the key to the whole thing is I\u2019m very happy these days. I\u2019ve hit a streak of writing that\u2019s probably one of the densest and best writing runs I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve always written in little bursts and this burst is lasting a couple of years now and it\u2019s consistently happening. </p> <p><strong>You\u2019re 75. Does having one of the most productive streaks happen now opposed to decades ago mean more to you?</strong></p> <p>It means a lot. I\u2019m not sure I fully understand why it happened. But <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/before-this-world-mw0002842975\">James Taylor</a> made one of the best records of his life this year [<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/james-taylor-before-this-world-20150616\">Before this World</a>, which actually came out last year]. And had his first No 1 record in a long stellar career. And James is the same age I am. It was very encouraging to me to see that. And realizing it\u2019s not impossible you can do really good work and if you\u2019re willing to work. </p> <p>Most people my age tend to be either lazy, they\u2019re just trying to recreate the last time they had a hit or they\u2019re just out of it. They think they\u2019ve said what they had to say. I pick up the guitar every day and I work at it. I try to write all the time. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIh4zceuZpc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hIh4zceuZpc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>For me, the simplicity of Lighthouse made it easy to rediscover your singing. Your vocals sound incredibly pristine, despite some years of tough living.</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m as baffled as you are! It doesn\u2019t make any sense! I was a completely bad boy. I did everything wrong. The only thing I didn\u2019t do is smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey. I guess those are the villains here. But I\u2019m grateful, man. I love singing. I don\u2019t sing the same thing the same way twice. That\u2019s like having your own rocket ship \u2013 it\u2019s so much fun! Singing like that is the most fun you can have with your clothes on. It\u2019s absolutely a joy. </p> <p><strong>The songs fuse folk and jazz \u2013 you worked with <a href=\"http://snarkypuppy.com/about\">Michael League</a> from jazz funkers Snarky Puppy.</strong></p> <p>The thing about writing with other people, man, is the other guy always thinks about something you didn\u2019t. I write well on my own. I\u2019m not good as Joni Mitchell, but I\u2019m pretty good. But when you write with somebody else like my son James [Raymond] \u2013 we wrote most of Croz together, we wrote most of [our next album] Sky Trails together. I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t do it more. It increases the number of options you have, it increases the amount of information you have, it increases the quality of the music. </p> <p><strong>Maybe it\u2019s because the idea of the singer-songwriter is so embedded that some songwriters are afraid to share.</strong></p> <p>First of all, people who write are often very egotistical about it and they don\u2019t want to share the credit. Or they don\u2019t want to share the money. Which is very shortsighted of them. Or they just have the ego involved to a point where they don\u2019t know how to work with anyone else. But I can tell you it\u2019s fun.</p> <p><strong>The new songs are very meditative. On The Us Below, you ask, \u2018Why must we be eternally alone?\u2019</strong></p> <p>I was in a very good mood. Even though we talked sometimes about tough stuff. The Us Below is still a love song. There are hard things in there. Songs about people who send our kids to war. The song is about the Syrian refugees coming ashore in Greece. But I feel the overall tone of the record is pretty positive. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fca1cf0229af5c3674e0b6e8f31e6650fb0e640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fca1cf0229af5c3674e0b6e8f31e6650fb0e640/10_27_517_310/500.jpg\" alt=\"David Crosby in 1970: \u2018I\u2019m not good as Joni Mitchell, but I\u2019m pretty good.\u2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Crosby in 1970: \u2018I\u2019m not good as Joni Mitchell, but I\u2019m pretty good.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Copi/Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>On Drive Out to the Desert, you\u2019re almost giving instructions about how to live.</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] It\u2019s kind of a funny thing because I\u2019m such a goofball you wouldn\u2019t pick me to give advice to somebody. But in fact, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I just don\u2019t want anyone to know.</p> <p><strong>Does the personal tone of the record mean you were looking back?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t really look back at all. I\u2019ve been less than happy being in the group that I was in for probably several years. I just didn\u2019t think there was much forward motion. And the songs I was writing really didn\u2019t fit that group. So I\u2019ve been kind of restless. The success I had with Croz, I think that really encouraged the hell out of me. I\u2019m really proud of it, and it sold more than 100,000 copies, which in today\u2019s world is pretty good. I feel that when things start to break your way, you should go for it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Here I am an old guy. I don\u2019t have enough time. It\u2019s precious for me to do these things and do them at the best level I can do them, right now.</p> <p><strong>In 2010 the Vatican newspaper named<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/feb/15/pope-top-10-albums-vatican\"> If I Could Only Remember My Name</a>, your first solo record, on a top 10 list of spiritually nourishing records.</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] Everybody in the world went \u201cWhat in the world is the Vatican doing having an opinion about records? What is going on?\u201d The best part was the No 1 album was [the Beatles\u2019] Revolver. I\u2019m next. And the next one after me is [Dark Side of the Moon by] Pink Floyd. So this comes out and I sent it to David Gilmour. And he said, \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d [laughs] He\u2019s a funny cat, but the idea he was disturbed I was ahead of him on the Vatican list was some funny shit, man. I laughed for a week.</p> <p><strong>CSN and CSNY produced the soundtrack to the Woodstock era. So you must be watching the parallels between the divide in the country over Vietnam and the divide over what is happening now regarding the racial unrest and political discord. </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a very tough time in the United States, man. Donald Trump has pulled a scab off an ongoing infection in this country of racism and stupidity that is beyond belief. He\u2019s made it obvious that the big part of the bell curve of the intelligent distribution is at a room temperature IQ. And there\u2019s a whole shitload of not very smart people out there who buy into Donald Trump. Trump is an obvious charlatan, an obvious liar, an obvious piece of shit. The only people who would believe in him are dummies. People who are politically primitive. His and their world is laced with racism. The racism in this country is fully active and fully discouraging in how pervasive it is.</p> <p>And frankly I have always wanted a woman president and Hillary is not who I would have picked. I think she\u2019s just a politician. I think under Hillary, nothing is going to change. It\u2019s the same game, same players. But I think that under Trump, we would get into wars and the country would come unglued completely. I love my country, man, it was a good idea when it was a democracy. But it\u2019s not a democracy now, it\u2019s a corporate-run place. The corporations have so much money and they throw it at congressional elections and then the Congress does what they tell them. </p> <p>And that\u2019s a very discouraging fact. I have been working at trying to make things better when I can. [CSNY] has always been there for civil rights and women\u2019s rights and anti-nuclear and anti-war. But things are not good in the United States right now. I did a swing though Canada recently and every night I would say, \u201cYou know, you think I\u2019m up here on tour but I\u2019m actually checking out the real estate!\u201d I get them laughing so hard.</p>",

Of course, that included time he spent interrupting, another toddler trait. In addition to the tantrums, Trump gets his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/298736-trump-defends-his-3-am-tweet-storm\">days and nights mixed up</a>.

He pouts.</p> <p>And we, the electorate, are left to watch, horrified.</p> <p>Donald J Trump has never been the most mature of public figures, but things went south in a big way in August, when Trump had already bagged his party\u2019s nomination, and he was speaking at a Virginia rally. (Was this before or after his campaign promised he\u2019d <a href=\"https://heatst.com/politics/watch-republicans-keep-insisting-donald-trump-will-start-acting-more-presidential-but-he-wont/\">act more presidential</a>?

But not long afterward, he asked that that baby be removed. He may have been joking, but then again, maybe not. It appears he didn\u2019t like the competition. The press had a field day, and then Trump did was he does best: He <a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/2016/08/05/trump-throws-tantrum-defending-throwing-crying-baby-rally.html\">threw a tantrum</a>.</p> <p>At the time, Politicus USA called it a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/2016/08/02/trump-kicked-baby-rally-unhinged-gop-nominee-hits.html\">new low</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Ha, ha! If only. A toddler in a 70-year-old body is an ugly thing. There is no hope of maturation \u2013 that ship has sailed. There is also no predicting what will happen. Just before the baby incident, Trump verbally <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/backlash-for-trump-after-he-lashes-out-at-the-muslim-parents-of-a-dead-us-soldier/2016/07/30/34b0aad4-5671-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html\">excoriated a Gold Star family</a> whose son, Army Captain Humayun Khan, died in Iraq in 2004.

In recent months, Boko Haram has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p> Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was Boko Haram\u2019s new leader, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>However, it is Shekau who is holding the Chibok girls. A video released of some of the girls in August seemed to have come from Shekau\u2019s camp somewhere in the remote Sambisa forest, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07ff65c19f5eaff2c4008040fa323cb50e5f35d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07ff65c19f5eaff2c4008040fa323cb50e5f35d/42_0_1098_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Video posted by Boko Haram shows a masked man talking to dozens of girls the group said were from Chibok.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Video posted by Boko Haram shows a masked man talking to dozens of girls the group said were from Chibok.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shekau is thought to be short of manpower, funds, ammunition and other vital supplies.</p> <p> Ryan Cummings, a security analyst in South Africa, said it was very unlikely Boko Haram would have released any hostages without a significant reward. \u201cWhy hold the girls for two years and then release them for nothing? It simply doesn\u2019t make sense \u2026 and is totally contrary to what we know about the group,\u201d Cummings said.</p> <p> There is evidence the Nigerian government and Boko Haram have conducted previous prisoner exchanges. In the initial stages of the insurgency the group swapped captured military personnel for its own combatants or family members seized by the Nigerian army.</p> <p> There have also been a series of kidnappings of westerners in Nigeria, some by extremists, resolved when, it is believed, significant ransom payments were paid by western governments.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the region, kidnapping for ransom has generated huge funds for militant groups such as al-Qaida in the Maghreb. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know the details yet but a series of such deals could have the potential to regenerate the group,\u201d said Cummings. </p> <p> Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped.

Apparently Kumbuku had a reputation for being \u201cprotective\u201d of his family, and on this occasion he rushed aggressively at the glass, banging on it, before escaping into the keeper\u2019s area behind his enclosure.</p> <p>But a more nuanced understanding of gorilla behaviour doesn\u2019t bear out such projections. Although male gorillas in the wild do exhibit aggressive behaviour and can even kill baby gorillas, more often when they are in groups, which sometimes contain several co-existing males, they are gentle and sociable.</p> <p>Primatologists like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/27/jane-goodall-chimps-africa-interview\" title=\"\">Dian Fossey</a> observed that like any primate, ourselves included, gorillas respond aggressively to stress and threat but are largely peaceable. There are no recorded instances of \u201calpha-male\u201d behaviour including genital groping or chest thumping displays over the pricing of Marmite. In fact, the whole idea of the <a href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-everything-you-know-about-wolf-packs-is-wrong-502754629\" title=\"\">\u201calpha male\u201d</a> in nature \u2013 first popularised by Rudolph Schenkel in <a href=\"http://www.davemech.org/schenkel/index.html\" title=\"\">his study of wolves</a> \u2013 has long since been discredited.

This is anthropomorphism which projects certain human characteristics it wants to \u201cnaturalise\u201d on to the animals, in this instance male predatory sexual behaviour or business dominance and aggression. Aiming it at gorillas is not new. \u201cGorilla\u201d was, and still is occasionally, used in its more 19th-century way, as an insult implying bestial stupidity. Now, however, Farage\u2019s projections are typical. \u201cGorilla\u201d is used as a shorthand for aggressive, dominant male behaviour as this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla\" title=\"\">Wiki entry</a> makes clear: \u201c\u2018800lb gorilla\u2019 is an American English expression for a person or organisation so powerful that it can act without regard to the rights of others or the law.\u201d</p> <p>It is the sheer size of mature male gorillas (although the more accurate weight is 400lb, not 800) and the existence of one dominant male in groups which have allowed certain aggressive human males to project their preoccupations on to gorillas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/london-zoo-gorilla-escape-kumbuka-wildlife-group-calls-for-inquiry\">London zoo denies gorilla escaped by smashing window</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But our understanding of their behaviour has also been distorted by natural history programmes with their \u201calpha-male\u201d preoccupations \u2013 and even more so by the existence of zoos. In confined enclosures and in small family groups, it\u2019s easy to form an impression of one huge male dominating his little family.</p> <p>Zoos are also highly stressful environments, making aggression a very real possibility. It\u2019s reported that visitors were banging on the windows of Kumbuka\u2019s enclosure before his escape. When keepers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-shooting-animal-conservation-experts\" title=\"\">decided to shoot silverback Harambe</a> earlier this year at Cincinnati zoo, visitors were screaming and shouting at him as he stood over the boy who had climbed into his pen. There are different opinions on whether the gorilla would have harmed the boy, but aggression is certainly a well-documented response to fear and stress.</p> <p>In the wild, male dominance is much less striking to primatologists; instead they witness complex, nuanced behaviour where interaction between mothers, and attention to the young is just as important for group cohesion. Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent has larger enclosures and bigger groups of animals. It\u2019s still captivity but it permits a glimpse of wild gorilla behaviour where maternal attentiveness and group cooperation is just as defining of a gorilla\u2019s essential nature as the dominance behaviour of some males.</p> <p>There are, in short, just as strong grounds to call someone a gorilla if she\u2019s an attentive mother. But that wouldn\u2019t suit the likes of Farage, who seek not just to naturalise but to excuse certain types of human behaviour, making it seem as if treating women with contempt is something eternal and unchangeable. Maybe we should laugh it off. Except gorillas need all the help they can get at the moment and being associated with some of the least endearing examples of the human male is not good for their image.</p>",

Trump might secretly be relieved that Rees-Mogg has dropped out; in the Conservative leadership election, the Somerset MP managed to back the loser time after time. First he backed Boris Johnson. When he dropped out, he switched to Michael Gove. When the Tories decided Gove\u2019s future lay in writing newspaper columns, Rees-Mogg bet the house on the completely useless Andrea Leadsom.

This was a question no one in the country \u2013 not even the Queen \u2013 had been asking themselves until Johnson idly mentioned it a few weeks ago to distract people from asking tricky questions about Brexit to which he didn\u2019t know the answer, but it had the monarchists out in force. Tory Jake Berry suddenly remembered that literally thousands of constituents had written to him offering to hand over their life savings. Not even Sir Jake \u2013 as he will no doubt soon be called \u2013 could compete with Sir Gerald Howarth for sycophancy. \u201cThe day Britannia was decommissioned was the worst day of my life,\u201d he solemnly declared. \u201cLet us put that error right.\u201d Howarth has led a very sheltered life. As with all Westminster Hall debates, nothing was resolved other than a general consensus that it would be quite nice if a kind philanthropist \u2013 that rules out Sir Philip Green \u2013 were to donate a yacht to Her Majesty.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>One item that may have escaped you is the news that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/owing-2m-durand-academy-state-school-in-south-londonto-be-stripped-of-management\">Durand academy in south London is likely to be stripped of its management team</a>, after refusing to repay \u00a32m in government funds and charging pupils to use its swimming pool through a complex network of payments and companies. Durand was one of Gove\u2019s flagship schools and the former education secretary seldom missed an opportunity to be photographed with former headteacher Sir Greg Martin. For those with first-hand experience of Durand, the real question was how it took the Department for Education so long to cotton on that the school was being run so badly. Those who complained were threatened with writs by legal firm Carter Ruck, and only a year ago the public accounts committee declared it was unhappy with the school\u2019s accounts. Martin, who was knighted for services to education in 2013, at one point paid himself \u00a3230,000 for running the school and another \u00a3165,000 for managing the gym he had set up as a separate company on the school site; he also used the site to run a dating agency.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Brexit means no breakfast. As the pound fell to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78478eee-e170-32d3-bdbb-b88a98f2f9bd\">a record 168-year low</a> (FT, paywall) against the dollar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">Unilever and Tesco reached a standoff over the price of Marmite</a>, with the supermarket refusing to stock the product if the multinational increased the price by 10%. I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t stand Marmite, and the absence of the spread is one of the few upsides of Brexit. But for others, the Great Marmite Swindle is the end of days, with people busy sharing recipes on Twitter: a litre of brewer\u2019s yeast; a pinch of sea salt, an onion, a couple of carrots, a turnip and half a stick of celery should do the trick. Marmite was considered to be a matter of such national concern that the government was again forced to give a running commentary on not giving a running commentary on Brexit. \u201cThere are own-brand yeast extracts that are available,\u201d said the leader of the house, David Lidington, not entirely reassuringly in the Commons. Though no cheap Vegemite. The pound is down 17% against the Australian dollar since 23 June. Open for business. At a price.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Never mind the rights and wrongs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-wins-2016-nobel-prize-in-literature\">giving the Nobel prize to a singer-songwriter</a> \u2013 personally, I\u2019d have given it to Leonard Cohen, whose literary output I rate considerably higher \u2013 but at least eveyone knows who Bob Dylan is. When the French writer JMG Le Cl\u00e9zio won the prize back in 2008, very few literary editors in the UK or the US had even heard of him, let alone read any of his books, and they had to quickly scrabble through their contacts books in a desperate attempt to find someone who could write a couple of hundred words about him. Though Dylan is best known as a lyricist, he has had one venture into prose, the 2004 book Chronicles Volume One, which was part autobiography and part fiction. Volume Two is yet to appear. To give you a flavour of his style, here\u2019s a digested read extract. \u201cPeople told me what my lyrics meant. It was news to me. One album was supposedly intensely autobiographical. Let them think so. I knew it was based on a bunch of Chekhov short stories. Outside the wind was blowing.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: The Nobel it is a-changin\u2019</strong><br></p>",

The impetus, as Harth put it in an emotional hour-long interview at the Guardian\u2019s New York office, was Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that any woman alleging misbehaviour on his part was lying. His eldest daughter Ivanka\u2019s widely aired insistence that \u201cmy dad is not a groper\u201d pushed her over the edge. \u201cWhat did she know?\u201d Harth asked. \u201cShe was 10 years old.\u201d</p> <p>A former Trump business associate from his early beauty pageant industry days, Harth said that the tycoon behaved inappropriately with her from the day she met him. The first presentation she gave with her boyfriend and business partner George Houraney back in December 1992 marked not just the beginning of their partnership with Trump, which Harth described as the professional \u201chighlight\u201d of their career, but also, the beginning of a steady stream of unwanted sexual advances, culminating in the alleged assault in one of the children\u2019s bedrooms at Mar-a-Lago, his ostentatious Florida mansion.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/20/jill-harth-donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p43p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2620861\"            data-video-name=\"Woman who sued Trump over alleged sexual assault speaks out \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-578fb000e4b09ac5ee0eec69\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/21/20160720JILLHARTH7web_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/21/20160720JILLHARTH7web_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/21/20160720JILLHARTH7web.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/21/20160720JILLHARTH7web_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/21/20160720JILLHARTH7web_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/20/jill-harth-donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuit-video\">Woman who sued Trump over alleged sexual assault speaks out</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cHe pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,\u201d Harth recalled, \u201cand I had to physically say: \u2018What are you doing? Stop it.\u2019 It was a shocking thing to have him do this because he knew I was with George.\u201d If she had known Trump a bit better at the time, she might not have been so shocked.</p> <p>Today, the examples of Trump\u2019s misogyny, casual and calculated alike, are as well-rehearsed as they are reprehensible. But something has changed again. Last week, the tape of his conversation with Billy Bush brought them front and centre in the American conversation; this week, further testimony from two women who spoke to the New York Times, alleging that his claims back then were more than mere words, have ensured that the spotlight will not shift. His unguarded phrase, \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, has stuck because it chimed with the testimony of Jill Harth, and so many other women who have spoken out about their experience with Trump. As a former Miss Utah, Temple Taggart, put it to the New York Times when remembering how he had introduced himself by kissing her on the lips: \u201cIt was like, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 Now no one can say I made this up,\u201d she said. In this context, the stories of the women who spoke up about Trump have taken on fresh weight: now undeniable as a map to his values and treatment of women for more than 40 years.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jill Harth was not the only woman who got in touch with me about Trump this year. Kari Wells, a former model and Bravo actor, described her own experience with Trump\u2019s sexual entitlement back in December 1992 when she was modelling in Aspen, Colorado, at the Ritz Carlton hotel and the Little Nell Hotels doing various fashion shows.</p> <p>Trump was dating a girlfriend of hers at the time, the model Kelly Ann Sabatasso, so she was friendly in passing when she saw him. \u201cI kept running into him and her at the different hotels and at the fashion shows,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me what time I was doing the show until, and I just thought it was polite conversation, so I told him it ended around 6pm. He asked if I would like to come up to his room as Kelly was coming over and he thought that the three of us could have some fun together. He pushed his room key forward on the table for me to pick up.\u201d At the time Wells was in her early 20s; the age difference, as well as the abruptness of his proposition, shocked her. She quickly made up an excuse, but she kept thinking about the exchange. \u201cWhat gave him a right to ask me such a thing? Just because I had been polite and friendly towards him, and the fact that I was a model?\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55vjz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756157\"            data-video-name=\"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: 'I know what he can do' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea8d3fe4b091b7fa2b5a86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\">Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: \u2018I know what he can do\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the case of Alicia Machado, whom I interviewed in Los Angeles where she now lives, it would ironically be the widely available video footage of the humiliation he subjected her to after the 1996 Miss Universe gained a modest amount of weight that would devastate Trump. Venezuela-born Machado became an American citizen this year with the express purpose of voting against him. And in an hour-long interview, interrupted only by a phone call from her mother, Machado described the infamous incident in which Trump turned a forced workout into a press event \u2013 \u201cI was in some gym in New York like a mouse,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">she said</a>. \u201cLook at that mouse: how she run, how she jump, how she make exercise. Like that. In that moment is when \u2026 problems come to me and start.\u201d Machado subsequently suffered from anorexia and bulimia.</p> <p>A week later, Hillary Clinton would tell Machado\u2019s story on the debate stage, blasting out a media package to back it up afterwards. It was a devastating moment for Trump, not just on the debate floor, but in the week that followed, with Trump tweeting out defensive comments about Machado\u2019s non-existent \u201csex tape\u201d, part of a larger effort by him and his campaign surrogates to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/alicia-machado-donald-trump-backlash-smear\">tar her character</a> with claims irrelevant to the issue at hand; her readily verifiable account of her experience with Trump.</p> <p>Machado had the evidence to prove her case against Trump, from video to a dossier of press clippings, precisely because Trump had wanted to document the moment. The trouble for Trump was, in the intervening 20 years the context changed and society had progressed. He, meanwhile, had not.</p> <p>It\u2019s one thing for Clinton to do things like call Trump a bully or even for his biographers to do so \u2013 as practically every one of them will. It\u2019s another to see it and feel it viscerally, as we can in Machado\u2019s story. And hers was not even the most compelling story I heard on Trump\u2019s bullying. That dubious distinction belongs to former beauty queen Sheena Monnin, sued by Trump for $10m when she made a negative comment on Facebook about his pageant. She had thrown a stone in his eye and now Trump was coming down on her with Goliath force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc8c5f4f7d91b3c25edb50ebc7602dc6c20675a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc8c5f4f7d91b3c25edb50ebc7602dc6c20675a3/0_292_5684_3410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheena Monnin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheena Monnin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheena Monnin./Sheena Monnin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was no way I could have afforded to pay that off and frankly, he had to have known that,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">she told the Guardian this summer</a>. In a more rational world, Monnin would not have spent years locked in legal battle with a man worth many billions more than she\u2019ll ever see in her lifetime for what amounted to a slight on Facebook; but in telling her story years later, as an increasing number of women are stepping forward to do, she found a measure of vindication and dignity.</p> <p>It is perhaps unsurprising that an exploration of how Trump got to this point takes you right back to his mother. Mary Trump, her son explained in The Art Of The Deal, was an unmatchable ideal. \u201cPart of the problem I\u2019ve had with women has been in having to compare them to my incredible mother, Mary Trump,\u201d he wrote (or his ghost did). \u201cMy mother is smart as hell.\u201d</p> <p>At the New York Military Academy, where he had been sent after an incident involving switchblade knives, he quickly developed the measure of success that would persist. He was seen with beautiful women on his arm so often he was voted ladies\u2019 man of his class. And as he grew up, Trump never lost his adolescent way of seeing women as trophies \u2013 or of measuring himself in the world.</p> <p>When he met his first wife Ivana Trump, a Czech American socialite skier whom he married in 1977, Trump recalled being impressed by more than her looks. \u201cGood looks had been my top \u2013 and sometimes, to be honest, my only \u2013 priority in my man-about-town days,\u201d he recalled in Trump: Surviving at the Top. \u201cIvana was gorgeous, but she was also ambitious and intelligent. When I introduced her to friends and associates, I said, \u2018Believe me. This one\u2019s different.\u2019 Everyone knew what I meant, and I think everyone sensed that I found the combination of beauty and brains almost unbelievable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/trumps-misogyny-problem-how-donald-has-repeatedly-targeted-women\">Donald's misogyny problem: How Trump has repeatedly targeted women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Astonished as he was, his marriage to Ivana lasted over a decade, long enough to have three children. When his wife\u2019s ambition started to grate, and rumours of his philandering persisted, he moved on to Marla Maples \u2013 \u201cnice tits, no brains\u201d, as he would later sum her up. Ivana, in a sworn deposition from the time, pointed not just to these infidelities but also to her own violent rape, following a fight. She has since softened her stance on the story she gave under oath, telling one biographer she didn\u2019t mean rape in the \u201cliteral\u201d sense, and is now bound from discussing it by a non-disclosure agreement. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s tabloid life was never even put on hold when he took up with Marla \u2013 Jill Harth\u2019s allegations occurred after he had taken up with Maples. They married in 1993, but the relationship was never strong and the rumours of affairs never quieted. Six years and one daughter \u2013 Tiffany Trump \u2013 later, Maples would become his new ex-wife. Trump blamed Marla, not himself for the destruction of their marriage, as he had blamed Ivana before her. He accused her of not making him dinner in a timely manner, and not being supportive enough of his long hours at work, but when it came to giving her emotional support all consideration went out the window: \u201cOne thing I have learned: There is high maintenance. There is low maintenance. I want no maintenance,\u201d he wrote in The Art Of The Comeback</p> <p>That much at least has not changed. Now on his third marriage to Melania Trump, 24 years his junior, he still brags about never changing diapers. </p> <p>***</p> <p>Alongside that marital history, and the litany of other charges against him, the stories of Machado, the fat-shamed beauty queen struggling with body image, Monnin, the bullied defendant fighting Trump\u2019s machine, and Harth, the sexually assaulted woman who thought she was launching a business proposition, paint the picture of a domineering man. But all three women chafed at the notion of being defined by him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7bca6c4ac79618d110ea5dc0beab301041705d1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bca6c4ac79618d110ea5dc0beab301041705d1c/0_75_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women protest against Donald Trump near the Trump International Hotel in New York on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women protest against Donald Trump near the Trump International Hotel in New York on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to say his name,\u201d Machado told me, when prompted at one point to indicate she was talking about Trump. She wanted to talk about the telenovelas she\u2019s starring in, the new business ventures she has, the home she keeps with her mother in Los Angeles and the seven-year-old daughter she adores. She wants me to know who she is now, not just who she was then.</p> <p>Mostly though, like every woman I interviewed, she wanted her story to be about her.</p> <p>Each woman came to me for different reasons: Harth was sick of hearing Trump tell her story; Monnin, who recently published a self-help book, wanted to help other bullying victims; Machado wanted to make sure her abuser wasn\u2019t the next president.</p> <p>But none of them wanted to talk about Trump. They did it because they felt that they had to, or someone else would. One surprising legacy of Trump\u2019s campaign is that, as he falls in the polls, it is women, perhaps recognising something of their own life experiences in what happened to these three, who look poised to rise up and denounce him and the strain of political misogyny he represents.<strong> </strong></p> <p>As the writer Rebecca Traister asks: \u201cWhich is worse, threatening to grab someone by the pussy or forcing someone to carry and give birth to a baby that is the result of rape? Which is worse: Popping a Tic Tac in preparation for forced extramarital kissing with a stranger or actively discouraging women\u2019s full participation in the workforce?

  "<p>Look back at the history of glam rock, and you keep running into things that seem like premonitions \u2013 previews of the scary and dangerous man running for the American presidency right now. In his mid-1970s interviews, David Bowie talked about \u201ca strong leader\u201d destined to \u201csweep through\u201d the western world: a charismatic superhero who might emerge not from conventional politics but from entertainment. Sometimes Bowie\u2019s tone was ominous. At others, he\u2019d make it seem like a necessary corrective to a Weimar-style state of decadence, talking with seemingly approving anticipation of \u201ca rightwing, totally dictatorial tyranny\u201d that would clean up all the mess made by the permissive society.</p> <p>At his most extreme, unguarded and&#xa0;cocaine-addled, Bowie proposed himself as a candidate for the job, whether as British PM, as the \u201cfirst English president of the United States\u201d, or maybe even as ruler of the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/07/shock-awe-glam-rock-legacy-simon-reynolds-review\">Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy by Simon Reynolds \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another future-spectre of Trump was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/28/1\" title=\"\"> Alice Cooper\u2019s pretend run for the presidency in 1972</a>.

The Donald is a bigot, a macho bully, a philistine, a proud ignoramus. Bowie and the brightest of his peers were androgynous aesthetes, intellectually hungry and sexually experimental.</p> <p>And yet there are some unlikely affinities, as I discovered while researching <em>Shock and Awe</em>, my history of glam. As signalled by his gilded tower on Fifth Avenue, Trump surrounds himself with glitz. Trump and the glam rockers share an obsession with fame and a ruthless drive to conquer and devour the world\u2019s attention. Trump actually plays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/queen-protests-donald-trumps-we-are-the-champions-song\" title=\"\">\u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d by Queen </a>(a band aligned with glam in its early days) at his rallies, because its triumphalist refrain \u2013 \u201cno time for losers\u201d \u2013 crystallises his economic Darwinist worldview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32d7531aab562bd9cdd48198f13ecc6db8a5b62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d7531aab562bd9cdd48198f13ecc6db8a5b62d/0_787_3232_4040/800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump plays Queen\u2019s \u2018We Are the Champions\u2019 at his campaign rallies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilpo Musto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A mirror of oligopoly capitalism, pop is a ferociously competitive game that sorts the contestants into a handful of winners and a great mass of losers. Propelled by a stardom-at-all-costs drive, many of glam rock\u2019s principal characters nimbly reinvented themselves and in some cases trampled others on their way up. They willed their fantasy selves into existence. This same ethos of \u201cDon\u2019t dream it, be it\u201d (as articulated by <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>\u2019s Dr Frank N Furter) could be seen in the type of fandom that glam inspired. It had an imitative quality never really seen before in pop: audiences dressing up, copying the hair and makeup. Roxy Music\u2019s fans, responding to the sophistication of the group\u2019s image and&#xa0;artwork, to audience flattering lyrical winks such as \u201csure to make the cognoscenti think\u201d \u2013 costumed themselves as members of a make-believe aristocracy. Bryan Ferry recalled how some would turn up to the shows in full black tie, as if attending an Oscars ceremony.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appeal is generally seen in terms of his doom-laden imagery of a weakened, rudderless America. But there is something else going on too: an admiring projection towards a swaggering figure who revels in his wealth, free to do and say whatever he wants. Trump is an aspirational figure as much as a mouthpiece for resentment and rancour.</p> <p>\u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/donald-trumps-lawyers-demand-art-of-the-deal-co-writer-pay-back-royalties\" title=\"\">Trump wrote in <em>The Art of the Deal</em>,</a> explaining the role of bravado in his business dealings. \u201cPeople may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.\u201d He and co-writer Tony Schwarz coined the concept \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d. That sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it cuts to the essence of how hype works: by making people believe in something that doesn\u2019t exist yet, it magically turns a lie into a reality. As the saying goes, fake it till you make it. Bowie\u2019s manager Tony Defries used this technique to break the singer in the US:&#xa0;travelling everywhere by limo, surrounded by bodyguards he didn\u2019t need, Bowie looked like the star he wasn\u2019t, until the public and the media started to take the illusion for reality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump and his co-writer Tony Schwarz coined the concept 'truthful hyperbole'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Early in his career, Trump grasped that \u2013 like a pop star \u2013 he was selling an image, a brand. Licensed out, the Trump name gets affixed to buildings and businesses that he doesn\u2019t own, let alone run. He\u2019s an extreme version of what people on Wall Street call a \u201cglamour stock\u201d: an investment that outperforms the market based on an inflated belief in its growth potential or&#xa0;on even more intangible qualities of&#xa0;cool and buzz. Twitter has been described as the ultimate glamour stock, its attractive image vastly out of whack with its ability to make money. A glamour stock will keep on winning right up until it loses \u2013 when the gulf between its perceived value and actual wealth-generative potential gets too huge, when reality finally disrupts the reality distortion field surrounding it.</p> <p>Self-reinvention was the strategy used by glam stars such as Bowie and Marc Bolan. You can see the same chameleon-like flexibility at work in Trump\u2019s career. Once upon a time he was a Democrat, on genial terms with the Clintons. Years ago he used birtherism as the launch pad for a political career; now he\u2019s dropped it, as&#xa0;a political liability. It\u2019s the same with his recent rabble-rousing rhetoric about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\" title=\"\">\u201cbuilding a wall\u201d</a>. Conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer analyses the agility with which Trump evades attacks by discarding ideas: \u201cHe merely creates new Trumps.\u201d Bowie conjured up new personas to stay one step ahead of&#xa0;pop\u2019s fickle fluctuations and keep himself creatively stimulated. With no&#xa0;fixed political principles, Trump\u2019s only consistency is salesmanship and showmanship: the ability to stage his public life as a drama.</p> <p>And it\u2019s the drama that holds the public\u2019s attention \u2013 the edgy promise of a less boring politics. The New York Times recently quoted a voter who confessed to flirting with the idea of voting for Trump because \u201ca dark side of me wants to see what happens\u2026 There is going to be some&#xa0;kind of change, and even if it\u2019s like a Nazi-type change, people are so drama-filled. They want to see stuff like that happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u2766</p> <p>Emerging after the earnest, authenticity-obsessed late 60s, glam was a period in which rock rediscovered a sense of showbiz and spectacle. Pop history has repeatedly cycled through such phases of glam and anti-glam: Bowie/Roxy razzle-dazzle was supplanted by scruffy pub rock and street-credible punk, which in turn was eclipsed by the neo-glam of the new romantics. A&#xa0;similar shift occurred in America when glitzy hair metal was displaced by grunge\u2019s mud-slide sound and earth-toned clothes.</p> <p>You can see similar dynamics at play&#xa0;in today\u2019s politics. Hillary Clinton sits squarely in the unglam corner: a&#xa0;worthy but dull public servant, supremely accomplished at everything required of a leader except&#xa0;what the public perversely craves \u2013 being an entertainer. She\u2019s a&#xa0;\u201cvalue stock\u201d \u2013 one&#xa0;of those companies that over time doggedly outperform the glamour stocks, but simply don\u2019t inspire spasms of irrational exuberance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a95df4dd34ee078cb93e112cfb618c1c9613a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a95df4dd34ee078cb93e112cfb618c1c9613a67/697_548_1292_1616/800.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018I\u2019m not a personality.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018I\u2019m not a personality.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The real anti-glam leader of our age, though, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/11/jeremy-corbyn-parliamentary-beard-of-the-year-victory\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn.

Corbyn tried to change the format and feel of prime minister\u2019s questions, saying he wished to \u201cremove the theatre from politics\u201d. In one&#xa0;particular PMQs, he responded to Cameron\u2019s slick pre-scripted gags with&#xa0;the schoolmasterly reprimand: \u201cI&#xa0;invite the prime minister to leave the&#xa0;theatre and return to reality.\u201d</p> <p>As for oratory, Corbyn seems instinctively averse to all those elements of spoken language \u2013 cadence, musicality, metaphor \u2013 that sway the listener irrationally. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-should-be-tougher-not-my-style\" title=\"\">as Gary Younge argued recently</a>, his plain-spoken delivery is taken as a token of sincerity by his followers, who \u201chave not come to be entertained; they have come \u2026 to have a basic sense of decency reflected back to them through their politics\u201d. This is how a&#xa0;personality cult has built up around him, despite his honest and accurate admission: \u201cI\u2019m not a personality.\u201d It\u2019s&#xa0;very indie, very alternative rock, the way that the absence of charisma has become the source of a curious magnetism.</p> <p>Once in a blue moon, a politician comes along who combines pop star allure and all the less glamorous qualifications such as temperament, competence and knowledge. Barack Obama has both kinds of cool going for him: perfect comic timing at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, calmness and clarity during moments of Oval Office crisis.</p> <p>Politics without any element of charisma is certainly a dry affair. But the cult of personality can be dangerous outside the realm of showbiz, its proper domain.</p> <p>\u201cI could see how easy it was to get a&#xa0;whole rally thing going,\u201d Bowie said in 1974, recalling the height of Ziggymania in Britain a few years earlier. \u201cThere were times when I&#xa0;could&#xa0;have told the audience to do anything.\u201d In another interview of that era, Bowie spoke of the way Hitler \u201cstaged a&#xa0;country\u201d, combining \u201cpolitics and theatrics\u201d to create the ultimate spectacle. \u201cBoy, when he hit that stage, he worked an audience \u2026 [Hitler] created this thing that governed and controlled the show for those 12 years.

Touring the streets of Richmond on her bicycle, the 51-year-old former restaurant manager stops Virginians and asks if they are registered to vote.</p> <p>If the answer is \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d, she follows up with the stigma-sensitive phrase: \u201cAre you still on supervision?\u201d</p> <p>It elicits a knowing response from those who, like her, want to take part in democracy but have been barred in their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/06/us/unequal-effect-of-laws-that-block-felons-from-voting.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">millions across the US</a>, due to a brush with the criminal justice system at some point in their lives. </p> <p>As the deadline approaches for registering to take part in one of the most consequential US elections in a generation, Virginia is the exception to controversial state rules that ban those convicted of a felony from voting. </p> <p>The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, had to circumvent Republican-led attempts in the state supreme court to block a blanket amnesty, and he did so by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/22/virginia-restores-voting-rights-felons-governor-terry-mcauliffe\">individually clearing felons to vote</a> \u2013 one signature at a time. An estimated 70,000 ex-offenders are now thought to have been registered to vote before the deadline of 17 October. </p> <p>In the presidential election, Virginia \u2013 a state Donald Trump once hoped to win \u2013 looks so far out of reach that Trump\u2019s campaign is <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-campaign-pulling-out-virginia-n665541\">reported to have pulled out</a>. But several <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/12/heres-how-good-a-shot-democrats-have-of-actually-winning-the-house/?tid=sm_fb\">tightening House races</a> there could yet make the difference in the battle for control of Congress. </p> <p>The on-off nature of the restoration of rights in Virginia has confused many. Thirteen thousand former offenders who registered to vote when McAuliffe first attempted an automatic clearance were later told they had been disenfranchised once again, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/virginia-executive-order-felon-voting-supreme-court\">court ruled his executive action was in breach</a> of the state constitution. </p> <p>Hence the effort through individual signatures, as groups such as <a href=\"http://www.newvirginiamajority.org/\">New Virginia Majority</a>, for which Hagen now works, are scrambling to find suitable candidates for gubernatorial clemency. The effort is as much about overcoming weary cynicism as getting paperwork to the governor\u2019s office in time.</p> <p> \u201cIt felt pretty bleak,\u201d says Hagen as she describes reaction to the first setback. \u201cPeople were really discouraged. I came across lots who were reluctant to try again. \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019 they\u2019d say, \u2018my vote\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is a feeling with which she can sympathise, as she says she had \u201cconsigned\u201d herself \u201cto never voting in my life\u201d, thanks to a string of \u201cpetty drug offences\u201d that led to her first felony conviction at 25 and a last one six or seven years ago.</p> <p>But rehabilitation led to a conviction that ex-offenders deserve to play a role in political life. Hagen estimates she has registered 600-800 Virginians and submitted \u201cseveral hundred requests\u201d for restoration of voting rights to the governor\u2019s office.</p> <p>In the north of the state, where Democrats are targeting several House seats once seen as impossibly out of reach, on Tuesday volunteers knocking on doors registered 200 new voters out of the Alexandria office alone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/14/florida-voter-disenfrachisement-former-felons-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/577j2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2800604\"            data-video-name=\"Florida's disenfranchised: voices of the 1.7 million not allowed to vote \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fe915de4b01d9dd2c9050a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11951915&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/12/161012VOTINGFELONS_lowres_KP-2111328.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/12/161012VOTINGFELONS_lowres.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/14/florida-voter-disenfrachisement-former-felons-video\">Florida\u2019s disenfranchised: voices of the 1.7 million not allowed to vote</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But this last-minute rush for electors is not welcomed by all. A few miles from Alexandria, a leading conservative critic of the governor\u2019s policy is deeply uncomfortable with what he sees as a nakedly partisan attempt to enfranchise voters who largely lean Democratic.</p> <p> \u201cIf you are not willing to follow the law then you can\u2019t demand a right to make the law for everyone else, which is what voting is about,\u201d says Roger Clegg, the president of the <a href=\"http://www.ceousa.org/voting/voting-news/felon-voting\">Center for Equal Opportunity</a>. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t assume somebody has turned over a new leaf once they have walked out of prison.\u201d</p> <p> Clegg is particularly scathing of the argument that preventing ex-offenders from voting is a ploy to limit the voice of African Americans in politics.</p> <p> \u201cThe fact that felons are disproportionately this or that colour does not make these rules racist any more than the fact that felons are disproportionately male makes these laws sexist,\u201d he argues.</p> <p> Even the harshest critics of the reforms concede that a rush of new faces to the polls can also be a sign of a healthy democracy. They would simply prefer more stringent tests before the right is restored.</p> <p> \u201cThe best argument that the other side has to make is that it is important to do what we can to reintegrate felons back into society and it certainly would be a bad thing if society sent a message that once you have committed a felony your civil life is over,\u201d Clegg says.</p> <p> \u201cBut the automatic reinfranchisement of felons misses an opportunity to do that kind of reintegration. There should be a ceremony like a naturalisation ceremony, where you go down to the courthouse and the person brings their friends and family around and everyone has a little American flag. That would be meaningful.\u201d</p> <p> For those on the streets trying to persuade ex-offenders to give democracy a second chance, there is plenty of meaning in the process already.</p> <p> \u201cThese are folks who have been systematically kicked out of the system, who have been ignored,\u201d says Matthew Rogers, regional field director of New Virginia Majority in Alexandria. </p> <p>\u201cMany of them do not even know their rights have been restored. So many of them break down in tears they are so excited.\u201d</p>",

And as Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes could attest, women are no longer willing to remain silent about what men have done with impunity in the past.</p> <p>This week, a man finally acknowledged on national television what many women already understood about the 2016 election. \u201cThis is a gender war,\u201d Donny Deutsch announced on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe the morning after the second debate. \u201c<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a> in America are going to stand up and revolt \u2013 every woman in American who has ever been held down, oppressed, harassed. And if you\u2019re not seeing that, you\u2019re missing it.\u201d</p> <p>And yet many men are still missing it.</p> <p>Following the second debate, a series of national polls revealed a gender split that showed women opposing Trump by increasing margins. If only women voted on election day, Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide with 458 electoral votes to only 80 for Trump, as Nate Silver reported on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>.</p> <p>As recent days have finally made clear, the 2016 election constitutes a referendum on male entitlement \u2013 and a Clinton victory will herald an earthquake that remakes the social landscape as dramatically as it does the national agenda.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d1223555c4b4dd73de0a9d865b1d6e18db8e897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1223555c4b4dd73de0a9d865b1d6e18db8e897/0_0_575_633/454.png\" alt=\"silver-electionupdate-womenvoted\" width=\"454\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On one issue after another, polls reveal the widening divisions between men and women. Announcing the results of a survey measuring public reactions to Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cgrab her by the pussy\u201d remarks, ABC\u2019s Rachel Tillman <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/43-percent-americans-trump-withdraw-presidential-race/story?id=42671346\">wrote</a>, \u201cThere was a stark gender gap, with 62% of women less likely to vote for him while 55% of men say it will make no difference on their vote.\u201d</p> <p>Such differences should surprise no one, because men lead entirely different lives than women. Over the course of their lifetime, 57% of women report having been touched or grabbed in a sexual way by a stranger in public. Thirty-seven percent of women have had a stranger masturbate in front of them at least once in public.</p> <p>But strangers pose less of a danger than loved ones; more than a third of female murder victims are killed by their intimate partners. One in five women will be <a href=\"http://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics\">sexually assaulted</a> in their lifetime \u2013 most often by someone they are close to. Trump\u2019s first wife accused him of such acts; in a sworn deposition during their divorce, Ivana Trump <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-ex-wife-claim-he-raped-her-resurfaces-in-new-documentary-a6836151.html\">used</a> the word \u201crape\u201d to describe forced sex in which her husband pulled out fistfuls of her hair.</p> <p>Is it any wonder that the segment of the electorate that is routinely victimized views such offenses differently than the segment of the electorate that commits them?</p> <p>Whether the crime is harassment, domestic violence or murder, the root cause includes an overwhelming sense of male entitlement: \u201cI get to do this to you because I\u2019m the man and you\u2019re a woman.\u201d Such privilege carries an assumption of ownership, as with property rights: experts on domestic violence attest that men are more likely to assault female partners when they feel they\u2019re losing control, as when threatened with a divorce or a restraining order.</p> <p>And men who fear they\u2019re losing control have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. The gender gap between Trump\u2019s support and Clinton\u2019s is particularly staggering among men who are ill-equipped in comparison with their female peers. An ABC News/Washington Post poll at the end of September showed Trump with an overwhelming 59-point lead among among white men who don\u2019t have college degrees \u2013 76% of whom supported him. In an era when women make up nearly 60% of college and graduate school students, those men are falling further and further behind.</p> <p>Despite such numbers, any real recognition of their import has been a long time coming. For the last year and a half, as myriad so-called experts struggled to understand the Trump phenomenon, their analyses focused on race, religion, ethnicity, class and income. With notable obtuseness, they resisted the most universal explanation well past the time when it should have been obvious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Throughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination: gaslighting, threatening and insulting at every turn. he has consistently acted like a vicious bully who will stop at nothing to subordinate his foes. At his first debate with Hillary Clinton, he interrupted her 51 times.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s interrupting and shouting over his adversaries during the debates were only an extension of the domineering traits that have long been clear. This week\u2019s news included reports from Miss USA contestants, some as young as 15, that Trump deliberately walked in on them backstage while they were naked. Trump has even bragged about doing so: \u201cI sort of get away with things like that,\u201d he said on The Howard Stern Show in 2005.</p> <p>As the possessor of a penis, celebrity and a fortune, Trump has never questioned his right to inspect and rank women in terms of his own interest in having sex with them. For decades his objectification of women has remained as consistent as the ugliness of his values; as a self-appointed judge of female worth, he and his beauty pageants and reality shows have perpetuated the misogynistic standards that nullify the value of any woman who is not very young, very thin and conventionally attractive.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/12/miss-arizona-donald-trump-naked-girls-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/577az\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2800383\"            data-video-name=\"Trump 'walked in on naked girls', says former Miss Arizona \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/CBS\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fe79e5e4b03b22b4fb2ae7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/12/161012missusa_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/12/161012missusa.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/12/161012missusa_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/12/miss-arizona-donald-trump-naked-girls-video\">Trump \u2018walked in on naked girls\u2019, says former Miss Arizona</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And with Trump, the double standards are so extreme it would be laughable if they weren\u2019t so destructive, from his fat-shaming of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado to the gratuitous insult he lobbed at Heidi Klum when he announced, apropos of nothing, that the supermodel was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/18/politics/donald-trump-heidi-klum-no-longer-a-ten/\">sadly, no longer a 10</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Nor did Trump \u2013 a chronic philanderer currently married to his third wife, having dumped the previous two after each had borne him children \u2013 see anything wrong with attacking Hillary Clinton over her husband\u2019s past infidelity. No matter what awful things men do, it\u2019s always the woman\u2019s fault.</p> <p>But women are becoming ever less compliant \u2013 and female insurrection is particularly upsetting to men who are already anxious about their ability to maintain their authority.</p> <p>Women have always been penalized for violating conventional gender norms, but no woman has ever had a realistic chance of winning the White House until now \u2013 and the backlash against Clinton\u2019s temerity was apparent from the start of her campaign. </p> <p>As Sandy Garossino wrote in the National Observer, \u201cUntil she ran for president, Clinton was the most admired woman in the world \u2026 So what the hell happened? The woman ran for president, that\u2019s what. Who does she think she is?\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s approval ratings have fluctuated wildly for decades. But the 2016 campaign ratcheted up the stakes to the point where the Republican nominee has promised to jail the female opponent who trounced him in both debates.</p> <h2>The confidence of the mediocre white man</h2> <p>Invoking the popularity of a tote bag that reads, \u201cLord, Give Me the Confidence of a Mediocre White Man,\u201d Jessica Valenti wrote about how exasperating it is to deal with \u201ca bombastic but woefully under-informed man who is convinced of how much smarter he is than you\u201d. When the article was published in the Guardian, its headline was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/mediocre-male-donald-trump-clinton-debate\">Why the mediocre male\u2019s days may be numbered</a>.</p> <p>Such predictions are, of course, what those men are worried about. In the early days of the modern women\u2019s movement, Gloria Steinem observed humorously that the reason many men oppose equality is that they fear women will treat them the same way they\u2019ve treated women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"764f4aa7d91c081705eb385fcf56e3573a2ffb46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/764f4aa7d91c081705eb385fcf56e3573a2ffb46/0_0_3719_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then as now, it\u2019s true that Not All Men behave badly. But the archetype is painfully familiar, as Nicholas Kristof pointed out in a New York Times op-ed column headlined: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/opinion/that-seventh-grade-bully-is-running-for-president.html\">A 7th grade bully runs for president</a>. Kristof\u2019s litany of characteristic behaviors was withering: \u201cThe boasts about not doing homework, the habit of blaming others when things go wrong, the penchant for exaggerating everything into the best ever, the braggadocio to mask insecurity about size of hands or genitals, the biting put-downs of others, the laziness, the self-absorption, the narcissism, the lack of empathy \u2013 and the immaturity that reduces a woman to her breasts.\u201d</p> <p>As Kristof\u2019s list suggests, the less hard-working or accomplished men are, the more threatened they seem by the prospect of having to compete on a level playing field \u2013 and the more they resist the prospect of real female empowerment.</p> <p>Despite growing competition, many men \u2013 like Trump in the run-up to the first debate \u2013 refuse to compensate by working harder, no matter how poorly they fare. Time-use studies show that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/01/06/gender_and_housework_even_men_who_don_t_work_do_less_than_women.html\">even when men don\u2019t have jobs</a>, they do far less housework and childcare than their working wives.</p> <p>Whether the issue is slacker husbands or discriminatory bosses who perpetuate the inequities of the gender pay gap, some women remain acquiescent to the unfairness of the status quo \u2013 but a lot of others are simply fed up. The question is: how many \u2013 and are they exasperated enough to head for the polls in droves? And will enough fair-minded men join them to elect the first female president in American history?</p> <p>The answer depends on how far we\u2019ve come in accepting the idea of women as truly equal human beings who sometimes outdo their male counterparts. Last month Vanity Fair reposted <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1994/06/hillary-rodham-clinton-first-lady\">a profile I wrote in 1994</a>, when the then first lady was working on healthcare reform. The article quoted a powerful Capitol Hill insider who compared Mrs Clinton\u2019s performance with that of her husband, the president. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them both make presentations, with dozens of senators at the table, and she\u2019s better than he is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these guys know it. They\u2019ve sat in rooms with her, and they\u2019ve sat in rooms with him. He\u2019s good \u2013 he\u2019s very good. She\u2019s just fucking perfect.\u201d</p> <p>In a globalized world increasingly riven by conflicts of byzantine complexity, Clinton\u2019s hard-earned knowledge and experience constitute her strongest claim to the Oval Office. But her rival \u2013 and the male minions who laud him as a \u201cgenius\u201d for evading taxes \u2013 fail to appreciate even that obvious point.</p> <h2>Is this the president we want for our sons?</h2> <p>As election day approaches, the larger question is how much sense of self-preservation will be manifested by the nation\u2019s adult females.</p> <p>Will American women \u2013 and the men who actually care about their welfare \u2013 support the leadership of a man who feels entitled to kiss strangers on the mouth and brag about grabbing crotches, simply because he is rich and famous and male?</p> <p>Will voters agree that a man should view and rank all women according to their physical attributes and fire those he doesn\u2019t find sexually desirable, because he thinks a woman\u2019s value is measured by her looks?</p> <p>Will voters approve the double standards of a man who publicly humiliates women for their sexual conduct even as he laughs off his own far more lurid transgressions?</p> <p>Will the electorate agree that males don\u2019t have to play by the rules \u2013 that men don\u2019t need to do what\u2019s best for their families (like refraining from dumping the mothers of their children in tabloid sex scandals) or for the economy (like paying contractors who provided services instead of cheating them) or for their country (like paying taxes)?</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has been running a commercial featuring some of Trump\u2019s denigrating comments about women, superimposed over pictures of uncertain young girls scrutinizing themselves in the mirror as they struggle to decide whether their bodies define their value in the world. \u201cIs this the president we want for our daughters?\u201d the ad asks.</p> <p>That leaves out an equally critical question: is this the president we want for our sons?</p> <p>A vote for Trump is a vote for the continuation of male entitlement \u2013 for the arrogance and inequity of unearned privilege, for the acceptance of irresponsibility in personal, familial and civic behaviors, and for the perpetuation of all the hateful biases that oppress women solely because of their gender.</p> <p>Is this the world we want to keep on living in, or is it finally time for us to demand a better one?</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>After a day of extraordinary statements \u2013 attacking women who have accused him of sexual assault, and invoking shocking antisemitic tropes \u2013 Donald Trump exercised what might be seen as a rare degree of restraint.<br></p> <p>Speaking to a Cincinnati arena filled with roughly 15,000 people on Thursday night, he merely insulted the state\u2019s Republican governor, mocked Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and watched as his supporters treated the press with the same affection that lions in the Coliseum treated Christians.</p> <p>Earlier, in the first full day after Trump faced a barrage of accusations of groping and sexual misconduct from nearly a dozen women, the Republican nominee went on the offensive.

  "<p>How did WikiLeaks go from darling of the liberal left and scourge of American imperialism to apparent tool of Donald Trump\u2019s divisive, incendiary presidential campaign?</p> <p>Thursday brought another WikiLeaks dump of nearly 2,000 emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign, allegedly by Russians. As usual, they were inside-the-beltway gossip rather than game-changing: the campaign tried to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/email-clinton-campaign-move-back-illinois-primary-42783309\">push back the Illinois primary</a>, believing it would make life harder for moderate Republicans.</p> <p>That has not stopped Trump trying to make hay from the leaked emails and deflect attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him. \u201cVery little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cSo dishonest! Rigged system!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/wikileaks-emails-trump-clinton-campaign-leaks-media-bias\">If Trump leaks are OK and Clinton leaks aren't, there's a problem | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street banks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">apparently revealed in an email dump</a> last Friday, just minutes after the release of a video in which Trump was caught boasting about groping women \u2013 timing that many felt was more than just chance. This follows a hack in July designed to embarrass Clinton on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. </p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/06/accusing-wikileaks-bias-beside-point/\">Robert Mackey</a> of The Intercept website wrote in August: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks Twitter feed</a> has started to look more like the stream of an opposition research firm working mainly to undermine Hillary Clinton than the updates of a non-partisan platform for whistleblowers.\u201d</p> <p>The seeming alliance between Trump and WikiLeaks is an astonishing role reversal. In 2010 it was lauded by transparency campaigners for releasing, in cooperation with publications <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-war-logs\">including the Guardian</a>, more than a quarter of a million classified cables from US embassies around the world. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange became a hero to many.</p> <p>At the time, Republican politicians expressed outrage at WikiLeaks, but now some are seizing on its revelations as potential salvation for Trump\u2019s ailing candidacy. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, took part in a media conference call about an email that purportedly showed Clinton campaign mocking Catholics.</p> <p>Conversely, liberal activists have expressed dismay at the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s email account and the calculated timing of the release. Neil Sroka, spokesperson for the pressure group Democracy for America, said: \u201cThere is a huge difference between risotto recipes in John Podesta\u2019s emails and the Pentagon Papers. The news value of these Podesta emails is fairly limited and the activist value is even less.\u201d</p> <p>Sroka added: \u201cWikiLeaks is like the internet. It can be a force for good or a force for bad. Right now it is propping up a candidate running the most hateful campaign in modern times.\u201d</p> <p>Last week US intelligence officials blamed Russia for previous hacks. It is not yet known whether Podesta\u2019s emails were hacked by the Russians, but US officials say the attack fits the same pattern. Russian president Vladimir Putin has denied the allegation.</p> <p>Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters on Thursday: \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security took the unprecedented step of saying ... beyond any doubt that this hack and then the leaking of the emails was perpetrated by the Russian government for the purpose of intervening in the election and trying to affect the outcome in favor of Donald Trump. This is getting closer and closer to the Trump campaign itself.\u201d</p> <p>All of which raises the question: do Assange, Putin and Trump form a triangle? Are they in communication with each other or merely exploiting a coincidence of interests? </p> <p>Trump has praised Putin and numerous links with Russia have emerged this year. But on Wednesday he denied any business interests beyond staging Miss Universe there. He has contradicted earlier statements about knowing Putin.</p> <p>Assange was asked by <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or\">Democracy Now earlier this year</a> whether he prefers Clinton or Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me, do I prefer cholera or gonorrhea?\u201d he replied. Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks editor, has said it would publish documents damaging to Trump if it had them. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re choosing publications to pick a certain line,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/how-julian-assange-turned-wikileaks-into-trump-s-best-friend\">she told Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>But some observers argue that Assange\u2019s war on Clinton is personal: she was secretary of state at the time of the diplomatic cables leak. Her perceived secrecy and hawkish foreign policy represents the antithesis of his anti-US imperialist worldview. The capricious, nihilistic, non-ideological Trump might seem like a kindred spirit by comparison.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/alina-polyakova\">Alina Polyakova</a>, deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said: \u201cMy impression of Julian Assange is that he sees US hegemony in the international world order as the biggest problem facing us today. In his attempt to bring \u2018transparency\u2019, he ends up siding with the very regimes that deny transparency and human rights. That\u2019s the irony of my enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI think the Russian government is in fact using WikiLeaks: the connection seems pretty clear to me. Is the Trump campaign tied to WikiLeaks? That\u2019s hard to say but I would be surprised if there\u2019s no coordination.\u201d</p> <p>Russia has uncomfortable associations for WikiLeaks. In 2010 its point man there, Israel Shamir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-israel-shamir-russia-scandinavia\">was exposed as an antisemite</a> and Holocaust denier. A website, israelshamir.com, carries numerous articles, <a href=\"http://www.israelshamir.com/article/a-lousy-dancer/\">one of which comments</a>: \u201cMs Clinton decided to blame her spectacular lack of success on Putin, as well. If she were honest, she\u2019d admit that she is unpopular, even among her own milieu.\u201d </p> <p>In an email, Shamir denied that Assange is coordinating with Russia. \u201cThe problem is that incredible revelations of emails are totally suppressed by the Clintonesque media,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead of discussing Clinton\u2019s hate to ordinary Americans, Clinton\u2019s order to assassinate Assange etc, you discuss whether Russians are involved. Shame!\u201d</p> <p>Assange remains holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London after claiming asylum, where he\u2019s been for four years. Two women in Sweden have accused him of rape and other sexual offences, which he denies, citing a wider conspiracy. Assange has expressed fears that, if extradited to Sweden, he would be in danger of being sent to the US, where he thinks he could face the death penalty.</p> <p>A former associate of Assange, who did not wish to be named, noted that there will be presidential elections in Ecuador in 2017 and the current leader, Rafael Correa, has stated that he will stand aside after 10 years in office. This could make Assange feel uncertain about his future protection. </p> <p>\u201cI believe he is basically hoping that Trump will be lenient on him,\u201d the former associate said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Julian Assange. I feel he\u2019s just desperate and it\u2019s a shame.\u201d<br></p> <p>The site has lost its halo in the eyes of what it used to be its core constituency, the ex-colleague added. \u201cAll the lefties were WikiLeaks softies. Now they are getting a different perspective. It\u2019s obvious Julian Assange has lost his ability to be neutral.\u201d</p> <p>But others who know Assange defend him. <a href=\"http://www.vaughansmith.com/\">Vaughan Smith</a>, a journalist and former army officer who allowed the WikiLeaks founder to stay at his UK home for more than a year, said in a text message: \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a minute that Julian is liaising with Moscow.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole thing is that he\u2019s not supposed to know the identity of his sources, who leave material anonymously to protect themselves. He checks that it\u2019s genuine and puts out as much of it as he can. That\u2019s his compact with whistleblowers. As for Clinton and Trump? He hasn\u2019t expressed a preference to me.\u201d</p> <p>And some Democratic voters have declined to criticise the leaks, which appear to show how the Clinton campaign worked to defeat Bernie Sanders in the primary elections. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anondescript\">Dave Handy</a>, a political organiser and Sanders supporter who will now vote for Clinton, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m glad but they\u2019re doing a necessary thing.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s a ploy, it\u2019s the truth. No one has denied this.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe Democratic party and the Clinton campaign have colluded for the last two years to make sure she becomes the nominee and to make sure she becomes president. As someone who will vote for her, we can only pray this is not how she runs her administration.\u201d</p>",

I saw it too, but not perhaps as you saw it, for I spent much of the time looking at his suit and feeling a tad embarrassed. It was quite a nice blue suit. Until recently, I had one quite similar. Not just alike in terms of cut or colour; mine actually had his name on it. Not Tom Ford, or Paul Smith, or Hugo Boss (as if I could afford that). This was a <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/merchandise/signature-collection/\">Donald J Trump brand</a> suit.</p> <p>It was pinstriped with fairly big lapels and turn-ups on the trousers. I liked it because it reminded me to some extent of the dramatic cloth-rich baggy suits my father and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\">Windrush generation</a> used to wear. And so, on a visit to New York a few years ago, I bought it from Macy\u2019s department store. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but it didn\u2019t break the bank.</p> <p>It was always problematic. I didn\u2019t know much about Trump. I didn\u2019t know he made suits, for a start, or that \u2013 much more likely \u2013 he had textile workers in Bangladesh, China, maybe Mexico to make them for him. I knew he was a bit naff and that his association with my suit was no kind of fashion statement, but I really did like it so I kept the sole mention of his name \u2013 the rectangular label sewn within the jacket, with \u201cDonald J Trump\u201d in gold letters \u2013 close to my chest, as it were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d34a77e56cc720b27f42f7569e717e2570c8dec3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d34a77e56cc720b27f42f7569e717e2570c8dec3/0_153_1283_1602/801.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Muir in a suit\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People thought the suit was great. If anyone asked for details, I\u2019d just say I got it in New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Muir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People thought the suit was great. If anyone asked for details, I\u2019d just say \u201cI got it in New York\u201d and the vagueness of that declaration would always deter further inquiry. But that\u2019s the problem with deception. Even for the most skilled practitioner, the inner doubts never really go away. And so it was with me and my suit from the Trump Collection. As a garment it seemed fine, but how to wear it without thinking of his preposterous bird\u2019s-nest hair, his ridiculous self-regard, his place in American culture while hosting The Apprentice as joke fodder for every late-night comedian?</p> <p>The doubts ate steadily away at me just as moths might happily have eaten away at the suit. Finally the troubling ratio: outward elegance set against the inner degradation, tilted irretrievably. A year ago, I took the Donald suit to the charity shop. Now, when the world knows all it needs to know about his depravity and lunacy, that seems to me a lucky escape.</p> <p>I understand that it may not seem that way to everyone, for in a modern world where celebrity and commerce skip hand-in-hand, we all buy products created or promoted by famous people we don\u2019t know. Some may be admirable, some may privately be rogues. They may be liberal; they may be illiberal.</p> <p>Our purchase decision may be driven by the association of the product with the celebrity or may just be a statement about the excellence of the item itself. But whatever we think of it, the link is there and from time to time that can be problematic. How many lucky enough to have anything designed by John Galliano reached for the scissors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/john-galliano-guilty-racism-antisemitism\">when he was convicted in 2011 for hurling racist and antisemitic abuse</a>?</p> <p>In 2012 French anti-racist groups called for <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/10/23/france.guerlain.protest/index.html\">a boycott of the perfume maker Jean-Paul Guerlain </a>after he used the N-word on national television. How many poured his expensive potions down the sink? Does Gary Lineker induce you to <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/gary-lineker-admits-always-most-7830878\">buy more crisps</a> or Davina McCall to <a href=\"http://www.garnier.co.uk/hair-colour/beauty/garnier/nutrisse-cream/davina-mccall\">change your hair dye</a>? If George Clooney turned out to be a cad, would you stop <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/03/george-clooneys-nespresso-ad/\">drinking his coffee</a>? Our status as consumers interconnecting with the famous as we shop can present dilemmas.</p> <p>I dodged the bullet with Trump\u2019s suit, but feel bad even now, because when I handed it to the charity shop, where I was praised for my benevolence, I didn\u2019t declare it. I didn\u2019t say, \u201cThis may look nice and it\u2019s in good nick, but there is a darkness to it and anyone who buys it must be wary.\u201d It was donated \u201cas seen\u201d, which might have been OK at the time, when Trump was just a bit ludicrous, but now feels akin to passing on a nasty virus. Someone, somewhere may now be wearing that suit, weighed down by its associations. If so, I apologise and hope they dispose of it more responsibly than I did.</p> <p>But then there is another possibility that someone \u2013 a Trumpite \u2013 now wears that suit with pride, as a symbol of all that links them with the man who has brought politics lower than any of us thought it could ever spiral. Cowardly perhaps, but I prefer not to dwell on it.</p>",

  "<p>Fame, Rainer Maria Rilke said, is the sum of all the misunderstandings that grow up around a name. It has always been believed that Ken Clarke is the most sympathetic of Conservative politicians, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/ken-clarke-caught-camera-ridiculing-tory-leadership-candidates-theresa-may-michael-gove\">rare maverick</a>, not given to cutting and trimming, and careless of his own fortunes. His reputation has been as a rough talker in a smooth party, the one human being in an otherwise inhuman outfit. Now aged 76, he has taken his chance to set the record straight by producing a book bent on proving that underneath his peacock selection of colourful hobbies \u2013 birdwatching, jazz, Formula One \u2013 he is, at heart, as orthodox and unchallenging as the smuggest of Soviet apparatchiks.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to tell which depresses him more, poor guy: his own story, or the burden of having to speak it into a Dictaphone. (He leaves the actual writing to others.) Although he makes an unwise reference to Harold Wilson producing \u201cimpenetrable and unreadable books\u201d about politics, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not in his own character to think too deeply about anything. Suspicious, he says, of anyone who flaunts their roots, he is happy nevertheless to stress that he is impeccably working class, born the son of an electrician who worked in a Nottinghamshire colliery.</p> <p>His mother died in the 1970s of cirrhosis of the liver, but he disdains to go into details about the cause of the disease. \u201cI don\u2019t like to discuss these things at length because it is unfair on my mother and gives them more emphasis than they deserve.\u201d Of his wife, Gillian, whom he met at Cambridge University, and who abandoned her own ambitions in order to be his helpmate, he remarks: \u201cIt quickly became obvious that Gillian\u2019s intention of pursuing her academic career was fairly hopeless \u2026 She had, I would plead in mitigation, always known that I was going to be a professional politician.\u201d</p> <p>Proud of what he calls his \u201cpeculiarly laid-back and stress-free personality\u201d and of having \u201cthe hide of a pachyderm\u201d, he progressed from being president of the Cambridge Union to working as a jobbing barrister in Birmingham, and thence at the age of 30 to becoming an MP. After a spell as a whip for Ted Heath\u2019s government in the early 1970s, he endured a period of opposition before what he calls \u201cmy boundless confidence in my own abilities\u201d ensured that, after the Conservatives\u2019 re-election in 1979, he achieved an 18-year run of power, smoking cigars and eating good meals at various high levels in Transport, Health, Employment, Trade, Education and the Home Office before finally becoming, in his own estimation, \u201cthe most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer since 1945\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout his service as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s tea trolley, he professes amazement that someone with his views was consistently given advancement by someone with hers. But Clarke\u2019s characterisation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/alan-greenspan\">Alan Greenspan</a>, the Ayn Rand-worshipping precipitator of the global financial crisis, as \u201cone of the wisest men I had ever known\u201d indicates that his self-proclaimed one-nation instincts hardly go very deep. Nor did his readiness in 1997 to run for the leadership of his party in a pact with John Redwood suggest that his differences of outlook with the swivel-eyed were as principled or profound as he pretends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Clarke\u2019s observations about colleagues, it's impossible to disentangle failures of curiosity from failures of style</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To every job he was given by Thatcher, he brought the same prejudice and applied the same tool kit. Like his boss, he never met a trade union he didn\u2019t dislike. So any objection that a professional group \u2013 be it prison employees, nurses, teachers, rail workers, miners or, particularly, doctors \u2013 brought to any detail of any Conservative plan for privatisation or reform was automatically dismissed as the pleading of the pampered. A laughably inadequate account of the miners\u2019 strike, in which Clarke takes up the blase pose of not understanding why people want to be miners in the first place, presents the conflict purely as a strategic test of strength for the government, and without any sensitivity to the fact that it was, both culturally and industrially, the most resonant domestic disaster of the period.</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d Clarke says, \u201cthe least observant of men.\u201d He refuses at any point to extend sympathy to workers who need to organise in order to maintain their living standards, but he chooses, meanwhile, to insert a whingeing paragraph about how heartbreaking it was for parliamentary undersecretaries in 1979 to struggle along on a salary which is, in today\u2019s money, \u00a349,400 a year. When it comes to lavishly subsidised cartels, he is a bluff and outspoken critic of everyone\u2019s except his own.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s observations about his colleagues are so lame that it becomes impossible to disentangle failures of curiosity and failures of style. From the moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/john-profumo\">John Profumo</a> is dubbed a \u201ccharming and delightful man\u201d, the reader must sharpen their scythe to hack through a dense thicket of transcribed cliche. The word \u201ccongenial\u201d is beaten into the ground, repeatedly deployed to describe any fellow politician whom Clarke likes but can\u2019t be bothered to portray.</p> <p>Thatcher, you will be surprised to learn, \u201cconstantly argued with her colleagues, sometimes being unpleasant and even rude\u201d. Clarke\u2019s own relationship with \u201cthe best prime minister I ever worked with\u201d was \u201crobust\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a> was \u201chighly intelligent\u201d. Willie Whitelaw, on the other hand, \u201cwas not intellectually brilliant, but nor was he stupid\u201d. When Britain crashes out of the ERM in 1992, a long and pointless defence of the useless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/22/conservativeparty.politics\">Norman Lamont</a> is mounted, as though it were somehow not the chancellor\u2019s own fault that his \u201ccompletely discredited\u201d government had \u201cits economic middle stump flying through the air\u201d. Lamont\u2019s refusal to resign immediately is excused on the incontestable grounds that he was Clarke\u2019s personal friend.</p> <p>A rare point of thoughtfulness comes when he regrets that his wife was far more upset by public criticism of him than he was himself. When a comedian says on the radio that among the few things making life worthwhile are \u201cbirdsong in the spring \u2026 and the prospect of seeing Kenneth Clarke going to his grave\u201d, it is Gillian who rings the BBC to complain. But at no point does Clarke de-monologue to ask himself whether the impact of his policies might have justified those attacks, which he complains were invariably \u201csavage\u201d, \u201csynthetic\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d. A similarly promising passage arising from when, as home secretary, he had bravely started to address the scandal of rising prison numbers is quickly cut short when Michael Howard takes over the post. A typical Clarkean coda adds that, in spite of Howard\u2019s law-and-order populism destroying all hope of progress, the two of them \u201cas ever, remained friends\u201d. Club before country, as they say in Westminster.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s life in politics has been bookended by the decisions to join and then to leave the European Union. A hurried epilogue on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/ken-clarke-tory-constituent-brexit-eu-referendum-not-binding\">Brexit</a> is clumsy and shallow.

  "<p>National politics is again beset by a fraction too much faction.<br></p> <p>On Thursday night, Victorian Labor\u2019s public office selection committee confirmed that a long time ally of Bill Shorten, the lawyer Kimberley Kitching, would replace Stephen Conroy in the Senate.</p> <p>People inside Labor who are not particularly enamoured of their leader were delighted by this turn of events, but closer to home, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/13/bill-shorten-ally-kimberley-kitching-to-replace-stephen-conroy-in-senate\">there was horror and consternation</a>, and I don\u2019t invoke those words lightly.</p> <p>Kitching is a divisive figure in Labor circles.
