He has these heavy eyelids and laid-back nature that I think I have.\u201d</p> <p>Pepe first became a meme in around 2008. People were lifting frames from the comic book, particularly one where Pepe has pulled his pants all the way down to pee and says \u201c<a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/feels-good-man\">feels good, man</a>\u201d and another where Pepe is consoling himself about his lack of success with women, saying \u201cat least I have time for a pizza on a bagel\u201d and adding their own captions. \u201cThen the <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/feels-bad-man-sad-frog\">Sad Frog took off</a>,\u201d said Furie, referencing a meme that flipped \u201cfeels good man\u201d on its head.</p> <p>\u201cIt just started to have a life of its own.

It becomes an internet thing.\u201d However, when ADL credited him as the creator of Pepe, he realized he had to intervene.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the worst-case scenario for any artist to lose control of their work and eventually have it labelled like a swastika or a burning cross,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI had to step up and speak on the cartoon frog\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p> <p>Furie has collected about 600 positive or peaceful frog memes being generated by the #SavePepe campaign. He plans to incorporate these into what he calls a \u201cPeace Pepe Database of Love\u201d, an online resource for people who want to support his campaign to cement Pepe\u2019s reputation as a \u201cstoned, chilled frog\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to get the frog off the hate database.

  "<p>Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state.</p> <p> The measure, known as <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Solar_Energy_Subsidies_and_Personal_Solar_Use,_Amendment_1_(2016)\">amendment 1</a>, has been criticized as \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America\u2019s sunshine state.</p> <p> The amendment would change Florida\u2019s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also <a href=\"https://smartsolarfl.org/the-solar-amendment/\">states</a> that the government should \u201censure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do\u201d.</p> <p> A group called <a href=\"https://smartsolarfl.org/\">Consumers for Smart Solar</a>, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida\u2019s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment\">The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,\u201d said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. \u201cIt has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.\u201d</p> <p> Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already \u201cstunted\u201d in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels. </p> <p> The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state. </p> <p> Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of \u201ctrying to fool you\u201d into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d and an attempt to \u201cconstitutionalize the status quo\u201d.</p> <p> Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://polls.saintleo.edu/proposed-florida-constitutional-amendment-on-solar-power-facing-a-changed-landscape-among-voters-new-saint-leo-poll-finds/\">has recently plummeted</a> to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass.

It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington\u2019s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households.</p> <p> The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn\u2019t support I-732 because it \u201cdoes not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy\u201d, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income.</p> <p>The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state\u2019s revenue <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/oct/03/nations-first-carbon-tax-on-the-ballot-in-washingt/\">by $200m</a> a year.</p> <p>However, the measure does retain <a href=\"http://grist.org/election-2016/james-hansen-vs-naomi-klein-state-carbon-tax-splits-national-climate-hawks/?utm_campaign=daily-static&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=edit-daily\">some notable support</a>, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama.

Suspicion of migrants, loathing of Muslims, a desire to put up walls and roll back social progress \u2013 these currents exist everywhere. Were Trump to win, they would have the endorsement of the most powerful office in the world. For eight years, Barack Obama has been a cautionary voice, counselling against the global rush towards xenophobia and insularity. If Trump replaces him, white nationalism will have command of the world\u2019s loudest megaphone. Racists and bigots everywhere will feel validated, vindicated \u2013 and mobilised.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nevada-voters-women\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aj3x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2867968\"            data-video-name=\"Nevada's women stand divided over Trump and Clinton on eve of election \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581aee5ae4b029b92ca45061\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/03/161026vegasv2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/03/161026vegasv2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/03/161026vegasv2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nevada-voters-women\">Nevada\u2019s women stand divided over Trump and Clinton on eve of election</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The same is true of the contempt Trump shows for basic democratic norms.

Here's my advice to US voters | Stephen Moss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Britain, we are not smugly distant from this. Our own democratic system rests on respect for the rule of law and the judges who enforce it. Yet, even here a national newspaper can brand three senior judges \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\">enemies of the people</a>\u201d, citing the fact that one of them is \u201copenly gay\u201d as evidence that their legal judgment was rigged and illegitimate.</p> <p>This is Trumpism \u2013 he too <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\">attacks judges</a> who won\u2019t surrender to him \u2013 and it is a virus not confined to the US. Full of hatred towards anyone deemed an outsider, contemptuous of knowledge and red-faced with self-righteous fury at a nebulous, all-encompassing elite, it is becoming the movement of our times.</p> <p>The first step towards its defeat is denying it a victory on Tuesday. Across the globe, we have to hope that happens \u2013 and that Americans end this nightmare before it can begin.</p>",
  "<p>The US election matters as much to the world as it does to Americans. The overriding reason is that an immense and present danger hangs over multilateralism and the notion of a rules-based global order. A Donald Trump victory would immediately make the world more worrying and unsettled than it already is. The US may no longer be seen as the world hegemon, whether benign or threatening, but it is still the single most important power. Its behaviour has unique potential to either make solutions possible or to add to areas of chaos. A Trump presidency would be bad for the US and dangerous for the world. A vote for Hillary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it.</p> <p>Domestic politics and the clash of personalities have dominated this campaign. But the little that Mr Trump has said is enough to know where the foreign policy risks and promises lie in the 8 November vote. A Trump victory would severely damage US standing almost everywhere. His strongman antics are a liability, not an asset. They are as distressing as they are ridiculous. Believing a man-to-man approach with Vladimir Putin will instantly dissolve Russia\u2019s aggressive revisionism reflects more ignorance than it does bravado. Mrs Clinton has a reputation for a hawkish outlook, but this will be tempered by war-weary public opinion in the US. She recognises that in the 21st century, US power has more chances of attaining goals if it acts inclusively, and not with go-it-alone reckless tactics. She has already applied much of this as secretary of state \u2013 playing a key role in the historic deal with Iran, in pushing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-18/hillary-clinton-secretly-pushed-cuba-deal-for-years\">a new relationship with Cuba</a> and managing the complex US relationship with China. A Clinton presidency should rely on soft power in a smart way, a philosophy she touched upon in her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-dnc-transcript.html\">Democratic convention speech this summer</a>. She should pay close attention to climate change, development and working out fairer global trade arrangements. The US should also take the lead on international justice by signing up to the international criminal court \u2013 and Mrs Clinton has expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/06/us-international-criminal-court\">\u201cgreat regret\u201d </a>about Washington\u2019s refusal to join.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-putin-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5274f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701797\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton: Trump's continual praise of Putin 'bizarre and astonishing' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1895be4b013613fffb552\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-putin-video\">Clinton: Trump\u2019s continual praise of Putin \u2018bizarre and astonishing\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are questions that Mrs Clinton\u2019s team, should they enter the White House, need to resolve. She\u2019s revealed precious little of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/17/hillary-clinton-supports-obama-keep-troops-in-afghanistan\">what she\u2019d do about Afghanistan</a>, a 14-year war that president Obama pledged to end, but that is still grinding on. If she sits behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/02/23/plan-to-close-guantanamo-bay/\">she will have to work out what to do with the</a> dozens of inmates remaining in Guantanamo Bay. When she talks of an intelligence surge, there are concerns<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\"> about what this means for the spying powers of the National Security Agency</a>. Mrs Clinton is a politician with the experience to tackle these matters. Mr Trump is not. He is more interested in pandering to dictators than in holding them accountable for crimes. He\u2019s spoken in favour of torture. His approach to trade is in line with his approach to immigration \u2013 the building of walls. He has portrayed global warming as a hoax. Mrs Clinton can be trusted with the nuclear button. Mr Trump cannot. A Trump presidency would be a leap into the unknown. His bigotry, his love of weapons, his impulsiveness and his America first-ism are all dangers. His victory would likely lead to more, not less, global confrontation.</p> <p>The most pressing issues are the burning crises of the Middle East. These will continue to hinder a US \u201crebalancing\u201d to Asia. There are no easy answers here. Mrs Clinton may want to put as much emphasis on protecting civilians as on combating Isis \u2013 she has spoken of creating a no-fly zone in Syria, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">a proposal that carries too much risk</a>. She will have to search for better leverage in the region; heftier diplomacy that perhaps includes coercion through sanctions.</p> <p>For Europe the stakes are high. Mrs Clinton is concerned about the old continent\u2019s prospects. Mr Trump plays on American isolationism \u2013 he supported Brexit and cares little for transatlantic security guarantees. Russian muscle-flexing means that, whoever becomes president, European nations can no longer rely on the US to do all the heavy lifting. Global governance is under increased strain. Geopolitical competition is rife. US leadership has a key role to play. Mrs Clinton helped turn the page on the disastrous George W Bush era. The diplomatic accomplishments of the past eight years should not be minimised. Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Obama could have anticipated the crises that befell them once they reached office. How a president reacts matters greatly. On this count alone Mrs Clinton deserves to be elected.</p>",

A spokesman for Arkansas\u2019s Pulaski County board of elections, which covers Little Rock, said the Clinton presidential center was not a polling site.</p> <p>The Trump Place polling station is a sensitive issue as a number of local residents <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/dump-the-trump-name\">are currently campaigning</a> to have his name removed from their buildings. </p> <p>Trump developed the apartments, between 59th Street and 71st Street on the west side of Manhattan, in partnership with investors from Hong Kong in the 1990s, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/nyregion/trump-place-buildings-name-change.html?_r=0\">according to</a> the New York Times. </p> <p>Seven buildings bear the Trump name, although the three apartment buildings at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard are no longer managed by Trump, and in October residents started a petition to have the Trump signage removed.</p> <p>The petition cited Trump\u2019s \u201cappalling treatment of women, his history of racism, his attacks on immigrants, his mockery of the disabled, his tax avoidance [and] his outright lying\u201d as factors in wanting to \u201cdump\u201d the Trump name.</p> <p>Kelly said she was among the signatories.</p> <p>\u201cFor the whole time I have lived here I have apologized for the name on the building,\u201d she said.

  "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other person in town with a Clinton sign,\u201d Link Oberg, 30, said, staring across the main street in Downsville, New York, at a phalanx of yard signs promoting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Republican John Faso\u2019s congressional re-election campaign. \u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d</p> <p>I am in Downsville, population 633, where the motto is: \u201cThe best town on a dam site!\u201d and where Trump signs dot the well-kept yards. (One Trump supporter, though, inked out the \u201cT\u201d and the \u201cP\u201d on one of the signs, offering neighbors the slogan \u201cRUM: Make America Great Again\u201d. It stood next to a <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/dont-tread-on-me-snake-parodies/\">Gadsden-inspired flag</a> advocating for gun rights.)</p> <p>Oberg, who answered the door in a throwback Army of Darkness T-shirt, grew up in a liberal household. \u201cThe sign was my mother\u2019s idea,\u201d she said of the family\u2019s Clinton-Kaine yard sign, adding she was of the \u201canyone-but-Trump mindset. But no one\u2019s harassed us about it or anything.\u201d</p> <p>Up the road in the town of Walton, Jody Jamieson\u2019s house had signs both for Clinton and for Faso\u2019s opponent, Zephyr Teachout, in the yard of her house on a corner far from main road. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly a Clinton supporter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Two doors down, her neighbors had a Trump-Pence flag where their American flag used to be; on that main road, Delaware Street, a cash-for-gold business proudly displayed the candidate\u2019s signs out front.</p> <p>Jamieson, who is 60, moved to Walton from Oklahoma with her husband, a native of the town who had moved away to attend college, where they\u2019d met. Like Oberg, she said she was one of two Clinton supporters in her town of 5,484 residents. </p> <p>The other is her son.</p> <p>The Clinton yard sign represents something of a shift for Jamieson, who has been a registered Republican for 30 years. \u201cI can no longer identify myself as a member of the Republican party that nominated Donald Trump,\u201d she said. After the election, she plans to change her party registration to Democrat; under New York state law, one must file notice of intent to change parties 25 days before a general election, and it only goes into effect after election day. \u201cIt took Donald Trump to do that.\u201d</p> <p>East of Walton, there are more Democrats in the village of Delhi (pronounced \u201cdell-high\u201d by locals) than some of the other places in Delaware County. The village, population 3,023, is home to the State University of New York at Delhi, a 2,000-student school with a focus on technological academic programs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52101012060cbc9ab816d373192ae1e612c5d065\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52101012060cbc9ab816d373192ae1e612c5d065/0_155_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rare sighting in this area of New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rare sighting in this area of New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Carpentier/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roger and Susan Hillstrom, who are in their mid-70s, moved to Delhi nearly 30 years ago from New York City (and aren\u2019t yet considered true locals).

(Statewide about 30% of New Yorkers don\u2019t register with a party affiliation.)</p> <p>\u201cWe have a strong Democratic group in this town,\u201d added Susan, who said another woman organized it to support Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s first Senate campaign. Now they get together regularly to talk about candidates \u2013 they\u2019ve helped elect two Democrats to the village board \u2013 and register voters.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re super organized,\u201d said Roger, \u201cbut we do get together and support candidates.\u201d</p> <p>They haven\u2019t heard much from their neighbors about their Clinton and Teachout yard signs. \u201cNobody\u2019s defaced them,\u201d said Roger, sounding horrified by the idea.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about vandalism,\u201d said Susan. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Both Hillstroms have friends who are supporting Trump, some vociferously, as well as those supporting Clinton. \u201cThis is a good community, Delhi, in supporting each other on a personal level,\u201d said Susan. \u201cIt\u2019s strong that way and maybe it kept us from being too terrible.\u201d</p> <p>Added Roger: \u201cWe all have the politeness not to go crazy with each other.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Another day closer to the presidential election, another slew of surveys \u2013 most of them showing that Hillary Clinton is in the lead. But the size of the Democratic candidate\u2019s advantage varies considerably from poll to poll, partly because some questionnaires ask voters to consider the fact that there are more than two presidential nominees. Green party candidate Jill Stein is on the <a href=\"http://www.jill2016.com/ballot_access\">ballot</a> in 45 states and voters in another three states can choose to write her name in. And the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is on the ballot in 50 states.</p> <p>Progressives who are feeling turned off by Clinton and/or Donald Trump, the two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">most unpopular</a> candidates in decades, might be considering a protest vote for one of these other parties (\u201cprotest\u201d in the sense that third-party candidates have a <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">less than 0.1% chance</a> of winning). With just four days to go until the election, they might be wondering who will be hindered more by a protest vote \u2013 Democrat Clinton or Republican Trump?</p> <p>As with all of the articles I have written so far about polling data, the answer is a very unsexy \u201cit depends\u201d. The impact of protest votes varies throughout the country. </p> <p>In total, 33 states can probably be viewed as \u201csafe\u201d states based on the fact that one of the candidates is leading by at least seven percentage points (the numbers are polling averages collected by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/\">Real Clear Politics</a>). When analysts talk about the electoral map working in Clinton\u2019s favor, they are referring to the fact that 14 of these states (plus the District of Columbia) look like they\u2019ll vote Democratic and together they\u2019re worth 187 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. Based on the same threshold of \u201csafe\u201d, Trump can only count on 152 college votes. </p> <p>More importantly, there are 17 states in the US that can be viewed as competitive based on the fact that six percentage points or less separate Clinton and Trump. Some of these states are unlikely to swing the entire election, though, because they don\u2019t have many electoral college votes. Alaska is one such example; although Trump has a narrow lead, the state is only worth <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">three electoral college votes</a> so has little power in changing the national result. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Here\u2019s a quick guide to where voting for a third party could affect which of the two main candidates wins.

A 2012 found that Spanish 15-year-olds have 6.5 hours of homework a week, nearly one-and-a-half hours more a week than the average. And children from the ages of three to six in the country are apparently doing half an hour\u2019s homework every day. Parents are being given letters to send to schools by a campaign group, urging headteachers not to set homework.</p> <p>It is a touchy subject for parents. I don\u2019t remember having any homework until I was in secondary school, but my seven year old daughter has a \u201chomework menu\u201d which she can choose to do some things from each half-term. She\u2019s also expected to do reading at home nearly every night. It isn\u2019t over-burdensome, but it does sometimes take a chunk out of our weekend when we could be doing things that are perhaps a bit more fun for all the family.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/03/my-son-works-until-midnight-parents-around-the-world-on-homework\">We asked readers from around the world what they thought of the amount of homework given to their children</a>.

  "<p>It\u2019s fashionable to dismiss all politicians as equally disappointing, unprincipled or simply venal. Since the system is gridlocked and out of touch, surely that means they\u2019re all just as bad as each other.</p> <p>But amid the wreckage of the political class, Donald Trump is different \u2013 and not just because of his politics or his rhetoric. He is in a class of his own, taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-psychopath-hitler\">narcissism and amorality</a> to a whole new level.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need a trove of leaked emails to understand just how different Donald is. You just need to get to know the Trump Foundation a little better. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html\">dogged reporting</a> of the Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold, we can do just that. It\u2019s not pretty reading. </p> <p>Trump and his supposedly charitable works are a grotesque distortion of philanthropy, a word whose roots come from the Greek for loving people. Judging from his philanthropy, Trump mostly loves one person, whose name just happens to be Donald.</p> <p>Instead of donating to a foundation with any meaningful purpose, Trump invested in his favorite pastime: inflating his self-image. This is his life\u2019s work, whether it\u2019s the Trump brand of business, politics or charity. The product is the same: an artificial version of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/nyregion/condemned-and-praised-by-trump.html\">1997 story</a> of when he was principal of a Bronx public school for a day. It was a cute program designed to boost struggling schools in New York City, and the supposedly wealthy property developer delighted in the scene.</p> <p>The school chess team was holding a bake sale to raise $5,000 to pay for travel to go to a tournament. Trump handed them a fake million-dollar bill. After making them the butt of his joke, Trump wrote them a real check for just $200.</p> <p>What kind of person mocks the students he is supposed to be helping?</p> <p>A man who shows up uninvited, a year earlier, to the opening of a nursery school for children with HIV/Aids. Trump sat on stage, pretending to be a donor, when he had given nothing. Not a penny. He posed for photos alongside then mayor Rudy Giuliani and the developer who actually donated generously to build the school. Then he simply drove away, having done nothing.</p> <p>That\u2019s Donald Trump. The man whose charitable foundation buys <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/painter-reveals-20-000-portrait-purchased-trump-foundation-article-1.2854613\">giant portraits of himself</a> to hang in his own golf resort.</p> <p>The Post called more than 400 charities with some connection to Trump. It found <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc7ZuJr4_QAhURHGMKHZkGB3wQFggbMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years%2F2016%2F06%2F28%2Fcbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH-MaRE_XKgY7kPJ0JO53KEVZKqA&amp;sig2=tcACPSGFjiIRo9n3uXXz8Q\">just one gift</a> from Trump in the past eight years: to the Police Athletic League of New York City, for less than $10,000.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s charity would not matter if he didn\u2019t brag about it so much. The scrutiny began when he skipped a primary debate as part of his petty feud with Fox News, staging a fundraiser for veterans instead. Trump promised to give $1m to the cause, but the money only materialized after months of media questions.</p> <p>For all his boasting about his foundation, most of the money came from outside donors, not from Trump himself.</p> <p>Normally you\u2019d say this kind of man has no shame. It\u2019s true: and that\u2019s exactly how Trump has managed to get to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America.</p> <p>Shameless is the way he won the primaries. Where other candidates were mildly restrained in their Muslim-baiting and nativist nightmares, Trump could always take things beyond the extreme. No previously elected official could trash Mexico and demand payment for a border wall. </p> <p>Shameless is the way he has conducted himself as a nominee. He has picked fights with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">Gold Star family</a> and promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">lock up his political rival</a> without due process. He has praised Russia while attacking his opponent for supposedly jeopardizing national security.</p> <p>And it turns out that a good chunk of Republicans like his shamelessness. They confuse his rule-breaking for the kind of free spirit that will reform a broken system.</p> <p>A real reform candidate could have won this election in a landslide. A self-disciplined extremist could have rallied the disaffected masses to his candidacy.</p> <p>But Trump is no reformer and he has no self-discipline. He abused the tax system to convert corporate losses into personal tax benefits. Then he accused his rival of failing to stop his tax avoidance, when she actually voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/donald-trump-tax-loophole-hillary-clinton-congress\">close</a> the very loophole that he has exploited.</p> <p>Like the scrutiny of his foundation, the long IRS audits he suffers are entirely of his own making. Trump will no doubt cast such investigations as political revenge, long after this election is over.</p> <p>For now, Trump is like the arch villain of a dozen superhero movies: the more he is attacked, the stronger he gets. The only solution is the kryptonite of election defeat, because with it comes the ultimate public rejection.</p> <p>No matter how much the national polls fluctuate, the state-by-state polls represent a disaster for Trump. States that he needs to win such as Virginia and Pennsylvania are out of reach. States he needs to defend, such as North Carolina, remain in jeopardy. States that Republicans haven\u2019t needed to defend in decades, such as Georgia and Utah, are vulnerable.</p> <p>There is only one refuge left for a man like Donald Trump: the shameless undermining of the democratic process itself. He will challenge the election and its results. He will stir up conspiracies of fraudulent votes and rigged elections. He will delegitimize this country\u2019s political leaders in ways that will make Vladimir Putin very happy.</p> <p>And he will walk away from the disaffected voters who believed his promise that he would win so much they would get bored of winning.</p> <p>Because he\u2019s shameless.</p>",

One of Vote Leave\u2019s few high-profile businessmen, the multi-millionaire was back in the headlines this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/wetherspoon-boss-eu-leaders-brexit-talks-tim-martin\">attacking EU leaders for \u201chectoring\u201d the UK</a>.

During the referendum campaign, a diversity of reasons for leaving was one of the leave side\u2019s great strengths; amid the chorus of different arguments there was something for almost everyone. Now that they have won, however, their incompatibility is becoming overwhelmingly clear.

The euro can\u2019t work without a government. I kept waiting for a Harvard professor to come out of the woodwork and say, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard such ignorance in my life.\u2019 But they never did. So I just kept repeating it. I became someone on the national news, repeating the same phrase.\u201d He breaks into a cackle. \u201cAnd in the end, the point was true.\u201d</p> <p>Once Britain opted not to join the euro, Martin lost interest in Europe. \u201cI never said a word.\u201d Had we met even just a couple of years ago, would he even have described himself as fiercely Eurosceptic? \u201cNot in the way that a lot of fiercely Eurosceptic people were. I think I was probably just starting to become aware of the lack of democracy at the heart of the EU, and formed the amateur philosophical theory that for the future of humanity \u2013 for prosperity and peace \u2013 you must have democracy. Because if you don\u2019t have democracy,\u201d and he starts to laugh again, \u201cyou always end up with a nutter in charge.\u201d (Does the same apply to businesses? \u201cYes! Even more so, only the customers are the electorate.\u201d) Martin wouldn\u2019t even have been too unhappy for us to remain in the EU. \u201cI just agreed with David Cameron that it needed fundamental reform.\u201d</p> <p>The 61-year-old is of the firm, if increasingly heretical, opinion that Britain has benefited enormously from EU migration, \u201cnot just economically but socially and culturally\u201d. His preferred Brexit model would continue to allow anyone from current EU member states to live and work here. \u201cIf you look around the world, successful economies and countries have had gradually rising populations, and that\u2019s needed for the UK as well.\u201d The only change he would make to the free movement of labour would be to exclude countries who join the EU in the future.</p> <p>How, then, did he feel when the leave campaign focused so heavily on immigration? He exhales uneasily, ums and ahs, and says: \u201cWell, you\u2019ll always get an element of xenophobia in any society, but I don\u2019t think Britain is generally xenophobic.

Tim is right!\u2019 But people on the remain side just don\u2019t seem to think like that. The emotion of people who\u2019ve been to good universities, et cetera, is not that they owe everything to democracy, but that they owe everything to people like them, who are better able to run companies, the civil service, universities, societies in general.\u201d</p> <p>The phrase \u201cbetter able to run companies\u201d catches my attention. Martin studied law at university, and qualified as a barrister, but then at 24 bought a pub in north London. There was more than a touch of the maverick, plucky little guy about his business model as he expanded: when brewers refused to sell him their tied-lease pubs, he bought up old banks and shops, licensed the converted premises and set about selling affordable food and drink to the unfashionable masses. Famously scruffy, he drives an old Volvo \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t own a yacht\u201d \u2013 and is pointedly unimpressed by the pretensions of professional boardroom culture. It makes me wonder if his Euroscepticism is really another expression of his emotional rebellion against the blue-chip elite.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re driving at, but no.\u201d It\u2019s the remainers, he claims, who are motivated by emotion. \u201cSomeone from the Financial Times said I was a great amateur philosopher, which is an insult \u2013 and also probably true.\u201d He hoots with laughter. \u201cAnd I think modern people think because they don\u2019t go to church they\u2019re more sophisticated and don\u2019t have a religion. But I think what the EU became was a quasi-religion for that sector of society. And universities are the modern day seminaries.\u201d</p> <p>Although happy to be a philosopher, he is emphatically not a politician. The last time he voted in a general election was 1992; \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that fact. I just didn\u2019t feel strongly enough.\u201d The only other time he has ever voted was in the 80s, for Margaret Thatcher, because she was his local MP. He mispronounces Andrea Leadsom and Gisela Stuart\u2019s names, and until recently Nigel Farage was the only Ukip politician he had even heard of. Were he American, he would vote for Hillary Clinton, and thinks Donald Trump is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d, but adds that \u201cI trust the American people to look into it in a bit more detail than me,\u201d so will defer to their judgment next week. \u201cI would never want to be a politician.

He can\u2019t think running the country is like running a pub, can he? \u201cWhat I was saying is that you can\u2019t go into negotiations with the EU insisting upon a particular outcome. If you say your pre-condition is that we have to have free trade, then in order to get that you have to accept what comes with that.\u201d I suggest that I\u2019ll be the EU, and he can be the UK, and he can show me how he would approach the negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I would say: Decca, I think free trade will suit both our territories better.\u201d I\u2019ll say: fine, but in that case you have to accept free movement of labour. \u201cI\u2019ll say: look, politically, we can\u2019t.\u201d But this is non-negotiable, I\u2019ll say. \u201cThen I think that we have to, er \u2013 well, it\u2019s up to you then, Decca, what you want to do.

But this is a businessman\u2019s assumption; to EU leaders, their political project\u2019s survival may turn out to matter more.</p> <p>We move on to much firmer ground when we abandon Europe and talk about the pub trade. To its admirers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon\">Wetherspoon\u2019s</a> is the saviour of the industry \u2013 while nearly 30 pubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">go out of business every week</a>, Martin\u2019s chain keeps on growing.

  "<p>There is a tendency to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/Presidents_Blinder_Watson_Nov2013.pdf\">overendow political events with economic significance</a>. However, the 2016 US presidential election could deliver a tectonic shift in international economic relations.</p> <p>For the most part, the candidates\u2019 platforms are standard, partisan fare. Hillary Clinton argues for investment in education and infrastructure, and a higher minimum wage. Donald Trump, too, advocates infrastructure spending along with tax cuts and the repeal of Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.</p> <p>However, one issue simultaneously distinguishes the main contenders from previous nominees while separating one from the other. Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-adds-jobs-october-unemployment-rate-election\">US adds 161,000 new jobs as Americans head to the polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/11/200565.htm\">\u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d</a>, Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm.</p> <p>Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/biography/hoover-campaigns-and-elections\">raise agricultural tariffs to protect them</a>. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/12798595\">intensified the Depression-era slump</a> in world trade.</p> <p>On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production, <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/04/14/Trump-says-he-will-revive-Pittsburgh-s-steel-industry/stories/201604140107\">Trump told audiences</a> that the industry\u2019s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/?_r=0\">45% on China</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/feed\">35% on Mexico</a>. He says <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/favicon.ico\">withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organisation</a> is an option and that he will <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-nafta-a-disaster\">break or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement</a>.</p> <p>The dogs on the street seem to know that Clinton\u2019s position is an electoral convenience. <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-calls-democratic-party-oppose-trade-deal\">Pushed by Bernie Sanders</a>, she threw TPP overboard in the primaries but will throw it a lifebelt in office, the argument runs. Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed.</p> <p>This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists <a href=\"http://economics.mit.edu/files/6613\">David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson</a> have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners\u2019 gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers\u2019 losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance \u2013 payments to US workers affected by import competition \u2013 has not offset the effects of job losses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Electoral college maths</a> makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off.</p> <p>Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/public-uncertain-divided-over-americas-place-in-the-world/\">believe trade lowers wages and costs jobs</a> than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/feed\">Germany</a>, fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/07/the-real-reason-the-u-k-voted-for-brexit-economics-not-identity\">lost most in trade with China</a>.</p> <p>Free trade has been a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/02/pdf/c2.pdf\">source of economic progress</a>. But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments\u2019 actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards.</p> <p><em>Stephen Boyle is chief economist at NatWest</em></p>",

The updating alert will deliver instantaneous, up-to-the-minute results with the latest Associated Press election data, automatically loaded directly to lock screens for Guardian app users who sign up. Readers will receive the latest information within one continuously updated notification, which will be always visible without additional taps, searches, or further access to a mobile app.<br></p> <p>Users will see the latest number of electoral votes won, how many states have been called, and the breakdown of the popular vote between the top two candidates. The notifications will then allow users to open the alert and access a live data visualization of the results and have the option to tap through to the live blog or the full results pages.<br></p> <p><strong>Sarah Schmalbach, product manager for the Guardian US mobile innovation lab</strong>, comments: \u201cThis will be the quickest and most convenient way to get live election night results on mobile. We\u2019re the first to take advantage of this brand new mobile alert feature, that allows us to update the latest data straight on readers\u2019 lock screens. No news app, or any other mobile app, has said they\u2019ll be doing this on November 8th.\u201d<br></p> <p>The notifications for the presidential election build on the success of live data notifications tested as part of the mobile innovation lab\u2019s experiment during the UK referendum on EU membership in June 2016.<br></p> <p><strong>Sasha Koren, editor of the lab says</strong>: \u201cIn adapting the technology the lab has built, and by applying the lessons we learned during the Brexit experiment, our goal is to bring live results notifications to a larger stage and to serve a wider audience during the biggest news event of the year. By adopting these notifications formats, the Guardian is taking the opportunity both to innovate within news delivery and to bring US election results to mobile users in the most accessible way possible.\u201d<br></p> <p>US app users will be prompted to sign up for live results notification via an opt-in screen starting November 4th and the alerts will be available globally through the Guardian\u2019s app notification settings.

Andy Sparrow is off today, so my colleagues and I will be keeping you up to date with all the latest developments in the government\u2019s fight to trigger article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p> Yesterday, Theresa May suffered a massive setback in what was the most important development in the Brexit story since her election as prime minister, after a high court ruled that parliament should legislate on invoking article 50. That means there needs to be a proper bill, passed through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs given a chance to amend it. Up until now, May has refused to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit in order to retain as much control as possible.</p> <p> To jog your memory of A-level politics, power in a democratic state such as Britain is conventionally shared by three bodies: the executive, which rules and proposes laws; the legislature, which passes laws; and the judiciary, which determines whether laws are being obeyed. Yesterday\u2019s landmark ruling means MPs and peers have for the first time got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process.</p> <p> Some key things that you need to know:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The government plans to appeal against the ruling, but informed commentators believe it is likely to lose again.</strong></li> <li><strong> The chances of Brexit being overturned are still minimal, as most MPs and peers who voted to remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured. </strong></li> <li><strong> The chances of a soft Brexit have increased significantly. If there is a bill, parliament will have the chance to exercise leverage.</strong></li> <li><strong> There is a real possibility that May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March, as the need to legislate could cause a delay.</strong></li> <li><strong> We are more likely to see an early general election than we were this time yesterday - a vote some commentators have dubbed \u201cthe Brexit election\u201d.<strong><br></strong></strong></li> </ol> <p> Today, the prime minister is due to speak to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and tell him that she is going to press ahead with her plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen anything you think we ought to cover, I\u2019ll be reading your comments below the line, or you can reach me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiakhomami\">@nadiakhomami</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T09:40:17.352Z\">at 9.40am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Fox News <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/02/fbis-clinton-foundation-investigation-now-very-high-priority-sources-say.html\">reported</a> on Wednesday that the FBI is intensifying an investigation into the Clinton Foundation over allegations \u2013 which both the foundation and the Clinton camp deny \u2013 it traded donations for access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/secret-recordings-fueled-fbi-feud-in-clinton-probe-1478135518?mod=trending_now_1\">reported</a> that justice department officials considered the allegations <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/secret-recordings-fueled-fbi-feud-in-clinton-probe-1478135518?mod=trending_now_1\">flimsy</a>. </p> <p>The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-making-inquiry-ex-trump-campaign-manager-s-foreign-ties-n675881\">business dealings in Russia</a>. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The Daily Beast <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/03/meet-donald-trump-s-top-fbi-fanboy.html?via=desktop&amp;source=twitter\">reported</a> on Thursday on ties between Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and the FBI\u2019s New York field office, which reportedly pressed the FBI to revisit the Clinton server investigation after beginning an inquiry into Weiner\u2019s alleged sexual texting with a minor. The website reported that a former New York field office chief, highly critical of the non-indictment, runs a military charity that has received significant financial donations from Trump. </p> <p>Comey\u2019s decision to tell the public in July that he was effectively dropping the Clinton server issue angered some within the bureau, particularly given the background of tensions with the justice department over the Clinton issue. A significant complication is the appearance of a conflict of interest regarding Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-meeting-hillary-email-server-fbi\">met with Bill Clinton</a> this summer ahead of Comey\u2019s announcement, which she acknowledged had \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over the inquiry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey: Hillary Clinton email inquiry is FBI chief's latest controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMany FBI agents were upset at the director, not because he didn\u2019t [recommend to] indict, but they believe he threw the FBI under the bus by taking the heat away from DoJ [Department of Justice],\u201d the former bureau official said. </p> <p>All this has compounded pressure on Comey, with little end in sight. </p> <p>Jim Wedick, who retired from the bureau in 2004 after 35 years, said that if Clinton is elected, she and Comey would probably find a way to work together out of a sense of pragmatism. He recalled both his own occasional clashes with federal prosecutors and Bill Clinton\u2019s uneasy relationship with his choice for FBI director, Louis Freeh.</p> <p>\u201cEach one will find a way to pick at the other. It\u2019s not going to be good and it\u2019s not going to be pretty. But they\u2019ll both have to work with each other,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Senator Ron<strong> </strong>Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, said: \u201cThe continued leadership failures at the FBI are another reminder we can\u2019t let intelligence agencies say \u2018trust us\u2019 and then give them a blank check to probe into Americans\u2019 lives.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I\u2019ve argued for years that Congress must create ironclad protections for Americans\u2019 security and privacy, we also need vigilant oversight of agencies that have the power to deprive citizens of their liberty or change the course of an election.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI would not comment for this story. </p>",

Retail lost 1,100 over the month, a surprise drop in a month when retail jobs usually start picking up.</p> <p>The report once again highlighted the uneven nature of the US jobs market: Hispanic unemployment declined to 5.7% but rates for most other groups showed little change.

  "<p>The most expensive political battle in Oregon\u2019s history will culminate next week when Oregonians go to the polls. But the fight isn\u2019t between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Instead, big business has been bombarding voters with ads in an effort to see off a bill that would force them to pay more in taxes towards funding the state\u2019s education, healthcare and senior services.</p> <p>Oregon has the lowest corporate taxes in the country, chiefly due to the state having no sales tax. In corporate income tax, however, Oregon rests somewhere in the middle.<br></p> <p>The proposal, Measure 97, would make any corporation with annual sales of more than $25m in Oregon pay a minimum tax of $30,001, plus a 2.5% tax on their sales above $25m.<br></p> <p>The contentious debate over the ballot measure has left the state divided, with millions being spent on ads, mailers and TV spots. Some of the world\u2019s largest corporations \u2013 Shell, Walmart, Comcast and Wells Fargo \u2013 have paid out of pocket to defeat the corporate tax increase in Oregon. Total contributions both in and out of state exceed over $23m.</p> <p>Proposed by the union-led coalition Our Oregon, the measure is aimed at stabilizing a trembling Oregon economy and avoiding a looming $1.4bn budget shortfall for the next two years. State economists project the corporate tax increase would raise some $3bn a year in revenue, increasing the state\u2019s budget by roughly a third. <br></p> <p>More than most states, the Democratic-dominated Oregon relies on personal income taxes \u2013 which total 75% of the state\u2019s tax collections \u2013 to fund services and programs like education, public safety and prisons. \u201cBecause of our high dependence on the personal income tax, we have more volatility than the typical state,\u201d said economist Paul Warner, of Oregon\u2019s non-partisan Legislative Revenue Office (LRO).<br></p> <p>In an economic upturn \u2013 when Oregonians are making money \u2013 the state budget benefits from increased personal income tax revenue. But when a recession hits, income tax becomes a faulty cash stream, and the state is forced to shortchange programs and services. The ballot measure is intended to make the state less reliant on personal income taxes and more on gross receipts revenue from large businesses.</p> <p>But the debate has opponents and supporters shouting different answers to the same question: who bears the cost in the end?<br></p> <p>While the measure would directly tax only a small pool of the wealthiest corporations \u2013 less than a quarter of 1% of all businesses operating in the state \u2013 opponents claim that Measure 97 is a deceptively disguised sales tax, which Oregonians have continually shot down since the 1930s.<br></p> <p>A coalition of more than 26,000 supporters \u2013 including consumers, family farmers, small and large businesses, and local chambers of commerce \u2013 have come together to defeat it.<br></p> <p>They argue that it will be detrimental to businesses with low margins. Meanwhile, the tax would be levied on all transactions down the line in the retail, wholesale and utility sectors. The result, they warn, would be higher prices for Oregonians on everything from electricity and healthcare to food and medicine.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that there will be some upward pressure on prices. I think the issue is around how much,\u201d said Warner, who estimates that consumer prices would increase by 0.8%.<br></p> <p>Robert Whelan, director of the economic consulting firm ECONorthwest, said the problem is that Measure 97 taxes sales, not profits. \u201cA chain like Safeway or Fred Meyer passes the $25m threshold in the first week of each year,\u201d he said. \u201cThereafter, they have to pay 2.5% of their sales in tax, even if the stores fail to make a profit. And that happens.\u201d<br></p> <p>Portland General Electric (PGE) has contributed $250,000 to the campaign against Measure 97. \u201cVarious suppliers, vendors and contractors we work with would also be subject to the new tax, and can be expected to pass their increased costs along to us,\u201d said Steven Corson, communications director at PGE. He predicts the company\u2019s retail customer base of more than 800,000 would face a price increase of about 2%.<br></p> <p>The Legislative Revenue Office (LRO) has projected that the measure could cost the average Oregonian household an extra $600 per year.<br></p> <p>Higher expenses for residents and the loss of thousands of private sector jobs \u201care huge prices for Oregonians to pay, especially when there is absolutely no guarantee for how the money would be spent\u201d, said Rebecca Tweed, the statewide campaign coordinator for the measure\u2019s opposition. While the language of the measure says it is to fund education, healthcare and senior services, the legislative assembly is not bound by a promise.<br></p> <p>The opposition says voters should not be put in charge of the state\u2019s tax system. \u201cAddressing and resolving Oregon\u2019s budget needs and tax policy is the responsibility of the Oregon legislature and the governor,\u201d said Tweed.<br></p> <p>But supporters say the opposition is using scare tactics \u2013 screaming job loss and price hikes \u2013 to dissuade voters.

This includes images, text, video, a combination of all three and sometimes real-world actions.</p> <p>Political memes have always existed. Recall Ronald Reagan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/20/255819681/the-truth-behind-the-lies-of-the-original-welfare-queen\">Welfare Queen</a> or Howard Dean\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0\">euphoric howl</a>.

They are now born from the swamps of the internet in real time, distributed from the bottom up. They have grown into a form of anarchic folk propaganda, ranging from tolerable epigrams to glittering hate-soaked image macros akin to a million little rogue Pravdas.</p> <p>Like me, you probably have more than a few Facebook friends who make it their life\u2019s work to circulate political memes in hopes of influencing how you see the world. They are our deadbeat uncles, former co-workers and long-forgotten high school acquaintances. They are agents of nowhere, apparatchiks of nothing in particular. And through the raw power of mass replication, even their most insipid ideas are able to surface from below. By typing some text on an image and sharing it with friends, they too have a voice capable of reaching a critical mass.</p> <p>The reason why it is now possible for Darryl from Accounting who hates \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d to have the same communicative power as a television network is down to the DNA of the medium: speed and lack of gatekeepers. Memes thrive on a lack of information \u2013 the faster you can grasp the point, the higher the chance it will spread. </p> <p>They also favor extreme perspectives: a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285414041_Impact_of_status_and_meme_content_on_spread_of_memes_in_virtual_communities\">recent study</a> from Texas University found that individuals who are socially isolated and more likely to be characterized as \u201con the fringe\u201d have a greater chance at creating a successful meme.</p> <p>In order to grasp why this is so significant, we need to go back to the last time we were making similarly grandiose proclamations about how the internet changed everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ILProgNet/status/713538359713357824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FeelTheBird?src=hash\">#FeelTheBird</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BirdieSanders?src=hash\">#BirdieSanders</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BheazM1KSv\">pic.twitter.com/BheazM1KSv</a></p>&mdash; ILProgressiveNetwork (@ILProgNet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ILProgNet/status/713538359713357824\">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Picture yourself in the year 2010. </p> <p>The possibility of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series is as depressingly remote as ever.

We created memes, but not just any memes \u2013 political ones meant to trigger paradigm shifts that would upend the prevailing logic of late capitalism, such as this one:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"533ea821b0ebaa4fe609b20102e9319c4f565c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/533ea821b0ebaa4fe609b20102e9319c4f565c09/0_0_915_1232/743.jpg\" alt=\"Adbusters memes\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We called it \u201cmeme warfare\u201d, a term that was originally coined by social change activist Andrew Boyd. </p> <p>\u201cSocial movements cannot live by meme alone. Yet memes are clearly powerful \u2013both analytically and operationally,\u201d Boyd wrote in his essay <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://andrewboyd.com/truth-is-a-virus-meme-warfare-and-the-billionaires-for-bush-or-gore/\">Truth is a Virus: Meme warfare and the billionaires for Bush (or Gore)</a>. \u201cA vital movement requires a hot and happening meme. Truth is a virus whose aim is to subvert the corporate mememachine with a sly guerrilla war of signs.\u201d</p> <p>Much of what we produced was mischievous, maybe even poignant, much of it verged on self-satire but most of it was strictly for the LOLs; in-jokes to keep the blood pumping through those long and sedentary pizza-filled production nights. But every once in a while, the Adbusters office turned out something that proved to be profoundly effective. </p> <p>For instance, the <a href=\"http://pismowidok.org/index.php/one/article/viewFile/162/290/2088\">black and white image</a> of a ballerina gracefully perched atop the charging bull of Wall Street, while masked figures charged forward from the background. \u201cBring tent\u201d, it read underneath, alongside the now famous hashtag that sparked the Occupy movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b6ba602941927fee2355ac206af8148fac3b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b6ba602941927fee2355ac206af8148fac3b90/0_0_1000_1515/660.jpg\" alt=\"Adbusters meme\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Back in 2010, the idea of using memes to political ends was still housed within a fairly slim leftist-activist corridor \u2013 it was a tool that seemed entirely of our own creation, and entirely under our control. We viewed memes as a vehicle through which activists could speak truth to power \u2013 they were molotov Jpegs to be thrown at corporate hegemony\u2019s bulletproof limousine.</p> <p>Never in our most ironic dreams did we the think that the spirit of our tired, lager-fueled pisstakes would end up leading to a resurgence of white nationalism and make the prospect of a fascist America faintly realistic.</p> <p>But the internet is weird like that. It takes things and twists them.</p> <p>At their most basic, meme warfare presented an opportunity for individuals to seize control of the means of media production from corporate interests. It was a viral and open-source medium that would allow individuals to compete for attention against the all-consuming hydra of advertising, marketing and public relations. </p> <p>This line of thinking was, in retrospect, breathtakingly naive. It assumed that the act of meme generation by a non-corporate entity would be innately good. Like many instances of the tech-centric idealism, it would unravel in spectacular fashion. It\u2019s not that anti-corporate activists were wrong about how the internet could be leveraged to change politics \u2013 it\u2019s that they were terribly right.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a straight, causal line connecting the Occupy movement and its many slogans with the neo-Nazi image macros that have been frogmarched out of 4chan to spread hate across the internet in support of Donald Trump. But they share some conceptual DNA. They are both indebted to Guy Debord and the Situationists, specifically the practice of <em tabindex=\"-1\"><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tournement\">d\u00e9tournement</a></em>: hijacking expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture against itself. They both also share a deep cynicism about the mainstream media. But this is where the similarities end.</p> <p>When appropriated by the emerging alt-right, memes become a different weapon. They <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/05/04/meme-magic-donald-trump-internets-revenge-lazy-entitled-elites/\">call it \u201cmeme magic\u201d</a> \u2013 a phenomenon which has helped vocalize and activate the more extreme wings of the Trump base and introduce white nationalism to a new generation of disaffected nerds. Meme magic is almost identical to meme warfare in that it attempts to use shareable images and ideas in an effort to engender real political change. </p> <p>To date, their most effective memes have been those questioning Hillary Clinton\u2019s health status.

Noam Chomsky\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\">Manufacturing Consent </a>instantly comes to mind, in which he painstakingly examines the New York Times\u2019 coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.</p> <p>The alt-right, on the other hand, is far less interested in thoughtful critiques and far more concerned with control. This mirrors the classic left/right divide of analysis versus action. While the left is typically comfortable with endlessly analyzing what\u2019s wrong with the reality, the right seeks to impose their own reality, currently existing reality be damned.</p> <p>Traditionally, mass media have provided a protective membrane between the public and overly toxic ideas. The mass effect of this delivered a relatively standardized view of politics and world events. For a number of reasons \u2013 a decades-long lowering of journalistic standards, the deterministic effect of ratings and clicks, and the generalized paranoia created by the internet, to name a few \u2013 this membrane has broken down.</p> <p>The recent #draftourdaughters meme provides an instructional example.</p> <p>On 16 May of this year, Hillary Clinton<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-clinton-women-draft-register-224390\"> voiced support</a> for legislation that would require women to register for the draft. This was largely received as a rare instance a bipartisan support for a purely symbolic gesture, aimed at promoting gender equality in the military.</p> <p>For a maverick like Ted Cruz, it was a chance for him to put on his daddy hat, lambasting the bill because it would \u201cforcibly conscript young girls into combat\u201d. To the paranoiac mind it fed into a conspiracy theory that the next world war is imminent. For the alt-right, it was a perfect opportunity to launch a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59uczc/draftourdaughters_is_weapons_grade_persuasion/\">weapons-grade persuasion</a>\u201d campaign.</p> <p>The result has been a series of <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/157933/will-hillary-draft-women-inside-draft-our-daughters-a-fake-ad-campaign-from-the-alt-right#.WKMo62xuY\">widely shared fake campaign ads </a>meant to promote the idea that Hillary wanted to send young women to their deaths in a war against Russia.

  "<p><strong></strong><strong>There are only days to go before the US presidential election on 8 November. What are the latest polls saying?</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>For an election that is generating more passion on both sides than any in recent memory, pollsters and pundits are offering scant comfort to those seeking clarity about Tuesday\u2019s result. Most outlets continue to predict victory for Hillary Clinton, but various models differ greatly in the certainty they award that outcome, and various polling averages disagree on the margin. Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">FiveThirtyEight</a> model gives Clinton a 65% chance of winning to Donald Trump\u2019s 35%, while the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;WT.nav=c-column-middle-span-region\">New York Times</a> sticks its neck out with an 86% chance of a Clinton presidency to 14% for Trump. RealClearPolitics\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">polling average</a> has Clinton ahead by 1.7 percentage points, while HuffPost Pollster\u2019s <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">average</a> gives her a 5.5 percentage point lead.</p> <p><strong>How have these indicators changed since James Comey announced the FBI was looking into Clinton\u2019s emails again?</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Amid this dense electoral fog, what is clear is that <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/11/02/Trump_leads_Clinton_in_new_Ohio_poll.html\">Comey\u2019s bombshell</a> last Friday that the FBI is in a sense reviving its probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was US secretary of state has had a profound impact on the race. It allowed Trump, until then mired in his own <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">controversy</a> over his attitudes towards women, to swing the spotlight back onto his rival\u2019s perceived untrustworthiness. Probably as a result, the Republican nominee\u2019s plummeting poll ratings have rallied, bringing them within the margin of error both on a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">national</a> measure and in key states such as <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/presidential-polls-2016-election-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/\">Florida</a>, and even propelling him into the lead in the bellwether state of <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/11/02/Trump_leads_Clinton_in_new_Ohio_poll.html\">Ohio</a>.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s happening now about the FBI investigation? Is there a timeframe?</strong></p> <p>FBI agents are racing through <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/laptop-may-include-thousands-of-emails-linked-to-hillary-clintons-private-server-1477854957\">650,000 emails</a> reported to have been found on a laptop shared between Huma Abedin, vice-chair of Clinton\u2019s campaign, and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner (he of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/anthony-weiner-resigns-twitter-scandal\">sexting</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/anthony-weiner-under-investigation-nypd\">scandals</a>). It is not known how many of those emails came to or from Abedin, nor how many might have related to Clinton or might already have been examined by the Bureau. If there are any new Clinton emails, it will take time to work out whether they contain classified material. So the search is unlikely to be completed by Tuesday, leaving this Sword of Damocles dangling over the Democratic presidential candidate as Americans go to the polls. </p> <p><strong>How is early voting looking?</strong></p> <p>More than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">34 million</a> Americans have already voted, surpassing the <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2012_early_vote\">32 million</a> who cast their ballots early four years ago. Will this benefit Clinton or Trump? There\u2019s no easy answer to that question, given variations both by state and electoral group. But there are clues. The good news for Clinton is that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clintons-coalition-hispanic-support-is-up-black-turnout-is-down/\">Latino turnout</a> among early voters has increased dramatically over 2012, suggesting that the \u201csleeping giant\u201d of the Hispanic vote might actually have been awoken this year by Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. The bad news is that the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2016/10/clinton-campaign-struggles-in-getting-african-americans-to-early-voting-polls-106931\">African American turnout</a>, such a vital element in the coalition built by Barack Obama in his two successful presidential runs, is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">young voters</a>. The fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for Clinton in swing states such as North Carolina, which has been identified by both candidates as a key target.</p> <p><strong>Can early voters change their minds, as Trump has urged, and have they been? </strong></p> <p>Trump is trying to use the furor over the FBI\u2019s renewed interest in Clinton\u2019s emails to persuade those early voters feeling buyer\u2019s remorse to switch their preference. \u201cNow that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/793763567837253633\">said on Twitter</a>, making the same appeal at a campaign stop this week in Wisconsin, one of six states that do actually allow early voters to change their minds (three times, in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/changing-early-vote-cast/\">Wisconsin\u2019s case</a>). The others are Connecticut, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York and Pennsylvania. <a href=\"http://wbay.com/2016/10/24/some-wisconsin-early-voters-make-ballot-changes/\">Some early voters</a> have made use of this facility, though probably not in numbers large enough to make a difference.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the latest from Florida, and why is the Sunshine State so crucial?</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Florida accounts for 29 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win, which puts it on a par with New York and means it has fewer than only California and Texas. Combine that with the state\u2019s history of squeakily close presidential elections \u2013 Obama won here in 2012 by just 74,000 out of more than 8m votes \u2013 and you have the mother of all swing states. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/donald-trump-path-to-270-scenarios/\">All</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/02/4-electoral-maps-where-donald-trump-wins/?tid=sm_tw_pp&amp;wprss=rss_the-fix\">modeling</a> suggests Trump must win Florida or kiss goodbye to the White House, although for Clinton it may not be quite so crucial.

For the lucky winner, the hard work will have only just begun. They must prepare for life in the White House, starting with the inauguration on 20 January.

Could an election defeat result in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/29/labour-mps-vs-corbyn-war-party-members-tories-brexit\">parliamentary Labour party</a> that would be more Corbyn-friendly than is currently the case?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/are-you-worried-about-labours-polling-figures\">Are you worried about Labour's polling figures?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in March, the media had a great deal of fun with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/23/labour-mps-hostile-corbyn-leaked-party-document\">leaked list</a> put together by a Corbyn staffer that categorised Labour MPs according to their perceived loyalty to the leadership. The smallest group, made up of Corbyn himself and the 18 MPs most loyal to him, was designated the Core Group, while there were 56 MPs labelled Core Group Plus. The largest group, called Neutral But Not Hostile, was made up of 71 MPs. Core Group Negative contained 49 MPs and Hostile Group 36. Some 17 MPs weren\u2019t included in any of the categories \u2013 and a couple of them appeared in more than one group.</p> <p>One way of answering the question, then (presuming for the sake of argument that the leaked list was reasonably accurate), is to compare the safety or otherwise of the seats occupied by MPs in the list\u2019s different groups.</p> <p>Doing this reveals that there isn\u2019t much difference in the majorities on which MPs loyal to Corbyn are sitting and those won by his detractors. There isn\u2019t any obvious sense in which Core Group (average majority 12,194) and Core Group Plus (average majority 9,412) are much more likely to survive a cull of Labour MPs at the next election than Core Group Negative (average majority 11,656) or Hostile Group (average majority 9,941) \u2013 or for that matter, Neutral But Not Hostile (10,067).</p> <p>Another approach is to take a guess at the vote share that parties might get at the next election, convert that to the seats they are likely to win and lose on that share, and see whether that makes a difference to the ideological composition of the PLP.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Activists longing for a more pro-Corbyn parliamentary Labour party will have to rely on their own efforts to get one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now clearly, caveats apply: we\u2019re assuming once again that the leaked list\u2019s designation of Labour MPs is reasonably accurate; we\u2019re assuming that the next election will take place on current boundaries; and we\u2019re using one poll\u2019s results and relying on the educated guesses built into vote-seat calculators. But we believe it\u2019s worth our while.</p> <p>If ICM\u2019s latest results were repeated at a general election, the Conservatives would win 43% of the vote and Labour 27%, with the Liberal Democrats on 8%, Ukip 12%, Greens 5%, and the SNP 4%. This would result in the Conservatives gaining nearly 50 seats, bringing their total to 379 \u2013 a majority of 108. Labour would lose just over 40 seats, leaving them with just 190, although since 10 of the expected survivors were not included on the loyalty list, we\u2019ve had to leave them out of our calculations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ded1b446d7489aad22810b39fc34a0f3e7df69e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ded1b446d7489aad22810b39fc34a0f3e7df69e3/1_8_787_472/500.png\" alt=\"Graph\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This projection \u2013 illustrated in two pie charts above (the first of which excludes MPs who were double counted or have died since the list was leaked) \u2013 likewise suggests that a defeat at the next election will not materially alter the balance of pro- and anti-Corbyn MPs in the PLP. Anyone supportive of the current leadership, then, who believes that Corbyn and those around him will benefit from some sort of clear out of his opponents by the voters, is likely to be seriously disappointed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/corbyn-urges-may-to-see-i-daniel-blake-to-gain-insight-on-life-on-welfare\">Corbyn urges May to see I, Daniel Blake to gain insight to life on welfare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as importantly, should Corbyn step down in the wake of a defeat, there is no guarantee that a Corbynista successor will make it on to the ballot, thus ensuring that Labour\u2019s currently pro-Corbyn grassroots members and supporters can pick someone to carry on where he leaves off. If Labour is left with 190 MPs, then said candidate will need 29 nominations to go forward for consideration to the members and registered supporters. With the Core Group reduced to just 17 MPs, the Corbynistas are going to need to recruit another 12 MPs from a Core Group Plus who, after the election, might not be feeling quite as positive about a leftwing leader as they may be now.</p> <p>Given that voters don\u2019t seem likely to deliver up a noticeably more pro-Corbyn PLP, Labour activists longing for one are going to have to rely on their own efforts instead. If the election doesn\u2019t happen until 2020, perhaps they still have time to alter the composition of the Labour benches at Westminster by deselecting sitting MPs in favour of more ideologically congenial candidates.

  "<p>For Khalid Abdalla, the boundary between life and art has repeatedly blurred and shifted over the past six years. The actor, best known for his roles in films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121902/kite-runner\">The Kite Runner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/133271/green-zone\">Green Zone</a>, has portrayed a film-maker struggling to finish a documentary in the tense political climate of pre-revolutionary Cairo, starred in a documentary about the 2011 revolution, actually documented the same uprising and its troubled aftermath, and set up a film centre in the Egyptian capital to support independent film-makers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/khalid-abdalla-movie-star-tahrir-square-united-93\">Khalid Abdalla: from movies to Tahrir Square</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Juggling these politically sensitive projects, Abdalla says he felt \u201cprofoundly trapped in a loop\u201d. From being at the centre of the anti-government protests in Tahrir Square, he has since experienced the optimism of the revolution give way to disillusionment. With the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi\">President </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi\">Abdel Fatah al-Sisi</a>, he now finds himself precariously navigating a new crackdown on Egyptian artists and activists that recalls the corruption and brutality of the ousted Mubarak regime.</p> <p>Just to compound the sense of deja vu, Abdalla is currently promoting his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiFlSxEGnQU\">In the Last Days of the City</a>, which finished shooting in Cairo six weeks before mass demonstrations broke out across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\">Egypt</a> on 25 January 2011. The actor plays a film-maker, also called Khalid, in the midst of a creative and personal crisis, seemingly unable to find a direction for his documentary, failing to find a new flat and coming to terms with a breakup \u2013 circumstances complicated by the everyday chaos of the city and the organised violence of the regime.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe is the kind of person that you\u2019re actually afraid you are, who\u2019s nice enough and warm enough, a good enough person but not special,\u201d says the actor. \u201cHe\u2019s been a difficult character to live with.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the actor says there is something progressive about the ineffectual nature of his alter ego. \u201cThe hero [in western and Arab cinema] is frankly someone who normally kills us. Whether it\u2019s the patriarchal or the political, they\u2019re essentially what we\u2019re revolting against.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"063f0e5da5aa44f9bead12c76bd9dff817ec1b88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/063f0e5da5aa44f9bead12c76bd9dff817ec1b88/0_166_2992_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdalla in The Kite Runner, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdalla in The Kite Runner, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In person, Abdalla, 35, exudes the same quiet intensity as the character he portrays. Polite and soft-spoken, his answers are often steeped in political or cultural theory and he can examine or unpick an idea \u2013 sometimes exhaustively \u2013 from every angle. But unlike his fictional counterpart, the actor\u2019s intellectual curiosity does not deter him from action. </p> <p>Abdalla was in London when the revolution broke out on 25 January 2011, but quickly returned to Cairo to join the anti-government demonstrations. He immersed himself in the political and cultural change overtaking Egypt, helping to found the media collective <a href=\"http://mosireen.org/\">Mosireen</a> (meaning \u201cwe are determined\u201d) to document the protests in Tahrir Square, shooting on the frontline of clashes with the police and the army. For the past five years, he has been helping to assemble a digital archive of these historic events from thousands of hours of footage shot by the collective, protestors and eye-witnesses. \u201cI hadn\u2019t picked up a camera before In the Last Days of the City,\u201d he says. \u201cI played a version of who I\u2019ve become.\u201d </p> <p>As Abdalla puts it, the film was made with a sense of foresight and edited with a sense of hindsight. Footage shot amid actual anti-government demonstrations in Cairo in 2010 took on new meaning after the revolution broke out but the actor denies the film anticipated the uprising.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we had any special insight in terms of what was going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cThe film\u2019s title was decided in 2008. It\u2019s just that the situation was so awful, things couldn\u2019t carry on like they were. There was a strong sense that something was going to shift and the whole country knew that \u2026 What you see extremely in the film is a people, city, buildings that have been broken down. Broken in the way that you break down animals.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, the film\u2019s portrayal of media censorship, state propaganda and police oppression \u2013 in one scene officers grab a man off the streets and beat him in a side alley \u2013 remains all too recognisable. \u201cScenes we captured so innocently pre-revolution have resonance in the [current] counter-revolution situation,\u201d says Abdalla. \u201cEveryone jokingly says that things have gone back to the way they were [before the revolution] and the film embraces [that].\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9072e8ca7816300102f5dc3e842978ee921e9b1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9072e8ca7816300102f5dc3e842978ee921e9b1e/295_0_1187_712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khalid Abdalla in a scene from In the Last Days of the City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khalid Abdalla in a scene from In the Last Days of the City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zero Production</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This perhaps explains why In the Last Days of the City has just been excluded from the <a href=\"http://ciff.org.eg/\">Cairo international film festival</a> (CIFF), where it was due to have its Middle East and North Africa premiere on 17 November. The official reason, given by the festival board in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/daysofthecity/posts/980893552022540\">a letter sent after the film was shown at the London film festival</a> last month, is that it has had too many international screenings, but Abdalla suspects the truth is more political. More than <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/247159/Arts--Culture/Film/In-the-Last-Days-of-the-City-continues-to-fight-fo.aspx\">300 film-makers and cultural figures</a> have published a letter calling on CIFF, which is organised by Egypt\u2019s ministry of culture, to reverse the decision.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a heartbreaking situation for us,\u201d says Abdalla. \u201cTheir last-minute deselection has left us without a Middle East and North Africa festival premiere, and sabotaged our plans. We just hope it\u2019s not a sign of what\u2019s to come from censorship.\u201d</p> <p>I first met Abdalla in Cairo in March 2014, when he was helping to establish <a href=\"http://cimatheque.org/\">Cimatheque</a>, an alternative film centre in downtown Cairo, near Tahrir Square, co-founded with the director of In the Last Days of the City, Tamer El Said. This was, he tells me two and a half years later, the darkest period in his life. The revolutionary movement was reeling from the return to military rule following a coup in July 2013 that ousted Egypt\u2019s first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/rabaa-massacre-egypt-human-rights-watch\">Rabaa massacre the following month</a>, when hundreds of Morsi\u2019s supporters were killed in clashes with the security services, and the subsequent declaration of a state of emergency and curfews across the country.</p> <p>As a star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-square\">The Square</a>, the award-winning 2013 documentary about the revolution and the subsequent political fallout, Abdalla was a highly visible figure and understandably anxious of reprisals by the authorities. One of his friends, who I interviewed days before, had recently burned the source material for his artworks after his flat was raided by the secret police. </p> <p>\u201cI hit the darkest place I\u2019d ever hit at the end of 2013/beginning of 2014,\u201d Abdalla recalls. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/egypt-massacre-morsi-clashes-mosques\">Rabaa massacre</a> had happened and the whole country was under curfew. Mosireen was under threat. The Square was coming out. Cimatheque was being built. I was living in one room in my parents\u2019 house. I was suffocating myself between the split of focus of all of this.</p> <p>\u201cI had a point where I would be woken up by the negativity of my thoughts attacking me for an hour or longer. I couldn\u2019t get rid of the thoughts. It was an hour and a half of attack in the morning. Me staring into space. Just blank walls, a loop of thoughts. The sense of the abyss was overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>How did he resurface from that hole? \u201cThis will sound really pretentious, but what got me out of it was as soon as I would hear that voice, I\u2019d pick up a book and drown it out with someone else\u2019s words, which I actually wanted to hear,\u201d he says. \u201cBooks of history and the philosophy of revolution, Gilles Deleuze, a lot of economics, stuff that was bigger than me. Reading all of this became therapeutic.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla\u2019s choice of self-help reflects his deep political convictions and the sense of having a responsibility to pursue a life and career that doesn\u2019t compromise those ideals. Born in Glasgow to Egyptian parents and brought up in London, activism is part of his heritage. His father, Hossam, was a leading student activist in the 1970s and his paternal grandfather, Ibrahim Saad El-Din, was a respected leftist economist. Both men were imprisoned several times because of their politics.</p> <p>So it is perhaps unsurprising that Abdalla\u2019s filmography reads like a guide to the 21st century\u2019s geopolitical crises: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/111619/united.93\">United 93</a> (9/11), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121902/kite-runner\">The Kite Runner</a> (the Afghan war), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/133271/green-zone\">Green Zone</a> (the Iraq war), and The Square (the Egyptian revolution). His next project, out in 2017, is a documentary called <a href=\"http://chickeneggpics.org/film/the-vote/\">The Vote</a>, about the first Egyptian election after Mubarak\u2019s fall, co-directed by his sister, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFeI1mrfTW8\">Hanan</a>, and his wife, Cressida Trew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1516a72b08262512b0efbb6563444fce18feea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1516a72b08262512b0efbb6563444fce18feea4/0_171_3296_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Greengrass ( left) and Khalid Abdalla (right) on set on United 93.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Greengrass ( left) and Khalid Abdalla (right) on set of the film United 93.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI started my career not seeing my colour,\u201d says Abdalla. \u201cBut I graduated from university in 2003, right after the war in Iraq started and while I was there, 9/11 happened. And the films have asked me the question: am I willing to live up to the responsibilities they put in front of me? The last 10 years has been me going into Hollywood cinema, playing Arab roles. I had a right to do that but I don\u2019t feel I had a right to make a career of it without living in the Arab world and without struggling in Arab cinema.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla\u2019s recent return to London sees him taking on a new but happier responsibility \u2013 fatherhood. His son Nawar\u2019s name means one who brings light. \u201cWe certainly need it,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy I have a child now. I feel freed by it.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the actor will return to Cairo in this month, staying until just before Christmas. \u201cThen in January we work out what to do afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve understood that there has to be a lifetime of living in both places. I can\u2019t leave Egypt and I can\u2019t leave here. Part of that struggle is the arc of my family and I don\u2019t want to burden my child with it.\u201d</p> <p>What hope does he have now for a democratic Egypt to emerge from the remains of the revolution? \u201cThe situation right now is horrendous \u2013 economically, politically, socially,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to go from worse to worse or whether there\u2019s another watershed moment that no one will easily put their faith in. Everything\u2019s closing down. But we\u2019re going to try to salvage as much as we can. I feel the need to live for that whatever the cost.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/in-the-last-days-of-the-city-review-berlin-film-festival-1201705591/\">In the Last Days of the City</a> will be screened <a href=\"https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/film-africa-last-days-city-akher-ayam-el-madina-qa\">on 5 November at the ICA</a>, London, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/film-africa\">Film Africa</a> festival.

The first, <strong>Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier</strong> (BBC2), set out to explore some of the conspiracy theories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> has deployed over the course of his campaign.</p> <p>One could argue that in these dark times we have great need for programming dedicated to debunking conspiracy theories, but nobody who believes the moon landings were faked is going to be swayed by anything as straightforward as evidence.</p> <p>Conspiracy Files went one better \u2013 shedding light on the motivations of the theorists themselves. Somewhere behind all the paranoiacs and numbskulls are a group of people \u2013 for lack of a better term, let\u2019s call them bad guys \u2013 who propound and promulgate conspiracy theories for their own ends. People for whom facts are an inconvenience. People like Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump rose to political prominence as a leading light of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/28/birther-movement-obama-citizenship\" title=\"\">birther movement</a>, a long and thoroughly disreputable campaign to de-legitimise America\u2019s first black president by insinuating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> wasn\u2019t born in the US. Though he had nothing to add to the theory beyond publicity, he stubbornly maintained its validity until it stopped helping him, at which point he unceremoniously abandoned it.</p> <p>One wonders how such disloyalty is viewed by hardcore birthers. Moldovan dentist <a href=\"http://www.orlytaitzesq.com/\" title=\"\">Orly Taitz</a> thinks Obama\u2019s birth certificate is an anachronistic forgery, because it lists Obama\u2019s father as \u201cAfrican\u201d instead of \u201cNegro\u201d. She seems to view this as a cover-up undone by political correctness gone mad.</p> <p>\u201cThis is so bad, it\u2019s like it\u2019s done by a retarded five-year-old,\u201d she says. You hear this a lot in conspiracy theorist circles: the people who secretly perpetrated the biggest fraud in history are total morons. Later on, a handwriting expert who claims a suicide note written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/may/23/campaign-president-2016-live-updates-trump-clinton-sanders-polling\" title=\"\">Vince Foster</a> (the Clinton associate who killed himself in 1993) was fake derided it as \u201camateurish, sloppy; I\u2019ve seen better by kids\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout his campaign, Trump has been aided, directly or indirectly, by people who have, at best, a tangential relationship to the truth. There is Trump adviser and former Nixon dirty trickster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim\" title=\"\">Roger Stone</a>, for whom \u201cHistory is a set of lies agreed upon\u201d is a motto. There\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/29/us-press-publishing-magazines\" title=\"\">National Enquirer editor</a> who, faced with one of his own headlines, says, \u201c\u2018Ted Cruz\u2019s Father Linked to JFK Assassination\u2019 \u2013 what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d This wasn\u2019t really a documentary about the triumph of paranoia and fear, but of cynicism. We\u2019ll have to wait until Tuesday to see if it has taken charge.</p> <p>If you did fancy a documentary about the triumph of paranoia and fear, <strong>The Gun Shop: Cutting Edge</strong> (Channel&#xa0;4) fits the bill. It was, if anything, an even more disheartening look at the present state of American affairs. Focusing on the staff and customers of a single premises in Battle Creek, Michigan, The Gun Shop was almost entirely populated by people who believe the solution to America\u2019s gun epidemic is way more guns.</p> <p>Freedom Firearms sells weapons, operates a shooting range and offers tuition. The proprietor tracks the popularity of guns by \u201chow many people take part in my concealed carry class\u201d. Here he schools people in the \u201c21 foot rule\u201d: apparently if someone within that range fancies stabbing you, you won\u2019t be able to draw your gun in time to save yourself. \u201cSo don\u2019t let people get too close,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His clientele were all nice people who just happened to share a worldview that was irrational, fearful and bolstered by wrongheaded slogans (\u201cAn armed society is a polite society\u201d). Folks really do respond to news of gun crime by going straight out to purchase a gun. Single mum Courtney bought a handgun because \u201cmy social media has just blown up with all the craziness that\u2019s going on in the world\u201d. Then she taught her nine-year-old son to use it.</p> <p>In the midst of this chilling portrait of everyday gun-shopping, I thought I detected some reasons to be faintly hopeful: nobody seemed consumed by hate; everybody seemed to take the responsibility of gun-ownership seriously, even if they didn\u2019t seem to give much consideration to the idea of killing another human being; there wasn\u2019t much in the way of right-to-bear-arms pontificating. But I gave in to despair as the shop owner walked staff through an armed robbery scenario. He wasn\u2019t so worried about the 21ft rule. \u201cI\u2019ve got other employees who\u2019re gonna smoke him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be in a circular firing&#xa0;squad.\u201d</p> <p>The notion of a circular firing squad is about as apt a metaphor for the US\u2019s relationship with guns as I\u2019ve heard, and it\u2019s not remotely encouraging.</p>",

  "<p>South Korean president Park Geun-hye\u2019s has made a tearful apology for her role in a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d political scandal that has engulfed her administration \u2013 but it has failed to mollify opposition parties.<br></p> <p>In a televised address on Friday, Park said she would cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation into allegations that she allowed Choi Soon-sil, a friend of 40 years, to influence government policies on everything from the economy to North Korea.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/south-korea-rasputin-like-friend-president-park-geun-hye-returns\">The scandal has rocked South Korean society</a> and sent Park\u2019s approval rating to just 5%, according to a Gallup poll released on Friday - the lowest for any leader in the country\u2019s 68-year history.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/nov/02/south-korea-explainer-park-guen-hye-six-key-points-scandal-choi-soon-sil\">South Korea scandal explained: six key points on the cronyism claims engulfing the president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But soon after Park\u2019s apology \u2013 her second in 10 days \u2013 the leader of South Korea\u2019s main opposition party accused her of \u201cinsincerity\u201d and of desperately clinging to power.</p> <p>\u201cShe does not seem to understand the gravity of the whole situation,\u201d said Choo Mi-ae, leader of Democratic Party of Korea. \u201cShe is only interested in maintaining her grip on power.</p> <p>\u201cThe president should remove her hands from state affairs.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, in a brief televised address to journalists, Park said that prosecutors should clarify what happened and that everyone involved, including herself, should be held accountable and take responsibility if found guilty.</p> <p>It is not clear what action could be taken against Park, as South Korea\u2019s constitution does not allow a sitting president to be prosecuted.</p> <p>\u201cThese latest developments are all my fault and were caused by my carelessness,\u201d she said, adding that she had \u201callowed my guard to drop\u201d around Choi.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to forgive myself and sleep at night because of the feelings of sorrow,\u201d Park said, her voice trembling.</p> <p>Choi is alleged to have used her closeness to the president to meddle in state affairs, and her lawyer has said he expects prosecutors to look into whether she inappropriately received classified documents. Choi has also been accused of using her ties to Park to benefit unlawfully from two non-profit organisations.</p> <p> \u201cIt is very miserable and regrettable that a particular individual is said to have taken profits and committed several unlawful acts, while we are working on a job in hopes of helping the national economy and people\u2019s lives,\u201d Park said, referring to Choi.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/choi-soon-sil-arrested-made-in-south-korean-presidential-cronyism-scandal\"> Choi has been in custody since Monday.</a></p> <p>However, Park denied some of the more lurid rumours surrounding the scandal - including reports that she had fallen into a religious cult and conducted shamanist rituals in the presidential Blue House.</p> <p>The scandal has triggered a media frenzy with fresh reports \u2013 many of them highly speculative and unsubstantiated \u2013 emerging every day, tying Choi and some of her extended family members to more alleged malpractices.</p> <p>Some reports have also suggested that Choi was still involved in marginal religious group created by her father and that Park had fallen under its influence.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been claims that I fell for a religious cult or had (shamanist rituals) performed in the Blue House, but I would like to clarify that those are absolutely not true,\u201d Park said in her address.</p> <p>Opposition parties have stepped up their criticism of Park, who has just over a year of her term to run, but have stopped short of calling for her resignation. That would trigger an early presidential election that they would not be confident of winning.</p> <p>Park has tried to defuse the crisis by firing eight presidential aides and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/new-south-korea-pm-appointed-as-cronyism-scandal-widens\">nominating three new top cabinet officials</a>, including the prime minister, in an effort to regain public confidence.</p> <p>But South Korean media reports said that if her choice of prime minister, Kim Byong-joon, is rejected and she is forced to name someone chosen by the opposition, she will effectively become a lame duck president.</p> <p>At best, Park will limp on to the end of her term with her power severely undermined at a time of slowing economic growth, rising unemployment and tensions with North Korea.</p>",
  "<p>There is a specter haunting Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat at the Public Theater. That specter is Donald Trump.</p> <p>Sweat, which debuted in the summer of 2015, was written well before his candidacy was declared and is set in 2000 and 2008. Yet it feels astonishingly prescient. Incisive, uncondescending and quietly compassionate, Sweat explores how the decline of industry and the crippling of unions goads the manufacturing class into racist and anti-immigrant positions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/02/notes-from-the-field-anna-deavere-smith\">Notes from the Field review \u2013 a one-woman study of incarceration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The play, directed by Kate Whoriskey, is set in Reading, Pennsylvania, a city that the 2011 census identified as the poorest in America. It begins in 2008, when two young men, Chris (Khris Davis) and Jason (Will Pullen), just released from prison, are trying to reintegrate into a community that has less and less to offer them. Their past crime is unspecified, but as Chris says: \u201cWhat we did was unforgivable.\u201d</p> <p>The action then reverses to 2000. Jason\u2019s mother Tracey (Johanna Day), Chris\u2019s mother Cynthia (Michelle Wilson) and their friend Jessie (Miriam Shor) are longtime workers at a factory manufacturing steel tubing. The work isn\u2019t glamorous, but these women are proud to do it. \u201cWhen I put on my jacket, I knew I\u2019d accomplished something,\u201d says Cynthia. \u201cAnd when I got my union card, you couldn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the greed of the factory owners and the relative powerlessness of the unions means that the days of fair wages and decent benefits are on the wane. Soon all that is solid melts into picket lines and unemployment checks.</p> <p>As in Ruined, her masterwork, and the excellent Intimate Apparel, Nottage allows drama to emerge through prisms of race, gender and class. She is passionate about making the political feel deeply personal and she allows her characters to explain themselves in ways that alternately attract and repel sympathies. </p> <p>In this regard, Sweat, which is attentively designed and dynamically acted, is a roughed-up jewel. Just when the situations and relationships seem settled, Nottage gives the scene a slight revolve, revealing new and complicating facets. This is a true ensemble work and one that demands and rewards a collective bargain with audience attention. Nottage may ask spectators to judge these characters, as they judge themselves, but she won\u2019t let us dismiss them.</p> <p>That said, it isn\u2019t flawless. The flash-forward mystery structure is a slight contrivance, and there\u2019s some shorthand used in determining the reasons for the economic crisis the characters face. Very occasionally the balance between dramatic action and social thesis goes wobbly. </p> <p>But more often this is a trenchant and moving play, which explains how feelings of disenfranchisement can make reasonable people act immoderately and unjustly. Nottage couldn\u2019t have predicted how topical the play would become or how disturbingly certain lines would resonate, as when Cynthia, revealing the friction between management and labor, announces: \u201cNow you know. The vote\u2019s coming! Decide!\u201d</p>",
