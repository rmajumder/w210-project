  "<p>A federal judge in New York has ordered counsel for Donald Trump and the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to appear in court along with the attorney for a woman referred to only as \u201cJane Doe\u201d who alleges the Republican presidential nominee raped her when she was 13.<br></p> <p>Judge Ronnie Abrams has slated an initial status conference in the civil lawsuit for 16 December in a New York district court. </p> <p>The order raises the extraordinary prospect, were Trump to win the 8 November battle for the White House, of counsel for a US president-elect being called into federal court in proceedings relating to allegations of rape of an underage girl.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Will Hillary Clinton lose the US election because of the FBI email investigation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has vociferously denied the accusations, dismissing them as fabrications and slamming the lawsuit as a sham designed to smear him as he runs for highest office. Epstein, an associate of the UK\u2019s Prince Andrew, was convicted of underage sex crimes in Florida in 2008 and has also denied the allegations.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuits-norm-lubow\">Guardian investigation</a> this summer found that the lawsuit appeared to have been coordinated by a former producer on the Jerry Springer TV show who has been associated in the past with a range of disputed claims involving celebrities including OJ Simpson and Kurt Cobain. A publicist acting for \u201cJane Doe\u201d also attempted to sell a video in which the woman describes her allegations against Trump to media outlets at a $1m price tag.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/326770514/Judge-Status-Conference-Order-Jane-Doe-V-Trump#download&amp;from_embed\">court order</a> gives no details of the legal complaint raised by \u201cJane Doe\u201d. It instructs all parties to the case to set out in advance the nature of the allegations and the \u201cprincipal defenses\u201d, as well as any previous motions and discovery as well as the \u201cestimated length of trial\u201d.</p> <p>The original federal lawsuit, filed in June, alleged that \u201cJane Doe\u201d was sexually assaulted by Trump in 1994 at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan home. Further claims were made that the real estate billionaire raped the then teenager at parties hosted by Epstein on the Upper East Side.</p> <p>The Guardian investigation found that a publicist calling himself \u201cAl Taylor\u201d attempted to sell the videotape of \u201cJane Doe\u201d relating her allegations for $1m. It linked Taylor through a variety of means including shared email addresses and phone numbers to Norm Lubow, who used to work on Springer\u2019s daytime talk show.</p> <p>Lubow was connected to a contentious claim, raised in the 1998 documentary movie Kurt and Courtney, that Courtney Love offered a fellow musician $50,000 to murder her husband, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. Love denied the charge.</p> <p>According to the New York Post, Lubow was also behind a tabloid newspaper story that OJ Simpson bought illicit drugs on the day his estranged wife Nicole Brown was killed.</p> <p>When the Guardian quizzed \u201cAl Taylor\u201d about his true identity, the publicist replied: \u201cJust be warned, we\u2019ll sue you if we don\u2019t like what you write. We\u2019ll sue your ass, own your ass and own your newspaper\u2019s ass as well, punk.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump presidential campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the forthcoming court proceedings. A lawyer for the Trump Organization told the Guardian in July: \u201cThis is basically a sham lawsuit brought by someone who desires to impact the presidential election.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to increase rates in September was a close call, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160921.htm\">the minutes released</a> on Wednesday show. When the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged\">met in September</a>, three of the 12 members voted in favor of increasing interest rates as the US labor market continued to improve at a slower rate and the risks from Brexit, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, eased. Some members indicated that a rate hike might be appropriate \u201crelatively soon\u201d. </p> <p>Up until September, Kansas City Fed president Esther George was the lone voice in favor of raising interest rates. Last month, she was joined by Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester and Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren in her call to increase the target range to 0.50%-0.75%. The current range is 0.25%-0.50%, after it was increased last December for the first time in nearly a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>The FOMC \u2013 which is the policy setting arm of the US central bank \u2013 noted that the case for increasing interest rates has strengthened recently. After last year\u2019s increase, the Fed was initially expected to hike rates four more times in 2016. With six FOMC meetings having come and gone, that forecast has now been revised down to just one rate hike.

So there\u2019s a political significance to this, which may determine the outcome.</p> <p>[Background: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-29/hollande-says-brexit-to-hurt-city-of-london-in-clearing-warning\">French president Francois Hollande said in June that the UK won\u2019t be able to keep its euro clearing business after Brexit</a>].</p> <p><strong>But on the technical issue -- euro clearing relates to the process by which banks clear complex derivative contracts priced in euros.</strong></p> <p>He explains that after the 2008 financial crisis, regulators insisted that derivatives contracts are cleared centrally, so that they could see the state of play, and if any firms are getting in trouble.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You avoid what happened in the financial crisis, where as the prices of assets move quickly, counter-parties make margin calls on other counter-parties, and the situation deteriorates quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe says he was at the G20 meeting in Pittsburg when regulators decided to do this, and it was the right thing. </p> <p><strong>But it needs central clearing, so you can net the risks.</strong><br></p> <p>In other words, financial firms can \u2018net\u2019 off their margin calls, balancing contracts where are up, or down, and only post the balance. That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u2019t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance.</p> <p>Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in.</p> <p>Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example).</p> <p>It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up.</p> <p>And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can understand the politics around this, but we\u2019re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure.</p> <p>If we\u2019re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So are you saying that it\u2019s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision?</em></p> <p>I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:24:49.798Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fe04bde4b01d9dd2c90200\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T09:50:41.496Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cunliffe: City jobs could move to New York after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street, in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street, in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues.</strong><br></p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u2019s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals.</p> <p>The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u2019t simply be copied.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t see London\u2019s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services and other services.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u2018transaction chain\u2019 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer.</p> <p>You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>And in New York, that already happens.

It has been a rather odd occasion - not a debate about Brexit, but a debate about how parliament debates Brexit - but given that we now live in world where the pound can rally following the publication of government amendments to opposition day motions (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266#block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266\">11.50am)</a>, these procedural wrangles matter.</p> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to approve a motion with cross-party support saying the Commons must have a \u201cfull and transparent\u201d debate on the government\u2019s plans for Brexit before article 50 is invoked, but ministers are refusing to commit themselves to giving parliament an actual vote on the matter. </strong><strong>Theresa May</strong> made this clear at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2#block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2\">12.36pm)</a> and<strong> David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, would not promise a substantive vote either in his speech at the start of the debate. It may well be the case that eventually MPs do get a vote, but any vote on a substantive motion would constrain the government, and also allow the possibility of Tory MPs rebelling with Labour, and May seems determined to resist it if at all possible. In his impressive debut as shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer</strong> confimed that Labour was not explicitly demanding a vote in its motion because it wanted to maximise the chances of MPs voting for it tonight. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910#block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910\">1.37pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Davis has played down suggestions that the government will publish a white paper or a green paper on Brexit. </strong>When it was put to him that a fellow minister, George Eustice, said a Brexit white paper was likely to be published, Davis dismissed the idea. Later he seemed to hint that one could be published.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I should also tell the House ... I have asked the chief whip to ensure we have a series of debates so that the House can air its views. And it would be again very surprising if we had those debates without presenting to the House something for them to debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a source in the department for Brexit said that Davis was not intending to suggest that policy papers would be published before the debates. Davis was just referring to the fact that ministers would keep MPs updated, the source said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Conservative former minister has accused the government of pursuing a Brexit policy driven by ideology, not national interest.</strong> In a question to Davis <strong>Claire Perry, </strong>the former transport minister, said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am extremely concerned by what has happened to sterling and what has happened to interest rates since the prime minister\u2019s comments at the conference last week. And I think the problem [David Davis] is not acknowledging is that many people in the country do not think that there is a policy to put the national interest first. They think there is a policy to put people\u2019s narrow ideological interests first. And what we should be setting out is quite clearly how we are going to protect British jobs and businesses and put ideology in the past where it belongs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis rejected this claim.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has withdrawn a claim he made on Monday that Starmer is a second-rate lawyer.</strong> He said he was being \u201cclumsy\u201d and that his comment was not intended to apply to Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can I unreservedly withdraw allegations that I made on Monday, only on the basis that it was clumsy, it was not meant about you, it was meant about advice. I don\u2019t doubt for one moment your capabilities as a lawyer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer said he considered the matter closed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m grateful for that and I can assure you and the House that I wasn\u2019t in the slightest bit concerned. I consider the matter closed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to confirm that powers over fishing and agriculture currently exercised by Brussels would currently devolve to the Scottish parliament. </strong>These were matters that would have to be discussed with Edinburgh, he said. <strong>Alex Salmond</strong>, the former Scottish first minister, said that under current law these matters would automatically get devolved to Scotland, regardless of what Davis said, unless the devolution arrangements were changed. He told Davis:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Agriculture and fisheries are not reserved, therefore they are devolved. Unless the government intends to change that position it\u2019ll be automatic that agriculture and fisheries powers go to the Scottish government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an area where we have not addressed or talked to the devolved administration at all yet.

He says the pound was heading south because no one has an idea what the government will put in place. The government has no plan for Brexit, and no strategy. The jobs and income of people are at stake. May says she will not give a running commentary. But she cannot run away from this.</p> <p>May says she is optimistic about Britain\u2019s prospects after Brexit. Labour did not want a referendum, she says. The Tories gave them one. Labour did not like the result. The Tories are delivering. And Emily Thornberry wants a second vote, she says. But Labour MPs should have learnt the lesson; if you ask the same question, you get the same reply. </p> <p>(That\u2019s a reference to the Labour leadership contest.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fe19c5e4b01d9dd2c9028c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T11:11:46.273Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says some Tories said Brexit would generate \u00a3350m a week for the NHS.

Is access to the single market a priority?</p> <p>May says she wants the best deal for the UK, including maximum possible access to the single market. But she is also clear that the vote to leave the EU was a vote to get control of immigration.</p> <p>Corbyn says May said leaving the single market would damage trade before she became PM. He says 140,000 people in the UK work for Japanese companies. What reassurance can May give to workers worried about their jobs?</p> <p>May says the Japanese firm SoftBank invested in ARM after the referendum.

But the home secretary wants to name and shame firms that employ foreigners.</p> <p>May congratulates Corbyn on his leadership victory. She says there was no plan to name and shame firms, or to publish lists of workers. But the government will consult on collecting data to ensure it is tackling skills shortages.</p> <p>Corbyn says he is grateful to all those that voted for him to become leader of his party. There were rather more than who voted for May. May is slightly unaware of what is going on. The home secretary said firms would be named and shamed. Then the government said the data would just be retained. Yesterday we learned pregnant women would not get ultrasound at a hospital without photo ID. Are these the actions of a country where it does not matter where you were born.</p> <p>May says if the NHS is providing services, people should be eligible.

In it they said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you are able to provide satisfactory answers to all these questions, just one per day from tomorrow until 31 March next year, it might give some confidence that the government is entering the Article 50 negotiations with a clear plan.</p> <p>If not, it will reinforce the sense that the government is instead blundering into this process without a clear endgame in mind, repeating exactly the same mistake that the previous Prime Minister made with his \u2018renegotiation\u2019 of Britain\u2019s EU membership last year: working to an artificial, self-imposed timetable; with a flawed Plan A of what he wanted to achieve; and no Plan B whatsoever.</p> <p>Given you have consistently spoken up throughout your career in a highly principled way about the importance of Parliamentary sovereignty, we hope you will reflect again on the decision to deny the country\u2019s elected representatives the opportunity to debate and vote on the Government\u2019s plan for Brexit before Article 50 is triggered.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to the letter a Conservative spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are aiming to deliver the right deal for the United Kingdom and return control over all the decisions that affect people\u2019s lives to the sovereign institutions of this country.</p> <p>That\u2019s what people voted for on June 23.

In reality, it it probably more a matter of establishing a temporary, tactical advantage, but an opposition is entitled to boast about its gains whenever it gets them.</p> <p>The key point is that Theresa May has compromised to avoid the risk of a Tory revolt over giving the Commons a say on Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s an opposition day in the Commons (meaning Labour gets the choose the motion for debate) and the party decided to get MPs to vote on whether the Commons should be consulted on the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating strategy. Here is the motion that it has tabled, which is also backed by the Lib Dems.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That this House recognises that leaving the EU is the defining issue facing the UK; believes that there should be a full and transparent debate on the Government\u2019s plan for leaving the EU; and calls on the Prime Minister to ensure that this House is able properly to scrutinise that plan for leaving the EU before Article 50 is invoked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Tory MPs also feel strongly that the Commons must have a say over Brexit (for reasons set out in the chamber on Monday) and, if there were a straightforward yes/no vote on whether the Commons should be consulted, Tory rebels could unite with the opposition to defeat the government. Theresa May wants to ensure the government has the final say.</p> <p>But May is not asking Tory MPs to reject the Labour motion outright (which is what normally happens when MPs debate an opposition day motion). Instead the government has tabled an amendment saying what Labour proposes is fine, so long as the government\u2019s negotiating position is maintained. The amendment reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At end add \u2018; and believes that the process should be undertaken in such a way that respects the decision of the people of the UK when they voted to leave the EU on 23 June and does not undermine the negotiating position of the government as negotiations are entered into which will take place after article 50 has been triggered.\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tory MPs will be asked to vote for this amendment, before the Commons votes on the main motions. Tory MPs who feel very strongly about parliamentary scrutiny, the \u201crebels\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">like Stephen Phillips</a>, may choose not to back the amendment, on the grounds that it is an attempt to neuter the demand for scrutiny, but that that won\u2019t look like much of a rebellion. And then the motion as a whole will get passed, probably with the amendment attached.<br></p> <p>That means effectively that May has conceded that there must be a \u201cfull and transparent debate\u201d in the Commons on the government\u2019s Brexit plan, before article 50 is invoked. <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, said last night this was \u201ca real victory for \u201cparliament and will help ensure there is proper democratic grip of the Brexit process.\u201d</p> <p>But the Labour motion mentions a debate but not a vote. On the Today programme <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, said that it implied a vote. But ministers will be able to say that they have not agreed to let the Commons vote on, for example, whether remaining a member of the single market must be a priority. If Labour could get May to concede that, then that really would count as a huge victory.</p> <p>I will be covering this issue, and the debate, in full during the day.</p> <p>Here is the agenda.<br></p> <p><em>9am:</em> Justine Greening, the education secretary, gives a speech to the Fawcett Society gender pay conference.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative chairman, and Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee on women in the Commons after the 2020 election.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives a speech on HS2.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England deputy governor, gives evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit. </p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Senior police figures, including Stephen Rodhouse, deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, give evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate on parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process.</p> <p>I will be mostly focusing on Brexit today but, as usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<p>In a fitting turn of events, the outcome of the 2016 election may now rest with a reality television mogul. Mark Burnett, British-born, is one of the most recognizable names in the business, having created both Shark Tank and the genre-defining Survivor. He\u2019s also the mastermind behind The Apprentice, the NBC show where contestants vie for Donald Trump\u2019s approval.</p> <p>According to a former Apprentice producer, \u201cthere are far worse\u201d <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/ex-apprentice-producer-far-worse-trump-tapes-exist.html\">outtakes</a> from the show than the damning 2005 Access Hollywood clip that surfaced last week, in which Trump brags to host Billy Bush about kissing women and grabbing them \u201cby the pussy\u201d sans consent. In other words, assault.</p> <p>Of course, strict legal red tape binds Burnett\u2019s ability to simply release the footage, including a rumored $5m fine. A statement from his production company \u2013 owned by MGM \u2013 also cast doubt on whether Burnett himself has physical access to the clips, claiming he \u201cdoes not have the ability nor the right to release footage or other material from The Apprentice\u201d. In what might be the worst possible scenario, the tapes could belong to Trump himself.</p> <p>If Burnett legitimately has no access to the tapes, then he can\u2019t be held responsible for not publicizing them. But if they are indeed bad for Trump, and if there\u2019s any way at all for him to get them out to the press, it is \u2013 as civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred and many others have <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/12/donald-trump-apprentice-gloria-allred/\">argued</a> \u2013 \u201cin the public interest\u201d to do so.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s holding Burnett back, insiders explain, is nothing more than the keen business acumen, airtight contractual arrangements and salesmanship that have propelled him to the top of his profession,\u201d Politico reports. Mind, Burnett is worth $450m, a fortune built in no small part off of Trump\u2019s celebrity. For a man that has made millions off of the GOP candidate\u2019s rise to prominence, handing the tapes over the public is quite literally the least he could do. Neglecting that responsibility would display the same kind of selfish thinking that plagues Trump and the rest of the 1%: ranking personal success above collective ruin.</p> <p>White British immigrants like Burnett, of course, will be some of the best off should Trump come to power. He\u2019s threatened to round up and deport some 11 million undocumented immigrants, and called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on\u201d. What started as a joke could be a painful reality for millions, ripping families apart and criminalizing whole swaths of the population, people of color in particular. If he wants a preview for what these policies might look like in action, he needs only look towards home. Conservative prime minister Theresa May and her cabinet have <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/151334637685/rudd-speech-to-conservative-party-conference-2016\">promised</a> to reduce migration by \u201ctens of thousands\u201d in Britain, punishing those who provide housing and banking services to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>Depending on what happens on 8 November, May might find herself with an ally across the Atlantic. Though the Access Hollywood clips have put a bigger dent in Trump\u2019s chances than any scandal yet, his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trump-getting-thumped-in-post-tape-gate-polls.html\">nine point lag</a> could still shrink before election day.</p> <p>If Trump does win, he\u2019ll have Burnett to thank. NBC public relations head Jim Dowd <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/08/donald-trump-the-apprentice-burnett/\">called</a> The Apprentice and its ratings success \u201cthe bridge to the campaign,\u201d winning Trump an audience in middle America that the real estate mogul had never before reached. Before the show, Trump admits in his 2011 book Time to Get Tough, most people \u201cthought I was a barbarian\u201d.</p> <p>Reality television molded Trump into the ratings and polls-obsessed performer that we know today, and created a new generation of Americans ready to be entertained by him. The GOP \u2013 with its decades-running vendetta against women of people of color \u2013 allowed him to step right into the party\u2019s candidacy, swapping over 40 years of dog-whistle politics for an attack hound bent on going after those already on the losing end of Republican policies.</p> <p>Burnett helped create Donald Trump \u2013 the man, the myth and the legend, all neatly wrapped into one leathery package. It\u2019s only right that he chips in to help bring him down.</p>",

But they were already at war with Saddam Hussein, having just defeated him in Kuwait. Saddam was on his own internationally, despised and isolated. He had no support from Russia or any Arab allies. The last thing he wanted was to confront the US any further. Enforcing a no-fly zone (even though it had no clear UN security council authorisation) involved no risk to the US or UK. Saddam made little effort to resist and not one of their manned aircraft was shot down.</p> <p>Today\u2019s situation in Syria is different. The Syrian air force is fully engaged and will not back down in its campaign to defeat its enemies in Aleppo. After three years of military stalemate, Bashar al-Assad feels he has regained the upper hand and is determined to retake his country\u2019s largest city.</p> <p>More importantly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\" title=\"\">the Russians are also active in the air</a>. Imposing a no-fly zone unilaterally (it would never gain a security council mandate) would be a declaration of war on Russia as well as on Assad. The dangers are obvious. It is not just a question of a clash between western and Russian planes by accident. That might be the only risk if it was assumed the Russians would meekly leave the skies free. Why would they? They are not going to be deterred from a bombing campaign that appears to be helping Assad\u2019s ground forces advance. For the west to confront them risks an incalculably serious war.</p> <p>Many on the jihadi side would like nothing more than to see the two Satans \u2013 the west and Russia \u2013 destroying each other in a hot war. But for Britain and the US it is madness. Hillary Clinton seemed to recognise that in a speech to corporate donors, according to the latest Wikileaks release. \u201cAll of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and Nato involvement where you take [out] a lot of civilians\u201d, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The second option is for Syrian government forces to retake the whole city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are only three sensible ways to save Aleppo\u2019s people. One is the voluntary departure of the jihadis who, in the words of UN envoy <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/wrong-un-s-syria-envoy-offer-aleppo-18894725\" title=\"\">Staffan de Mistura</a>, are holding civilians hostage. One could go further and say they are keeping eastern Aleppo\u2019s civilians as human shields. Why, for example, have most people not left already, given the intensity of Russian bombing: is it that the jihadis are blocking people\u2019s escape? Syria is also mired in a propaganda war, and in the heart-rending images that the rebels put out on social media about life and death in Aleppo, the seamier side of the armed groups\u2019 control is suppressed.</p> <p>Hundreds of civilians recently left the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-daraya-idUSKCN1111FE?il=0\" title=\"\">besieged Damascus suburb of Daraya</a> after the rebels gave in, with no reprisals from Assad forces. Gunmen were even allowed to keep their weapons and were taken by buses to rebel-held areas in the north.</p> <p>The second option is for Syrian government forces to retake the whole city, just as Iraqi forces retook jihadi-held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/iraq-declares-ramadi-liberated-from-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Ramadi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/iraqi-forces-enter-fallujah-in-attempt-to-drive-out-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Falluja</a> in recent months. Iraqi barrel bombs and US airstrikes had left three-quarters of those cities in ruins, but civilians got the chance to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>The concept of an Assad victory will stick in the throats of hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have lost so much in the fight against him. But if the secular multicultural tolerance of pre-war Syria is to be restored, it is better to deny victory to the Sunni extremists who pose the main opposition to Assad, whether it is Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\" title=\"\"> Jabhat al-Nusra</a> or similar groups.</p> <p>The third option is a ceasefire. Last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/10/syria-ceasefire-deal-tentative-negotiate-kerry-lavrov-us-russia\" title=\"\">Russian-US agreement</a> provided for the superpowers to separate the al-Nusra fighters from those Syrian Islamists prepared to negotiate with Assad\u2019s representatives in Geneva for a coalition government.</p> <p>The ceasefire never took hold because the Islamists refused to split. Al-Nusra understandably did not want to be isolated and left vulnerable to a joint US-Russian air campaign. So they used their dominance among the Aleppo fighters to press the other groups to stick with them. For their part, the non-Nusra fighters feared an alliance between the Americans, the Russians and Assad\u2019s army.</p> <p>Having failed once, for the Russians and Americans to broker a new ceasefire is a tall order. The other options are equally difficult. But at least they tend towards de-escalation. Proposing a no-fly zone not only risks greater catastrophe for the people of Aleppo. It threatens to engulf us all.</p>",

  "<p>Utah is an important state in this election.

The accounts suggest he may never make a profit on either resort, although the Trump family insist Turnberry will return to profitability in the short to medium term.</p> <p>There is also an apparent discrepancy between the accounts and his filings last year to the US Federal Election Commission (FEC), the regulator which controls election spending. </p> <p>In his attempt to create a global portfolio of world-class golf resorts, the Republican presidential candidate had invested \u00a362.7m in buying and refurbishing the Open championship resort at Turnberry on the coast of south-west Scotland, between acquiring it in April 2014 and the end of 2015. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072426cdcdc1f813cc59c6a2ddbf9c76deb7c734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072426cdcdc1f813cc59c6a2ddbf9c76deb7c734/255_119_693_545/500.png\" alt=\"Location of Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The locations of Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mapbox, OpenStreetMap</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, his losses at his golf course and boutique hotel at Balmedie, north of Aberdeen, which he once claimed would be \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d and where he plans to build 2,750 homes and holiday flats, also continue to mushroom. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal loans to Trump International Golf Course Ltd (TIGCS), which has owned the Aberdeenshire estate where the resort is being built since 2006, increased by \u00a32.6m last year. <br></p> <p>That took his total investment there to \u00a339.4m \u2013 well above the \u00a331.5m valuation he has given for the course and 19-bed hotel. That increased loan was needed to help stem cumulative operating losses totalling \u00a39.7m by the end of 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">Donald Trump faces wall of opposition as he returns to Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as avoiding corporation tax liability due to those operating losses, Trump also avoided paying any value added tax (VAT), the UK sales tax, at the Aberdeenshire course last year.</p> <p>The accounts for both companies, published this week, state that their financial viability rests on Trump\u2019s loans and his continued willingness to underwrite their losses. But neither set of accounts makes any mention of his bid to become US president and the fate of his investments were he to win the White House in November. Trump <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/30/donald-trump-blind-trust-foreign-business-deals-500398.html\">has said</a> his children would run his businesses if he is elected.</p> <p>In his filings last year to the US FEC, Trump declared that Turnberry generated income of $20.4m (\u00a316.6m today) in 2014 and the Aberdeenshire course earned him $4.4m (\u00a33.6m today). <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>His UK company accounts showed hefty losses on both resorts in that year, of \u00a31.1m at the Aberdeenshire course and \u00a33.6m at Turnberry. Last year\u2019s operating losses at Turnberry were \u00a38.4m. Trump lost a further \u00a32m in dollar-to-sterling currency exchanges, bringing total losses for Trump to \u00a310.5m last year. In 2014, he reports losing \u00a33.1m in currency transactions at Turnberry, bringing his total losses to \u00a36.7m in 2014. The result was an overall loss of \u00a326m.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Turnberry accounts state: \u201cThe group is dependent on continuing finance being made available by its ultimate owner to enable it to continue operating and to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\u201d The Aberdeenshire course accounts use almost identical wording.</p> <p>When he bought Turnberry, a world-famous links course with striking sea views on the coast of Ayrshire, in 2014, Trump boasted he would spend \u00a3200m on refurbishing the resort, to make it one of the world\u2019s most prestigious and attract Open championship tournaments. However, his new company accounts cast doubt on that spending claim.</p> <p>That work appeared to have been completed in June this year, when he officially reopened the 149-room five star hotel, complete with a new opulent ballroom, a \u00a33,500-a-night presidential suite and entrance-way fountain, and the newly extended and reorganised Ailsa golf course.</p> <p>But his company accounts show that by 31 December 2015, he had spent only \u00a362m on buying the resort, its running costs, and the upgrade and course reorganisation. </p> <p>The accounts show that his New York-based trust, the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, loaned his Turnberry holding company, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, \u00a342m in 2014 and \u00a321m in 2015. </p> <p>Of that, he is reported to have spent \u00a335m buying the business, implying that in order to meet his pledged refurbishment investment of \u00a3200m he needed to spend a further \u00a3138m in the first six months of this year. The accounts show that this investment only increased the value of Turnberry\u2019s physical assets by \u00a314.4m by the end of last year.</p> <p>He flew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">into Turnberry in June</a> on his own Trump-branded Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, and the accounts show the 12-seater aircraft was put on Turnberry\u2019s books in 2014 after he moved it from Florida to be permanently based in Scotland.</p> <p>His accounts show the aircraft was bought for just over \u00a31m, by transferring shares from Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd to his Delaware-registered firm DT Connect LLC, which had previously operated the Sikorsky from Palm Beach, Florida. However, the accounts also show the Scottish company valued the aircraft at just \u00a3269,000.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump\u2019s executives in the UK point out that both courses employ significant numbers of people \u2013 there are 337 on Turnberry\u2019s staff, earning a total of \u00a35.6m last year, and 95 in Aberdeenshire, earning \u00a32m in 2015. Trump has also spent tens of millions of pounds on local contractors. That spending has added to the Scottish economy.</p> <p>Turnover at both resorts rose last year. Despite the resort\u2019s closure for refurbishments in October last year, Turnberry\u2019s turnover increased by \u00a32.2m to \u00a311.4m in 2015 while the Aberdeenshire course turnover rose by a more modest amount, from \u00a32.8m to \u00a33m. Even so, the operating losses for TIGCS were close to \u00a31.1m, just a bit lower than its similar losses in 2014.</p> <p>In addition to using the continuing losses to avoid paying company tax at both resorts, the accounts show that he has other assets which would allow him to defer corporation tax if they became profitable in future. </p> <p>The accounts for Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd state he also has a potential deferred tax asset of \u00a37.9m but that asset is not recognised in the accounts \u201cas there is no certainty of taxable profits in the future\u201d. The Aberdeenshire course has a similar deferred tax asset said to be worth \u00a31.4m.</p> <p>At the second presidential debate in St Louis, Missouri, on Sunday night, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">acknowledged</a> that he used a $916m loss reported on his 1995 income tax returns to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\">avoid paying personal federal US income taxes for years</a>. \u201cOf course I do. Of course I do \u2026 I absolutely used it,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The Trump campaign has been contacted for comment.</p>",
  "<p>The territory is marked out in red and blue <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">on two maps by statistician Nate Silver</a>. One map of the US showing what would happen if only women voted, the other if only \u201cdudes\u201d did. The lady vote would have Hillary Clinton ahead in typically safe Republican states such as Alaska, Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, South Dakota, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. She would get&#xa0;458 electoral votes, compared with Donald Trump\u2019s 80.</p> <p>The dude-only map, though, shows that Trump could win every swing state with Clinton just about clinging on to the west coast, parts of the north-east, Illinois and New Mexico. Trump would get 350 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 188.</p> <p>Thankfully, this is not a dude-only election. It is not even a Democrat v Republican election. It is an insurgency by a man (and a movement) who, in promising to reinstate America\u2019s supposedly lost greatness, will destroy the GOP establishment. They deserve it. The sudden abhorrence at Trump\u2019s description of sexual assault as banter is ludicrous. Have they ignored everything he said on women, Mexicans, Muslims and black people? The cowardice of the Republican party meant they would not challenge him for fear of damaging their own prospects. They could not care less if the collateral damage is to poor women or black communities.</p> <p>For Trump has been a long time coming: he is the embodiment of the backlash against feminism that many of us recognised in the early 90s.</p> <p>We need to understand how culture and gender intersect with the economy. Votes for Trump might not be deliberately made in the name of a gender war, but that is exactly the battle being fought. Feminism is seen as both triumphant and pass\u00e9. Both views deem it as unnecessary. This backlash has been drip fed into popular culture.</p> <p>Its radicalism was stripped away in the mid-90s by the whole Sex and the City vibe. We could have sex and shoes, if we were white and rich. Lads could be sexist pigs again. Porn became ubiquitous and post-feminists embraced it. Women no longer needed feminism, because they needed men for babies and to open jars. For this they had to be appealing before they were 30 and their eggs shrivelled up. Dating became a desperate game and men preferred women who were free. Just not too free. Men wrote books about how to get women into bed that were akin to rape manuals. But worse was to come: men started embracing their manhood, rejecting \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d or political correctness. By&#xa0;the mid-to-late 2000s, this pushback against the gains of feminism was&#xa0;in full flow.</p> <p>This was implicitly tied to recession. This&#xa0;is something that the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage understand. The right always does. The left, with its eye on class struggle, continues to miss how things play out in terms of gender. The misogyny of a Trump, or his pet tic Farage, does not exist in an economic vacuum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/1/28/7929939/net-worth-decline\" title=\"\">net worth of the bottom 60% of US households is about 14% lower than it was 30 years ago</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/11/upshot/for-the-poor-geography-is-life-and-death.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">life expectancy gap between rich and poor in the US is growing</a>. The number of single-parent families has risen rapidly. Michelle Alexander, a&#xa0;law professor, says there are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/michelle-alexander-more-black-men-in-prison-slaves-1850_n_1007368.html\" title=\"\">more black men in prison than there were slaves in 1850</a>.</p> <p>So the US and its men are in pain. So much so&#xa0;that a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/04/news/economy/america-left-behind-white-men/\" title=\"\">quarter of white blue-collar workers are&#xa0;unemployed.</a> Many are on prescription painkillers, opiates such as OxyContin. Where there is pain, there is anger. And anger kicks downwards. On to women.</p> <p>This sense of abandonment felt by blue-collar workers feeds the backlash. Britain is a very different country, but the same sense of neglect is&#xa0;there in former industrial areas.</p> <p>I remember interviewing miners who \u201cretired undefeated\u201d, as they said, and would not take the new jobs on offer to them. Their women folk did. This inflexibility, combined with real inequality, feeds exactly into a backlash against women and&#xa0;\u201cimmigrants\u201d. The fragility of the masculine identity produces this hopeless nostalgia for defined gender roles. Look around. Have women \u2013 of every ethnicity \u2013 ever had to look so uniform? Long straight hair, pouty lips, big breasts? That\u2019s just the surface; the substance remains lack of equal pay, sexual violence, attacks on abortion rights, and online abuse. As Susan Faludi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash:_The_Undeclared_War_Against_American_Women\" title=\"\">wrote way back in 1991</a> the backlash is not coherent, it&#xa0;is&#xa0;more of a countercurrent, an undertow. But it&#xa0;will drag us down</p> <p>In yoking economic insecurity to the culture war, Trump and his cohorts threaten liberal certainty. His voters may know that his misogyny is a small price to pay for the change he offers; it may, indeed, be a bonus. The running down of the welfare state, after all, has been a war on women. The war on drugs has been a war on women with more and more women in prison. The overt coupling of patriarchy with race privilege and a militarised police force is visible enough proof to&#xa0;make Trump\u2019s assertion that the American Dream is over feel true.</p> <p>So how come women are rejecting his vision and men are not? What is in it for them? \u201cWhen power is scarce, a little of it is tempting,\u201d wrote Margaret Atwood in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood\" title=\"\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a>. A little power. Trump cannot win without women. The fact he thinks that he can reveals his heart of darkness. It still beats strong.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign released a new <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tools/way-back-when/\">interactive web ad</a> on Wednesday, unveiling a shuffling timeline that allows users to compare Clinton\u2019s career to that of Republican opponent Donald Trump.</p> <p>In the timeline, Clinton\u2019s campaign pits her work as first lady, senator and secretary of state against some of Trump\u2019s more incendiary remarks and tweets.</p> <p>In 2013, the ad notes, Clinton finished her tenure as secretary of state, four years after she was confirmed.

There are so many things that make our lives more difficult and if you mix them together it is almost impossible to keep going. The best outcome is to have the referendum this year.

There were many acts of violence during the last demonstration. Bands of armed bikers rode the main streets of Maracay robbing and hurting people.

There\u2019s too much corruption and populism posing as social justice. <br></p> <p>\u201cA referendum would be a moral victory, in order to give people back the sense of living in a democracy because that\u2019s something we have lost.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party\u2019s descent into civil war has revived Democratic hopes of an improbable treble by winning the presidency, House and Senate, allowing Hillary Clinton to pursue an aggressive agenda without the obstacles that have faced Barack Obama.</p> <p>With Donald Trump\u2019s campaign at risk of imploding, there are growing signs that both parties are focusing on the battle for Congress, where Republicans have everything to lose and could find Trump dragging them underwater like a drowning man.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s apparent declaration of war against the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Republican establishment on Tuesday will have done little to soothe nerves. Republican members of Congress seeking re-election now face the perilous choice of whether to risk alienating moderates or angering Trump diehards. Some are evidently trying to have their cake and eat it.</p> <p>The Senate consists of 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats and two independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats. The House breaks down as 246 Republicans and 186 Democrats with three vacancies.</p> <p>This year was always going to be an uphill battle for Republicans in hoping to retain the Senate. Democrats are defending just 10 seats while the GOP has to hold on to 24.

Despite Democrats\u2019 best efforts to cast their opponents as the \u201cParty of Trump\u201d, few signs have pointed to the brash real estate mogul being as deadly to down-ballot candidates as they once feared.</p> <p>But last Friday\u2019s release of an 11-year-old video in which Trump boasted about sexual assault have again shaken the party to its core. As his poll numbers plunge, there are fears that independent and even some Republican voters will turn against the party, or at least stay at home on election day, potentially handing Democrats a crucial advantage. Suddenly the Senate looks in grave jeopardy and even the House could be in play again.</p> <p>Voters support Democrats over Republicans for Congress by seven percentage points, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken after the release of the tape but before Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate.</p> <p>Democrats have been looking to tie candidates to Trump for some time and are now intensifying their efforts.

He came close in a further 23 districts. Some of the most vulnerable Republicans have denounced Trump in recent days. Barbara Comstock of northern Virginia has been a longtime critic of him but Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett has thrown Trump at her on the debate stage and in commercials.</p> <p>For now, the true down-ballot impact of Trump\u2019s recent crash remains unclear. Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the non-partisan Cook Political Report, who has been closely tracking the races, said: \u201cI understand why Democrats are optimistic but that optimism isn\u2019t based on any meaningful data yet.\u201d</p> <p>Shaun Bowler, professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, had a similar assessment. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t clear \u2013 or at least not from the data that are public yet \u2013 just how much damage Trump is doing to the GOP brand,\u201d Bowler said. \u201cYes, there are lots of hardliners sticking by him regardless \u2013 it just isn\u2019t clear though whether that support will translate into a win for candidates lower down the ballot.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems likely that the wave after wave of attacks from fellow Republicans coupled with what seems to be generally regarded as Trump\u2019s poorly run campaign will depress turnout among Republicans. Which means \u2013 for some candidates \u2013 there is a problem. On the one hand they can see the blowback Ryan is experiencing, suggesting there may be costs to bailing on Trump; on the other Trump\u2019s candidacy simply may depress the number of voters who turn out. This is a harder group to talk about since it does depend on district-by-district knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Whit Ayres, a veteran political consultant and pollster for Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign, agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s really too early to assess until we\u2019ve had time to get some polling data back. I did believe that Republicans have an excellent chance to hold on to the House and a 50-50 chance to retain the Senate, both of which are more optimistic than many people\u2019s view last summer.</p> <p>\u201cThat said, we don\u2019t know the effect of the tape, the debate and Trump\u2019s pledge to essentially take the party down with him.\u201d</p> <p>In 1984, former vice-president Walter Mondale was demolished by Ronald Reagan yet Democrats gained two Senate seats.

The goal, Ryan said, was to ensure Clinton did not get a \u201cblank check\u201d with a Democratic-controlled Congress should she win. <br></p> <p>Ryan received both support and criticism from House members, some of whom warned that it was the very strategy of ostracising Trump, rather than backing him, that could cost them the House.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Trump used Twitter to fire off attacks on Ryan. Disloyal Republicans \u201care far more difficult\u201d than Clinton, he posted. \u201cThey come at you from all sides. They don\u2019t know how to win I will teach them!\u201d</p> <p>Forty Republican senators and representatives have revoked their support for Trump, with nearly 30 of those calling on him to quit the race altogether, according to a count by the Associated Press. But Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, insists that the party stands by the nominee.</p> <p>There are also signs of a shift in emphasis in the Clinton campaign, aware that control over House and Senate would present her with a historic opportunity to enact a progressive agenda that includes issues such as gun control and climate change.</p> <p>Last year, Clinton accused the other Republican candidates of maligning Muslims after Trump proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country. \u201cTheir language may be more veiled than Mr Trump\u2019s, but their ideas aren\u2019t so different,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/no-donald-trump-were-not-barring-muslims-entering-country/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=20151208feed-trump\">said</a> during a December campaign event in New Hampshire. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t come out of nowhere,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/es/post/remarks-supreme-court-and-whats-stake-2016-election/\">said</a> during a March speech at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cWhat the Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics, they are now reaping with Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d</p> <p>By May, when it was clear Clinton would win the Democratic primary, her campaign took a different tack. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe campaign does not want to connect Trump and the Republican party. They want to make Trump look even more extreme than the rank-and-file Republican Member of Congress,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/how-a-decision-in-may-changed-the-general-election\">an internal email exchange</a> between officials at the Democratic National Committee, made public by WikiLeaks as part of a huge cyber-attack, revealed.<br></p> <p>The campaign spent much of the summer months casting Trump as far beyond the pale while touting endorsements from business leaders and influential Republicans. <br></p> <p>But when the tape of Trump boasting about using his fame to prey on women was made public and the long-simmering tensions between factions of the Republican party erupted into a full-fledged civil war over the weekend, Clinton\u2019s campaign gleefully fanned the flames.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty stunning that right after the debate the speaker of the House has to come and say he\u2019s no longer going to defend Donald Trump and that each Republican member of Congress has to decide for themselves whether they\u2019re going to support the nominee,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters this week.<br></p> <p>\u201cI understand why they\u2019re doing that, but Paul Ryan and leaders of the Republican party \u2013 there was a time when they could have stopped Donald Trump. There was a time where they could\u2019ve spoken out against him. That time was the summer and obviously it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p> <p>In a signal that the campaign was not abandoning its courtship of Republicans and independent voters, Palmieri noted that the campaign launched ads featuring Republican voters backing Clinton in key battleground states, including Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Iowa. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t become the nominee of his party on his own. The leaders helped legitimise him and I think they have a lot to answer for, and I imagine voters will hold them accountable, too,\u201d Palmieri continued, singling out the Senate races in Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republican incumbents McCain and Ayotte had withdrawn their endorsements of Trump.</p> <p>On Monday, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was forced to contend with his decision to disavow Trump. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of our party,\u201d the Arizona senator said during a debate in Phoenix with his Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick. \u201cHe won the nomination fair and square. But \u2026 I have daughters. I have friends. I have so many wonderful people on my staff. They cannot be degraded and demeaned in that fashion.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Prior, communications director of Republicans\u2019 Senate Leadership Fund, remained optimistic. <br></p> <p>\u201cFrom day one, Senate Republicans have been running their races focused on the particular issues that are important in their respective states,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, they are well positioned to withstand any cross currents from the top of the ticket and, consequently, this gives Republicans a good chance at retaining the majority in the Senate.\u201d</p> <p>But Obama, arguably still the most effective messenger for Democrats, twisted the knife while campaigning for Clinton on Tuesday. <br></p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways here!\u201d Obama told voters in North Carolina. \u201cYou can\u2019t repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say, \u2018But I\u2019m still gonna endorse \u2019em to be the most powerful person on the planet!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that now you\u2019ve got people saying, \u2018Well, we strongly disapprove. We really disagree. We find those comments disgusting, but we\u2019re still endorsing him. We still think he should be president.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t make sense to me!\u201d</p>",

We were not living in the past, nor were we pretending that we were a part of the grunge movement. Songs like Keep the Faith were inspired by the LA riots, the Rodney King beating, the Berlin Wall coming down, and we were maturing as a band.

We want to see an end to that, but there are many questions about a no-fly zone that need to be looked at: Who is it there to protect? Would it lead to [President Bashar al-]Assad bombing people in the expectation that they would then move to that zone? Who would enforce that safe area?\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWhat we all know is the only real solution is a political transition and it\u2019s time Russia accepted that; that the future of Syria is a political transition to a stable Syria free of Assad.\u201d</p> <p>May\u2019s questions are a clear indication that the British and US military are unconvinced about the feasibility of a no-fly zone, given the presence of Russian airplanes in the skies above Syria.

It was May 2014 when we co-sponsored a UN security council resolution to refer those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, regardless of affiliation to the international criminal court. That was vetoed by Russia and China.\u201d</p> <p>Her remarks came as the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, claimed Vladimir Putin had cancelled a visit to Paris next week because he was too embarrassed to discuss Syria.

  "<p></p> <p>With Donald Trump\u2019s campaign still reeling from his lascivious comments about groping women on an 11-year-old tape, a growing number of GOP mega-donors and outside groups are fretting about the Republicans losing their congressional majorities, and scrambling to pour tens of millions more into ads and voter mobilization drives in tight races to stave off Democratic challengers.</p> <p>The release of Trump\u2019s remarks about assaulting women on Friday and his slash-and-burn attacks on Hillary Clinton and her husband in the second presidential debate, have fueled growing Republican worries about the Democrats taking one or both houses, say GOP donors and former members. If Clinton wins, meaning Vice-President Tim Kaine would hold the casting vote in the Senate, meaning the Democrats would only need to pick up four seats to control the upper chamber. The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/scott-walker-investigation-wisconsin-lawmakers-john-doe-papers\">Wisconsin lawmakers urge investigation of Scott Walker after 'John Doe' papers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw. On Monday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, fired another salvo at Trump by saying he would no longer campaign for him or defend him, and told members they should feel free to focus on their own survival.</p> <p>\u201cI think Republicans were feeling pretty good about the Congress a couple weeks ago, but this morning they\u2019re very worried,\u201d former representative Vin Weber told the Guardian on Monday. Weber has helped raise funds for a politically-active non-profit, the American Action Network, and an allied Super Pac, the Congressional Leadership Fund, that are trying to keep the GOP majority. The fund has received $20m from casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans are scared to death of what would happen if they lost the Senate and House, regardless of which candidate\u201d wins the presidency, billionaire broadcaster Stan Hubbard told the Guardian. Hubbard, who has contributed over $100,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac, added of Trump and Clinton: \u201cThey\u2019re both disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>Hubbard, a major donor to a few conservative groups, said he got a call last week from the US Chamber of Commerce, which is strictly focused on congressional races.

Besides Nevada and New Hampshire, the others are Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Last week the Chamber of Commerce began its fourth ad buy in Nevada, a $1m effort to help representative Joe Heck win the Senate seat of retiring Senator Harry Reid.</p> <p>Several days after the first debate, the conservative big donor and advocacy network led by the billionaire Koch brothers \u2013 which has said it isn\u2019t backing Trump due to strong concerns about his policies and rhetoric \u2013 hosted a conference call with donors, asking for at least $10m more for Senate ads and get-out-the-vote efforts which have been its major focus, a donor who was on the call told the Guardian. </p> <p>The Koch network, which expects to spend about $42m this year on TV and digital ads in eight states, might spend a few million more on \u201cstrategic media buys\u201d and voter mobilization drives, said James Davis of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the financial hub of the sprawling advocacy network.

We have to investigate Hillary Clinton and we have to investigate the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>He called the FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 in which the agency director, James Comey, reprimanded Clinton for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d but ultimately recommended no charges \u2013 a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. </p> <p>The email Trump singled out involves an exchange between Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon and the DoJ concerning a lawsuit pertaining to a freedom of information request about her emails. The exchange between Fallon and the individual at the DoJ occurred two months before the FBI opened its probe into Clinton\u2019s emails, and it pertained to information that was publicly available. </p> <p>There is no evidence that the DoJ communicated with Fallon on the email investigation.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane on Tuesday, Podesta blamed Russian intelligence officials intent on undermining the Democratic nominee. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in politics for nearly five decades,\u201d Podesta told reporters. \u201cThis definitely is the first campaign that I\u2019ve been involved with in which I\u2019ve had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies \u2026 who seem to be doing everything that they can on behalf of our opponent.\u201d Podesta did not confirm the veracity of the leaks. </p> <p>Ahead of the Florida rally, Trump lashed out at the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him although he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">stopped short of formally withdrawing his support for the nominee</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not giving support \u2013 they don\u2019t give the support that we really need \u2013 but the fact is that I think we should get support and we don\u2019t get the support from guys like Paul Ryan,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly on Tuesday. \u201c[Ryan] had a conference call with congressmen, with hundreds of them, and they practically rioted against him on the phone. One person stuck up for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really want his support,\u201d Trump added of Ryan. </p> <p>O\u2019Reilly asked Trump to elaborate on his earlier tweet in which he wrote that it was \u201cso nice that the shackles have been taken off me\u201d.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Trump said the shackles represented some of \u201cestablishment people, the weak and ineffective people within the party\u201d. When O\u2019Reilly asked if \u201cthrowing off of the shackles\u201d meant that he would become more outspoken, Trump forcefully denied that he was outspoken.</p> <p>He also denied polling that shows him losing support among women, a group he had trouble appealing to even before the release of video in which he boasted about touching women without consequence because of his fame. He has dismissed the remarks as \u201clocker room talk\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have heard it before, and I\u2019ve had a lot of women come up to me and say I\u2019ve heard that before, and I\u2019ve heard a lot worse,\u201d Trump told O\u2019Reilly. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to lose an election, I think that\u2019d be pretty sad.\u201d</p> <p>With less than one month left until election day, Trump is under pressure from party leadership and his own supporters to hone his attack strategy and stick to it. His campaign has so far proved resilient despite not having a conventional fundraising structure or voter outreach plan. </p> <p>During the speech in Florida\u2019s conservative panhandle, Trump encouraged the crowd to register to vote. He noted that the voter registration deadline in Florida had been extended because of the hurricane, which interrupted the state\u2019s final registration days. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a movement. But if we don\u2019t win, all it is a little asterisk in history,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything like this. So go and register. Make sure you get out and vote. November 28th.\u201d The US election is on 8 November. </p>",

My strategy was always to act. The effort required from women is double that required from men but internationally, being a woman has definitely been an advantage. I have the status to speak as the head of the city, and in Palestine I have become an important figure.\u201d</p> <p>Few supporters of women\u2019s equality see no benefit at all in the elevation of women to roles previously occupied only by men. But there are plenty who pour cold water on the idea that where one leads, others will follow, or that the election of a first female mayor \u2013 or indeed a first woman as a country\u2019s president or prime minister \u2013 changes anything much. </p> <p>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science at the University of Southern Denmark, says recent Scandinavian political history justifies such doubts. While Denmark has had its first female prime minister, and the sexes are widely seen to be more equal there than almost anywhere else, the percentage of female mayors in the country has not risen above 15%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.</p> <footer> <cite>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSince we have already some women mayors and we\u2019ve had a female PM, we tend to tick off gender \u2013 \u2018OK, we\u2019re done with that, we\u2019ve reached some kind of parity\u2019 \u2013 and focus on other under-represented groups, immigrants and young people and so on ... when in fact gender parity has not been reached,\u201d he says. \u201cWomen still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.\u201d</p> <p>Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, echoes this. She says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/hillary-clinton-sexism-millennial-voters-women\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for US president</a> creates the \u201cfalse impression that women have really made it in politics. If she wins it will be enormously significant but it masks the reality. We\u2019re not anticipating a year of great strides. We might get from 19% women in the House of Representatives to 20%. State legislatures are not particularly great, and at governor level there are only six women [out of 50].\u201d</p> <p>Walsh believes the women with positions in American politics are, on the whole, more moderate, because women are more economically vulnerable than men, and see themselves as more likely to need state help. But she adds that partisan pulls have recently become stronger. </p> <p>She points to a lack of research into local government internationally as one problem confronting anyone trying to understand what impact, if any, women legislators make. She also notes that the jobs of mayor or governor pose particular challenges, because the stereotype of the good female politician is of a skilful group or committee worker, not a charismatic boss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29/0_384_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor of Watford Dorothy Thornhill speaks to Nick Clegg and project managers during a visit to the construction site for the Watford Health Campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Watford, Dorothy Thornhill, speaks to Nick Clegg and construction managers at Watford Health Campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> This point is echoed by Dorothy Thornhill, mayor of Watford in England for the past 14 years, and one of just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/03/where-women-council-leaders-northern-powerhouse-english-regions\">four directly elected English female mayors</a>. \u201cPeople think leadership equals male characteristics,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea that you have to be this macho-type of person is still around.\u201d As mayor, she has played against this type, and cheerfully reports how on a school visit a child shouted out, \u201cYou ain\u2019t no mayor!

But having once been a sceptic, she now believes directly elected mayors are the future of local government, not just in the UK where a handful of powerful new city-region mayors are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/labour-announce-candidates-mayor-greater-manchester-west-midlands\">due to be elected next year</a>, but internationally.</p> <p>Last year the thinktank LGIU and Fawcett Society <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/project/commission-on-women-in-local-government/\">launched a Commission on Women in Local Government</a>. If this aims to fill in gaps in knowledge of what is going on in the UK, evidence on the impact of female mayors globally looks set to remain hard-to-come-by for some time. </p> <p>\u201cYou see a woman\u2019s body and you see a feminist outcome, but a woman\u2019s body might not have a feminist mind,\u201d says Sarah Childs, professor of politics and gender at Bristol University. While the election of a woman mayor can signal a desire for change, or rejection of the status quo \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/rome-mayoral-crisis-could-hurt-five-stars-national-chances-italy-virginia-raggi\">mayors of Rome and Turin</a> are both from Beppe Grillo\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement, while those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/ada-colau-barcelona-most-radical-mayor-in-the-world\">in Barcelona</a> and Madrid are leftists \u2013 it is hard to draw any firm conclusions about what this might mean for women longer-term.</p> <p>One influential aspect, however, is that these female leaders are showing a younger generation of girls what is possible. \u201cNot too long ago I was in a parade, and somebody shouted, \u2018Here comes the mayor!\u2019\u201d says Megan Barry. \u201cThree little girls on a stoop looked up and one of them said, \u2018Which one is he?\u2019 so I got to walk over and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s me,\u2019 and she replied, \u2018You mean a girl can be mayor?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But while not every woman mayor is a feminist with the specific goal of improving the lives of women in their city, it is still the case that women bring with them a set of experiences different in important ways from those of many of their male peers. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never tried to put a buggy on a bus, you don\u2019t really understand what many women\u2019s experience of public transport is,\u201d Childs says, adding that there\u2019s a burgeoning argument for childcare to be thought about as infrastructure \u2013 not just roads and rail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4af7b62cea7a70bca7bae19704e01fa8b0bf802b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af7b62cea7a70bca7bae19704e01fa8b0bf802b/610_0_2800_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cologne\u2019s chief of police Juergen Mathies and mayor Henriette Reker announce the city\u2019s security plans for New Year\u2019s Eve 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cologne\u2019s chief of police, Juergen Mathies, and mayor, Henriette Reker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolf Vennebernd/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sexual violence and harassment are another reason women and girls experience cities differently from men.

Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/germany-crisis-cologne-new-years-eve-sex-attacks\">sex attacks in the city at New Year</a>, when almost 500 sexual assaults were reported, Reker was lambasted for her remarks about keeping strange men at arm\u2019s length, which were interpreted as \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d. She <a href=\"https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/96/light-in-the-dark/\">has since said</a> she thinks her words were a subconscious reflection of her own trauma. When I ask what lessons she took from New Year, she says the attacks are \u201cstill very much present in our heads\u201d.</p> <p>Ana Olivera, until last year mayor of Montevideo, capital of Uruguay, is another mayor to have focused attention on violence against women, by offering psychological therapy to survivors of sexual violence. But she describes rights for women as part of a larger struggle that includes racial equality and LGBT inclusion: \u201cI don\u2019t see women\u2019s interests as a trade-off against the interests of other groups.\u201d </p> <p>On the contrary, supporters of women\u2019s representation in politics believe women can act as a kind of bridgehead for other under-represented groups \u2013 older people, children, racial and religious minorities \u2013 because although women are not a minority, they are more likely than men to have experienced social exclusion and disempowerment. Olivera names among her proudest achievements as Montevideo mayor a skate park, proposed by a group of teenage skateboarders who won approval and a budget from the city.</p> <p>If a couple of themes recur in talking to female mayors, one is that they have often been underestimated, if not insulted; another is their sense that women can bring a different, less overtly combative and more consensual approach to government. Also, there is their pride at having blazed a trail. </p> <h2>Female mayors in their own words</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0/0_27_477_596/400.jpg\" alt=\"Cyvette Gibson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyvette Gibson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cyvette Gibson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cyvette Gibson, Paynesville, Liberia (population 347,000)</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn parts of Africa there are still prejudices about women in leadership roles and doubts about the impact we can make.

The backlash culminated in a conference call on Monday with House Republicans at which Ryan essentially cut Trump loose and seemed to acknowledge that Hillary Clinton would win the election.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ffv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2786643\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump's sex boasts: 'When you are a star they let you do anything' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f87665e4b0e4aaeaa8d24b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s sex boasts: \u2018When you are a star they let you do anything\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Shortly after landing in San Antonio for a closed press fundraiser, Trump extended his attacks, railing against the 2008 GOP nominee, John McCain, for withdrawing his endorsement. \u201cThe very foul mouthed Sen John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/785885793340448769\">Trump tweeted.</a> McCain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">issued a statement</a> that he was unable to even offer his party\u2019s nominee \u201cconditional support\u201d on Saturday in the wake of what the Arizona senator<a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/statement-from-john-mccain-withdrawing-support-of-donald-trump/\"> called </a>Trump\u2019s \u201cboasts about sexual assaults\u201d.</p> <p>Trump had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/18/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-iowa-republicans\">previously mocked </a>McCain, a decorated war hero, for being captured during the Vietnam war after his plane was shot down. <br></p> <p>Rubio, who ran against Trump in the presidential primary, said his position had not changed in a statement on Tuesday after facing mounting pressure from his opponent in the Florida Senate race to dump Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI wish we had better choices for president.

  "<p>The first modern writers to bring animal behaviour and biology to the general public were Konrad Lorenz and especially Desmond Morris with his international bestseller The Naked Ape. These 1960s books paved the way for other popularisers, including EO Wilson, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, Jane Goodall and myself. We are now very used to this kind of literature, but I still remember how my professors at the time warned against reading Lorenz and Morris, fearing that it would muddle our minds. They should not have done so, though, because we took their warnings as recommendations.<br></p> <p>I met Morris when he came to open the chimpanzee facility at <a href=\"http://www.burgerszoo.com/\">Burgers\u2019 zoo</a> in Arnhem, in the Netherlands, where I conducted my studies. Seeing the water moat surrounding the ape island, he predicted, tongue in cheek, that the chimps would one day build a raft to get out. They never did (chimps are hydrophobic), but the entire colony of 25 apes did escape a few years later by propping a tree stem against a concrete wall and climbing over it, upon which they raided the zoo restaurant. Returning home with their bellies full, they left the zoo staff \u2013 and me \u2013 wondering how they could have done so without tight coordination. The tree was way too heavy for a single chimp.</p> <p>This event interests me nowadays for different reasons. It has become customary to claim that only humans cooperate with insight and joint intentions. But I hold animal intelligence in much higher esteem. My latest book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/are-we-smart-enough-to-know-how-smart-animals-are.html\">Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?</a> laments the persistence of human exceptionalism. For about a century, we have tried to squeeze everything other species do into two small boxes: learning and instinct. We now have outgrown these boxes and are willing to consider a much wider range of possibilities. Animal capacities are often similar to ours, but can also be quite unique. Since we use ourselves as touchstone, we downplay capacities that we don\u2019t possess, such as echolocation or magnetic navigation, while excessively admiring those we rely on, such as language. With this in mind, here \u2013 chronologically \u2013 are a few linguistic products that have influenced my thinking:</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/prince-23.html\">The Prince by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli</a> (1532)</strong><br>While watching chimpanzee power struggles at the zoo, I found zero help in my biology books. So I turned to Machiavelli, reading him during the quiet hours in between the upheavals of bluster and aggression that the chimp males produced. Machiavelli was clear that (military) might is crucial for any ruler, as are strategic alliances and backing from the masses. In chimpanzees, too, no alpha male rules on his own: he needs to make deals, and pay off his supporters. The Florentine chronicler of human affairs helped me see the patterns that I described in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/chimpanzee-politics.html\">Chimpanzee Politics</a> in 1982.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"http://wkprc.eva.mpg.de/english/files/wolfgang_koehler.htm\">The Mentality of Apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler</a> (1924)</strong> <br>This book started the cognitive revolution, at least for animals. It describes in detail how chimpanzees solve problems in their heads. K\u00f6hler presented his apes with a brand new problem, such as a suspended banana, and noted how they would stare at it for a long time before suddenly jumping up to stack up the boxes he had provided. They reached the solution on the basis of <em>einsicht</em>, translated as \u201cinsight\u201d. This radical proposal made K\u00f6hler a hated man \u2013 many scientists still cannot speak his name, only hiss it. Yet he ushered in an era of research that now includes corvids, dolphins, elephants, parrots, and other brainy animals considered as thinking beings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb15eae59762560b5acd5e0749a29f9b19d6902f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb15eae59762560b5acd5e0749a29f9b19d6902f/192_306_1195_1494/800.jpg\" alt=\"Desmond Morris with a chimpanzee in 1961.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Desmond Morris with a chimpanzee in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/18/scienceandnature.science\"> The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris</a> (1967)</strong><br>This classic about humanity\u2019s place in evolution is still a fun read, because Morris writes with such humour. We may have the biggest brain for our body size, he said, but should never forget that we also have the biggest penis. He went on to treat human sexuality as explicitly as only a biologist can. Many of his provocative ideas are now outdated, but some have withstood the test of time, even though the author is rarely credited for them. These include speculations about the link between primate grooming and human gossip, or the roots of human monogamy.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo5975789.html\">Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behaviour by Robert Richards</a> (1987)</strong><br>A critically important book at a time when most evolutionary writing went to the dark side. Biologists couldn\u2019t stop talking about selfishness, competition and the lack of genuine kindness in a dog-eat-dog world. Perhaps not coincidentally, this was also the time of Reagan and Thatcher and the celebration of human greed. Since all of this was advertised as Darwinian, I was profoundly grateful for philosophers, such as Richards and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness\">Mary Midgley</a>, who illuminated a different side of Darwin, including his views on moral evolution.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://jasoncollins.org/2012/06/11/franks-passions-within-reason/\">Passions Within Reason by Robert Frank</a> (1988)</strong><br>Frank is an economist inspired by evolutionary theory. But instead of using that theory to make the case for unfettered competition, he has always emphasised the social side of our species; our commitments, our concern for fairness, our genuinely charitable impulses. He was writing about these issues long before the modern wave of behavioural economics and our current understanding that the default mode of human interaction is actually cooperative rather than competitive.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"http://www.thenaturalistsnotebook.com/ravens-in-winter/\">Ravens in Winter by Bernd Heinrich</a> (1989)<br></strong>Reading this book one can\u2019t help but shiver, because it is all about ravens in freezing Vermont, and an author dragging frozen carcasses up and down the mountain \u2013 and waiting days for his ravens to land near them. How do these birds communicate about the food bonanza, and whom do they tolerate close to it? We learn a great deal about corvid intelligence as well as the persistence of naturalists.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"http://islandpress.org/book/naturalist\">Naturalist by EO Wilson</a> (1994)</strong><br>I am such an admirer of Wilson and his bravery in the face of opposition! A mild-mannered southern gentleman, he was accused of being a Nazi, just because he believed that biology might tell us something about human behaviour. I could list his scientific works, but the best read is still this autobiographical one. Wilson hailed from Alabama, the state next doors to mine (I live in Atlanta, Georgia), so I can relate to the nature he describes and also his early enthusiasm for all kinds of organisms.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/primate-s-memoir.html\">A Primate\u2019s Memoir by Robert Sapolsky</a> (2001)</strong><br>I am always jealous of authors with English as their native language, and especially of Sapolsky who is a hilarious storyteller. He writes with such ease that you\u2019d want to go out with him to the field. A primatologist and neuroscientist, Sapolsky spent years with wild baboons in Kenya, documenting their tense social relations and stress levels.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mothers-and-others.html\">Mothers and Others by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy</a> (2009)<br></strong>The debate about human evolution often turns on violence and males, with females being the passive vessels of male reproduction. Hrdy takes exactly the opposite tack by stressing female sexuality and choice, and the <a href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/It-Takes-a-Village/Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/9781416540649\">it-takes-a-village</a> cooperation with which we raise our young. Very refreshing and insightful, not only in relation to our own species, but also to the matriarchal society of bonobos.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves-3.html\">We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler</a> (2013)<br></strong>It is hard to write about this novel without spoiling its plot, but let me just say that as a primatologist I enjoyed it immensely and felt that the author had done her research and/or experienced things that I can relate to.</p> <ul> <li>Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? by Frans de Waal is published by Granta, priced \u00a314.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/are-we-smart-enough-to-know-how-smart-animals-are.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a312.29, with free UK p&amp;p</a>.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>For years, New Yorkers have been watching several transformations take place around them. Contentious issues of gentrification, displacement and modification continue to rage on and in the midst of all this, one of the city\u2019s greatest inventions, hip-hop, has also been undergoing what some might argue are parallel changes. The idea of what a rapper looks and sounds like is slowly being redefined and 24-year-old Bronx native Quay Dash is an emerging artist whose work is a timely reminder of just how far the genre has come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/26/d-lo-d-loco-kid-comic-rapper-poet-interview-sense8\">D\u2019Lo: 'I came out three times \u2013 as gay, as having a girlfriend and as trans'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think New York, whether it\u2019s hip-hop or soul or R&amp;B, we need to bring it back and go hard,\u201d Dash says with the confidence of an artist once associated with a company called Cunt Mafia Records. \u201cA lot of southern rappers are doing it big right now and they been doing it big for years.

The five-track EP Transphobic is a vibrant, thrilling project and one that Dash hopes will strike a chord with many. \u201cI think it\u2019s really relevant to a lot of shit that\u2019s going on right now in the LGBT community,\u201d she says. \u201cThe title was a great fit for the EP because it also represents my life as a trans woman.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FifVR6dwhD4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m\">In a recent interview</a> with one of her contemporaries and fellow New Yorker Young M.A, she spoke about her reticence to be labelled as a gay rapper (\u201cI never look at LGBT when I do music.

It\u2019s like, \u2018How could you do that? How dare you?\u2019 They don\u2019t want to take the time out to get to know people like me and it\u2019s really saddening because, you know, we\u2019re not bad people. We\u2019re the same as everyone else. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever get better for us.\u201d She fears for the upcoming election, how that might worsen a fragile situation for the transgender community and worries for people across the country. \u201cThey love stupid, foolish things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saddens me to see someone like Donald Trump run for president and have some type of voice. When I\u2019m in America, I just feel like the transphobia is real; the homophobia is real; everything is just like real. It\u2019s so anti \u2026 I really can\u2019t with America.\u201d</p> <p>Dash\u2019s bleak outlook comes after a life of struggle, a childhood filled with foster care and group homes as she tried to find an identity in her surroundings. \u201cIt was a real tough time for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI ended up living with my sister, and that\u2019s when I started writing music and talking about the shit that was bothering me in society. That\u2019s when I started being Quay Dash.\u201d </p> <p>Her background might have led to this awakening but it doesn\u2019t overwhelm her music. Transphobic isn\u2019t just an EP about Quay Dash\u2019s struggles, it\u2019s raw and braggadocious, and quickly making her name known. \u201cPeople are feeling it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty stoked about the future and the present is just, it\u2019s live right now.\u201d Despite the growth in female rappers, Dash is largely unmoved by her peers (\u201cThere\u2019s nobody inspiring me\u201d) and instead, acknowledges Lil\u2019 Kim, Remy Ma and Foxy Brown as her inspirations from the past.</p> <p>Dash wants to fill this void and represent her city, which she feels is too often overlooked for the south, and she\u2019s confident about her ability to push a genre that\u2019s often transphobic and misogynist. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s no different than being on the street,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that I\u2019m better than most of those rappers anyways.

  "<p>Softly spoken with assertive undertones, Fadumo Dayib is the first woman ever to run for the presidency of Somalia. As a Somali female campaigner, she was a \u201cshero\u201d of mine before I met her.</p> <p>The odds are stacked against Dayib defeating incumbent Hassan Sheikh Mohamud; she isn\u2019t even listed as a candidate in <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201608180542.html\">analysis in regional media</a> and has said herself that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/fadumo-dayib-the-somali-refugee-vying-to-return-home-as-first-female-president\">she has little chance of winning</a>.</p> <p>But Dayib\u2019s courage says something about my home country and how far it\u2019s come. So far, the daily death threats she receives are greatly outweighed by the overwhelming support from fellow Somalis. Dayib believes Somalia is ready for female leaders and the fact that she can run at all is in itself cause for celebration.</p> <p>I ask the most obvious question: \u201cWhy do you want to run for the Somali presidency in such a hostile environment to women?\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Living in Finland, she says, gives her many privileges she wouldn\u2019t have had in her own country, and she wants to extend these to women and girls back home. Dayib wasn\u2019t fully literate until the age of 14 but now has several degrees in international public health, including one from Harvard, and is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Helsinki. Born in Kenya to Somali parents, as a child Dayib was deported back to Somalia with her family. When civil war broke out shortly thereafter, the family was forced to leave again, ending up in Finland.</p> <p>\u201cAll I want is for my people to reach their full potential and exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d she says, adding that by running for the presidency, she is exercising her rights as a Muslim woman. During our discussion, she frequently expresses sadness at the global wave of Islamophobia and the portrayal of Muslim women as voiceless and weak. Were she to be elected, she would want to ensure Somalia practices the correct Islam, \u201cthe religion of peace\u201d.</p> <p>Dayib has seen first hand the violence of extremists al-Shabaab in Somalia, where she worked for six months setting up maternal health clinics before the UN evacuated her over security concerns. </p> <p>However, the everyday hostility she faced was oddly familiar. \u201cIt was very similar to what my Finnish colleagues were telling me, \u2018you came to our country to take our jobs\u2019. Now I was being told by Somali colleagues, \u2018you came back to Somalia to take our jobs\u2019. So where was I to go? I was stuck in the middle. Where did I belong?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls go to school, women are working, people feel happy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From there, Dayib went to Fiji and Liberia, where she helped set up HIV prevention offices and trained health care providers for the UN. Seeing how Liberia had emerged from long-term strife brought Dayib\u2019s thoughts back to her ancestral land. </p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Somalia be like this? I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls are going to school, women are working, people feel happy,\u201d she says. Experiencing progress in other African countries gave her hope, but she was under no illusion about the difficult road ahead. The start, however, is always the hardest and that\u2019s what her candidacy is all about: a huge step for Somali women and for Somalia as a whole.</p> <p>Even if Dayib not chosen as next president at the election (<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/27/somalia-delays-its-presidential-election-by-month.html\">currently scheduled for 30 November</a>) she vows to remain in Somalia. Her plan is to set up an independent panel to deal with corruption. She says its her duty to help rebuild the country, and is is adamant that more Somali women should invest back in Somalia whether economically or through their skills as doctors, teachers or social workers. </p> <p>Dayib is under no illusions; she knows Somalia is still very male-dominated, and that when she announced her bid for the presidency, many people struggled to believie it. I was one, but meeting her has extinguished any doubts. Dayib is fierce and her vision for Somalia is clear.</p> <p>\u201cI have a calling and purpose in this world,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must stand and speak up against injustices, my family gets that, it\u2019s not easy but this is who I am. If loving my land means I will die, so be it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/29/leyla-hussein-the-women-who-made-me\">Anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein: the women who made me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dayib and I both know too well that Somali women do not lack strength, intelligence or skills; what they lack is opportunities to reach their goals. We agreed that women and girls in Somalia are in desperate need of safe spaces to access resources, support, education and for protection.</p> <p>Our country faces great challenges. The al-Shabaab rebellion is certainly one of the greatest, but it does not scare Dayib. She believes that by creating a stable environment, and reclaiming the Somali identity, she can address the anger and disillusionment of young Somali men that is fanning the rebellion. </p> <p>In the end, however, corruption might prove a greater obstacle. Dayib places ending corruption at the top of her candidacy\u2019s priorities. She recognises, however, that corruption is also the greatest barrier to her own chances of winning, possibly even greater to her being a woman. I hope this will not be the case. I believe that a president like her could take on the great challenges facing our country.</p> <p>Meeting Dayib reignited my own commitment as a campaigner. It helped me believe again that no battle is too big to fight.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Last year as a result of Labor\u2019s tax transparency legislation, tax office data revealed that one in three private companies paid no tax and one in four public corporate entities operating in Australia paid no tax. In addition, half of the foreign companies operating in Australia had no taxable income while 56 millionaires paid no income tax in 2013, not even the Medicare levy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swan then got specific about BHP and called on the board to provide a full and frank explanation of their role.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a stark contrast between the esteem in which BHP, its executive and the board expect to be held and their actual behaviour. </p> <p>BHP has an experienced Board;<strong> Jack Nasser, Andrew MacKenzie, Malcolm Brinded, Malcolm Broomhead, Pat Davies, Anita Frew, Carolyn Hewson, Ken MacKenzie, Lindsay Maxsted, Wayne Murdy, Dr John Schubert </strong>and<strong> Baroness Shirti Vadera. </strong></p> <p>The Board should provide a full and frank explanation of their role in approving this aggressive transfer pricing scheme. <strong>The board of BHP has not been true to the values they espouse in their charter of corporate responsibility.</strong></p> <p>Corporations are not ends in themselves. The community cannot allow the corporate veil to hide the moral responsibility of those that run them. When companies fail to pay their fair share of tax, revenue must be found elsewhere from businesses and individual taxpayers. </p> <p>The billions of dollars avoided are forever lost to education and infrastructure, which are investments vital to growth and ultimately support the bottom line for business....</p> <p>At a time when this government hacks and slashes at the social safety net in the name of budget repair, it is simply obscene for corporates to walk away with money on this scale.</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between the respect boards and executives expect and what their actual behaviour merits. The actions of these businesses tear at the very fabric of our community and erode trust in business and government.</p> <p>The actions of these businesses tear at the very fabric of our community and erode trust in business and government. </p> </blockquote> <p>BHP rejected Swan\u2019s claims. A spokesman told Guardian Australia:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our Australian adjusted effective tax rate, inclusive of corporate tax, PRRT and royalties in FY16 was approximately 57%.

That was the estimate. The actual amount of payments in the 2016 PEFO was $425bn. This is a government that has ensured we have controlled expenditure.

Nominal figures don\u2019t take into account inflation or the increase in the size of the economy.</p> <p>In the 2013 Pefo, the expected expenditure in 2015-216 was $424.9bn but this was calculated to be 24.6% of GDP. The $425bn that was actually spent in 2015-16 was instead worth 25.8% of GDP (because the economy didn\u2019t grow as fast as they thought it would).</p> <p><strong>So while in nominal terms the Abbott/Turnbull government had met their target, in terms of percentage of GDP they were out by 1.2% of GDP \u2013 or about $19.8bn.</strong></p> <p><strong>And if Morrison really wants to talk in nominal figures, he should also note that the 2013 Pefo predicted a Budget deficit in 2015-16 of $4.7bn, and it ended up being a deficit of $39.94bn.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdb68be4b03b22b4fb2764\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T04:10:30.964Z\">5.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turnbull has consulted his department on the solicitor general's dispute with Brandis</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Labor\u2019s Tony Burke asks Malcolm Turnbull</strong>: Has the prime minister sought advice from his department about the current conflict between the attorney-general and the solicitor-general and does the prime minister have confidence in the solicitor-general?</p> <p>Turnbull says yes and Brandis and Gleeson have his confidence.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can say that I have discussed it with my department and my secretary, indeed, and I have spoken to him about it.

Here are a few highlights:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I genuinely believe that politics is a noble calling, not a grubby, necessary evil. We are so incredibly fortunate to live in free and fair democracies where we have the right to run for parliament. Jo was an exceptional person, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But she wasn\u2019t unique, and she would have been the first person to say so. There are so many women in our communities who could serve with distinction: we need to help them to get into parliament and to be proud to be political.</p> <p>Of course, this isn\u2019t just about numbers, and it\u2019s not about \u2018having a go\u2019. It\u2019s about results. <strong>Women need power to change things.</strong> You can\u2019t change things if you are a name on a ballot, a quota filled \u2013 you need your seat in parliament. Participation is the start, but power is the end. Jo knew that \u2013 it\u2019s why she worked so hard across party lines to make sure that women were running for seats they could win and it\u2019s why she herself joined a party where she stood a shot of becoming an MP and, one day, a minister, even a prime minister.</p> <p>Jo had courage, but she was also unashamed to have ambition. She wanted to go far, and she wanted to lift up others as she climbed. There\u2019s no stain in aspiring to the highest office in your country. It doesn\u2019t taint the purity of your purpose.</p> <p>Today, I want to say to you loudly and clearly: have the highest of ambitions for yourself, for your purpose. Jo believed Britain could be a force for change in the world, and she fought for that.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is a lot more, in fact I could copy the whole speech over but question time looms. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:08:36.036Z\">at 4.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fda136e4b01d9dd2c90178\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:43:50.906Z\">3.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wong again calls for Brandis to resign. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ea3ece305fc46d618f60168c4b3185d7e4e0e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ea3ece305fc46d618f60168c4b3185d7e4e0e9c/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penny Wong has a go at the attorney general, George Brandis, in the Senate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny Wong has a go at the attorney general, George Brandis, in the Senate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:09:14.930Z\">at 4.09am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fda088e4b01d9dd2c90177\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:33:29.317Z\">3.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Wong\u2019s case:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This matter started when s<strong>enator Brandis</strong> made an amendment to the <strong>legal services directions</strong> in May.</p> <p>The legal services directions set out rules and requirements for the performance of commonwealth legal work.</p> <p>Brandis\u2019s amending direction bars the solicitor general from providing legal opinions or advice to anyone in government without the attorney general\u2019s permission.</p> <p>It prohibits any commonwealth agency or officer from referring a question of law to the solicitor general without the written permission of the attorney general.</p> <p>This is a blatant power grab.</p> <p>It is a bid to control the flow of legal advice from the independent solicitor general to government departments and to senior figures in the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:39:39.101Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd9fd9e4b05d915e4240a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:30:03.850Z\">3.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wong is reprising the dispute between the AG and the SG. </p> <p>Wong says Brandis seems to believe that the only legal opinion anyone may need is his opinion. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd9ee7e4b03b22b4fb274f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:27:05.321Z\">3.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OK, in the Senate, <strong>Penny Wong</strong> is talking <strong>George Brandis</strong>, his greatest hits and his latest dispute with the solicitor general.</p> <p>She says the attorney general should not mislead the parliament and the public.

Cathy McGowan thinks so</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Indi independent, <strong>Cathy McGowan</strong>, gave a speech last night calling for a minister for young people and a campaign from the Australian Electoral Commission to engage young people in civic participation. </p> <p>There is a backstory.</p> <p>McGowan won her first election in 2013 against the Liberal frontbencher <strong>Sophie Mirabella</strong> by 439 votes. After the election, there were complaints referred by the Liberal party and an investigation by the Australian relating to allegations of electoral fraud by a number of young voters who were involved with the McGowan campaign. One was McGowan\u2019s niece.<br></p> <p>The original <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/batch-of-false-votes-tars-cathy-mcgowans-indi-win/news-story/5d4128b4a1f80e109062dd8fdd3f634c\">story ran in September 2014</a> and there were allegations raised during the joint standing committee on electoral matters (Jscem). The Australian Electoral Commission investigated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/voter-investigation-not-about-political-gain-say-indi-campaigners\">then the Australian federal police</a>.</p> <p>The AFP then charged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/niece-of-federal-mp-cathy-mcgowan-faces-court-over-alleged-election\">Maggie Ellen McGowan, 27, and Sophie Petrea Fuchsen, 24</a>, with providing false and misleading information, alleging the pair voted in the seat of Indi while living in Melbourne during the 2013 election.</p> <p>The case dragged on and eventually was thrown out in April this year, almost two years after it began. From the story:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Outside court the women\u2019s lawyer, <strong>Rob Stary</strong>, said the case was bound to fail and a terrible waste of resources.</p> <p>Both women were students at the time and the AEC website clearly said students did not need to change their \u201chome address\u201d, he had told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThe original complaint, whoever it was that initiated it, was quite scurrilous,\u201d Stary told reporters.</p> </blockquote> <p>The heart of the issue is around country kids who go to cities to study. As they often have no fixed address, they remain enrolled for voting and other purposes at their family home. But within this loophole, someone found cause to complain. On the numbers, given these are conservative electorates in regional Australia, it seems incredible that the complaint may have originated within the Coalition. If these young people cannot enrol at their home address, it is likely they would remain without a vote. </p> <p>Anyway back to McGowan. She wants the appointment of a minister for young people, to \u201caddress systemic barriers that prevent young people from civic participation, to advocate on their behalf, and help ensure that when policies affecting young people are considered, they do not have an adverse impact\u201d.</p> <p>This is what she said last night.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is confusion about enrolment rules. The involvement of the Australian federal police, Australian Electoral Commission and media in the affairs of 27 young people in my electorate caused the loss of trust in our democratic political institutions. In 2016 approximately 350,000 eligible young people were not enrolled to vote. In the eyes of many young people, these events are even more reason why they feel it makes no sense to engage. No wrongdoing was found after rigorous investigation but these young people are still being scrutinised. We need to stand up for our young people, we need to support them and we need to encourage them to participate in politics. The AEC needs to be supported to engage young people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:23:58.236Z\">at 3.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd8fe5e4b01d9dd2c9016b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T01:34:06.969Z\">2.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A summary, before the time gets away.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Singaporean prime minister has addressed the parliament praising the relationship between Australia and Singapore.

The plebiscite certainly is not my preferred position either. I put up a cross-party bill back in 2015 in good faith, but it joined the other 17 unsuccessful bills that have gone before it ... This is a battle that has been going on for decades now. And, while I am not challenging the intention of some individuals across politics in championing this cause or those within the marriage equality movement, I am concerned that people are losing sight of the endgame.

  "<p>I am on my way to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wendi-deng\">Wendi Murdoch</a> \u2013 as, I\u2019m surprised to learn, she still likes to be known \u2013 and I\u2019m scared to death. C\u2019mon, you remember Wendi Murdoch. Rupert\u2019s ex-wife. The incredibly glamorous one with long hair \u2013 no, not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jerry-hall\">Jerry Hall</a>, that\u2019s the current one. The one before \u2013 the fiercer one. The one who grew up in a small flat in China and ended up living in the most expensive apartment in Manhattan \u2013 $44m (\u00a335.8m), don\u2019t you know \u2013 after meeting Rupert at Star TV, which he owns, in Hong Kong. According to multiple reports at the time, his children from his previous marriage loathed her, and not just because of their father\u2019s bafflingly bad dye job that happened on her watch, although I always thought that was cause enough. Her most glorious moment on the international stage was when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/19/rupert-murdoch-attacked-phone-hacking-hearing\">she walloped Johnnie Marbles</a>, aka Jonathan May-Bowles, a protestor who tried to pie Rupert during his 2011 parliamentary appearance (\u201cMr Murdoch, your wife has a very good left hook,\u201d Tom Watson said, rightly, at the time). </p> <p>Sadly, this image of marital bliss soon ended and the two were divorced in 2013, possibly or possibly not due to causes related to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/14/tony-blair-rupert-murdoch-deconstruction-friendship-wendi-deng\">a note she apparently wrote about Rupert\u2019s close friend, Tony Blair</a>: \u201cOh, shit, oh, shit. Whatever why I\u2019m so missing Tony. Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt \u2026 And he is slim tall and good skin,\u201d the note read. Blair and Wendi have both denied that anything improper happened between them. More recently, she has had to deny further rumours that she is in a relationship with \u2013 but of course \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/wendi-deng-putin-rupert-murdoch-caribbean-russian-yacht\">Vladimir Putin</a>, although that the rumour sounded so credible says a lot about Wendi. So, like I said, I\u2019m terrified. But, if I\u2019m honest, an even bigger part of me would like her to be my life coach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a2d3f9cc7c86899570c789c2b133256710bb1a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a2d3f9cc7c86899570c789c2b133256710bb1a6/251_0_2438_1462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deng Murdoch with ex-husband Rupert Murdoch in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deng Murdoch with ex-husband Rupert Murdoch in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Kessler/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/22/kevin-macdonald-documentary-sky-ladder-the-art-of-cai-guo-qiang-review-\">Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I decide the best way to make her adopt me is to try to dress like her. To this end, I\u2019ve studied <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wendimurdoch/?hl=en\">her Instagram</a>, which features cosy pictures of her with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFuDYVbKVcL/\">Naomi Campbell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBqfyYRKVXM/\">Anna Wintour</a> and, er, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/2REnDxKVUE/\">Henry Kissinger</a>. Her style is best described as \u201cinternational lady billionaire\u201d: some independent labels (Christopher Kane, Giambattista Valli) mixed with the big stalwarts (Dior, Chanel). The closest I can get to this in my closet is a very old Diane von Furstenberg dress and some scuffed Miu Miu shoes. This is, without a doubt, the most dressed up I\u2019ve ever been for work and, as I hustle to a central London hotel to meet her on a Friday morning, I feel slightly like I\u2019m going on the scariest date of my life.</p> <p>The reason I\u2019m meeting her is that she has produced a film, and guess what? It\u2019s really good. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80097472\">Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang</a> is a documentary directed by Kevin Macdonald (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1104804,00.html\">Touching the Void</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/12/thriller.jamesmcavoy\">The Last King of Scotland</a>) about the extraordinary Chinese artist <a href=\"http://www.caiguoqiang.com/\">Cai Guo-Qiang</a>, who \u2013 as well as being a skilled painter, sculptor and taxidermist \u2013 works in gunpowder and explosives (you probably know him best as the man behind the mind-blasting fireworks display at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china\">Beijing Olympics opening</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VReg_NTqHyk\">closing</a> ceremonies). </p> <p>The film follows him as he tries to realise his 20-year dream of creating what he calls a \u201csky ladder\u201d: a fireworks project that resembles a 500-metre ladder reaching up into the heavens. Alongside this, Macdonald traces a line between Cai\u2019s family and childhood during the cultural revolution and the art he makes today. The art really is incredible, but it\u2019s Cai himself who really stands out \u2013 a gentle, charming man with a bright smile, a world away from the usual image of the tortured artist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee86b23dde8b1c94135b59406ee92ef0237d1aa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee86b23dde8b1c94135b59406ee92ef0237d1aa5/0_0_350_594/295.jpg\" alt=\"With Naomi Campbell in 2011.\" width=\"295\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Naomi Campbell in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Wyman/GETTY IMAGES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m meeting Cai (pronounced Tsye) and Murdoch in the hotel, which creates a rather tricky interview dynamic. On the one hand, there\u2019s the extremely impressive Cai, who proves to be as warm in person as he is in the film. On the other hand, there\u2019s Murdoch, as fascinatingly frightening as I\u2019d hoped and a thoroughly distracting presence. I ask Cai who persuaded him to allow a documentary-maker to trail him around for months and poke around in his life.</p> <p>\u201cIt was Wendi,\u201d he replies at once, unsurprisingly.</p> <p>I imagine she is good at persuading people, I say.</p> <p>\u201cI had never done a documentary before, so I met <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001770/\">Fisher Stevens</a>, who is an amazing documentary filmmaker, and he and I talked together about [directors] <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587955/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Bennett Miller</a> and Kevin Macdonald, and we got them both,\u201d she says with a bark of laughter. Her accent is like the distilled essence of a first-class lounge in an airport, an unplaceable mix of various but undeniably well-heeled intonations. \u201cBefore\u201d, for example, becomes \u201cbefarrrrrr\u201d, sort of how Katharine Hepburn might have said it, but louder and more rat-a-tat-tat.</p> <p>Cai smiles at how Murdoch was able to persuade three esteemed directors to work on her film, with Stevens and Miller acting as producers: \u201cWendi\u2019s really amazing. She\u2019s able to bring all these little boys together.\u201d</p> <p>And how does she do that, I ask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b332a98c1a9db85d16d726cf021f28394ec1e738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b332a98c1a9db85d16d726cf021f28394ec1e738/0_15_944_566/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cai just laughs, but Murdoch makes a sly smile at me and arching her eyebrows while batting her lashes. \u201cI love working with creative people,\u201d she says, with a flick of her long hair.</p> <p>Cai is dressed just as I would expect of an artist, by which I mean he is dressed a little like Vincent van Gogh, with a loose tweedy jacket, a simple jumper and loose trousers. Murdoch, by contrast, is in her usual glamazon style and she happily talks me through her outfit: \u201cI love having fun with fashion,\u201d she says, waggling her leather-and-tweed flat boots (\u201cChanel\u201d) while the rest of her is in a long-sleeved black top with ruffles (\u201cPeter Pilotto\u201d) and a leather skirt (unspecified). Cai and Murdoch make a somewhat unlikely double act, although they have been friends for 15 years, ever since they met at the Royal Academy in London and realised they were neighbours in downtown Soho, New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"055cadc0c0a103ba0167f4dabf388bfa678951c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/055cadc0c0a103ba0167f4dabf388bfa678951c7/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deng Murdoch\u2019s second film, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deng Murdoch\u2019s second film, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur children play together and speak Chinese together,\u201d says Murdoch (her daughters with Rupert are 15 and 13; Cai\u2019s are 26 and 13). \u201cAnd I just knew Cai\u2019s story would make such a great story: a child from a small town becomes a huge star internationally. Then you have to ask yourself: how do I challenge myself now? I need new things. It\u2019s a universal story,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Well, not quite universal. But perhaps she related to it on some level?</p> <p>\u201cYeah. But we all relate to it.\u201d</p> <p>Sky Ladder is Murdoch\u2019s second film; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/snow-flower-and-the-secret-fan-review\">Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</a>, a historical drama set in 19th-century and modern China, was released by 20th Century Fox \u2013 of which Rupert was CEO at the time) and was not a critical success. She is already working on her third film, although she won\u2019t talk about it yet. Has she ever asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a> for tips about how to produce? (I find it\u2019s generally a safe assumption that all super-rich people know each other.)</p> <p>\u201cOh, I love Harvey\u2019s movies!\u201d she says. (See?) \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to bother him \u2013 he\u2019s so busy.\u201d And who needs Weinstein\u2019s advice anyway? I get the strong impression that Murdoch\u2019s chief gifts are bringing people together (\u201cWhenever a famous person is dating another famous person, chances are that Wendi Murdoch brought them together,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13459215/businesswoman-wendi-murdoch-career-profile/\">according to Vogue</a>), and then bending them to her will, both of which seem like good qualities for a producer.</p> <p>I had been firmly instructed by the PRs to stick to questions about the movie, but I can\u2019t help but notice that her name in the credits is Wendi Murdoch, not Wendi Deng. Why is that?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5611bf15d8ee2286b2e35d2e0e4ae4a3a6166d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5611bf15d8ee2286b2e35d2e0e4ae4a3a6166d8/0_449_4419_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist Cai Guo-Qiang\u2019s Remembrance, on the riverfront of the Power Station of Art, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Sky Ladder: Cai Guo-Qiang\u2019s Elegy, on the riverfront of the Power Station of Art, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lin Yi/Netflix/Courtesy of Cai Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBecause my children are Murdoch,\u201d she replies.</p> <p>Does she think the Murdoch name helps her?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she says, sounding a little astonished at the thought.</p> <p>So presumably she and her ex are on good terms if she has kept his name?</p> <p>\u201cMany people ask that,\u201d she says, again sounding surprised. \u201cWe are very friendly. We parent together and we go to school events together. We have the same rules for the kids, like not to spend hours on social media. He\u2019s an excellent father and we are on the same page.\u201d</p> <p>So is she happy that he has found love with Jerry Hall?</p> <p>\u201cMmm, next time you interview me we can discuss that,\u201d she says, and I suspect I\u2019m just about escaping Johnny Marbles\u2019 fate. Still, in for a penny and all that, so I carry on. Is she dating?</p> <p>This question seems to please her more: \u201cI am, but no one serious.

But nobody goes to watch the winter Olympics. What were they up to?</p> <p>\u201cWe go to almost all the Olympics!\u201d says Murdoch.</p> <p>\u201cI like to see all the nervous people. It\u2019s like the excitement I\u2019d feel for the Chinese Spring festival,\u201d says Cai, sweetly. \u201cAnd the winning,\u201d says Murdoch, less sweetly.</p> <p>As well as producing, Murdoch backs an art website with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/04/dasha-zhukova-interview-roman-abramovich\">Dasha Zhukova</a>, the wife of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich\">Roman Abramovich</a>, and the two are close friends.</p> <p>It\u2019s that Chinese and Russian connection again, I say.</p> <p>She looks at me suspiciously and sits forward.</p> <p>I mean you and Dasha, I say nervously.</p> <p>\u201cAh right,\u201d she says, sitting back again.</p> <p>Another close friend is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ivanka-trump\">Ivanka Trump</a>, who Murdoch set up with her now husband, Jared Kushner, and the threesome were photographed <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/ivanka-trump-wendi-deng-vacation\">holidaying together in Croatia this August</a>. I ask Cai and Murdoch how they find it living in America during this especially crazy election.</p> <p>\u201cWhat they\u2019re experiencing is similar to what\u2019s happening around the world, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">referendum in Britain</a>,\u201d says Cai. \u201cI agree,\u201d says Murdoch firmly.</p> <p>That must be rather awkward, given that she\u2019s such close friends with Donald Trump\u2019s daughter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fd9565c2b287821710fd3af939ae38a365f0224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fd9565c2b287821710fd3af939ae38a365f0224/0_20_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"The team behind Sky Ladder: Murdoch with Fisher Stevens, Cai Guo-Qiang and Kevin Macdonald\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The team behind Sky Ladder: Murdoch with Fisher Stevens, Cai Guo-Qiang and Kevin Macdonald</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maarten de Boer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, <em>she\u2019s</em> not running for office. She\u2019s very impressive. She has three children and she is teaching them Chinese. It\u2019s very nice. We\u2019ve been friendly for many years. I try to separate [the election] from that. She collects art, you know.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll say this for Murdoch: she\u2019s a real hoot. Terrifying, obviously, but also hilarious, sometimes deliberately so. When I ask her to describe her typical day, she reels off: \u201cI wake up early, then I work out,\u201d she begins, and she mimics lifting dumbbells, which is quite a sight to see in her Chanel boots. She clearly cares about educating the west about China; as well as making China-based movies, she co-hosted the massive exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/aug/19/china-through-the-looking-glass-show-breaks-metropolitan-museum-record\">China: Through the Looking Glass</a>, at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum last year, \u201cand a lot of people told me they loved the show and it opened their eyes. So that\u2019s good,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s a lot more relaxed when she\u2019s talking about fashion, dating and her friends. I can see why Rupert\u2019s kids were wary of her (a shy and retiring stepmother she was never going to be), but I always thought she looked a lot more entertaining than any of them. She would be a lot of fun to have a two-martini lunch with at some fancy place on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. And she\u2019d be petrifying to antagonise.</p> <p>The time is up and, as I stand, Cai gives me a beautiful postcard of the Sky Ladder. Murdoch, meanwhile, gives my outfit a very blatant once-over. The room goes silent. I hold my breath.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God, I love your shoes!\u201d she shrieks. \u201cThe heel \u2013 so perfect!\u201d</p> <p>Nailed it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang is on Netflix and in UK cinemas from 14 October</em></p>",

That is the thing that should cause chills,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In another tweet, Fallon acknowledged that reporters would be interested in their internal campaign operation but implored the media to scrutinize collusion between the hackers and Trump\u2019s associates.</p> <p>\u201cFor God sakes, Roger Stone admitted meeting with Assange,\u201d Fallon said of one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good reading to see internal discussions [about] Trump\u2019s taxes?

In another, Podesta said he was \u201cskeptical\u201d about hitting Sanders on his gun control record, which during the Democratic primary became one of Clinton\u2019s more prominent lines of attack against the Vermont senator. </p> <p>\u201cInterestingly, I am worried about blowback from our supporters,\u201d Podesta wrote, as the campaign mulled criticizing Sanders in an op-ed that ran in Clinton\u2019s name in the New York Daily News.</p> <p>Aides ultimately concluded they would \u201ctone down the contrast\u201d between Clinton and her Democratic opponent.</p> <p>One exchange revealed tensions between Clinton\u2019s longtime aide Doug Band and her daughter Chelsea Clinton in late 2011, when Chelsea cited \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the blurring of lines between the family\u2019s foundation and Band\u2019s consulting company, Teneo. </p> <p>Band, who insisted his company had \u201calmost nothing to do\u201d with the Clintons or its foundation, lashed out at Chelsea in an email to Podesta on the subject.</p> <p>\u201cShe is acting like a spoiled brat who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she\u2019s doing because she, as she has said, hasn\u2019t found her way and has a lack of focus in her life,\u201d Band wrote.</p> <p>The fallout from Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while heading the state department was also a topic of discussion. In an email from August of 2015, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri noted Clinton was \u201cnot in the same place\u201d as her team on how to address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cAs you all know, I had hoped that we could use the \u2018server moment\u2019 as an opportunity for her to be viewed as having take [sic] a big step to deal with the email problem that would best position us for what is ahead,\u201d Palmieri wrote. \u201cIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place).\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign pounced on the hacked emails, focusing on one exchange it claimed showed evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Department of Justice in the investigation into her private server.

Blumenthal was simply passing along the article to Podesta, in an email that contained the subject line \u201cthe truth\u201d and prompted <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635\">an essay</a> in Newsweek on Monday evening from Eichenwald himself titled: Dear Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, I am not Sydney Blumenthal.</p> <p>The source of the false story linking Blumenthal to the passages he never wrote was Sputnik, a government-controlled Russian news agency. The website took its post down after the error became clear, but Eichenwald questioned how a conspiracy went quickly from Russian print to Trump\u2019s podium.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the Trump campaign to ask how the Benghazi email came to the candidate\u2019s attention and whether the campaign would acknowledge what the Republican nominee quoted as Blumenthal\u2019s words were, in fact, from Eichenwald\u2019s 2015 Newsweek article.</p>"
