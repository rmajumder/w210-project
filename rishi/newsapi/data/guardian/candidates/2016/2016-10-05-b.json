  "<p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/10/04/AM16-TR100416-Transcript-of-October-2016-World-Economic-Outlook\">IMF world economic outlook</a> released on Wednesday suggests stagnant growth for the year ahead, and warns that unless nations take efforts to shift their economies out of the rut, political movements against trade will continue to thrive and will also likely lead to lower growth in the future.</p> <p>Since the GFC, the IMF world economic outlook reports have made for pretty depressing reading. Titles such of \u201cToo Slow for Too Long\u201d, from April this year, are about as cheery as it gets. This time the title \u201cSubdued demand: Symptoms and Remedies\u201d reflects the continuation of this generally downcast outlook. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/world-debt-has-hit-record-high-of-152tn-says-imf\">IMF urges governments to tackle record global debt of $152tn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It says something that the bright aspect of the report is the suggestion that while things are not really getting better for the world economy, neither are they getting worse. Instead the IMF finds that the world economy is \u201cmoving sideways\u201d.</p> <p>Woohoo!</p> <p>This has meant for the first time in a long while there was no significant downgrade in the projection for world GDP growth.</p> <p>The 3.1% growth that was predicted in July remains in place. That\u2019s good news (of sorts) but a long way below the IMF\u2019s highest estimate back in September 2011 of 4.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IMF projections for GDP growth in 2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/M5cH1/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while the world GDP growth prediction remains steady, the outlook for advanced economies has been revised down yet again \u2013 from the 1.8% in July to just 1.6%, and massively down on the 2.2% predicted a year ago.</p> <p>The two big reasons for the slow-down in the advanced economies is a weaker than expected growth in the USA and the fallout from the Brexit vote. </p> <p>This time last year, the IMF was expecting the UK economy to be growing by 2.2%. The uncertainty of the Brexit vote saw them downgrade that to 1.9% in April and 1.7% in July. The good news is the IMF now expects the UK to grow by 1.8%. </p> <p>But when asked if this showed that the IMF had overestimated the impact of the Brexit vote, Maurice Obstfeld, the director of the IMF research department argued the sharp devaluing of the UK pound had helped keep the UK\u2019s economy growing better than would be expected (as it made its exports) but that the long term issues remained.</p> <p>For Australia, the situation is better in the short-term as well. The IMF has upgraded our forecast growth for this year from 2.5% to 2.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IMF projections for GDP growth in 2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yCs5o/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Alas the upgrades for Australia and the UK don\u2019t continue into next year. </p> <p>The IMF downgraded the growth projection for Australia in 2017 from 2.5% to 2.2%, while the projection for UK growth has been halved in the past 12 months. Last year the IMF anticipated the UK\u2019s economy growing by 2.2% in 2017; now it expects a pitiful 1.1%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IMF projections for GDP growth in 2017\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fhD2y/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The slowdown in the USA, where the IMF has downgraded growth projections for this year from the 2.2% in July to now just 1.6% is due mostly to falling business investment and \u201cdiminishing pace of stockpiles of goods\u201d. </p> <p>That such a slowdown appears not to have affected the likely chances of Hillary Clinton winning the election highlights how much better the chances for the Republican Party would have been had they not picked Donald Trump as its candidate. </p> <p>The IMF does note that the continued \u201csubdued\u201d growth is having political impacts. It says that the slow recovery after the GFC has been \u201cespecially damaging in those countries where the distribution of income has continued to skew sharply toward the highest earners\u201d. In short, the IMF argues, \u201cgrowth has been too low for too long, and in many countries its benefits have reached too few.\u201d</p> <p>They suggest the impact of inequality has been a driver of a \u201cpolitical movement that blames globalisation for all woes and seeks somehow to wall off the economy from global trends rather than engage cooperatively with foreign nations.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF argues that because international trade is a key driver of economic growth, the movement to increase trade barriers will \u201clikely to depress global growth further.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/apr/14/the-imf-could-have-called-their-latest-report-the-new-normal-yep-it-still-sucks\">The IMF could have called their latest report 'The New Normal: Yep, it Still Sucks' | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead it argues that nations need to work together. On this score the IMF remains praising of the efforts by Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott when hosting the G20 conference in Brisbane in 2014 to co-ordinate a growth target.</p> <p>The IMF argues that to spur stronger growth, economic policies must be comprehensive \u2013 pointedly arguing against relying on low interest rates, and instead arguing for more fiscal stimulus.</p> <p>Here the IMF points to the stimulus provided this year by the Canadian government and in the United States. </p> <p>The data shows that the Australian government remains more focused on reducing the deficit and leaving the work of stimulating the economy mostly on the shoulders of the Reserve Bank: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiscal impulse\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MFlDk/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The good news for Australia is that we look to be well past the peak of our unemployment.

Republicans came out <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/gop-trump-pence-prep-debate-229181\">declaring the debate made them wish Pence</a> was the nominee rather than Trump.</p> <p>It was a contrast to last Monday\u2019s presidential debate when Hillary Clinton emerged the victor in the polls, following Donald Trump\u2019s under-prepared performance. Trump has since claimed that microphone issues had affected him, and that online polls declared him the winner \u2013 despite <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/27/donald-trump-s-online-trolls-turn-on-their-god-emperor.html\">reports claiming those numbers were rigged</a> by Trump supporters. </p> <p>But Trump made sure to claim last night\u2019s win as his own; part of his narrative of being a successful businessman who knows how to make deals.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of vice president debates, and last night Americans also got to look firsthand at my judgment \u2013 you need judgment for people, for deals,\u201d Trump continued. </p> <p>\u201cWell, Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America \u2013 his opponent only talked about small and petty distractions,\u201d said Trump in Nevada.</p> <p>But during the debate, Kaine mostly focused on things that Trump had said or done. Kaine questioned Trump\u2019s behavior, such as saying women should be punished for getting abortions (a statement he later backtracked), that Vladimir Putin was a better leader than President Obama or his plans to build a wall between Mexico and the United States.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has said the Paris climate deal could prove a \u201cturning point\u201d in the effort to avoid dangerous global warming, after a flurry of commitments by nations pushed the agreement into force.<br></p> <p>The climate accord is set to be activated on 4 November after the European Union, Canada, Nepal and India all formally ratified the deal. The latest ratifications mean that 73 nations accounting for nearly 57% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">fully committed to the process</a>, meaning the two key thresholds to the agreement have now been met.</p> <p>Obama said: \u201cToday is a historic day in the fight to protect our planet for future generations. This gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we got. With optimism and faith and hope, we are proving it is possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/canada-carbon-emissions-tax-paris-climate-agreement\">Canada will tax carbon emissions to meet Paris climate agreement targets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US president said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris agreement</a> will prove a \u201cturning point\u201d in the fight against climate change, should nations fully commit to cutting emissions. The US and China, the world\u2019s two largest emitters, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">ratified the agreement in September</a>. </p> <p>Obama said the deal, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature doesn\u2019t rise 2C above pre-industrial levels, will \u201copen the floodgates for low-carbon innovation at a scale we haven\u2019t seen before\u201d. But he warned that emissions will need to be scaled back even further, along with mooted cutbacks in aviation and HFC pollution, if runaway climate change is to be avoided.</p> <p>\u201cNo nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this on its own \u2013 we have to do this together,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we meet every target, we will only get to part of where we need to go. But this will help delay or avoid the worst consequences of climate change. It\u2019ll help set bolder targets.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris agreement, struck last year, calls for all 195 signatories to come up with their own voluntary plans to reduce emissions. While the landmark deal is the first commitment by all countries to reduce emissions, the individual pledges are unlikely to be sufficient to stay within the 2C limit, which could be breached as early as 2050, <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-09-global-2c-threshold.html\">according to recent research</a>.</p> <p>Separate studies have shown the world is on course for a temperature rise of <a href=\"https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/scoreboard/\">around 3.5C</a> by the end of the century, based on the emissions cuts promised in Paris. This would cause a range of disastrous environmental consequences, including heatwaves, sea level rise, species extinctions and spread of disease.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/us-climate-change-emissions-miss-2025-target-research\">doubts that the US is on track even</a> to meet its initial promise to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 by 2005 levels. In a further complication, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has promised to withdraw the US from the deal should he win power. However, the ratification locks countries into the deal for four years, so an immediate US exit wouldn\u2019t be possible. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/india-paris-climate-change-agreement-un-narendra-modi\">India to ratify Paris climate change agreement at UN</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But green groups have celebrated the activation of the Paris deal, pointing to the lightening pace of ratification after decades of international wrangling over climate change. United Nations agreements often take years to come into force, with the Paris deal taking less than a year to pass its ratification thresholds.</p> <p> \u201cThe unprecedented speed of the entry into force of the Paris agreement demonstrates that Paris was not a one-off deal, but rather a long-term commitment to climate action,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.</p> <p> Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, added: \u201cAfter years of tireless dedication and work toward an international climate deal, the Paris agreement has finally jumped off the page and into reality. </p> <p> \u201cNow that the agreement is a reality, we must finally align our global energy and economic policies to meet these goals and end subsidies for outdated fossil fuels, transition to 100 percent clean energy, and stop harmful trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that run counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement.\u201d</p> <p> Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a key architect of the Paris deal, said the deal should be met with \u201cunbridled optimism.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cWe now we have our starting signal \u2013 this is the \u201cgo\u201d toward a low carbon future,\u201d she said. \u201cThat future is going to be exciting: ending the dominance of fossil fuels will deliver an abundance of innovation and opportunity for all of us. </p> <p> \u201cWe can deliver cleaner air, healthier cities and a new kind of \u2018industrial\u2019 revolution underpinned by technologies that enable us to live a prosperous life within the boundaries our planet can sustain.

  "<p>If you decided to skip the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday evening and just tune into to the late night talk shows to get all of your information (and, these days, the gap between comedy and news is forever narrowing), then you probably came away thinking only one thing: the debate for the second most powerful job in the free world was dreadfully boring. (Jimmy Kimmel had to recuse himself from comment since he is actually <a href=\"http://jk4vp.com/\">running for vice-president</a>.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine-vp-debate-mike-pence-what-we-learned\">Tim Kaine shouldn't try standup \u2013 and other things we learned at the VP debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stephen Colbert said the moderator at the contest between Donald Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence and Hillary Clinton\u2019s would-be second-in-command, Tim Kaine, told the audience to \u201cmuffle your yawns, silence your blinks, and apply the Breathe Right strip before you fall asleep in your seats\u201d.</p> <p>The Daily Show spent most of its live broadcast after the debate talking about how lackluster the whole thing was. Trevor Noah flat-out said: \u201cThe debate was boring. It was boring as hell.\u201d He joked that it was so boring that the ratings showed that \u201c80 million people had <em tabindex=\"-1\">not</em> watched the debate\u201d, adding that it was the first time a broadcast had negative ratings. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPtcDrbUa1A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HPtcDrbUa1A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt was the biggest white guy argument in history,\u201d Noah said. He saw little differentiation between the two candidates and said that if they were both bags you were picking up at the airport you would definitely get them mixed up. </p> <p>However, he saw that each candidate had a distinctive job to do. Tim Kaine had to seem affable and lifelike to counteract Clinton, \u201cwho died six weeks ago\u201d, and Mike Pence had to make some of Donald Trump\u2019s crazier statements seem palatable. He said Pence\u2019s performance was sponsored by Febreze and that he was basically spraying the air freshener and saying, \u201cNothing smells here. Nothing smells here.\u201d </p> <p>Ultimately, Noah was swayed by Pence\u2019s defenses of Trump, saying that they were so believable it almost made him want to vote for Pence. However, he made a very apt analogy for his reverence. \u201c[Pence] is the guy who\u2019s not good at convincing his friend not to drive drunk but is very good at convincing the cop that his friend isn\u2019t drunk,\u201d he said. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyjAw7-eKIs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MyjAw7-eKIs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Stephen Colbert, who was also performing live after the debate, came down for Pence, though it wasn\u2019t with much distinction. \u201cIt was like watching a loaf of white bread get pistol-whipped by a jar of mayonnaise,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much flavor, but there was a clear winner.\u201d </p> <p>Colbert then spent the majority of his monologue poking at Pence, particularly because he signed a \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill into law in Indiana that allows businesses to refuse services to gay customers. He said that Pence saying that he \u201cspends a bit of time on his knees every day\u201d was evidence that he is \u201cvery close with Vladimir Putin\u201d. Then he chided Pence for when he accused Kaine of \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/that-mexican-thing-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate\">whipping out that Mexican thing again</a>\u201d.

Still, he echoed the general sense that the face-off was a little bland. \u201cIt was pretty much the same debate I had with my wife about what color to paint the foyer,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we want eggshell or ivory?\u201d </p>",

  "<p>In the final stretch of a presidential campaign that has seen little sustained debate over reproductive rights, Tuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate brought the issue of abortion firmly into focus. </p> <p>It started with Republican Mike Pence on the attack, accusing Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-hillary-clinton-supports-abortion/\">falsely</a> \u2013 of actively supporting an outlawed form of abortion late into pregnancy. Kaine shot back with a litany of attacks on Donald Trump and his running mate\u2019s harsh promises to outlaw abortion, including Trump\u2019s promise to nominate supreme court justices who will overturn any right to the procedure.</p> <p>\u201cGovernor Pence wants to repeal Roe v Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust women? Why doesn\u2019t Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?\u201d</p> <p>It was the rare moment in the general election campaign when abortion issues have taken a front seat. That is despite Trump\u2019s selection of Pence as his running mate fueled expectations that the culture wars would loom large. Pence, who first made his name as one of the most anti-abortion members of Congress, rose to national prominence as the Indiana governor who signed a highly contentious and economically damaging set of restrictions on LGBT rights. </p> <p>Instead, divisive issues such as abortion and the rights of LGBT people have gotten little more than a perfunctory nod from the Republican standard bearer. Clinton speaks regularly on the stump about her support for LGBT and abortion rights. But the issue has seldom been the subject of her fiery clashes with Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-pence-kaine-trump-clinton\">Trump on trial: Kaine calls on Pence to defend running mate in debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday night, their running mates more than made up for that. </p> <p>Pence began the exchange by falsely accusing his opponent and Clinton of supporting the practice of \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d. Congress already has imposed a national ban on \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d, which is a political moniker, not a medical one. In 2007, the supreme court upheld the ban. And neither Clinton nor Pence has ever advocated for reviving the procedure.</p> <p>Pence also touted his state\u2019s efforts to expand anti-abortion counseling for pregnant women. But the source of the funding has been controversial: In one case, Indiana\u2019s health department <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/10/13/state-awards-35-million-contract-anti-abortion-organization-pregnancy-services/73819882/\">furnished $3.5m</a> to a Pennsylvania-based anti-abortion counseling group from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. TANF funds are traditionally earmarked to provide food and shelter for pregnant women or families with young children.</p> <p>Setting off a heated exchange, Kaine responded by highlighting Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">remarks</a>, in late March, that women ought to face \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for having illegal abortions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/mike-pence-led-anti-lgbt-backlash-trump\">Before he was Trump's running mate, Mike Pence led the anti-LGBT backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s threat is a salient one in Pence\u2019s Indiana.

In fact, pro-abortion rights activists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/purvi-patel-abortion-sentence-reduced\">pleaded with Pence</a> to clarify the law so it can\u2019t be used in the future to punish other women.

He declared himself to be \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in 1999 and didn\u2019t publicly change his stance until 2011, when he first toyed with the idea of running for president as a Republican. </p> <p>This election cycle, Trump has antagonized anti-abortion groups by referring to reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood as helping millions of women and saying decisions such as Roe v Wade \u2013 the supreme court ruling that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion \u2013 are set in stone. The Susan B Anthony List, the country\u2019s foremost anti-abortion political action committee, kicked off the Republican primaries by <a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\">urging voters</a> to \u201csupport anyone but Donald Trump,\u201d saying he \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d to oppose abortion. Trump eventually made peace with anti-abortion groups by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">adopting</a> the standard Republican platform on abortion wholesale. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">Kaine and Pence: two Catholic-inspired visions with little else in common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the Democratic side, there is more talk of reproductive rights. Clinton has staked out new territory with vocal support for the use of public funds to pay for abortion. Her platform calls for repealing the Hyde amendment, a budget rider which has prevented women from using Medicaid to cover abortion services for more then 40 years. </p> <p>But her choice of Kaine as a running mate caused skepticism among progressive circles over the Virginia senator\u2019s personal support for the Hyde amendment. \u201cI have been for the Hyde amendment and I haven\u2019t changed my position on that,\u201d Kaine told CNN shortly after joining Clinton\u2019s ticket. An aide later clarified that Kaine, despite his personal opinions, \u201cwill stand with Secretary Clinton to defend a woman\u2019s right to choose, to repeal the Hyde amendment. Voters can be 100% confident that Tim Kaine is going to fight to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">Both Kaine and Pence are Catholics</a> who have said their faith informs their governing on issues ranging from the death penalty to needle exchanges. Abortion came up after the moderator, CBS anchor Elaine Quijano, asked the two men about the role their faith has played in their political decision-making. </p> <p>Quijano posed the question as a catch-all query on \u201csocial issues\u201d. The result was that the debate never touched on the biggest issue looming over either candidate \u2013 the anti-LGBT \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill that Pence signed amid national condemnation in 2015.</p> <p>The law green-lighted several forms of discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals under the guise of religious beliefs. Facing pressure from dozens of major corporations, which threatened to pull their business from Indiana, Pence eventually softened the bill\u2019s restrictions.</p>",
  "<p>Television spinoffs are all the rage at the moment. The Netflix show Luke Cage came from Jessica Jones. Punisher is being spawned from Daredevil. Better Call Saul was sired by Breaking Bad.</p> <p>So it makes sense that the 2016 presidential election would get in on the act, commissioning the one-off vice-presidential debate after the success of its parent series, The Presidential Debates.</p> <p>Here are the takeaways.</p> <h2><strong>We got closer to learning which vice-presidential candidate is which</strong></h2> <p>Before Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s debate 40% of Americans <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/40-percent-americans-vp-candidates/story?id=42497013\">could not name either vice-presidential candidate</a>, let alone tell them apart.</p> <p>Thanks to the hour-and-a-half slog, we now have at least some sense of which one is Virginia senator Tim Kaine and which one is Indiana governor Mike Pence.</p> <p>Tim Kaine is the yappy little puppy. He interrupted too much and was a little bit too keen. Pence is the overly relaxed one who had his face permanently set to condescension.</p> <p>If you only saw photos from the debate: Kaine looks like a friar who has drunk too much mead. Pence <a href=\"http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mike_pence3.jpg\">looks like</a> he has been embalmed.</p> <h2><strong>Sometimes commercial breaks are a good thing</strong></h2> <p>Did anyone really want to watch two men in their late 50s argue for 90 minutes straight? </p> <p>This was one of the rare occasions where television viewing would have been improved by the show being broken up. It certainly would have been more humane.</p> <p>Three commercial breaks during Tuesday\u2019s debate would have been perfect. One to use the bathroom, one to fetch refreshments, and an extra one in case of emergencies.</p> <h2><strong>Pre-cooked lines are terrible</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoPu1UIBkBc\">Ronald Reagan had a good one once</a>, but he was actually an actor. Tim Kaine is not an actor, and it showed in his delivery on Tuesday night.

But the problem is we have tasted Trump now. It tastes awful, obviously, but it has rendered everything else bland by comparison.</p> <p>Kaine and Pence did not call each other names. They did not insult whole groups of people. Neither man referred to his phallus.</p> <p>Consequently, neither came across as unequivocally odious. </p> <p>We\u2019re used to turning on a debate and sitting back while Trump shoots himself in the foot, as Kaine might say. Kaine and Pence didn\u2019t so much as stub their toe.</p> <p>Pence defended Trump and Trump\u2019s views, but he did it pleasantly, like a smiling sales assistant telling you he won\u2019t honour your return even though you have a receipt. Trump is the mechanic who chases you out of his garage with a wrench after destroying your car.</p> <p>Trump returns on Sunday for the penultimate presidential debate. Enjoy it while it lasts.</p>",

Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Against that backdrop, the fall in the exchange rate will help to support activity, cushioning the impact of greater uncertainty. While that was expected, the effect could be coming through faster than we\u2019d anticipated.</p> </blockquote> <p>The speech also takes a good look at the impact, and causes, of record low bond yields (a massive headache for pension funds), and the wider issue of economic uncertainty. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf\">It\u2019s online here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/783598802099986432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really good speech by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a> Ben Broadbent <a href=\"https://t.co/5Tibyb4COl\">https://t.co/5Tibyb4COl</a></p>&mdash; Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/783598802099986432\">October 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c444e4b005191a20ee93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:25:50.137Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This isn\u2019t how Theresa May would like her first conference as Tory leader to be remembered.</strong></p> <p>But it appears that the slump in the pound vs the euro this week means Britain has fallen to sixth place in the list of the world\u2019s biggest economies, behind our old friends France.</p> <p>The FT\u2019s Chris Giles has crunched the numbers, and explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>International Monetary Fund <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/10/03/AM2016-NA100416-WEO\">estimates of the size of economies in 2016</a> puts the UK at \u00a31,932bn with France weighing in at \u20ac2,228bn, putting the UK ahead so long as a pound buys more than \u20ac1.153.</p> <p>At the start of the week, the prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary all boasted that Britain would get a good deal in EU talks because Britain was the fifth-largest economy in the world.

  "<p>Do you trust the people? Being able to answer \u201cyes\u201d has long been taken as a litmus test of the depth of your commitment to democracy. In a democracy, the people, like customers, may often be wrong, but must always be treated as though they are always right. That\u2019s why Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest campaign gift to Donald Trump was her comment that half of his supporters belonged in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">basket of deplorables</a>\u201d. \u201cNo one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their president,\u201d Trump said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No sensible person thinks majority opinion is a good guide to best practice in health or engineering.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the UK, when David Cameron recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\">resigned</a> as prime minister he was not ashamed for having called a referendum he lost but \u201cproud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people for these big decisions\u201d. This was one Cameron line his successor Theresa May was all too happy to keep faith with. \u201cWe know there is no finer accolade than to say David Cameron put his trust in the British people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd trust the people we will.\u201d</p> <p>But history suggests it is unwise to trust any politician\u2019s claim to be trusting the people. In 1906 Winston Churchill even had the gall to assert \u201cTrust the people\u201d was his motto in a speech defending the hereditary monarchy and House of Lords. Of course there is a sense in which democracy is about trusting the people. The mistake, however, is to assume that this trust is in the majority\u2019s ability to reach fair and wise decisions about specific policies. That kind of trust is not just unjustified, it\u2019s borderline insane. No sensible person thinks majority opinion is a good guide to best practice in health, education, engineering, or pretty much everything else. So why would public policy be any exception?</p> <p>Plato and Aristotle get a bad rap these days for their rejection of democracy. But the substance of their objections were spot-on, and not just because they saw that majority opinion is not the same as wisdom. For <a href=\"http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_aristotle_democracy?page=all\">Aristotle</a>, democracy\u2019s fatal problem is that it divides society by pitting the majority \u2013 however slender \u2013 against the minority. We\u2019re seeing this playing out in America, where the divide between Republican and Democrat has never been wider, but in elections the winner takes all. We\u2019re also seeing this in Britain, where cosmopolitan liberal cities and conservative communitarian towns and villages view each other with incomprehension.</p> <p>Why then has democracy actually served us so well? Put simply because it is not democracy as conceived by its ancient Greek critics. What we call democracy is actually a system of representative government which leaves most big decisions to elected leaders. Crucially, it is also a system in which the rule of law is more important than the will of the majority at any given moment. That\u2019s a safeguard Aristotle didn\u2019t anticipate. Indeed, he argued that democracy was opposed to the rule of law because he thought it meant the will of the people transcended the law.</p> <p>To say democracy is about trusting the people is therefore simplistic in two ways. First, for democracy to work it requires the people to trust those they elect to make decisions. Demanding that politicians instead trust the people to tell them exactly what is best turns this on its head, undermining one of actual democracies\u2019 greatest strengths.</p> <p>Second, our democracies are built around constitutional arrangements that make major change difficult precisely because it does not trust the people or the government to be reliable or constant.</p> <p>Western democracy is built around a tripartite trust: trust in the people to hold government to account and to set the general direction of policy, but also trust in politicians to make specific decisions, and in institutions to provide safeguards against rash or tyrannical actions. What we are seeing all over the western world are the last two pillars being torn down, leaving all trust resting on the people.</p> <p>This is rightly called populism, not in the American sense, but as understood in the rest of the world. Populism is generally defined as a mode of politics in which the will of the people is seen as clear, virtuous and homogeneous. Populist politicians simply promise to do what this will commands, ignoring or denying the fact there are different, competing interests in society, not just those of the majority. Populists do not try to square the simple desires of the electorate with the complex realities of society but pretend that what seems simple is simple and that anyone who says otherwise belongs to an obfuscating elite looking for excuses to defend its own interests.</p> <p>Those who oppose populists are accused of being anti-democratic because in a sense they are: they reject pure, direct democracy in which the people dictate policy, as did Plato and Aristotle. But they are completely on the side of the very successful form of democracies that we have developed, systems of government that are much better than any imagined by those great philosophers. We trust the people to play their part, but not to run the whole show.</p>",

Here\u2019s the most obvious winners and losers.</p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>British workers</strong></p> <p>May promised her government would be on the side of British workers, ruling out a bonfire of employment rights post-Brexit, reiterating her leadership race commitment to putting employees on company boards and attacking company bosses who \u201cearn a fortune but don\u2019t look after your staff.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Rural Britain </strong></p> <p>Broadband is a priority which May mentioned in her speech, and one her spokeswoman said had been discussed in cabinet meetings and committees. It\u2019s in rural, and traditionally Tort, areas where connectivity is poorest and expect to see some concrete new policy on this in coming weeks and months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Savers</strong></p> <p>May said it was clear current low interest rates were not working for everyone, and there were gentle hints that the government may be preparing to rethink quantitive easing, a policy that would be attractive to savers. May said though QE had been good after the financial crash, the government would \u201cacknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201d Monetary policy like this however, is really the domain of the Bank of England.</p> <h2>Losers</h2> <p><strong>Foreign workers</strong></p> <p>May has made it clear she wants to prioritise voter concerns about immigration in her Brexit negotiations. Her speech will have unnerved many overseas workers, including doctors, whom the Prime Minister suggested may only be allowed to stay in the UK for a limited period. Firms have already started a huge backlash against a proposal floated by Amber Rudd to make companies list the number of foreign workers they employ. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92/231_43_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Baggott/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Energy companies </strong><br>May strongly hinted she wanted to tackle high energy bills, without a firm proposal. But her words about energy companies have been seized on as potentially a move towards Ed Miliband-style energy price caps. Her official spokeswoman did not rule out even tougher action, but said firmer policy announcements would follow.</p> <p><strong>Human rights lawyers</strong><br>One of the biggest cheers in the hall came as May attacked \u201cactivist, left-wing human rights lawyers.\u201d The focus of her anger was abuse claims against British troops, which defence secretary Michael Fallon had announced earlier would be protected against claims arising from the ECHR for future conflicts.</p> <p><strong>Tax avoiders</strong></p> <p>Nothing concrete yet, but May has seized on another Labour soundbite, it\u2019s patriotic to pay your taxes. \u201cWhoever you are you \u2013 however rich or powerful \u2013 you have a duty to pay your tax.

It is welcoming her renewed commitment to putting workers on company boards. Here is the full statement from <strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re pleased Theresa May has renewed her commitment to having workers on company boards. This is a good first step towards building a fairer economy.</p> <p>However, we are still miles away from having a country that works for the many. UK workers suffered the biggest fall in wages of any developed country after the crash. Those working in the public sector and private sector urgently need a pay rise.</p> <p>Working people also need assurances that their jobs won\u2019t be put at risk by Brexit. Our relationship with the single market is crucial for protecting livelihoods across the country.</p> <p>We need to manage migration better and get tough on employers who undercut pay. But any new deal must also protect jobs and future workers\u2019 rights.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T14:06:14.269Z\">at 3.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f503ebe4b08ebe3d557108\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T13:45:35.749Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is<strong> Dave Prentis,</strong> the Unison general secretary, on the speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavePrentis/status/783621484237512704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Theresa May talks about those who face stagnating pay.

This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, its director general: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The CBI welcomes the government\u2019s consultation on business practices and will take this opportunity to understand and respond to the true concerns of society.</p> <p>Government must build on the great things so many firms are already doing and not impose approaches that look good on paper, but don\u2019t make a difference in practice. Placing workers or consumers on boards can be a solution for some firms, but may not be the only or even best way of changing company culture.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the IoD has effectively accused May of treating business leaders like \u201cpantomime villains\u201d. This is from James Sproule, the IoD\u2019s director of policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Plans to \u2018name and shame\u2019 companies who employ foreign workers, aside from adding to bureaucracy, send precisely the wrong message. The prime minister should instead listen to her own advice and remember that, in Britain, it doesn\u2019t matter where you were born. Make no mistake, Britain is at its best when it is open and offering a home to the world\u2019s brightest and best who want to study and build a better life for themselves, while contributing to the British economy.</p> <p>As a longstanding trailblazer for good corporate governance, the IoD welcomes the prime minister\u2019s focus on how corporate leadership can aid economic and social success. Business leaders are not pantomime villains, evading taxes and employing cheap labour from abroad out of some destructive desire to do Britain down, and for every Mike Ashley or Philip Green there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working entrepreneurs who are more likely to remortgage their homes than own a super yacht. Those people will now be watching the autumn statement and the chancellor like a hawk, expecting more measures to promote enterprise and investment than we saw in this speech.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T13:34:51.686Z\">at 2.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4fda7e4b0e2a2a25af374\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T13:22:48.446Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn accuses Tories of encouraging xenophobia and hatred</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And this is from <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>, the Labour leader.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conservative party leaders have sunk to a new low this week as they fan the flames of xenophobia and hatred in our communities and try to blame foreigners for their own failures.</p> <p>Drawing up lists of foreign workers won\u2019t stop unscrupulous employers undercutting wages in Britain.

But that was the Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, whose speech introducing Theresa May was one of the best of the whole conference season. As for Theresa May\u2019s, it was rather more questionable.</p> <p>What was certainly bold was May\u2019s decision to cast herself as the leader of a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297#block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297\">11.51am</a>). Taking the EU referendum vote as her starting point, she said it was not just a vote to leave the EU but a protest against an economic and political system rigged in the interests of the elite to the detriment of ordinary people. She is not necessarily wrong, and this analysis is not unlike Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, but May then set out to use it to make the case for her own brand of pragmatic, populist, \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism. What she had to say about tax-dodgers (and, even more pointedly, tax-dodging accountants), corporate responsibility, market failure and industrial intervention was provocative in Tory terms, and yet another indication of how far the party has come from the days of Margaret Thatcher. Edward Heath coined the term \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, and May has placed herself firmly in the Heath/Major/Blair centrist tradition. It\u2019s Christian democracy \u2013 or perhaps Anglican democracy, given that May\u2019s father was a vicar.</p> <p>Yet there was nothing in the speech to show that May is willing to match her rhetorical courage with action. If she really thinks working people are losing out under the tax system, she could abandon George Osborne\u2019s inheritance tax cut. If she is serious about intergenerational fairness, she could shelve the \u201ctriple lock\u201d. And if she accepts that housing policy needs to change so that people can get on to the ladder, she could rip up planning laws and send the bulldozers on to the green belt. But of course that wouldn\u2019t go down well in Maidenhead (her constituency), or with the Daily Telegraph, or with the Conservative party at large.</p> <p>May said at one point that government was about \u201caction \u2026 about doing something\u201d. But caution seems to be more her watchword. We\u2019re still waiting for a decision about Heathrow. </p> <p>Ultimately this speech will be judged by whether May can deliver on the heady ambitions that she set herself. It is not inconceivable; in some respects her record as home secretary was radical. But she would have been much more convincing today if she had backed her rhetoric with at least one announcement to show that change is real.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T12:58:28.033Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4e71de4b08ebe3d557064\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T11:46:20.230Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is an agenda for a Conservatism rooted in the centre ground.</p> <p>That is what this government is about, she says.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learned.</p> <p><strong>1. Brexit will be at the harder end of the scale. </strong>This was signalled in Theresa May\u2019s speech on Sunday and \u2013 judging not least by the market reaction \u2013 it is the most important takeaway from the whole conference. Ministers still seem uncertain as to exactly what they want, but the Norway/Switzerland models (soft Brexit) are out and, although May is not planning to simply walk away and slam the door (the hardest possible Brexit), she will prioritise getting control over immigration over single market membership. Brexiteers strongly object to the terms hard/soft on the grounds that they are loaded, because hard implies bad (clean/dirty is one alternative formula they prefer), but this terminology is not unreasonable. Economists believe disengaging from the single market will have negative consequences.<br></p> <p><strong>2. The Conservative party is largely united behind May on Brexit, but it is complacent about the risks. </strong>From what has been said in the conference hall, and on the fringe, you could easily forget that the party was split down the middle on the EU four months ago, because now the Tories seem remarkably unified. According to a <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/10/brexit-members-survey-todays-conservativehome-conference-newspaper-in-full.html\">ConservativeHome poll</a>, 76% of members back the harder Brexit May is offering. But there is a considerable disconnect between Toryworld, where many members are convinced that all forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy are just wrong, and reality, where May\u2019s speech sent the pound tumbling. Two figures who are not complacent are May herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\">who has been warning about \u201cbumps in the road\u201d</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\"> </a>and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who used his speech on Monday to try to warn his party about potential bad news ahead.</p> <p><strong>3. City and business opinion does not matter to the Tory leadership as much as it used to.</strong> Traditionally the Conservative party has been quite deferential towards the City and business, but now the tone is different. \u201cCity delegates stranded on Planet Tory for the duration of the party conference report the atmosphere has turned toxic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7133664a-8a29-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">the Financial Times\u2019 Lombard column reports</a>. A Bloomberg story saying <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-03/may-said-to-downgrade-city-in-brexit-shock-for-financial-sector\">the City would get no special favours in the Brexit negotiations</a> caused alarm (even though it was denied) and then Amber Rudd, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on work visas, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/79577/business-backlash-against-amber-rudds-fresh-immigration\">which prompted a strong business backlash</a>. In government Hammond is fighting to protect business interests in the Brexit talks although, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1703845213273550\">in a perceptive Facebook post</a>, ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> says the conference shows \u201cthe Treasury, in the May government, is less powerful than it\u2019s been for many decades.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>4. May seems serious about defining herself as a centre-ground politician, although so far there is little policy evidence to show that she will be very different from her predecessor.</strong> It is commonplace for political leaders serious about power to argue that they represent the centre ground, or that the centre ground has moved towards them, but May is finding it easier to make this case than David Cameron because for most his premiership the centre ground was taken by his coalition partners, the Lib Dems. However, so far, we have yet to see a big policy shift that makes this real. When Nick Robinson challenged her yesterday to show her commitment to working people by axing inheritance tax cuts (which only help the wealthy), or higher public sector pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b#block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b\">May ducked for cover</a>. </p> <p><strong>5. The Tories aren\u2019t very worried about Labour, but that has not stopped them annexing some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy territory.</strong> In some respects, competitive party politics is quite simple: all you have to do is attack your opponents\u2019 bad ideas, pinch their good ones, and make sure you have the sense to tell which is which. The Tories have done that this week, hijacking some of the soundest aspects of the Corbyn agenda \u2013 a slower timetable for balancing the budget, reviewing whether employment laws suit the modern workplace, and a migration impact fund. Some Labour figures think that, if the Tories are on their turf, that will help Corbyn, but that is not necessarily so because, on the economy and immigration, the Tories are more trusted than Labour. The Tory MP Robert Halfon <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tories-should-be-worried-and-not-celebrating-robert-halfon-minister-mp-a7342636.html\">gave an interesting speech</a> saying his party should worry about Corbyn\u2019s ability to inspire young voters, but he has been a lone voice and generally the Conservatives are not taking the threat from Corbyn seriously at all. </p> <p><strong>6. Next year\u2019s most important election may well be the West Midlands mayoral one.</strong> Labour is expected to win the mayoral elections in Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region next year quite easily, but the contest in the West Midlands could turn out to be gripping. The Tories have used the conference to promote their candidate, the outgoing John Lewis boss Andy Street, and Street say he just needs a 4% swing from the general election results to win. Given that the West Midlands is one of the regions where general elections are often decided, this will be a key test for Corbyn\u2019s Labour versus May\u2019s Conservatives.<br></p> <p><strong>7. The Tories have ditched the Cameron era quite ruthlessly. </strong>There is little gratitude in politics. Ministers have been acknowledging David Cameron in their speeches, but their tributes have barely gone beyond the polite and, outside the conference hall, it\u2019s more a case of \u201cDave who?\u201d. In the atrium there is a display featuring pictures of Tory prime ministers from Robert Peel to John Major, from which Cameron is notably absent. The people most closely associated with his administration, such as George Osborne and Michael Gove, have not turned up and, in a final indignity, Sir Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/david-camerons-former-aide-charged-1500-for-conference-ticket-after-publishing-attack-book-on-a7334966.html\">had to pay the extortionate business attendee rate</a> to get a pass to be allowed entry into the conference building.<br></p> <p><strong>8. Being foreign secretary has not changed Boris Johnson. </strong>Diplomacy is normally associated with a certain amount of gravitas, and before the conference it was not clear whether Johnson would adopt a serious tone, or whether we would get the usual faux-spontaneous, rambling, semi-frivolous standup routine. In the event we got the latter. It was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c#block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c\">a very good speech</a>, probably the best anyone has delivered so far (not least for the use of the word \u201cfunkapolitan\u201d), although what the mandarins at King Charles Street and Johnson\u2019s fellow foreign ministers made of it is anyone\u2019s guess.<br></p> <p><strong>9. The Tories who backed the Vote Leave campaign are not willing to defend its key claims.</strong> One of the TV highlights of the conference has been Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/783193789158481920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">trying to get the Tory Vote Leave leaders to defend their claim that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS</a>. The Vote Leave NHS promise was disowned some months ago, but this week we\u2019ve seen further evidence that Vote Leave\u2019s Brexit forecasts were misleading. Rudd said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live?page=with:block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e#block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e\">not planning to increase immigration from the Commonwealth as EU immigration falls</a> (leavers forecast the opposite), and Brexit ministers are backing away from the claim that there will be no trade-off between controlling immigration and enjoying the full benefits of the single market. (Admittedly, some of the worst remain economic forecasts have failed to materialise too, but the person most associated with those claims, George Osborne, is out of the picture.)</p> <p><strong>10. An early election looks less and less likely. </strong>May has been saying for some time that she has no plans for an early election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f#block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f\">in an interview on Sunday</a> she went further then before, saying an early election would generate \u201cinstability\u201d. Just as significantly, it has become clear from what has and has not been said around the conference that there is little appetite in the party for an early poll.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:40:05.813Z\">at 11.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c868e4b0d9ed530ef255\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:35:17.565Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP, Greens and Plaid Cyrmu issue joint statement condemning Tories's stance on immigration</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SNP leader and Scottish first minister <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the Green co-leaders <strong>Caroline Lucas</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong> and the Plaid Cymru leader <strong>Leanne Wood</strong> have released a joint statement this morning condemning the Tories for their stance on immigration. Here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The countries of the United Kingdom face a spiralling political and economic crisis. At the top of the Conservative party, the narrow vote in favour of leaving the EU has now been interpreted as the pretext for a drastic cutting of ties with Europe, which would have dire economic results - and as an excuse for the most toxic rhetoric on immigration we have seen from any government in living memory.</p> <p>This is a profoundly moral question which gets to the heart of what sort of country we think we live in. We will not tolerate the contribution of people from overseas to our NHS being called into question, or a new version of the divisive rhetoric of \u2018British jobs for British workers\u2019. Neither will we allow the people of these islands, no matter how they voted <a>on June 23rd</a>, to be presented as a reactionary, xenophobic mass whose only concern is somehow taking the UK back to a lost imperial age. At a time of increasing violence and tension, we will call out the actions of politicians who threaten to enflame those same things.</p> <p>This is not a time for parties to play games, or meekly respect the tired convention whereby they do not break cover during each other\u2019s conferences. It is an occasion for us to restate the importance of working together to resist the Tories\u2019 toxic politics, and make the case for a better future for our people and communities. We will do this by continuing to work and campaign with the fierce sense of urgency this political moment demands. </p> </blockquote> <p>The statement has also been signed by Steven Agnew, leader of the Greens in Northern Ireland, Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, and Alice Hooker-Stroud, leader of the Welsh Greens.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4bf25e4b0afec6ad16f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-elgot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:52:21.671Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Communities secretary <strong>Greg Clark</strong> joked last night to a meeting of liberal Tories that Theresa May had been great for progressives because Boris Johnson \u201cspends most of his time out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>At a midnight reception for the Tory Reform Group, members of the group cheered as Clark, who was a remain campaigner teased his cabinet colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for the TRG and particularly a great summer as there are more TRG MPs than there are Liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cDamian Green in the cabinet!

Rudd,</strong> the home secretary, was on the Today programme this morning defending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">the plans she announced yesterday to restrict the number of foreign workers coming to the UK. </a>She said some firms were not doing enough to employ local people.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The purpose of this review is to look at whether they are doing enough to train people locally when they could be able to do that. There are record levels of employment, which is great, but there are still one in 10 18- to 24-year-olds unemployed and I want businesses to think first about locally training people where possible. For instance, I went and visited a factory quite recently where they recruit almost exclusively from Romania and Poland, where they have people who have experience in factories building these sofas that they have. They didn\u2019t even consider training locally \u2013 there was a local college they could have worked with, but they choose to recruit outside the UK. We set policies to encourage businesses to make a profit and be successful, but also to have a responsibility to local employment and we\u2019re asking them to join us on this journey so they don\u2019t automatically go abroad where it\u2019s cheaper perhaps and sometimes they feel more efficient.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the Times, one of Rudd\u2019s proposals is for firms to have to publish figures showing what proportion of their workforce is foreign. Rudd told Today that this was just a proposal and that it would not definitely be implemented.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The business I mentioned to you would have shown it had 80-90% non-UK citizens working there. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re definitely going to do, it\u2019s one of the tools we\u2019re going to use as a review to see if we can use it as a way of nudging people to do better behaviour.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f160837fa9421047a8323f41dcc1efc178aeea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f160837fa9421047a8323f41dcc1efc178aeea/0_225_3216_1927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DAVID HARTLEY/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:30:52.817Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ead3e4b0afec6ad16cae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:16:32.588Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This morning we learn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/nigel-farage-says-he-may-technically-still-be-ukip-leader\">Nigel Farage may still be technically leader of Ukip</a>, even though the party announced a new leader last month.

  "<p>In those entertaining early days of the Republican primaries, the illogical popularity of Donald Trump seemed like a lark. Snarky nicknames were coined, toupee memes were shared. And even when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/10/donald-trump-rally-black-man-sucker-punch-north-carolina-video\">Trump dissenters were sucker-punched at rallies</a> and racists grew emboldened, candidate Trump\u2019s oratory provided comic relief because so many sensible Americans were confident that, comparisons to Mussolini notwithstanding, it really can\u2019t happen here.</p> <p>In 1935, just after the rise of the Third Reich, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1930/lewis-bio.html\">Sinclair Lewis</a> wrote<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/09/29/it_really_can_happen_here_the_novel_that_foreshadowed_donald_trumps_authoritarian_appeal/\"> It Can\u2019t Happen Here</a>, a satirical novel about fascism in America. His intention was to shake up an American electorate complacent that the land of the free could never become a police state. So Lewis wrote about a demagogue who becomes president of the United States by promising to return the country to greatness and by demanding law and order.</p> <p>Now the time seems ripe for a new look at Lewis\u2019s cautionary tale. The world premiere of <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyrep.org/\">Berkeley Rep</a>\u2019s theatrical adaptation of It Can\u2019t Happen Here promises shrewd parallels between then and now. But the production is less lacerating satire than agitprop. Tony Taccone and Bennett S Cohen intended to improve upon a previous theatrical adaptation staged by the earnest <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-wpa/\">WPA</a> in 1936. Yet under Lisa Peterson\u2019s stylized direction, this version retains a didactic righteousness.</p> <p>The play never shakes its bookish shape. Actors stand in sober formation to address the audience. Descriptive sentences are parceled out to actors and dialogue takes the backseat to pontificating and political speechifying. Characters aren\u2019t much more than mouthpieces.</p> <p>The mouthpiece with the best words is Doremus Jessup, played by Tom Nelis. A social-democratic newspaper editor (from Vermont of all places), Jessup is the wry voice of reason. He knows those who express certainty that there\u2019s no way Americans will elect Buzz Windrip are \u201coverestimating the country\u201d. Played bigly by David Kelly, Senator Berzelius \u201cBuzz\u201d Windrip is a charismatic charlatan who spins stagecraft and peddles fears.</p> <p>Taccone and Cohen sprinkle Trumpiness throughout their adaptation. Resemblances to today\u2019s headlines are like a theatrical round of Where\u2019s Waldo. Windrip, we hear, \u201cpretended he was his own publicity man\u201d, telling reporters that he \u201cwas the smartest man on Earth\u201d. At a rally, Windrip kicks out a commie, yelling, \u201cGet him out \u2026 Get him out of here! \u2026 In the good old days we would\u2019ve known what to do with this boy.\u201d</p> <p>These nimble additions put a fresh orange coat on the 1934 narrative but Sinclair Lewis\u2019s original book was eerily on the nose. Lewis describes Windrip as \u201cvulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \u201cideas\u201d almost idiotic\u201d. He is backed by \u201cThe League of Forgotten Men\u201d \u2013 men who would fit well into a basket of deplorables one imagines. To add to the festive election spirit, the theater audience is instructed to cheer and boo on command. Placards are thrust into our hands. Flags are waved.</p> <p>But after Windrip is elected, the play loses some of its cleverness. The genre shifts to wartime noir as paramilitary thugs squash dissent, martial law is imposed, jails spill over into concentration camps and a resistance movement forms. But for all the high stakes suspense and totalitarian brutality, the stage action fizzles. It\u2019s hard to care about resistance fighters who spout undiluted ideology. </p> <p>To the extent that there are parallels to contemporary politics in the play\u2019s second half, it\u2019s the Bush administration that one sees reflected \u2013 scoundrels exploiting patriotism and snatching liberties in the name of freedom. Lewis even anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/sorryforthefreedomfries\">freedom fries</a>; Jessup recalls the war hysteria that had them calling sauerkraut liberty cabbage.</p> <p>From our vantage point, this as an eerily prescient foreshadowing of current affairs. But like some other politically knowing dystopian narratives, (Orwell\u2019s 1984<em> </em>for one) Lewis was writing about the state of his own contemporary society. His objective was to take down presidential hopeful Huey Long \u2013 who was actually assassinated before the election. In Sinclair Lewis\u2019s call to arms, the fearless journalist and his printing press is the final image that inspires hope for political change. Eighty-one years later, Americans might be forgiven for believing that that won\u2019t happen here.</p>",

  "<p></p> <p>After a week of listening to Donald Trump supporters defend his longstanding biting remarks about the supposed weight gain and personal history of a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, who now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">supports the candidacy of Hillary Clinton</a>, one might be forgiven for thinking that Republicans are tone-deaf about the experience of most women in America in 2016.</p> <p>The National Republican Campaign Committee, though, is perfectly well aware that most women have a strongly negative response to body shaming. That\u2019s probably why, in a close race for a congressional seat in Maine, it started running <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8huR_LQwq4\">an ad</a> last week accusing the Democratic candidate of pushing legislation designed to body-shame teenage girls.</p> <p>The problems: the Democratic candidate is a woman, Emily Cain; and the ad is misleading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/alicia-machado-donald-trump-backlash-smear\">Alicia Machado told the truth about Trump, and the backlash is terrifying | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cain is infuriated by the NRCC ad and, in response, released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDvkuwylebA\">one of her own</a> on Tuesday directly addressing her own weight issues. \u201cLike a lot of women, I\u2019ve struggled with my weight,\u201d she says in the ad. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very personal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe issue of women and girls, and body issues and self-esteem, is a core issue of mine,\u201d she told the Guardian. </p> <p>The original ad drawing Cain\u2019s ire claims that she supported a bipartisan bill to start to address childhood obesity \u2013 about 30% of Maine\u2019s children were considered overweight or obese <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/stateprograms/fundedstates/pdf/Maine-State-Profile.pdf\">in 2010</a> \u2013 that would have required schools to regularly weigh children and report aggregate data to the state. In the ad, the legislation is derided by women, posing with school-age children, as \u201ca violation of our kids\u2019 privacy\u201d and deemed an effort to weigh \u201cour teenage girls\u201d. The bill failed to pass<strong> </strong>in that session, and schools were asked to submit the data to the state on a voluntary basis, since many of them collect it anyway. Similar legislation passed the following year.</p> <p>Cain called the attack ad \u201cway over the line\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is really exploiting the vulnerabilities of teenage girls and their families.\u201d</p> <p>And though she was expecting conservatives in the state to attack her about the legislation \u2013 they did in her first race for the seat, in 2014 \u2013 she was surprised that Republicans went the body-shaming route instead of sticking to privacy. \u201cI don\u2019t know why politicians want to keep talking about women\u2019s weight,\u201d she said. But she added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to run away and hide from this attack.\u201d</p> <p>Still, forcing a woman to defend her legislative efforts to identify and eventually reduce childhood obesity by accusing her of trying to invade the privacy of teenage girls is an interesting tactic for a party whose standard-bearer has <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/10/donald-trump-women-insults-megyn-kelly/31407363/\">repeatedly dismissed women</a> who disagreed with him as unattractive or overweight.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s statements are reportedly having an effect, though perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-alicia-machado-republican-women-sexism?CMP=edit_2221\">not with conservative-leaning women</a> who already support him.</p> <p>At a Clinton rally on Tuesday, a 15-year-old girl told the nominee: \u201cI see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about women and how they look.\u201d She asked how to \u201cundo some of that damage\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s advice: \u201cWe need to laugh at it, we need to refute it, we need to ignore it.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>On Sunday, a 200-person flashmob appeared in New York City\u2019s Union Square.

Kneeling at a coffee table in their Williamsburg apartment after an all-night session of editing, holding a half-eaten apple which she jokingly described as their collective breakfast, she told me, \u201cWe were tired of the narrative of the candidates being \u2018two sides of the same coin\u2019 with one as a lesser evil. We wanted to turn attention to the positive qualities of Hillary, and focus on the people in the United States that she and her campaign are including.\u201d </p> <p>Lidofsky, whose first TV series, <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/strangers-an-original-series-by-mia-lidofsky#/\">Strangers</a>, will premiere early next year on Refinery29, added, \u201cEver since Hillary announced her run for the presidency, there\u2019s been a heightened sense of sexism in the air and in the press. There\u2019s such a double standard in the media. They focus on her emails, her apparent lack of transparency, and how much she smiles and what she wears. And we wanted to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re behind you. And we wanted to pay homage to her pantsuits, as we think of them as her superhero costume. She\u2019s a superhero to us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rowlson-Hall and Lidofsky met while both working on the set of Lena Dunham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls\">Girls</a><em>. </em>They belong to a vibrant community of young, creative women making their own way in an often male-driven film and television industry \u2013 the type of people, perhaps, that you might have expected to have supported Bernie Sanders. \u201cSo many of my friends were supporting Bernie and I wanted to make it clear that I was \u2018with her\u2019,\u201d said Lidofsky, with a nod to Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan. She cited Clinton\u2019s pragmatism and experience as the reason she voted for her in the primaries. \u201cShe\u2019s a warrior and a pioneer,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s been working for 35 years, and I look at that as a way to progressively and actively change the system, because she understands it.\u201d</p> <p>What a Clinton presidency would mean for America is something that Rowlson-Hall, whose work is always imbued with meticulous symbolism, gave careful consideration while choreographing for the flashmob. Each movement of the dance contains messages about issues at stake in this election, like a thumb and forefinger motion that represents an ovary and reproductive rights, or a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic national convention</a>: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c0279f7ece63efee38a77f95c6d9439c86d0f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c0279f7ece63efee38a77f95c6d9439c86d0f7c/144_53_1538_923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mia Lidofsky (left) and Celia Rowlson-Hall: \u2018Hillary\u2019s a superhero to us\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mia Lidofsky, left, and Celia Rowlson-Hall: \u2018Hillary\u2019s a superhero to us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Crozier</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Participants in the dance travelled from as far as Toronto, and included US residents with green cards who couldn\u2019t vote, but wanted to \u201ccontribute to world peace\u201d. Men danced alongside women, and all ages were represented. In one sequence, the camera pans from a pregnant dancer to a woman dancing with her toddler on her hip.</p> <p>Children made the shoot seem even more crucial. \u201cThere was this moment when these little girls arrived in their soccer outfits to the rehearsal,\u201d said Rowlson-Hall, \u201cThey\u2019d just come from a game, and their moms had brought them to learn the dance. I started weeping. I thought, \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re fighting for them\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The resulting video is an uplifting burst of energy, a tonic to the often negative and divisive tone of the election. \u201cWe believe that with empathy, the story can be changed,\u201d said Lidofsky, who as an LGBT woman found herself psychologically affected by the Orlando shooting this summer. \u201cFor the first time in my life [after Orlando], I felt like a target, and I felt that my partner and the love of my life was a target. A lot of our black friends have expressed that they were born into that fear. This video was about the message of love over hate, and reaching out to our communities and shining a light on how Hillary could support us, and how, in the end, your vote matters.\u201d</p> <p>Within a few hours, the first share of the video had been viewed 300,000 times on Facebook. Should one of those viewers include Hillary Clinton, Lidofsky and Rowlson-Hall had one message for her.</p> <p>\u201cHillary, we love you, we\u2019re with you, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d said Lidofsky. </p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d added Rowlson-Hall, laughing, \u201cwe will choreograph your inauguration entrance.\u201d</p>",

Other notable expenditures involving charitable money include $12,000 on a helmet signed by football player Tim Tebow, $20,000 on a six-foot portrait of himself and some years later, $10,000 on another portrait of himself.</p> <p>The Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold began looking into the foundation after Trump solicited donations at an Iowa fundraiser for veterans. The candidate claimed he raised \u201c$6m\u201d from the fundraiser, which he held in lieu of attending a Republican debate, and pledged the money would be distributed to veterans\u2019 groups. The campaign later <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-said-he-raised-6-million-for-vets-now-his-campaign-says-it-was-less/2016/05/20/871127a8-1d1f-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html\">conceded he raised less</a>. Still later it was revealed that much of the money was not distributed to veterans\u2019 groups until after the paper raised questions about the whereabouts of the donations.</p> <h2>Who is investigating the allegations?</h2> <p>The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/donald-trump-foundation-donations-new-york\"> issued a notice </a>this week after the Post reported that the charity did not have the correct paperwork to solicit donations. </p> <p>According to the notice, the Trump foundation must immediately cease fundraising and soliciting contributions in the state, wrote James Sheehan, the head of the charities bureau in Schneiderman\u2019s office. The foundation has 15 days to provide the bureau with the proper documentation and paperwork, including delinquent financial reports for previous years, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. Failure to do so \u201cshall be deemed a continuing fraud upon the people of New York\u201d, Sheehan wrote.</p> <p>In a statement, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks replied: \u201cWhile we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneiderman\u2019s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Last month Schneiderman, a Democrat supporting Hillary Clinton, launched a broad investigation into the Trump Foundation amid a string of reports that raised questions over its practices. Schneiderman is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/eric-schneiderman-trump-university-fraud-223812\">also suing the Republican nominee </a>over Trump University, alleging that the businessman ran a fraudulent online education program that bilked students. </p> <h2>What does this mean for Trump?</h2> <p>It\u2019s not yet clear how this will affect Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions. A failure to comply could lead to further action by the attorney general\u2019s office. </p> <p>Past controversies have failed to dent his appeal to his supporters, but the the cease-and-desist notice follows a particularly bruising week for the Republican nominee. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s week on the campaign trail, dubbed his worst of the presidential race, was marked by a poorly reviewed debate performance, a Twitter-fueled feud with a former Miss Universe, who he shamed for gaining weight, and a stunning <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">report by the New York Times</a> that the Republican may not have paid federal income tax for 18 years after declaring nearly $1bn on his federal income tax returns. A slate of recent national and battleground state polls show that support for Trump has dropped, giving Clinton a significant lead.</p> <p>The controversy around Trump\u2019s foundation came up during Tuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate. Governor Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s running mate, defended the foundation: \u201cThey give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine interjected: \u201cA $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?\u201d</p>",

Instead he hailed his work on the issue as governor of Indiana and in Congress. </p> <p>Ashley Bell, the director of African American outreach for the RNC, told the Guardian: \u201cDonald Trump is the top of the ticket so [Pence] will adopt Donald Trump\u2019s position on criminal justice reform.\u201d Bell, a longtime advocate for criminal justice reform with the Republican party, also insisted that when Trump referred to stop-and-frisk he was referring simply to a brief \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_stop\">Terry stop</a>\u201d. \u201cHow a city applies Terry stops can or can not be constitutional,\u201d he added. </p> <p>He went on to argue that \u201cthe application of stop-and-frisk under [former New York mayor Michael] Bloomberg was deemed unconstitutional but under [Bloomberg\u2019s predecessor Rudy] Giuliani, it was a completely different practice.\u201d </p> <p>Bell said that the practice \u201cwas two different things\u201d and that stops increased from 100,000 to 600,000 in the transition between the two administrations. \u201cWhen you have a six-time increase in stop-and-frisk, that\u2019s going to raise some significant challenges,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, Democratic congressman Ruben Gallego of Arizona bashed Pence for his defense of stop-and-frisk. \u201cTo say stop-and-frisk will be welcomed in minority communities shows how out of touch you are.\u201d </p> <p>Gallego continued: \u201cNo community, minority or not, rich or not, wants to be treated as an automatic criminal and the fact that Mike Pence would be so ignorant to even think that really shows you how out of touch he is with any minority community.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Poland is unlikely to back Donald Tusk\u2019s bid to stay on as president of the European council, the head of the country\u2019s governing rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) has said, in a move that could destabilise the EU during Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine the government will back Donald Tusk for a second term,\u201d Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the former prime minister and Poland\u2019s de facto kingmaker, told the Polska Times newspaper. \u201cIs this the sort of person who should remain at the head of the European council?

  "<p>This weekend, as Donald Trump went into freefall so drastic and self-defeating we had to wonder if <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">he was the one</a> who mailed his tax forms to the New York Times, his campaign sent out a supposed elder statesman to defend him: Rudy Giuliani.</p> <p>That Giuliani should be viewed as a credible and authoritative voice is as laughable as Trump\u2019s combover.</p> <p>To people around the world, Giuliani may still seem like a paragon of leadership, the man who saved New York City in the dark days after the twin towers fell 15 years ago. But if you can cast your mind back to those days, you\u2019ll also remember how he crudely tried to manipulate the fear of that moment in a naked power grab. Giuliani <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121313&amp;page=1\">considered running for a third term</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/04/nyregion/giuliani-says-he-won-t-seek-a-third-term.html\">delaying his departure</a> from office (despite the law).</p> <p>And if you think of how people love to say that Giuliani\u2019s follies can be excused by the fact that he \u201cmade New York safe\u201d, remember: his signature technique, \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, is a fraud, and he did not make it safe for young black and Hispanic men, for the mentally ill, or for the poor.</p> <p>It is frightening to hear Trump say he wants to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-national-stop-and-frisk-policy-for-cops-does-it-work/\">develop a national stop and frisk policy</a>, in which police are encouraged to stop and search people all the time, because it threatens the fourth amendment and will lead to more racial profiling. But it\u2019s even more chilling to hear Giuliani still touting it and lying that <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/09/28/giuliani_stop_frisk_blind.php\"> it saved black lives</a>. Under Giuliani, the NYPD ramped up this controversial practice, which is currently under federal monitoring for unfairly targeting young black and brown men <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/fact-check-stop-and-frisk/\">and for being unconstitutional \u201cas applied\u201d</a>. Crime has gone down in New York City even as the use of this ruinous technique has <a href=\"http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data\">decreased</a>, so reliance on it was meaningless except as a form of social control.</p> <p>While Giuliani was mayor, the NYPD\u2019s use of stop and frisk led to the arrest of the most people ever arrested for marijuana in a single year, despite the <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/young-mens-initiative-the-white-mayors-burden-6433075\">decriminalization</a> of small amounts of pot in 1977: <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Levine_NYC_MJ_Arrest_Crusade_Continues_Sept_2009.pdf\">more than 50,000 people were arrested in 2000</a>, Giuliani\u2019s penultimate year in office. Of those, 85% were black or Hispanic, <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/young-mens-initiative-the-white-mayors-burden-6433075\">even though</a> \u2013 according to the NYPD\u2019s own data \u2013 \u201cwhites demonstrate slightly higher rates of contraband\u201d when stopped.</p> <p>Years before he called the Black Lives Matter movement \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rudy-giuliani-black-kids-99-chance-killing-article-1.2706349\">inherently racist</a>\u201d, or said that \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rudy-giuliani-black-kids-99-chance-killing-article-1.2706349\">there\u2019s a 99% chance</a>\u201d black children will kill each other, he was making life hell for the families of victims of police violence. For example, when Patrick Dorismond was killed after he rebuffed requests from undercover police asking where they could buy marijuana (the same year, remember, as the record marijuana arrests occurred), Giuliani <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,41921,00.html\">said Dorismond was</a> \u201cno altar boy\u201d and said a charge he once faced as a child over a fistfight (later dropped) \u201cmay justify, more closely, what the police officer did\u201d. (As Politico <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-2016-214207#ixzz4M3mCX6ee\">reported</a>, despite the post-mortem smear, it emerged that Dorismond was an alumnus of the same Catholic school Giuliani attended, and that he had in fact been an altar boy.)</p> <p>Then there was Giuliani\u2019s war on the homeless. While he was running for Senate (before dropping out) in the fall of 1999, \u201cGiuliani ordered that all \u2018able-bodied\u2019 homeless people must go to work or risk losing their city-provided shelter and possibly their children to foster care,\u201d <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,35839,00.html\">Time reported</a>. And if you want to understand how so much of American life has become criminalized for the poor, consider how Giuliani <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/20/nyregion/in-wake-of-attack-giuliani-cracks-down-on-homeless.html\">said</a> the right to sleep on the streets \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist anywhere\u201d, raising the prospect of those who were unable to find shelter being arrested.</p> <p>If Trump wants an elder statesman who shows that his team is full of calm, steady, thoughtful people, Giuliani is hardly the face he needs. But if Trump wants to show who he is and how he\u2019d lead, then this aggressive, offensive purveyor of failed policies maybe is a good spokesman for him after all.</p>",

Since the December 2010 awards, corruption has been exposed in the global game, with the then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter among those now banned from the game.</p> <p>Montagliani, speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference in London, said: \u201cIf Russia and Qatar wouldn\u2019t have got these World Cups would we be in this situation now with an opportunity to clean the game?</p> <p>\u201cI think that was the starting point and the tipping point for certain things to happen. If England and the US had got the World Cup, maybe we would\u2019ve had status quo. I\u2019m just wondering if the authorities that have stepped up their involvement in the game would\u2019ve done that if the choices had been a bit different. Maybe the best thing that happened in football was Russia and Qatar.\u201d</p> <p>Montagliani, a Canadian, was elected Concacaf president this year, following the disgraced Jeffrey Webb as leader of North American, Central American and Caribbean football. Montagliani is also an ally of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who was named Blatter\u2019s successor in February.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/world-cup-expand-48-teams-fifa-gianni-infantino-suggests\" title=\"\"> Infantino has raised the prospect of expanding the World Cup from 32 teams to 40</a> \u2013 and now 48. Fifa, which governs 211 nations, who all take part in World Cup qualifying, is expected to decide on the format for the 2026 tournament early next year.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s not going to stay at 32 for 2026. I think it\u2019s going to change,\u201d Montagliani added. \u201cIf we listened to traditionalists we\u2019d still have a 16-team World Cup. And there is a balance. You don\u2019t want 211 countries in a World Cup either.</p> <p>\u201cBut the reality is that the World Cup is such a strong brand and inspires a lot of hope and inspiration in countries. For them just to dream about it, never mind get a piece of it, provides a lot of groundswell in those countries to promote the game. I think it\u2019s an opportunity and I think the president is right to really look at it. Should it expand? I think the answer is probably yes. I think [the question] now is: \u2018What\u2019s the format?\u201d\u2019</p> <p>Montagliani says the United States, Canada and Mexico may host the World Cup themselves, but a regional bid is possible, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s time it does come back to Concacaf. We haven\u2019t had it since 1994 [USA],\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudice their own individual positions, but as Concacaf president I don\u2019t see any negatives in terms of a regional bid.\u201d</p> <p>Concacaf has struggled with corruption perhaps more than any other of Fifa\u2019s six confederations, with Montagliani seeking to address the troubles and the image with the appointment of a first chief-compliance officer and a potential re-naming of the organisation. \u201cNo longer can a president or anyone else do things on a wink and a nod,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now [re-naming Concacaf] is an idea. We\u2019re looking at it. As an organisation you always have to look to change. Your brand or your name should not be exclusive of that. Part of it is the history, but part of it is also can we maximise in terms of leveraging a new brand and a new name.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Trump isn\u2019t <em>fit</em> to serve as president of the United States. Clinton isn\u2019t relating <em>emotionally</em> to the electorate. These points of contention seem to be at the heart of debates around this year\u2019s presidential election. Gone is the traditional division between left and right, or liberalism and conservatism. What we are seeing instead, is a competition between technocracy and populism.</p> <p>It is little surprise that this election has been described as a choice between the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d. We have a reliable, if uncharismatic, policy wonk on one hand; and an entertaining, if unpredictable, maverick on the other. And it is this opposition \u2013 competence v charisma \u2013 rather than substantive policy disagreements, that is framing the election.</p> <p>Consider that, when it comes to policy positions, these two candidates are among the most <em>different</em> in recent memory. Yet such differences don\u2019t really seem to be at the center of attention, either for the candidates themselves, or the public at large.</p> <p>In their recent debate, Clinton said explicitly that she intends to \u201cincrease taxes\u201d for the rich and address the \u201csystemic racism\u201d of the country\u2019s criminal justice system: positions that not even Obama had dared to take so plainly four or eight years ago. Trump instead declared he intends to lower taxes for the top income brackets and dismissed the problem of racism as a question of \u201claw and order\u201d. Similarly, on international trade, they took almost diametrically opposed stances: Clinton sees it as a factor of growth and stability, whereas Trump says trade is \u201ckilling our country\u201d.</p> <p>Yet all this somehow remains in the background. The real core of what Clinton was attempting to communicate is that she is more competent than her rival, because she has greater policy expertise. This explains her reliance on the opinion of \u201cindependent experts\u201d to make the case for her economic plan, as well as the insistence on \u201cfact-checking\u201d Trump\u2019s assertions.</p> <p>Conversely, most of Trump\u2019s efforts went into depicting Clinton as a political insider, who is responsible for the \u201cmess\u201d the country is supposedly in at the moment, while presenting himself as a \u201cstrong leader\u201d who can solve the country\u2019s problems precisely by virtue of his decisive and unconventional approach.</p> <p>The roots of this populist drift in the Republican party go back several decades. Although the party\u2019s current establishment professes to be outraged by at least some of Trump\u2019s excesses, there is a direct line of continuity running from the late 1990s\u2019 bid to impeach Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, to George W Bush\u2019s self-presentation as the candidate one would \u201cmost like to have beer with\u201d, the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2012 and many features of Trump\u2019s current campaign.</p> <p>The Democrats\u2019 response has been to move progressively towards the center, assuming the mantle of \u201creason\u201d and \u201crespectability\u201d, while presenting their rivals as irresponsible mavericks. No wonder the substantive policy differences between them have fallen into the background: when politics is structured around the opposition between competent technocrats on one hand and anti-establishment populists on the other, there is little room left for substantive policy disagreement in the middle.</p> <p>Nor is America alone in this shift. The debate over Brexit in the UK was fought along the same axis of opposition. The core of the Remain campaign\u2019s argument rested on the opinion of \u201cexperts\u201d, according to which leaving the European Union would have had objectively catastrophic consequences for the country. In contrast, the Leave campaign appealed to many of the same sentiments that underscore Trump\u2019s appeal: widespread anti-establishment feeling, guttural nationalism and concerns about immigration and international trade.</p> <p>The paradox is that all this is depoliticizing public debate, precisely as campaigns become more bitter and conflictual. Democratic politics depends on the confrontation between rival political agendas and ideological visions. But in the struggle between technocrats and populists all we are left with is the choice between preserving the system as it is or burning it all to the ground. For those who want meaningful political alternatives, this doesn\u2019t bode well. <br></p>",
  "<p>Nigel Farage has declared himself the interim leader of Ukip following the resignation of Diane James after just 18 days in the post.</p> <p>The MEP said he had spoken to the Electoral Commission, which confirmed he was technically still leader. He made the declaration amid rumours that Ukip\u2019s ruling body could try to install Neil Hamilton, the former Tory politician and Ukip leader in Wales, as temporary leader.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC2\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show, Farage said he hoped that \u201chorror show\u201d would not come to pass as Hamilton was not good for the image of the party.</p> <p>James stepped down saying she did not enjoy the support of MEPs or party officials for changes that needed to be carried out to Ukip\u2019s national executive. </p> <p>She was elected at Ukip\u2019s party conference last month, but in a statement released on Tuesday night she said she would not formalise her leadership.</p> <p>\u201cIt has become clear I do not have sufficient authority, nor the full support of MEP colleagues and party officers, to implement the changes I believe are necessary and upon which I based my campaign.\u201d</p> <p>However, Farage claimed she had a \u201cpersonal problem\u201d relating to the health of a family member and had been shaken by being spat at while at Waterloo station.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as the party is concerned, it\u2019s not a great day but it not the end of the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A Ukip source said James had filled in an official form to take over control of the party and added the words \u201cunder duress\u201d in Latin; and confirmed that Farage himself believed he may \u201ctechnically\u201d still be leader \u2013 but had no intention of running in a new contest.</p> <p>Farage told the Press Association that he would not return as Ukip leader \u201cfor $10m\u201d. Asked if he\u2019d take $20m, he replied: \u201cNo I\u2019m not coming back. I\u2019m retired.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier Paul Oakden, the Ukip chairman, when asked who was currently leader of the party, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIn my mind it is Diane James; she has quit indeed, but that doesn\u2019t mean she is not the leader until a new leader is appointed.\u201d</p> <p>But he said he would consult the Electoral Commission on Wednesday, adding: \u201cIf they still have Nigel Farage down as leader, that will make it a very interesting day for me, I suspect.\u201d</p> <p>Oakden said he had not spoken to James directly about her resignation, and insisted: \u201cBoth I and the NEC have been consistently supportive of Diane since she was elected as leader.\u201d He added: \u201cThe job of being leader is often very difficult from the job of running to be leader.\u201d</p> <p>The Electoral Commission said Ukip submitted the paperwork notifying it of the change in leadership on Monday, although it had not been processed as officials had questions regarding the completion of the form. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are aware that the newly elected leader of Ukip has now stood down and are in touch with the party to confirm how they wish to proceed regarding updating their entry on the statutory register,\u201d a spokesman said. </p> <p>James, who was chosen by Ukip\u2019s members after Farage stepped down in the wake of the Brexit vote, said she would continue as MEP for South East England.</p> <p>Discussions are taking place within the party about holding a snap two-week election to install a new leader quickly, with former deputy Paul Nuttall and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\">disqualified former candidate Steven Woolfe</a> two possible candidates.<br></p> <p>Raheem Kassam, the former chief of staff to Farage who left after the election, has confirmed he will run for the leadership. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/19/ukip-suzanne-evans-unsacked-media-spokesperson\">Suzanne Evans</a>, the former deputy chair who clashed with Farage, could also try again after she missed out because she was suspended at the time of the last contest, while Lisa Duffy, who ran against James, also said she could participate.</p> <p>Two other candidates who lost to James told the Guardian they would also consider standing again. Phillip Broughton, who fought the Hartlepool seat at the 2015 general election, said he would \u201crule nothing out\u201d. Bill Etheridge, a West Midlands MEP, said he might step forward \u201cif there is no other serious libertarian candidate\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>An MEP for South East England since 2014, 56-year-old James was the Eurosceptic party\u2019s first female leader and won the post by a wide margin after securing the backing of senior Ukip figures including Farage. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In her acceptance speech, she promised to bring a new professionalism to the party, saying: \u201cWe are going to confound our critics, we are going to outwit our opponents, we are going to build on our election success that we have achieved to date and do more.\u201d</p> <p>But questions were raised about her commitment to the post after she declined to take part in hustings debates around the country with rival candidates.</p> <p>After a career in the healthcare sector, she was elected to Waverley borough council in Surrey as an independent in 2007 after becoming disillusioned with the Conservatives.</p> <p>She switched to Ukip in 2011 and shot to national prominence in 2013 when she fought the parliamentary byelection in Eastleigh, Hampshire, which was triggered by the downfall of cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who was jailed for lying about a speeding offence. She came close to taking the seat from the Liberal Democrats, coming second with 27.8%, fewer than 2,000 votes behind the winning candidate.</p> <p>James raised some eyebrows in a 2015 interview when she declared her admiration for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, describing him as a strong leader who stood up for his country.</p> <p>Her elevation to the leadership of the party meant that Ukip joined the Conservatives, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru in having a female politician at the helm, while the Greens have a woman as job-sharing co-leader.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DianeJamesMEP/status/783418481333137409/photo/1\"><br></a></p>",

It\u2019s a nice touch, much like the permanently pained look on his face. </p> <p>But at Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why Pence was so unhappy. Was he opposed to every word coming out of Tim Kaine\u2019s mouth? Or was he just dismayed at his own situation?</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy campaigning as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. You can\u2019t admit the obvious: that your presidential candidate is hiding his tax returns, stoking racism and spooking allies around the world. </p> <p>So you have to deny Trump\u2019s quotes, or accuse your opponent of hurling insults. But most of all, you have to look affable while your running mate looked irascible.</p> <p>In that sense, Pence succeeded in beating his boss. The problem is: so did Kaine. </p> <p>If Kaine had one job, it was to repeat as loudly and frequently as possible all the dumb and offensive words that have tumbled out of Trump\u2019s curled lips.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vice-president-debate-fact-check-mike-pence-tim-kaine\">VP debate fact-check: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t a pretty night for the Democratic veep pick. He interrupted too often and smiled too little. He was forced to repeat Trump\u2019s worst insults. He looked and sounded too hot, where his rival looked and sounded too sincere.</p> <p>But in truth, neither man seemed comfortable in their designated role. Like two insurance salesmen getting drunk at their annual trade conference, Kaine and Pence were just trying too hard.</p> <p>Kaine tried to beat Pence into submission with pesky facts. Pence tried to smother his facts with a syrupy version of Ronald Reagan. \u201cYou can roll out the numbers and the sunny side,\u201d Pence said, \u201cbut people in Scranton know different.\u201d</p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss Kaine-Pence as a sideshow.

While Pence kept his cool, Kaine tried to imitate Joe Biden\u2019s interruption-heavy performance against Paul Ryan in 2012 \u2013 without half his charisma. Kaine\u2019s biggest downfall, though, may not have been about tone. </p> <p>Compared to Kaine, Pence told a compelling \u2013 if terrifyingly cynical and blatantly false \u2013 story of a country that has lost its way, and how he and Trump intend to restore it. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d might be one of the best political slogans of the past decade. But Trump owes its creation to people such as Margaret Thatcher and Reagan, who worked to spread the neoliberal gospel that\u2019s now seeped into both parties. That evangelizing project has been incredibly successful, with each candidate airing concerns about government spending, personal responsibility and the limits of American coffers.</p> <p>There were glaring omissions tonight, too. Despite a series of increasingly brutal projections about the likelihood of catastrophic global warming, talk of climate change was limited to a few coded words at the debate\u2019s start, like the mythical \u201cwar on coal\u201d and \u201cclean energy jobs of tomorrow.\u201d A cringe-worthy conversation about criminal justice reform somehow managed not to breach mass incarceration. And a brief discussion of reproductive rights \u2013 one that should have been up top given Pence\u2019s deplorable record on the issue \u2013 got shunted to the very end.</p> <p>The Democratic party has spent the past several decades pivoting around terms of debate set by the right. Kaine\u2019s loss in tonight\u2019s debate showed just how much work the Democrats \u2013 and the social movements pushing them \u2013 need to do to recenter the conversation. </p> <p>More than the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d Kaine and Clinton keep pushing, the Democratic party needs a surge in imagination, to do more than play defense against attacks from across the aisle and propose transformative solutions, in line with the pain many Americans today are facing. That was sorely missing tonight. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carla-sorey-reed\">Carla Sorey-Reed:</a> Pence is a prettier, more practiced Trump<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a8433f1e02dec97d23adf7ba1c40208f71e54c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a8433f1e02dec97d23adf7ba1c40208f71e54c2/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Richard Wolffe\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Kaine and Pence had a relatively balanced debate \u2013 no knockouts. Two experienced politicians dispatched to further the rhetoric of their campaigns and defend the candidates at the top of the ticket. Neither disappointed. </p> <p>At the start, when asked what made him a good candidate for the vice-presidency, Kaine faltered. Looking down, he rushed a heavily scripted first answer, told through the filter of Clinton\u2019s point of view, that took too long and strained to connect back to the question. Kaine directed his entire answer off camera, which greatly reduced his engagement with the television audience. </p> <p>Pence restated Trump\u2019s conservative positions, doubling down on wealth and whiteness for the win. Pence tried to spin away from Kaine\u2019s points on policy, using plain speak \u2013 the common language of the Trump campaign. When Kaine pushed Pence on social security, all that Pence could offer was: \u201cThere they go again. We\u2019re going to meet our obligations to seniors.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bd31e8805336ac7f00621b495777de931f074cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd31e8805336ac7f00621b495777de931f074cd/0_48_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Pence won the debate by a landslide.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pence won the debate by a landslide.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was on the topics of policing, immigration and women that the difference between the men and their campaigns was made most clear.

Kaine spoke of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d and \u201cbuilding bonds of understanding\u201d while Pence seemed annoyed with the topic and impatiently attempted to dress down his opponent by saying \u201c\u2026 enough of seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs\u201d. A frightening reality check for minorities. </p> <p>On immigration, Pence offered more thinly veiled hate with \u201ctoo often with criminal aliens in the country, it\u2019s bringing heartbreak\u201d. If only Kaine had challenged him right then and there. As the debate went on, Kaine grew stronger, relying less on prepared statements and messages, and listening and responding in real time. <br></p> <p>In the words of Kaine: \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks ... Donald Trump is showing you who he is.\u201d Pence speaks the same, only prettier and more practiced.

But unlike Trump, Pence apparently isn\u2019t prone to chasing shiny objects. <br></p> <p>Constantly interrupting Pence and speaking at a mile a minute, Kaine tried for the life of him to get Pence to discuss Trump\u2019s racist attack on Indiana Judge Gonzalo Curiel, Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims, Trump\u2019s praise of Vladimir Putin, Trump\u2019s call to deport all illegal immigrants, and so on and so forth. Whatever the accuracy of Kaine\u2019s attacks on Trump \u2013 and make no mistake, they were often accurate \u2013 Kaine\u2019s style was excessive. By throwing out so many issues in one breath, he made his rhetorical assault hard for viewers to follow. He also made it easy for Pence to ignore him with a shake of the head \u2013 a nonverbal \u201cthere you go again\u201d.</p> <p>Kaine\u2019s constant \u201cI know it all\u201d interruptions might be considered the 2016 version of Al Gore\u2019s groans. It made him come across as a thoroughly unlikable figure. </p> <p>By contrast, Pence was calm and cool. He methodically hammered home the Trump campaign\u2019s positive themes \u2013 let\u2019s get America\u2019s economy moving again, let\u2019s put American workers first, let\u2019s bring back American jobs, let\u2019s project strength in the world, America needs change. </p> <p>Sure, these are broad themes, but presented in Pence\u2019s confident manner, they resonate. Like Kaine, Pence had his share of canned lines. Unlike Kaine, he was able to deliver them in a way that made them appear sincere and sometimes even heartfelt. Performance matters. </p> <p>Pence won the debate by a landslide, and it\u2019s hard to imagine there will be many in the media who will even attempt to claim otherwise. The only question is how his running mate\u2019s fragile ego will react when all those who panned his debate skills praise Pence\u2019s. <br></p>",

There is little chance of any developments in the Trump case before the presidential election, but a court in Maryland, where the lawsuit was filed, has scheduled a status conference in December. </p> <p>Harder, 46, grew up in Encino, Los Angeles, where his father was a financial consultant and his mother a homemaker. He attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he became involved in student politics, and later enrolled in law school at Loyola. \u201cI grew out of politics and when I was in law school, I needed a job after I finished to pay off all my student loans, which were massive,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He went on to work for a series of firms <a href=\"http://hmafirm.com/attorney/charles-j-harder/\">before starting his own</a>, and made a name for himself representing high-profile clients such as Sandra Bullock, Bradley Cooper, George Clooney, and Clint Eastwood, mainly in disputes involving advertising.

In March, a Florida jury made shockwaves by awarding Bollea $140m \u2013 $40m more than Harder had originally requested \u2013 and soon thereafter, Gawker, once a leader in digital media, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">filed for bankruptcy</a>. Gawker.com was soon <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/18/gawker-to-close-univision-sale\">shut down by its new owner, Univision</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The case wasn\u2019t entirely black and white, and controversy abounded when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit\">it emerged that Bollea\u2019s lawsuit was actually funded by Peter Thiel</a>, a Silicon Valley billionaire and co-founder of PayPal, who had had his own issues with Gawker in the past after the site published an article about his sexuality. Press freedom advocates feared that the verdict would pave the way for other rich and powerful people to pursue personal vendettas by giving financial backing to chosen litigants in order to take down those who had wronged them. It is not a fear Harder shares.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a meritorious case,\u201d he says. \u201cIf my firm had taken on the case on a contingency fee basis, if a public interest organisation had taken on the case, if the client had paid for the case himself, or if he had gotten funding from an outside litigation funding company, he would still have gotten the verdict that he got. Mr Thiel just happened to pay Hulk Hogan\u2019s costs, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the merits of the case. Gawker had violated his privacy, violated the law, and a jury ruled in his favour. That\u2019s why the case ended up the way that it did.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Hogan verdict, Harder\u2019s list of influential clients has been growing. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/03/amber-heard-johnny-depp-divorce-blackmail-suit-doug-stanhope\">He was hired by Amber Heard to sue the comedian Doug Stanhope</a> after he wrote online that the actress was blackmailing her estranged husband Johnny Depp, whom she had accused of spousal abuse. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61d2be5c-7382-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a\">He was hired by the former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes to challenge negative media coverage in New York magazine</a> over sexual harassment allegations against him by his former colleagues, a partnership that led to one Forbes writer dubbing Harder <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/katiasav/status/773220883133497348\">\u201cthe rich man\u2019s favourite tool for assaulting journalism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But perhaps his most intriguing relationship is the one he has with the Trumps.<br></p> <p>It is somewhat unusual for a major party\u2019s presidential nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication so close to an election, but Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing legal action. The GOP candidate, who has banned publications such as the Washington Post, Politico <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">and a Guardian reporter and photographer from covering some of his events</a>, recently tweeted that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-irresponsible-intent\">his lawyers wanted him to sue the New York Times</a> for \u201cirresponsible intent\u201d in reports. While Trump never specifically mentioned Harder, some have speculated as to whether the lawyer will be acting as his right-hand man.</p> <p>When I put this to Harder, he laughs and firmly states: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, period. I don\u2019t represent Donald Trump, I represent his wife; it\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, does he agree with Trump that the hurdle established in the landmark supreme court decision in New York Times v Sullivan (1964), which requires public figures who bring defamation lawsuits against the media to establish \u201cactual malice\u201d, should be challenged?</p> <p>\u201cSeparate and apart from anything that Donald Trump has ever said, I\u2019ve always felt that the \u2018actual malice\u2019 standard is unreasonable,\u201d Harder says. \u201cJustice Byron White, who voted in favour of the standard in the New York Times v Sullivan case, 20 years later wrote a dissent in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet case, saying we all got it wrong, that the standard is far too high and it\u2019s very difficult for people who are public figures to prevail when they are actually defamed. I agree with him.\u201d</p> <p>As far as public figures go, does Harder think there is a difference between suits that come from celebrities and those that come from politicians, due to varying levels of public interest, and if so, should the term \u201cpublic figures\u201d be split into two?</p> <p>\u201cI do think that in the context of a political campaign, if a reporter is writing about issues that are relevant to the political campaign, there is some leeway there and there should be some leeway there,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re electing a Congress member, a senator, a governor, a president, or any other person to elective office, that is different from just the public\u2019s curiosity about somebody\u2019s sex life, somebody who is not seeking public office, who just happens to be an actor or a recording artist. I do think that those two have a different public importance.</p> <p>\u201cBut my view is this: if it\u2019s defamation, it\u2019s problematic, inherently. The actual malice standard basically says, \u2018OK, you do have defamation but there\u2019s an additional standard that needs to be overcome if you\u2019re a public figure.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6a9b428da1655204ccad2f302e1ffbb6160d5a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a9b428da1655204ccad2f302e1ffbb6160d5a1/234_137_2582_1549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Denton, founder of Gawker, clashed with Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan, before the site declared bankruptcy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Denton, founder of Gawker, clashed with Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan, before the site declared bankruptcy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though he views libel laws as outdated, Harder has never seen himself as an adversary of the free press and disagrees with depictions of him as such. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m an advocate of responsible free press, but when people choose to tell lies about others, they\u2019re exposing themselves. Sometimes when people lie and lie, they become emboldened that they can get away with anything, and then they tell bigger and bigger lies against various people, some of whom can afford to bring an action. The takeaway is that news organisations need to be responsible, just like lawyers, doctors, and teachers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Daily Mail said the newspaper had \u201coffered Mr Harder the opportunity to agree wording for the retraction days \u2013 not several weeks \u2013 after publication\u201d and that \u201cinstead of taking that opportunity, he rushed to file a lawsuit later the same day\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMr Harder\u2019s many public statements about the lawsuit have attracted vast amounts of media coverage, far more than the original article, which provoked very little response. The Daily Mail disagrees with Mr Harder\u2019s interpretation of the article as the retraction makes clear ... we note that, six weeks later, proceedings have still not been served by him in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Harder, meanwhile, says the recent increase in his profile hasn\u2019t changed his life much. \u201cI\u2019ve always been busy, I\u2019ve always been hardworking, and that remains. I\u2019ve got the same family, same house, same car, same routine.\u201d He spends his spare time with his wife and children, mostly going to places around LA and doing things together. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty boring life,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I enjoy it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On 23 February, Donald Trump stood before a rally of cheering supporters to celebrate a thumping victory in the Nevada Republican caucus \u2013 his third consecutive win, in defiance of the naysayers who had predicted that his bubble was about to burst. \u201cIf you listen to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win too much \u2013 and now we\u2019re winning, winning, winning the country,\u201d he bragged. \u201cWe won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>That last line provoked immediate waves of mockery. It sounded at the time like another one of Trump\u2019s many gaffes \u2013 he loves that people do not get a decent education? Yet behind the mockery was a real sense of disquiet, which has not gone away: Trump loves the less educated because they appear to love him back. As the Atlantic reported in March: \u201cThe best single predictor of Trump support in the Republican primary is the absence of a college degree.\u201d Education \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 seemed to be propelling the Trump bandwagon.</p> <p>The possibility that education has become a fundamental divide in democracy \u2013 with the educated on one side and the less educated on another \u2013 is an alarming prospect. It points to a deep alienation that cuts both ways. The less educated fear they are being governed by intellectual snobs who know nothing of their lives and experiences. The educated fear their fate may be decided by know-nothings who are ignorant of how the world really works. Bringing the two sides together is going to be very hard. The current election season appears to be doing the opposite.</p> <p>Trump continues to poll far ahead of Clinton among voters who did not go to college, while Clinton still leads by a considerable margin among college graduates. This is a significant change from 2012, when the picture was far more mixed. Four years ago, the college-educated vote was almost evenly split, with graduates favouring Obama over Romney by a narrow margin, 50 to 48. Recent polling puts Trump\u2019s lead over Clinton among <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/poll-trump-leads-clinton-76-percent-to-17-percent-among-white-men-without-college-degrees/\">white men without a college degree</a> at a sobering 76 to 19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/29/how-the-education-gap-is-tearing-politics-apart-podcast\">How the education gap is tearing politics apart \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there are other factors at play here. Race is one; gender is the other. The overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are white, regardless of their education levels. However, white men with a college degree split much more evenly between the candidates, whereas white women without a college degree still strongly favour Trump. Less educated voters who support Trump are not necessarily poor: many earn more than $50,000 (\u00a339,000) a year. Trump scores particularly well among small business owners who did not go to college. These polling numbers \u2013 which are only indicative, since no one has actually voted yet \u2013 can be unpicked a hundred different ways. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that how people vote is increasingly being shaped by how long they spent at school.</p> <p>What is happening in the United States has also been happening in the UK. The Brexit campaign had its own Trumpian moment, courtesy of Michael Gove, who told Faisal Islam in an interview on Sky News on 3 June that \u201cthe British people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">had enough of experts</a>\u201d. Gove was also widely mocked \u2013 if not experts, who was he proposing to get to repair his car, fix his teeth, teach his kids?</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what he said struck a deep chord, because it contained a large element of truth. The experts Gove was deriding had been telling the British public that the risks of Brexit far outweighed any potential benefits. Gove insisted that the voters should decide this for themselves, on the basis of their own experiences, rather than listening to elite voices that had a vested interest in the outcome. Those voices came trailing educational qualifications, which had put them in their positions of authority \u2013 at the IMF, the Bank of England, the Treasury. Gove was asking voters lacking anything like the same educational qualifications to feel empowered to reject what they were being told. And in the referendum on 23 June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">that is what they did</a>.</p> <p>Voters with postgraduate qualifications split 75 to 25 in favour of remain. Meanwhile, among those who left school without any qualifications, the vote was almost exactly reversed: 73 to 27 for leave. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/people-who-felt-marginalised-drove-brexit-vote-study-finds\">report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> last month confirmed that \u201ceducational opportunity was the strongest driver\u201d of the Brexit vote. Again, there were plenty of other factors at work \u2013 including a significant generational divide. Older voters were far more likely to vote leave, which partly helps to explain the education gap, since the rapid expansion of higher education in recent decades means older voters are also much less likely to have attended university. But the Rowntree report concludes that educational experience was the biggest single determinant of how people voted. Class still matters. Age still matters. But education appears to matter more.</p> <p>A post-Brexit electoral map of Britain starkly illustrates this new divide. Scotland voted remain for its own particular reasons. But in England and Wales, many university towns emerged from the referendum as isolated outposts of pro-EU sentiment in a sea of Brexit. Newcastle, York, Nottingham, Norwich, Cambridge, Brighton, Warwick, Exeter, Bristol, Reading, Oxford and Cardiff all voted remain. I live in Cambridge, which voted remain by a margin of 74 to 26. There was consternation here following the result. It was accompanied by a barely suppressed feeling that ignorance had won the day. I lost count of the number of times I was told that one of the top trending searches on Google in the immediate aftermath of the vote was: \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d The implication was that we had been taken out of Europe by people who did not even know what it was they were being asked to decide about.</p> <p>Few felt comfortable, at least in public, following this thought through to its logical conclusion. Yet it was hard to escape the sense that a long buried suspicion of democracy was fighting its way back to the surface. If politics has turned into a contest between ignorance and knowledge, then places like Cambridge may be starting to feel dismayed by the realisation they are now on the losing side. But that would be to fall into an old trap.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Elite anxiety about the consequences of political ignorance is nothing new. In the long history of intellectuals worrying about democracy and its failings, two basic fears keep nagging away. The first is that democracy will mean rule by the poor, who will use their power to steal from the rich. The second is that democracy will mean rule by the ignorant, who will use their power to do the dumbest things. Both these worries go back at least as far as Plato. The ancient Greeks understood full well that democracy meant letting the have-nots get their claws into the haves. For Aristotle, that\u2019s what the word meant: it was rule by the poor (the <em>demos</em>) over the wealthy. But if class conflict came with the territory, the deeper fear was what the masses might do out of sheer foolishness.</p> <p>For Plato, democracy suffered from the basic defect of putting decision-making in the hands of people who were not competent to decide. Politics was a skill \u2013 and most people were simply clueless. Worse, that made them prey for hucksters and demagogues who would promise the earth and get away with it. Democracy was fertile ground for fantasists with a taste for power. If you tell the people that up is down, and the people believe you, then who is going to let them know that they are wrong?</p> <p>These fears have never really gone away, and they reassert themselves at times of political crisis. In the 1920s, the American political commentator Walter Lippmann updated Plato for the 20th century by arguing that modern citizens simply lacked the mental capacity to process the information needed for intelligent decision-making. Lippmann had worked in American propaganda during the first world war and had seen at first hand just how easy it was to manipulate public opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no longer possible,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto believe in the original dogma of democracy: that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart.\u201d People will vote on the basis of anything that grabs their attention in a passing moment, filtered by whatever deep prejudices they harbour beneath the surface. Evidence means little to the average voter; reasoned argument means even less. Lippmann concluded that democracy could only be rescued by establishing a cadre of specially trained experts, whose job was to steer politicians away from the dubious instincts of the people and back towards what the evidence required. Otherwise, the manipulation of public opinion would become the be all and end all of democracy, which is all the encouragement demagogues ever need.</p> <p>Lippmann\u2019s fears chimed with the growing worry of some prominent mid-20th century economists that too much democratic decision-making would lead to financial ruin. A series of future Nobel prize winners, from Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman, channelled the ancient critics of democracy by arguing that putting the voters in charge meant short-term impulses would prevail over long-term prudence. Ultimately, they thought, democracy produced inflation, which was just another way of the poor getting their own back on the rich. Hayek and Friedman both put their ultimate faith in the power of markets. But first, they felt experts had to be empowered to rein in the self-destructive impulses of the voters. Hayek at one point advocated restricting the franchise to those aged 45, in order to cut out the young, who don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them, and the old, who have a vested interest in the past. Hayek did not believe that anyone, however expert, could know the future. But he wanted to put self-knowledge back at the heart of democracy: the worldly wisdom of understanding what is possible, and what is just wishful thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that ignorance is being set against knowledge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lippmann, Hayek and Friedman insisted they were trying to save democracy, not destroy it. But what they thought democracy needed saving from was itself. The voters had to be rescued from their preference for fairytales and the people peddling them. In the late 20th century, partly under the influence of such thinkers, democratic politics did carve out spaces where experts could be better insulated from the impulsive decision-making of the masses, as independent central banks and other unelected bodies were entrusted with more and more decision-making capacity, away from the glare of public opinion. Now, in the 21st century, these are the experts who find that the voters no longer want to heed their advice.</p> <p>In the year of Trump and Brexit, it is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that popular ignorance is once again being set against expert knowledge. Trump is what you get when demagoguery is allowed to run unchecked, egged on by a craven media that simply enjoys the show. Brexit is what you get if you ask people a question that they lack the basic information to answer. This is the view that has been doing the rounds in the circles in which the highly educated move. But to think this is a big mistake.<strong> </strong>The educational divide that is opening up in our politics is not really between knowledge and ignorance. It is a clash between one worldview and another.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>What is the EU?<strong> </strong>Hearing educated remainers mock those who asked that question the day after the vote was an uncomfortable experience \u2013 and not just because the story about Google searches was largely apocryphal. After all, the question is not as straightforward as it seems: it is simple enough to say what the letters refer to, but far more difficult to know what they really mean for our politics and our future. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is knowledge the same as knowing which way to vote. The split between the university towns and other parts of the country did not arise because one set of people understood what was truly at stake and the others were just taking a wild guess. Both sides were guessing.</p> <p>Even now, no one truly knows what is going to happen. The better-educated cleaved to one set of predictions because these chimed with what they already believed in. Polling carried out before the referendum, which asked people what they thought was likely to happen in the aftermath of a Brexit vote, found that university graduates thought that it would produce an immediate financial crash, whereas those with fewer qualifications thought it much more likely that things would carry on as before. Prior political preferences shape what we think the evidence shows, not the other way round.</p> <p>None of this would have surprised Lippmann. When he argued that ordinary voters were incapable of judging complex policy questions on their merits, he did not exclude the educated from that judgment. He meant everybody. As he wrote: \u201cI have not happened to meet anybody, from a president of the United States to a professor of political science, who came anywhere near to embodying the ideal of the sovereign and omnicompetent citizen.\u201d He thought that we needed experts who were trained in eliminating their own biases \u2013 and whatever a regular university education does, it does not do that.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone astray in their moral and political thinking as often as anyone else,\u201d write the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their new book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\">Democracy for Realists</a>, echoing Lippmann. What the educated are better at is sounding like they know what they are talking about, because they have been trained in how to make an argument. \u201cWell-informed people are likely to have more elaborate and internally consistent worldviews than inattentive people, but that just reflects the fact that their rationalisations are better rehearsed.\u201d Education gives you the ability to tailor your arguments to suit your personal preferences, which is why it is a big asset on the job market. But it does little to help tailor your personal preferences to suit the best arguments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian Design</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the current political climate, a lack of education is sometimes blamed for the spread of conspiracy theories, which run like wildfire through many populist movements. Trump\u2019s campaign, with its nods and winks to \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on\u201d, and its pre-emptive warnings about the vote being stolen, has been feeding and feeding off the appetite for conspiratorial thinking. Yet to blame this on the absence of education is just another version of the old fear of the credulity of the untutored masses: they will believe anything.</p> <p>The real story is more complicated. Polling conducted earlier this year by a research project in Cambridge shows that education does sometimes make a difference when it comes to conspiracy theories: the likelihood of someone thinking the moon landing was a hoax, or that the government is hiding the existence of aliens, does decline as you go higher up the education ladder. But when the theories concern politically divisive issues, then education has far less effect.</p> <p>Possessing a university degree does not alter the probability of someone believing that global warming is a hoax \u2013 that tracks prior political commitments, not superior knowledge. Nor are conspiracy theories confined to the right. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support among Labour party members contains a high proportion of university graduates. Yet in a YouGov poll, 55% of Corbyn supporters agreed with the statement that intelligence services such as MI5 have been working to undermine Corbyn since he became leader. That figure compares with only 19% of the wider public who give credence to the same claim. People will believe what their political loyalties incline them to believe, regardless of how much education they have received.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that our political beliefs are simply a reflection of our narrow self-interest. It is true that we all have a tendency to favour the worldview that enhances our future prospects. The preference of university graduates for remaining in the EU echoes the benefits that EU membership gives them: the free movement of labour and easy access to European networks is better for those with the qualifications to take advantage of a knowledge economy. But it is not the case that the education divide is just another version of the class divide, with the winners from globalisation lined up against the losers.</p> <p>As with Trump supporters in the US, Brexit was not simply the cause of the disadvantaged and left behind. Many Brexiteers come from the affluent middle classes, particularly in the south of England, outside of the university towns. Meanwhile, universities are producing their fair share of losers these days, as students leave burdened with debt and confronted by a bleak job market. Yet these students \u2013 rich or poor, in work or out, elite or not \u2013 overwhelmingly favoured EU membership. Education does not simply divide us on the grounds of what is in our interests. It sorts us according to where we feel we belong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Why does education do this?<strong> </strong>Political scientists have been aware of the growing education divide for decades. A report on the 1983 general election \u2013 whose authors included a young John Curtice, the current eminence grise of the UK polling business \u2013 noted that education levels were emerging as a significant indicator of voting patterns. The report put this down to the distinctive social attitudes that were picked up at university. \u201cEducational experience,\u201d it noted, \u201cis an important source of values distinct from class experience.\u201d These values often related to issues that were not straightforwardly economic.</p> <p>Graduates, even in the 1980s, tended to be much more concerned about the environment than other sectors of the population. They were also strikingly more internationalist in outlook. In 1983, 58% of graduates expressed a positive attitude to what was then known as the European Economic Community, whereas only 35% of those who left school at 16 felt the same. Not much has changed since. But at that time, the Labour party was still overtly hostile to the European project, and withdrawal from the EEC was part of its famously radical 1983 election manifesto. Many graduates reported having leftish attitudes on a whole host of other questions \u2013 from defence spending to women\u2019s rights. But on this issue their cosmopolitanism took precedence over their party loyalties. The result was that in the 1983 election more than twice as many university graduates voted for the centrist pro-European SDP-Liberal Alliance as voted for Labour.</p> <p>One reason this was not a bigger issue back then \u2013 and the Alliance did not manage to supplant Labour as the main party of opposition \u2013 was that there were not that many university graduates. Although participation had been steadily rising, in the mid-1980s fewer than one in five people had benefited from higher education. That was enough to make a difference, but not enough to tip the balance. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/24/students-higher-education-almost-50-per-cent\">2012, university participation among 18-30 year olds was close to 50%</a>, and it has only dipped recently because of rising tuition fees. That is enough to start splitting the population into two camps.</p> <p>But it is not simply a question of demographics. The gap has been amplified by certain forms of social mobility, which have reinforced the education divide by enabling the better-educated to start congregating together: socially, geographically, romantically. In a previous generation, graduates often married non-graduates, because their choices tended to be driven by where they happened to live or work. As the clich\u00e9 has it: bosses used to marry their secretaries. Not any more, and not just because there are fewer secretaries. If you went to university, ask yourself: how many of your friends didn\u2019t go to university? And among your friends, how many of those who did are married to people who didn\u2019t? Greater freedom of movement produces greater freedom of choice. But that does not produce more social diversity, it produces more social stratification.</p> <p>Social media now enhances these patterns. Friendship groups of like-minded individuals reinforce each other\u2019s worldviews. Facebook\u2019s news feed is designed to deliver information that users are more inclined to \u201clike\u201d. Much of the shock that followed the Brexit result in educated circles came from the fact that few people had been exposed to arguments that did not match their preferences. Education does not provide any protection against these social media effects. It reinforces them.</p> <p>The growing political divide between the educated and the less educated can be seen across Europe. It is most pronounced in Scandinavian countries, where university attendance is high and levels of education are an increasing driver of voting habits. It is less visible in southern and eastern Europe \u2013 in places such as Portugal and Poland \u2013 where participation in higher education is lower, and other social factors, including family and religion, still exert a strong grip.</p> <p>But Britain and the US are different again, because of their political systems. In European countries with proportional representation, smaller parties can offer a home to particular segments of the population, including those at both ends of the education scale. The support for many European parties of the populist right is heavily drawn from less educated voters. Meanwhile, green and liberal parties, especially those that favour immigration, rely strongly on university graduates for their support. That group includes the Liberal Democrats, which is still the UK-based party that attracts the highest proportion of graduates among its voters. But as the Lib Dems have discovered to their cost, with first-past-the-post that is not enough. Under a PR system, targeting the graduate vote can generate significant representation in parliament. Here, it can get you wiped out \u2013 especially if you make a promise to students not to raise their tuition fees and then fail to keep it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The education divide derives from values often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide is never going to supplant traditional left-right politics. There is not going to be a \u201cGraduate party\u201d taking on a party of \u201cSchool Leavers\u201d. Instead the divide cuts across left and right, which is why it is proving so disruptive to our politics right now. Big-tent political parties are struggling to hold their fractured coalitions of voters together. Polling still reveals some shared attitudes between university graduates and those without educational qualifications on economic issues, such as support for trade unions and mistrust of the free market. But the education divide derives from an alternative set of values, which is often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians.</p> <p>Authoritarians are looking for order and control, libertarians want greater freedom and tolerance. Along with education levels, the strongest indicator of likely support for Brexit was shown by attitudes to capital punishment: the more you were in favour, the more you wanted to leave the EU. These attitudes tend to track educational experience. Labour\u2019s support is now split between left-leaning libertarians (broadly pro-union and anti-banks, but also pro-immigration, and often highly educated) and left-leaning authoritarians (also pro-union and anti-banks, but far tougher on immigration and very concerned about crime and community). Each grouping might gather upwards of 20% of the electorate under its wing. Together that would be enough for a parliamentary majority. But they do not fit together any more, and increasingly they neither like nor trust each other.</p> <p>The same forces are threatening to play havoc with electoral politics in the US. Trump\u2019s army of the less educated is on the march inside the Republican party, but that leaves plenty of traditional Republicans \u2013 including many college-educated ones \u2013 wondering where to go. Some Republicans will be voting for Clinton. Some traditional Democrats<strong> </strong>will be sorely tempted by Trump\u2019s deeply authoritarian message. It is true that American democracy has proved highly resilient in the past and the party system has adapted to many demographic and cultural shifts. However, it is also possible that the gap between the educated and the less educated is going to become more entrenched over time, because it is not just a question of economic interests. It represents a gulf in mutual understanding.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The conflict between rich and poor<strong> </strong>still matters a great deal in our politics. But the age-old fear that democracy would end up letting the poor steal from the rich has always looked overblown. Constitutions \u2013 including the one carefully crafted by the American founders to guard against just that outcome \u2013 have done their bit to safeguard the interests of the propertied classes. So, too, have the increasingly complex institutional arrangements that give power to experts in areas \u2013 defence, finance, environment, health \u2013 where technical knowledge is assumed to be required. Representative democracy has proved effective at staving off class war. It has done it by finding electoral outlets for popular dissatisfaction \u2013 as with the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, of Attlee in 1945, or of Obama in 2008 \u2013 that never quite let the people take charge. When inequality gets out of hand, the system does what it can to correct for it. But it is designed to avoid extreme solutions driven by popular anger. That still holds. The haves do not look in danger of being expropriated by the have-nots any time soon.</p> <p>The contest between the educated and the less educated is different. Many of the safeguards that have been put in place to bypass popular politics \u2013 above all, the authority that now resides in central banks \u2013 have had the effect of empowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite. These are not just the bankers, but the lawyers, the doctors, the civil servants, the technicians, the pundits, the academics. Not all of the educated are winners in this world, but almost all of the winners are educated. It gives the impression that knowledge has become a proxy for influence.</p> <p>When Gove suggested that the experts should not be trusted because they have a vested interest in what they are saying, that was his point: once knowledge becomes a prerequisite of power, then it no longer speaks for itself. It appears to speak for the worldview of the people who possess it. At that point it ceases to be knowledge and simply becomes another mark of privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of superiority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide has the potential to break apart the careful ties that hold representative democracy together. Regardless of our different interests, we elect representatives to take decisions on our behalf on the understanding that we share certain basic values, including a respect for knowledge, wherever it comes from. Once knowledge is assumed to be just another one of the perks of power, then the basis to trust others to take decisions for us becomes eroded. Asserting the facts and asserting your privilege grow increasingly difficult to distinguish.</p> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of moral superiority. These days the rich find it quite hard to get away with the presumption that their wealth is proof of their virtue. When they seek protection from the system, it is pretty clear what they are up to: they are looking after their interests. But when the educated look out for themselves they can dress it up as something ostensibly better than that: expertise.</p> <p>To those on the receiving end, that stinks. It stinks of hypocrisy, and it also stinks of self-interest. The fact that the educated are not always the beneficiaries of the social attitudes that they hold \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s supporters, like Bernie Sanders\u2019s, would rightly insist that many of the positions they adopt are designed for the benefit the socially excluded \u2013 does not help. It just makes them sound even more self-righteous.</p> <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum Jeremy Cliffe of the Economist \u2013 the house journal of the educated expert \u2013 suggested that although Brexit might win this time, it was possible the UK would vote to rejoin the EU in a second referendum 20 years from now, by which point current levels of university education would have spread to later age groups. Twenty years is a very long time in politics. Before then, the gap between the educated and the less educated has the potential to widen, as each side digs in. The viciousness of public debate, as bad as it is now, could still get worse. Because two-party politics does not map on to this division, mainstream politicians will have to find creative ways to try to harness it. These carry the risks of making it worse.</p> <p>The EU referendum was seen by educated optimists \u2013 including some of the people around David Cameron \u2013 as just another way for democracy to let off steam: a means of giving vent to anger without letting it run out of control. That is what the optimists have been saying about Trump too. But the steam is still rising.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump was put on trial in his absence during the vice-presidential debate as his running mate Mike Pence was accused of trying to defend the indefensible.<br></p> <p>But Democrat Tim Kaine, embracing his role as Hillary Clinton\u2019s attack dog, interrupted so aggressively that many analysts felt he lost the debate on style to the calm, composed and measured Republican Indiana governor.<br></p> <p>In a focus group conducted by strategist Frank Luntz for CBS News in the swing state of Ohio, 22 people said that Pence won and only four said Virginia senator Kaine prevailed. When Luntz ran a similar group during last week\u2019s presidential debate, Clinton beat Trump 16-6.<br></p> <p>Pence gave a polished performance that could have given some hope to Republicans, and much wishful thinking about a non-Trump top of the ticket, but he was repeatedly forced on to the back foot by a brutal catalogue of the nominee\u2019s words and deeds.<br></p> <p>\u201cSix times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can\u2019t imagine how you can defend your running mate\u2019s position on one issue after the next,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cIn all six cases, he\u2019s refused to defend his running mate. And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.\u201d<br></p> <p>Pence remained steady under fire during the only vice-presidential debate of the campaign but when Kaine brought up Trump\u2019s campaign launch claim that the Mexican government is deliberately sending rapists into the United States, he awkwardly replied: \u201cYou whipped out that Mexican thing again.\u201d Kaine demanded: \u201cCan you defend it?\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-debate-tim-kaine-mike-pence-trump\">Pence could have stumbled in the debate \u2013 if only Kaine let him talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kaine attacked the Trump record on issues ranging from tax, nuclear weapons and Senator John McCain\u2019s war service to his description of women as \u201cslobs\u201d and \u201cpigs\u201d, his suggestion that women who have abortions should be punished and his questioning of Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace.</p> <p>Referring to Trump\u2019s past praise for dictators, Kaine said: \u201cHe\u2019s got a personal Mount Rushmore: Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly Pence flatly denied that Trump had made controversial statements and, instead of defending the candidate, resorted to the strategy of gaslighting, by repeatedly challenging known facts to manipulate the truth. </p> <p>He claimed Trump\u2019s past remarks were \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared with Clinton\u2019s infamous comment when she described half of Trump supporters as \u201ca basket full of deplorables\u201d.</p> <p>Pence ducked, dodged or denied statements that Trump has put on the record. The Clinton campaign accused of him telling downright lies in some instances. David Gergen, a former presidential adviser, said on CNN: \u201cPence will not fare well with fact checkers, but his poise and polish played well with voters. For better or worse, style counts a lot in these debates.\u201d</p> <p>The debate in Farmville, Virginia, with the candidates sitting at a table rather than standing at lecterns, was not expected to have a major impact on the presidential race, though Trump himself could not resist providing a live commentary via Twitter. He claimed: \u201cMike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike!\u201d</p> <p>Pence started strongly and looked directly into the camera in a way that Kaine did not. After a bewildering political year that has shaken the Republican party, Pence, a 12-year congressman and Indiana governor came over as a somewhat authentic voice of conservatism who may be consoling and energizing for party members who find Trump distasteful. </p> <p>He attacked Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state, arguing: \u201cWe see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.\u201d He cited the crisis in Syria and a newly emboldened Russia following a failed Clinton \u201creset\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vice-president-debate-fact-check-mike-pence-tim-kaine\">VP debate fact-check: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Referring to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server at her home, Pence, referencing the fact that he and Kaine both have sons who are US marines, remarked: \u201cIf your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did, they\u2019d be court martialed.\u201d</p> <p>Seeking to play the role of Clinton attack dog, Kaine interrupted several times, perhaps a little too zealously. He delivered some evidently rehearsed lines, telling Pence: \u201cYou are Donald Trump\u2019s apprentice,\u201d and asking: \u201cDo you want a \u2018you\u2019re hired\u2019 president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u2018you\u2019re fired\u2019 president in Donald Trump?\u201d</p> <p>Pence, who remained composed in manner and voice, a contrast to the thin-skinned Trump, responded: \u201cYou use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.\u201d</p> <p>Debating the economy, the Republican said with assurance: \u201cSenator, you can roll out numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different; people in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine, however, gradually found his footing and scored points when he attacked Trump. He had plenty of material to work with. He seized the opportunity to rebroadcast, before an audience of millions, many of Trump\u2019s most offensive and infamous remarks about Mexicans, Muslims and women.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a fundamental respect issue here,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cAnd I just want to talk about the tone set from the top. Donald Trump during this campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, he\u2019s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don\u2019t like saying that in front of my wife and mother.</p> <p>\u201cHe attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn\u2019t a hero because he\u2019d been captured. He said African Americans are living in hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a US citizen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">Kaine and Pence: two Catholic-inspired visions with little else in common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cI cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.\u201d</p> <p>On almost every occasion, Pence offered little by way of defense.

I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\"> early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts, </a>until finally promising<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\"> \u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></p> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>. The terms of the deal extend that \u201cbreakout\u201d ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Pence: the US doesn\u2019t know who Syrian refugees are and should block them</strong></p> <p>The government has a fairly clear idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most \u2013 not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here.

While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn\u2019t hold up either of them as role models for my kids,\u201d she said.<br><br>At the weekend Ayotte had struck a more moderate tone, giving away free condoms on the campaign trail to push her plan on birth control. The poster at the event claimed to \u201cUse Condom Sense!\u201d </p> <p>Ayotte is in a close race with Democratic governor Maggie Hassan, who was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, Emily\u2019s List and NARAL.

  "<h2><strong>Mike Pence: \u2018Norwood University\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In his opening statement, Pence misstated the name of the university hosting the debate. It is Longwood University, not Norwood.</p> <h2><strong>He also said that Barack Obama has raised more taxes to extraordinary levels</strong></h2> <p>This isn\u2019t quite right. There were two major changes to the tax code in Obama\u2019s two terms: the 2012 expiration of tax cuts created by George W Bush (with extensions for people making less than $400,000 a year), and levies to fund the Affordable Care Act (including a penalty for not having health insurance, a 10% tax on tanning services and a 3.8% tax on investment income for top earners).</p> <p>Obama also enacted temporary cuts meant to spur investment and help Americans in the depths of the financial crisis, but all in all tax rates for most Americans have not changed much since Bush\u2019s presidency, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361\">report</a> by the nonpartisan congressional budget office. Under Bush, the top tax rate was 35%; under Obama, the wealthiest Americans pay 39.5%.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Obama administration has \u2018stifled the economy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Obama took office in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, and the economy has crawled back into recovery over his two terms, with employment nearly down to pre-crisis levels. It\u2019s arguable that his policies have restricted some growth, but the economy has held to a steadily upward track.</p> <p>This summer the OECD gave its <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/United-States-2016-overview.pdf\">stamp</a> of approval to the US economy, saying in a report: \u201cthe US economy has rebounded: output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak by 10%, robust private-sector employment gains have sharply reduced unemployment, fiscal sustainability has been largely restored and corporate profits are high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-elections-live\">Vice-presidential debate live: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine face off</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations while she was secretary of state \u2026 She kept that pay-to-play process in\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Pence is correct that the foundation took donations from foreign governments, and that the charity did not disclose every contribution \u2013 in violation of an agreement to identify donors that it made with the Obama administration. But no one has yet produced evidence of a quid pro quo exchange between the Clinton Foundation and its donors.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018It was a failure of the secretary of state\u2019 to acquire a status of forces agreement with Iraq</strong></h2> <p>The argument that Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to secure an agreement with Baghdad over keeping American troops in Iraq ignores several key facts, including that the Bush administration similarly failed. It also ignores that Isis\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/us-actions-in-iraq-fueled-rise-of-a-rebel.html\">formed</a> out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">post-invasion civil war</a> in Iraq, while Bush was president; that the group took root in Syria\u2019s civil war, where the US did not intervene until 2014; that Obama withdrew American forces in 2011 under the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\">timeline</a> agreed on by Bush and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">Baghdad</a>.

Since Obama took office in January 2009 the US has created <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001\">10.8m private-sector jobs</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kaine is counting back from the depths of the economic recession, in early 2010, which would erase a full year off of Obama\u2019s presidency.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: \u2018The debt explosion on the Trump side is much much bigger than anything on the Clinton side\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct, according to conservative and nonpartisan thinktanks alike. Clinton\u2019s proposed tax plan would add $191bn to the debt over the long term, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/default/files/docs/TaxFoundation-FF496.pdf\">according to the </a><a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">Committee for a Responsible Budget</a>, a conservative thinktank. The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">add $1.1tn in revenue</a> in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would add <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/09/26/donald-trump-would-boost-debt-more-than-hillary-clinton-report-says/\">$5.3tn to the debt</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: even Richard Nixon released his taxes</strong></h2> <p>Richard Nixon did not release his tax returns while running for president in 1960 or in 1968 \u2013 he released them in 1973, after his second term began. In 1968 Nixon only gave a limited glimpse of his to a magazine writer and only released the returns under pressure from the Watergate inquiry. He released the returns despite an audit by the IRS, which Trump has repeatedly claimed is his reason for not releasing returns.</p> <p>You can look at Nixon\u2019s returns at the <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">Presidential Tax History Project</a>.

Pence, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/capital-living/meet-the-lawmaker/20999-house-conservatives-oppose-add-ons\">supported</a> a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/15/news/economy/trump-pence-social-security/\">2005 plan</a> that would have modified the program into a private system.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018He\u2019s created a business that\u2019s worth billions of dollars\u2019</strong></h2> <p>There is no direct evidence that Trump\u2019s business is worth billions of dollars \u2013 the only tax return publicly available, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">published by the New York Times</a> last weekend, shows that he reported a $916m loss in 1995. Trump could prove the worth of his business by publishing his returns. Forbes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/donald-trump-net-worth-forbes-400\">estimates Trump is worth $3.7bn</a>, far lower than his claimed $10bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf7b56f52cd95fbe3764bedcbb05801dcc9f7c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf7b56f52cd95fbe3764bedcbb05801dcc9f7c0/0_95_4722_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Pence responds to Tim Kaine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Pence responds to Tim Kaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump would let states decide whether to be rid of the minimum wage</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct insofar as Trump has a position on minimum wages, if he\u2019s talking about the federal minimum wage, specifically.</p> <p>Trump has changed his position on the minimum wage at least three times, including within the span of a single interview. On 26 July, when Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMK8Iv7tiE\">asked him</a> where he would set a federal minimum wage, he repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump\">a stance from May</a> that the US does not need one: \u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p> <p>He then immediately changed his position: \u201cWell, I would leave it, and raise it somewhat.\u201d A day later in Florida he said he wanted a $10 an hour minimum wage, up from the current level of $7.25, and confirmed to a reporter: \u201cfederal\u201d. He has most consistently said that states should decide a minimum wage.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine notes, correctly, that black people are more likely than white people to be arrested and given long sentences.</strong> </h2> <p>They are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">more likely to be shot by police</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton and Kaine support \u2018open borders\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Neither ticket supports \u201copen borders\u201d, which the US does not have. Pence appears to be using the word to denigrate Barack Obama\u2019s support for immigration reform and protection for some undocumented people from deportation. But Obama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">deported a record more than 2.5 million people since he took office</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/\">a record 438,421 people in 2013</a>, and increased border patrol staff to <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/performance-accountability-financial\">a record 21,444 agents in 2011</a>; his policy could not reasonably be described as \u201camnesty\u201d or \u201copen borders\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay backtaxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports the deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump has \u2018called Mexicans rapists and criminals \u2026 He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified \u2026 He said African Americans are living in hell\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is right that Trump has broadly characterized immigrants in derogatory terms, but Trump also almost always gives himself a way out. On 16 June 2015, when he announced his candidacy, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is patently false, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/donald-trump-fact-check-immigration-inner-cities\">we</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration\">fellow</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/\">fact-checkers</a> have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/\">repeatedly</a> shown, since most migrants leave their homes for work or family and the Mexican government has nothing to do with their emigration. Statistics on crime by non-citizens mostly suggest that Mexican migrants \u2013 more of whom are leaving the US than entering \u2013 don\u2019t affect overall crime rates.</p> <p>Trump has i<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">ndeed called judge Gonzalo Curiel unqualified</a> because the American judge is \u201cMexican\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/living-in-hell-milwaukee-segregation-donald-trump\">said that African Americans are \u201cliving in hell\u201d.</a></p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton called half of our supporters \u2018deplorable\u2019</strong></h2> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">a fundraiser</a> Clinton said: \u201cTo just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables\u201d. This group, she said, included \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d people.

Polls also show lower but significant such sentiment among supporters of Clinton. Her generalization pointed to real racial animus, ignored it among her own supporters and showed how difficult it is to attach a number to racism, even while <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">separate polling</a> shows <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/\">racism</a> is <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">affecting millions</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/29/roughly-half-of-hispanics-have-experienced-discrimination/\">widespread</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">systemic ways</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s complaint contradicts his own past remarks. In 2012, after Mitt Romney was lambasted <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/the-47-percent/\">for dismissing 47% of Americans</a>, Trump agreed, telling <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/video/trump-romney-dont-apologize-47-025517267.html\">Fox News</a>: \u201cYou do have a large percentage of people that feel they\u2019re entitled.\u201d Last year he similarly dismissed half of all Americans, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/18/donald_trump_eventually_50_of_americans_are_not_going_to_be_able_to_carry_the_other_50.html\">telling Fox</a>: \u201cWe have a society that sits back and says, \u2018We don\u2019t have to do anything.\u2019 Eventually the 50% cannot carry, and it\u2019s unfair to them, but cannot carry the other 50%.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump hasn\u2019t apologized to anyone</strong></h2> <p>Trump has expressed regret for having said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">the wrong thing</a>\u201d but not said what that thing was or whom he had caused \u201cpersonal pain\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump supports the mass deportation of 11 million people</strong></h2> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDUADNTpAh0\">a 10 November debate</a> Trump expressed support for Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s Operation Wetback, the forcible deportation of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/06/annotated-transcript-the-aug-6-gop-debate/\">hundreds of thousands of migrants</a>, sometimes under inhumane circumstances. He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\">early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts,</a> until finally promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">\u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></h2> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>.

Using data from the census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 million to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most, not 20 million people as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the past 20 years.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></h2> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by Isis to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.

Comey did say that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\u201d against Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. But Comey also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">excoriated Clinton for \u201cextremely careless\u201d practices</a> and found that she had spoken falsely repeatedly about the system.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump has praised Vladimir Putin and \u2018it\u2019s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are dealing with Putin\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump has repeatedly called Russia\u2019s president a \u201cstrong leader\u201d and spoken approvingly of this strength and Putin\u2019s polling numbers. For instance, on 18 December 2015 he <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/12/18/donald-trump-praises-putin-as-strong-leader/\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt fine about Putin. I think that he\u2019s a strong leader.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-gives-russias-putin-an-a-in-leadership/\">told Fox News</a>: \u201cIn terms of leadership [Putin\u2019s] getting an A.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA2rmuJu9c\">a 10 March debate</a>, Trump tried to hedge on semantics. \u201cStrong doesn\u2019t mean good,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin is a strong leader, absolutely. He is a strong leader. Now I don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\u201d</p> <p>Pence also said, as Kaine points out, that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/08/mike-pence-says-its-inarguable-that-putin-is-a-stronger-leader-than-obama/\">it\u2019s \u201cinarguable\u201d that Putin is a stronger leader than Obama</a>.</p> <p>Kaine also said that Putin \u201chas run his economy into the ground, he persecutes LGBT folks and journalists\u201d.</p> <p>The caliber of Putin\u2019s leadership is debatable in and of itself. Russia\u2019s economy under Putin\u2019s 16 years of leadership has become over reliant on oil and hamstrung by economic sanctions, themselves prompted by Putin\u2019s aggressive military action in Ukraine.

But I\u2019m not there. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you\u2019re talking about and all of the power of Nato and all of this.

Ukraine is not a member of Nato, the history of Crimea and Russia goes back centuries, and the continued war in eastern Ukraine is being fueled by both the Kremlin and local forces.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Associated Press found that more than half of Clinton\u2019s meetings as secretary of state were with donors to the Clinton Foundation</strong></h2> <p>The AP story on Clinton\u2019s meetings <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/09/ap-deletes-clinton-foundation-tweet-227917\">did not include her meetings with people in the US government and from foreign governments</a> \u2013 who were by a huge margin the people she met with while serving as the top diplomat of the United States.</p> <p>The news agency deleted a tweet about the story \u2013 virtually verbatim to what Pence said \u2013 for lack of context, and the Associated Press\u2019s vice-president for standards John Daniszewski wrote <a href=\"https://blog.ap.org/announcements/statement-on-why-ap-deletes-clinton-tweet?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">a blog post about the decision</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018Trump and I would just never support legislation that would punish a woman for making the heartbreaking decision to terminate a pregnancy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct that Trump suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">women should be punished for having abortions</a> \u2013 he then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">recanted the idea</a> at the end of a day of flip-flopping positions.
