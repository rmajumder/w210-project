I know that\u2019s a term they reserve for Barack Obama, but I think women can have swag also. I take a lot of pride in the way I dress, the way I look, the way I carry myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baxter, who spent 31 years with the New York City board of education, was quickly taken out of her comfort zone: as a teenager in the early 1960s, she was a scholarship student at a highly selective Bronx-based private school named Fieldston. \u201cI was the only black female in my class.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baxter, who came from a mixed family \u2013 with a white father and a part African American, part Native American mother \u2013 found it scary at first. Discrimination was evident. There were parties she wasn\u2019t invited to, comments she was subjected to.</p> \n<p>Discrimination followed her. After college, despite qualifying as a high school teacher, when it came to a final oral examination, she was failed. The board of examiners said her southern accent was an impediment to her being understood by students in the classroom. But Baxter didn\u2019t have one; she had lived in New York her entire life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c1d7665-bec5-4d84-8487-7c3f97a7cd62\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"expandable\"> \n    <h1>The Guardian view on America\u2019s choice</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>If we had a vote, we would use it to elect Hillary Clinton as president. She's a thoughtful politician who has&nbsp;responded to concerns about her cautious centrism by committing to more radical plans. With decades of experience, she is a fitting successor to Barack Obama. It is also high time there was a woman president. By contrast Donald Trump is an irascible egomaniac, uninterested in the world. He has fought a campaign of abuse, riddled with racism and misogyny. He propagates lies, ignorance and prejudice.</p>\n     <p>There are three particular ways in which electing Mr Trump is a step that should be spurned by any responsible American voter.

Mrs Clinton is much better. So elect her.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Baxter eventually qualified and rose up. Her crowning achievement? Besides her two daughters, she says that as a principal, she turned around a failing school in the Bronx in record time. In just three years, Baxter overhauled a 5,000-student school where many attendants lived below the poverty line \u2013 significantly improving grades, attendance and morale. The accomplishment won her an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/27/opinion/cloning-thelma-baxter.html\">editorial</a> in the New York Times, the title of which reads \u201cCloning Thelma Baxter\u201d.</p> \n<p>More broadly, it is birth control, Roe v Wade, and winning the battle of being in charge of our own bodies that she considers the most important victory she has seen in her lifetime.</p> \n<p>Other victories, like childcare, and finding ways to balance careers with child-rearing, have yet to come. Baxter remembers her mother, a prominent journalist and then city government worker, suffering from that struggle. It is the same struggle she grappled with, that she now sees her daughters also face.</p> \n<p>Baxter says Hillary Clinton has faced a vast amount of unfair scrutiny in the run-up to the presidential elections. Her own way of vanquishing such treatment was to keep on facing the challenges set before her. \u201cI just had to overcome those kinds of hurdles. I had to constantly prove to people that I was qualified, well-prepared and that I wanted to do the job \u2013 and that I was up to doing the job. I think that\u2019s a hurdle that all minority, black, or Hispanic women have to face, much more so than white women.\u201d</p> \n<p>And going to cast a vote for the first female president feels important as well as historic. \u201cI will be very, very proud. Almost as proud as when I went to vote for Barack.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Gloria Neuwirth, 82, lawyer: \u2018It\u2019s an uphill battle for women\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-women-voter-gloria-neuwirth-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b3n4\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876530\" data-video-name=\"Gloria Neuwirth, age 82, on voting for a female president \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5822332ce4b0822c310ec179\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-women-voter-gloria-neuwirth-video\">Gloria Neuwirth, age 82, on voting for a female president</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sitting behind her large wooden desk, Gloria Neuwirth says she is cutting down her work hours at the Manhattan law firm where she has been a partner for the last 20 years. \u201cI am cutting down from five days to four days a week,\u201d she states, no movement of the eyelid detectable.</p> \n<p>Neuwirth grew up in the South Bronx, the daughter of immigrant parents who owned a chain of pharmacies. She\u2019s the product of the New York City public school system, and recalls riding the subway to go to piano lessons with a degree of freedom and independence.</p> \n<p>In the mid-1950s, Neuwirth attended Yale law school: she was one of just 12 women in a class of 162 students. Her gender received frequent attention. \u201cThe question that I got from students and even some professors was: why are you here, taking the place of a man? I heard that question over and over again, the assumption being I was going to graduate and just go and raise a family.\u201d</p> \n<p>After graduating, finding a job was hard. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many jobs available to women. It was the late 1950s.\u201d</p> \n<p>One company refused to hire her because they held occasional evening meetings they didn\u2019t think would be suitable for her to attend. Another Wall Street firm declared they didn\u2019t hire women, but told her she was pretty, so they\u2019d be happy to talk to her.</p> \n<p>Neuwirth eventually found a job as a researcher with Columbia University and the Bar Association. A little over a decade later, after taking time off to have four children, she once more struggled to find employment. She wanted work adapted to her family requirements \u2013 an almost impossible ask. The battle for flexibility and childcare is a gender battle that has yet to be won, she says.</p> \n<p>Women have come a long way since she first qualified as a lawyer, Neuwirth points out. Nowadays, women make up a little over half of law school students. But then, she pauses, she also read of a law firm that had announced new partners, 14 out of 15 of whom were men. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s an uphill battle for women.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for having a woman in the White House, it will be \u201cvery exciting for girls as well as boys to see that a woman can be president\u201d. However, America is hardly blazing a trail, she points out. \u201cWe are way behind the rest of the world. So many other countries have had women leaders, and we have never.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Robin Morgan</strong>, 75: \u2018People have died for the right to vote \u2013 women included\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/robin-morgan-hillary-clinton-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b3f4\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876314\" data-video-name=\"Robin Morgan, age 75, on voting for a female president \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58220a57e4b0eda0192fd80c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/robin-morgan-hillary-clinton-video\">Robin Morgan, age 75, on voting for a female president</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Robin Morgan sits by the fire in her small, book-filled New York City apartment, and lets her gaze be drawn towards the small entrance to her bathroom, where a few framed letters have been placed.</p> \n<p>The writer, feminist, activist organizer and radio <a href=\"http://www.wmclive.com/\">show</a> host nods. \u201cYes, those are copies of some of my correspondence with Simone de Beauvoir,\u201d she confirms. \u201cShe was a wonderful woman.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan, a child actor who enrolled as a non-matriculated student at Columbia University aged 14, says her first adult job as a secretary at a New York literary agency in the late 1950s forced her to confront serious sexism.</p> \n<p>Around the same time, like \u201ca great many other idealistic young people\u201d, she became involved in the civil rights and then anti-Vietnam movements. It was a rude awakening.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are doing all this work in civil rights and anti-war movements thinking that we are marching towards this brave new world with our revolutionary brothers where we would all be equal and free. And, not so much. Because we discovered that our revolutionary brothers thought women were a species apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan recalls men in both movements issuing derogatory come-ons to women. \u201cHey baby, give me a little of my civil rights tonight\u201d and \u201cGirls say yes to boys who say no\u201d were lines that were all too common, she says. \u201cIf you think about it, of course, that statement pimps women.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We discovered that our revolutionary brothers thought women were a species apart</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In 1968, Morgan <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_feminists.html\">helped lead a protest</a> at the Miss America pageant, decrying the degrading nature of the event. The protest, which attracted national and international coverage, threw the American women\u2019s liberation movement firmly into the mainstream.</p> \n<p>But for her, looking back, it is not the more than 20 published books that are her greatest professional accomplishment, but rather her participation in the establishment of a global women\u2019s rights movement. \u201cWomen are aware now that they are part of a global movement. The United States did not invent feminism; it is not an export from the Americas. We are one mosaic tile in a grand mosaic.\u201d</p> \n<p>She mentions how slow some battles feel \u2013 against sexual harassment, for instance. \u201cEvery now and then you think: how can this still be happening?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery woman in this country, I think every woman on this planet knows, has experienced some version of sexual harassment \u2013 some man has put his hands or looks where they shouldn\u2019t have been, employment discrimination, whether it\u2019s a job you have or a career.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she remains optimistic. \u201cIf you pan back to a historical perspective, change is happening very rapidly.\u201d</p> \n<p>And although Morgan believes electing a female president should not be perceived as the be-all and end-all \u2013 \u201cWe still have racism having had a black president for two terms, and we even have backlash\u201d \u2013 it still feels like an exciting moment.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will vote with great pride, I will be moved to do so. Just to see a woman\u2019s name on the ballot. And not any woman, but to see a woman who in a very real way comes out of the women\u2019s movement, who was affected by the women\u2019s movement, calls herself a feminist, stands for many of the things that we have put on the map. That\u2019s a thrill I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to see.\u201d</p>",

They run a hotline - 866-OUR-VOTE \u2013 which has received thousands of complaints from voters running into difficulties.</p> <p>North Carolina, one of the most sensitive swing states that both Clinton and Trump have poured resources into winning, has been particularly troubled today by voting machines breaking down and electronic polling books seizing up. There\u2019s no suggestion of foul play here, but it has complicated an already tense election day.</p> <p>Texas is a story of more willful trouble. The Republican-controlled legislatures efforts to introduce one of the strictest forms of photo-ID requirements in the country has led to widespread confusion, Perez said.</p> <p>The coalition has found numerous cases of signs being posted on the walls of polling stations that incorrectly inform voters about Texas\u2019 photo-ID criteria.</p> <p>Many complaints have come in about alleged intimidation of voters outside polling stations from a number of states. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly heard from voters complaining about this, though it\u2019s going to be very hard to tell how organized it was. It\u2019s too early to tell whether it was an individual action or something more planned.\u201d</p> <p>One development that Perez said would have to be reviewed after the dust has settled from this election was the proliferation of poll watchers. The 2016 election cycle, given the degree of suspicion around, had spawned the surreal phenomenon of poll watchers observing voters and then poll monitors watching them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are creating a culture of multiple layers of people observing each other, which produces it\u2019s own challenges. We\u2019ve got to a place where poll watchers watch watchers watching watchers.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58224cdfe4b0eda0192fd924\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T22:08:59.122Z\">10.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spokesperson: George W.

But whether Clinton wins or not, \u201cshe\u2019s opened the door for future women to think about running and that\u2019s important. I\u2019m sure there will be others, maybe not in my lifetime.

I was pleasantly surprised to only wait about 15 minutes in line, and I am so grateful for the friendly attitudes and efficiency of the volunteers. The voting process went smoothly, and regardless of how long anyone has to wait in line, I encourage you to vote. Quite frankly, there is too much at stake in this election. My girlfriend and I are going to order takeout and watch the election results tonight... Regardless of which candidate wins Missouri this year, I\u2019m proud to say I cast my ballot to promote a better political future for myself as a young adult, and a better future for all Americans.</p> <p><strong>Steve Pearcy from Manassas, Virginia says his mom would have liked to have seen today:</strong></p> <p>When my mom and dad were born, a woman couldn\u2019t vote in the US. A black man theoretically could vote, but his right to do so was usually denied, usually, alas, by Democrats in the south. Folks from poor backgrounds like my folks didn\u2019t really have much chance of going to college to change their lot in life. If someone without money got seriously ill, they usually died, like my grand-uncle\u2019s young wife and their two-year old child in the flu epidemic of 1918.</p> <p>A little over 40 years later when I was born, a woman could vote in the US. Barriers to black folk voting would be torn down a few years later with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, laws pushed through by more visionary Democrats. A few years later Medicare and Medicaid programs were enacted by Democrats so people without means had access to health care. A woman and man of different races could not marry in many states of the US. My father, who grew up on a tenant farm in Missouri, went to college after World War II with the GI Bill. My brother would go to college a few years after I was born, my mother would get her degree 14 years after I was born, and from an early age I just assumed I\u2019d go to college. As a kid, my grandmother used to say with pride, \u201cI\u2019m a Baptist and a Democrat,\u201d and my parents took me to vote and see them vote for Democrats because the Democratic party tried to help all people, not just the rich.</p> <p>A little over 40 years after I was born, I sat with my parents and cheered and cried as we watched as Barack Obama, the son of a white woman and a black man, was nominated to be the Democratic candidate for president. Unfortunately there were and still are folk who try to keep people of color from voting, but such efforts have the boom-a-rang effect of making people more determined to vote. More and more people in the United States are getting the chance to go to college. The Affordable Care Act enacted by Democrats provides access to health care to millions who did not have access before. People of all races can marry anyone who they wish. The country continues to try to be better with every generation, to try to be a more perfect union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T21:25:46.074Z\">at 9.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58222cd2e4b0eda0192fd8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sam-thielman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T19:52:43.099Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump cited voting machine malfunctions on CNN on Tuesday afternoon when he again refused to say whether he would concede the election if he lost.

In Jacksonville, an unauthorized person was reported to be inside a polling place and refusing to leave in a way that voters found menacing. The coalition declined to state the individual\u2019s party affiliation. </p> <p>There are also reports of intimidating behavior by a group of individuals behaving aggressively outside the polling place at the Hollywood branch library in Broward County. The group approached vehicles in a way that made some would-be voters turn round and drive away before they had a chance to vote.</p> <p>The National Coalition for Black Civic Participation said that people have been spotted in Florida driving around in pickup trucks waving Confederate flags in a threatening posture.</p> <p>By 9.30am, the hotline had received 5,500 calls from around the nation. Many were from North Carolina, another hotly fought state, where polling machines were malfunctioning across entire counties.</p> <p>The election protection coalition has 4,500 legal volunteers at hand today to deal with the calls coming in to its 23 call centers around the country.

It\u2019s election day, but we\u2019ll resist the temptation to wax dramatic. No reflections on the historical import of a day that could see the election of the first woman US president, or of Donald Trump. No musing about just how long these last 18 months have sometimes felt. No solicitations after your personal health, mental and physical, at this, the (apparent) end of our collective slog through a muddy field of base discourse, objectionable behavior and trampled bunting.</p> <p>There were some happy moments in there! We think. And we will recall them just as soon as the votes are counted. Which brings us to the main business of the day: bringing you the election results, as soon as they come in, from Maine to Alaska. That\u2019s the purpose of today\u2019s blog, and that\u2019s what you can expect as the polls begin to close, initial returns come back, state results are declared and the identity of the 45th president of the United States is revealed.</p> <p>When will we know who was elected president? In 2000, they didn\u2019t know until December. But that was exceptional. With any luck tonight, we\u2019ll know the identity of the next president before the clock ticks into Wednesday on the east coast. The first polls opened in New Hampshire at midnight - with three tiny towns allowing midnight voting and immediate results. </p> <p>Out of the 64 ballots cast in those three counties, Trump nabbed 32 votes, Clinton got 25 and three went to Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>The last polls, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, aren\u2019t due to close until 1am ET.

In some cases voters have been denied a ballot. The justice department announced Monday that it planned to deploy in 28 states to ensure voting rights were respected, after Trump\u2019s claims that the vote would be rigged and exhortation to supporters to keep a vigilant eye in \u201ccertain areas\u201d.<br></p> <p>We\u2019ll also have the chance to gauge whether turnout appears to be up or down in a way that bodes well for either candidate.

  "<p>The Dakota Access pipeline operator chose the day of the US presidential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-results-live\">election</a> to announce that the final phase of its controversial construction project will begin in two weeks \u2013 marking a bold escalation in its response to the Native American protests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">Dakota Access pipeline: the who, what and why of the Standing Rock protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Energy Transfer Partners, the company overseeing the North Dakota oil pipeline, has already completed construction up to the river that provides water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and announced on Tuesday it would soon begin drilling at the site.</p> <p>The company said it would not halt construction, despite requests by federal agencies to delay the project as the US government reassesses permits and considers possible reroutes.</p> <p>In a statement, Energy Transfer Partners said it was \u201cmobilizing horizontal drilling equipment\u201d in preparation for tunneling under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri river by the protest camps and Native American reservation. The corporation said it would be ready to start crossing the water in two weeks.</p> <p>The announcement came on a quiet election day at the encampments built by members of the Standing Rock Sioux nation and other indigenous people in opposition to the pipeline.</p> <p>After a string of clashes and mass arrests, rumors spread among activists that the pipeline, government and tribal leaders had negotiated a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/11/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-delay\">30-day moratorium</a> on both construction and protest or religious ceremonies on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the conflict.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in shock. I\u2019m speechless,\u201d said Cheryl Angel, a Sicangu Lakota tribe member who has been at the Standing Rock camps since the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable and devastating. It\u2019s almost as though they have no soul.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement presents the final phase of construction as a done deal, and will be seen as a clear illustration that the oil company is aggressively moving forward with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">$3.7bn pipeline</a> in defiance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/dakota-access-obama-suggests-ways-to-reroute-pipeline-being-investigated\">Barack Obama</a> and the thousands of demonstrators who are camped out at Standing Rock to fight the project.</p> <p>Last week, Obama made his first remarks on the huge demonstrations since police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">arrested hundreds of unarmed protesters</a>, who call themselves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/north-dakota-pipeline-activists-bakken-oil-fields\">water protectors</a>\u201d and say the pipeline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-sioux\">destroying sacred indigenous lands</a>.</p> <p>The president said the US army corps of engineers was exploring ways to \u201creroute\u201d around Native American lands, and said the government was \u201cgoing to let it play out for several more weeks, and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans\u201d.</p> <p>In September, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">government said</a> it would temporarily <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing\">halt permits</a> to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river and requested that the company \u201cvoluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west\u201d of Lake Oahe.</p> <p>Energy Transfer Partners ignored that request and continued construction, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-last-stand\">approaching within a few miles of the river</a>, causing widespread anger and sadness at the Standing Rock camps, which have been opposing the pipeline since April.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s statement does not address the requests from the government for a delay. On the contrary, it suggests that the company is not giving consideration to alternative routes or Obama\u2019s recent remarks.</p> <p>\u201cDakota Access previously received a permit from the army corps with respect the tunneling activities under Lake Oahe, and Dakota Access has all other regulatory approvals and land rights to complete the crossing of the Missouri river at Lake Oahe,\u201d the statement said, adding that the company expects to receive final permissions \u201cin a time frame that will not result in any significant delay\u201d.</p> <p>The army corps did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Asked about Obama\u2019s comments, pipeline spokeswoman Vicki Granado told the Guardian: \u201cWe are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement comes as North Dakota regulators are moving ahead with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/dakota-access-oil-pipeline-native-american-artifacts-discovered\">formal complaint against the corporation</a> for failing to properly disclose findings of Native American artifacts along the construction route.</p> <p>Angel said the pipeline construction plan was \u201cenvironmentally irresponsible\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d considering the army corps has yet to approve final permits. Noting that the Missouri river provided drinking water to millions, she added: \u201cI\u2019m in tears, because I can\u2019t believe [the company] would do this to a whole group of people who don\u2019t have any say.\u201d</p> <p>This past Sunday, more than a hundred water protectors used boats to ferry across the Cannonball river and attempted to climb \u201cTurtle Island\u201d \u2013 a portion of army corps land where tribal members say there are 11 burial sites. Several tribal elders, including Darrel Killsinsight, implored everyone to return to the main camp, referencing the alleged 30-day agreement.</p> <p>But representatives of the tribe never officially confirmed that any such agreement was in place, and Tuesday\u2019s statement flies in the face of any hope for a moratorium. </p> <p>Jan Hasselman, the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux in its permit litigation, said that the statement from Dakota Access was probably a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-north-dakota-pipeline-energy-transfer-idUSKBN1332QZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">response to an army corps spokesman</a> telling Bloomberg that the company had agreed to slow construction. But, she added, Dakota Access does not have all the permits it needs to begin drilling, including the easement. </p> <p>\u201cStarting construction without permits would be beyond the pale, even for Dakota Access,\u201d Hasselman told the Guardian. \u201cIt is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors\u2019 money into this route when both the President and Senator Tim Kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from Lake Oahe.\u201d</p> <p>The timing of the announcement on election day instantly raised suspicion \u2013 and anger \u2013 among the activists gathered at Standing Rock. Activists have expressed frustration with the US presidential race, noting that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates?page=with:block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5#block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5\">refused</a> to take a position on the conflict and GOP candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">Donald Trump has close financial ties to the pipeline</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWith the election being so big, and North Dakota being so small, they think they can just sweep this under the rug,\u201d said Danny Grassrope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised. Snakes are sneaky, and this is a black snake. It blindsides everyone.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cA lot of people are going to get angry, and this is where we need to stay positive. We need prayers more than ever now.\u201d</p> <p>The protesters were also disappointed that Obama has not condemned the highly militarized police force in North Dakota, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-women-police-abuse\">arrested more than 400 people</a> and deployed Mace, Tasers, rubber bullets and army tanks to respond to demonstrations.</p> <p>A UN group is also investigating claims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">inhumane jail treatment</a> and other human rights abuses by law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cAre indigenous people so invaluable that now that Dakota Access is to the water, does it not matter to anyone that people are going to start laying down their lives?\u201d asked Eryn Wise, a member of the Jicarilla Apache and Laguna Pueblo tribes.</p> <p>\u201cI think that people need to seriously question the integrity of the work produced by DAPL right now, because they\u2019re rushing,\u201d Wise added. \u201cIs it safe when they\u2019ve been rushing like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 11 November 2016 to better reflect the article.</p>",

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

There is nothing constructive to be said today on the political noise, so perhaps we should look to the challenges ahead.</li> <li>Prejudice is one of the biggest threats to economic and social stability. Prejudice is on the rise. Declaring a group in society to be \u201csecond class\u201d undermines their economic contribution \u2013 increasingly so in today\u2019s changing world. Politicians must tackle prejudice head-on; it is morally and economically the right thing to do.<br></li> <li>Global trade patterns are changing. Lengthening supply chains and outsourcing are outdated as localized production reintroduces the imperial trade model, and technology means that trade in services is increasingly important. Politicians need to stop living the trade of the past, and embrace the trade of the future.<br></li> <li>Jobs do not disappear; jobs become different.

Removing \u201cillegals\u201d from central America and banning immigration from any Muslim country can only amount to a program of racial cleansing in a country with the ethnic diversity of the US. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s swipes against Black Lives Matter and his raging about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d are coded appeals to a sense among some of his supporters that African Americans should be returned to the margins of the country\u2019s life. </p> <p>Australians like to look down on the spectacle and extremism of US politics but the fact is that our respective histories have strong parallels. Each was founded on forms of white nationalism, which bubble up in political life and everyday conversation. </p> <p>The white settlers of both countries dispossessed and slaughtered their native inhabitants. Later, each heavily restricted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy\">non-white migration</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act\">especially from Asia</a>. </p> <p>White advantages (and white racism) have never disappeared in either country. But a more diverse migrant intake from the latter part of the 20th century has factored into complex politics of backlash and resentment. </p> <p>At first this was given expression by flash-in-the-pan demagogues in the 1990s, like One Nation here or David Duke in the US. Now, cynical conservatives have brought it into the heart of the political process in Australia, the US and other western democracies. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/in-the-game-of-fantasy-us-election-one-fifth-of-australians-would-vote-for-tru\">In the game of Fantasy US Election, one-fifth of Australians would vote for Trump | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we look at Bernardi and Christensen\u2019s most prominent activities \u2013 halal food inquiries, 18C, or <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-19/george-christensen-addresses-extreme-islam-at-mackay-rally/6632006\">palling around with Reclaim Australia</a> \u2013 we see that they too embrace a politics that centres around white identity, and portrays its privileges as being at risk from threatening ethnic and cultural others. </p> <p>Their Trump support is, no doubt, partly about trolling for attention. </p> <p>But we are best to take it at face value.

The Socialist party is in disarray, with a recent poll showing only 4% of people were satisfied with Hollande. The party base is increasingly disillusioned and there are serious questions over whether Hollande, or anyone else from the Socialist party, could even make it into the final runoff of the presidential race next May. </p> <p>The French presidential election is more open than any previously. Hollande is France\u2019s least popular president since the second world war, and is expected to announce next month whether he will attempt a re-election bid that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/francois-hollande-would-be-swept-aside-in-presidential-election-poll-shows\">some predict</a> is already doomed. Meanwhile, the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen is tipped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national\">easily make it through</a> to the final runoff. </p> <p>The French right will choose its presidential candidate in a primary race at the end of this month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a>, the pro-business and socially moderate mayor of Bordeaux, is the favourite to win ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">former president Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, who has run an increasingly hardline campaign, veering towards the themes of the far right. </p> <p>But it is the first time the right has held an open primary race to choose its candidate, making the turnout and result hard to predict. Jupp\u00e9 is currently rated France\u2019s most popular politician, and Macron \u2013 who shares similar free-market reform ideas \u2013 is the second most popular.</p> <p>Macron prides himself on his independence and belonging to no political party, saying it doesn\u2019t matter he has never before run for elected office. He describes himself as of the left but keen to bring together people from across the whole spectrum, including the right. Polls show he is most popular among rightwing, older and professional voters. But pollsters have said Macron has his work cut out to expand his support base.</p> <p>Only two years ago, when Macron was Hollande\u2019s chief adviser in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, he was totally unknown to the general public. The philosophy postgraduate and former Rothschild banker\u2019s rise to government minister was so extraordinary and unconventional that he is still known as a \u201cflying saucer\u201d on the political scene.</p> <p>Five years ago the notion that someone with no constituency or political party and no electoral experience could be a serious contender for the French presidency would have been unthinkable. But Macron \u2013 a pro-reformist, pro-business figure who served for two years in a Socialist government while insisting he was \u201cneither left nor right\u201d \u2013 has spent months building up financial and strategic backing for a presidential bid. He is seen as a product of the times: a non-politician wanting to take on politics. Yet, though he is a rebel, he is also a product of the establishment as a former minister and graduate of France\u2019s top civil service school. He is seen as someone new, but a safe pair of hands.</p> <p>As economy minister, Macron regularly launched scathing attacks on the left\u2019s defining characteristics \u2013 from the 35-hour-week to the large public sector \u2013 and repeatedly criticised the discrimination and inequality that still defined France\u2019s high-rise suburban estates. Not afraid of grand metaphors, Macron has likened his own rebellious streak to France\u2019s 15th-century saint and saviour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/joan-of-arc-ring-stays-in-france-after-appeal-to-queen\">Joan of Arc</a>.</p> <p>He has not yet set out his political platform \u2013 which he calls a mission to \u201ctransform France\u201d \u2013 but he has spoken of the need to cure France of its \u201cdemocratic malaise\u201d, warning of people\u2019s distrust of the political class.</p> <p>He has often been intentionally cryptic and is expected to flesh out his ideas in a book this month. \u201cFrance is a project, and that\u2019s the project I want to take further,\u201d he said at a rally in Montpellier last month.</p>",
  "<p>The stress of Brexit is adding to pressure on couples on the brink of divorce, according to the head of the UK\u2019s largest family law organisation.</p> <p>For partners who voted different ways in the referendum, the difficulty of reconciling opposing political views may be the final straw, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/09/legal-aid-cuts-no-fault-divorce\">Nigel Shepherd, the chair of Resolution</a>, which represents solicitors and those involved in family law across England and Wales.</p> <p>His comments come as a Dutch entrepreneur announced plans to set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/23/divorce-new-rules-splitting-up-amicable-marriage-breakup\">divorce hotel</a> in the UK to help separating couples sort out their problems over the course of a weekend. <br></p> <p>Law firms regularly send out press releases warning that Christmas or long summer holidays will trigger a fresh wave of relationship breakdowns, but few such cautions were circulated before the EU referendum in June.</p> <p>For some people, the Brexit vote was a traumatic rupture from the idea of a European union. Shepherd said divergent political perspectives could reinforce personal misunderstandings. </p> <p>\u201cWe have come across a number of families in this country [who are splitting up] because one them voted differently [to the other] in the referendum,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cThey fell out in a big way because one voted for remain and one for leave.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that was unlikely to have been the sole reason [for divorce] but we have heard of cases from a number of our members. It was a really divisive campaign. It pushed some couples [over the edge]. It was the last straw that made them think \u2018we are really incompatible\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A similar phenomenon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/fashion/marriage-politics-donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0\">has been observed in the US</a> among warring couples split between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. <br></p> <p>The legal ramifications of Brexit is also proving a challenge for lawyers. \u201cWe prepare quite a lot of pre-nuptial agreements under the European system but we can\u2019t say now where we would like issues determined,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what marriage regulations will exist.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of a divorce hotel, soothing the process of the final breakup, comes from Jim Halfens, who was a commercial manager in a Dutch law firm.</p> <p>There are already divorce hotels in the Netherlands and the US. Halfens plans to open one in northern England early next year. The idea is for partners to negotiate the final terms of their separation and mark the formal ending of a relationship.</p> <p>Halfens said he came up with the idea after a friend went through a \u201cdreadful and drawn-out\u201d divorce. Only couples who are on speaking terms are likely to be allowed to attend and fees are likely to be around \u00a35,000.</p> <p>\u201cYou start together and you end together,\u201d Halfens explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t need your mother-in-law or new girlfriend to be there. You sit there for two days and you get to solve this issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure cooker where you need to find a solution. It hardly ever happens that [a couple] are not able to solve a divorce. Like this, you know when it starts and ends. You can say it\u2019s a pity that the marriage failed but the divorce should be a positive note in your new life.\u201d </p> <p>The soon-to-be exes are allocated separate rooms in the hotel. \u201cSometimes I thought couples might get back together, but everyone who goes to the divorce hotel goes through to a divorce,\u201d Halfens said. \u201cIt has happened that they sleep in the same room, but they have still gone through with the breakup.\u201d</p> <p>David Leckie, a family mediator who will be the UK hotel\u2019s manager, said: \u201cIt is helpful for people to acknowledge the ending of a relationship in a formal way. Otherwise it\u2019s like people dying without having a funeral. It\u2019s symbolic. It leads to a more positive ongoing relationship with their children.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the effect of Brexit on relationships, he agreed that it was having a negative impact. \u201cIt has imposed an added strain on relationships, one in which people might not be talking to each other as well. Brexit has been an issue,\u201d he said.</p>",

Given that her fury extends beyond Trump to the inequality and bigotry that has infected the body politic, she is sure to have plenty to rage at in the coming years \u2013 no matter who wins.</p> <p>Another of the most successful breakout comedians of this election, <a href=\"http://trumpvsbernie.com/about/\">Anthony Atamanuik</a>, seems to have had enough. Atamanuik spent much of the year touring his Donald Trump impression in the brilliant Trump v Bernie debates with James Adomian. After Trump clinched the nomination, Atamanuik switched to one-man \u201c<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/elections-best-trump-impersonator-reveals-his-secrets-w448704\">Trump Dump</a>\u201d rallies, where he gave long, Trumpish speeches in the Republican candidate\u2019s signature rambling style.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/05/donald-trump-franz-ferdinand-samantha-bee-peter-serafinowicz\">Pop goes Trump! The artists, comedians and meme-makers deflating the Donald</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a show on Thursday night at the New York comedy festival, however, both he and his audience seemed to have had their fill of the election. For his final Trump rally, Atamanuik ditched the parody and launched his own spiel, a personal, leftist take on the history of oppression in America and the laziness of modern-day slacktivism. When he pulled the Trump wig off at the end of the show, the message was clear \u2013 we need to leave this guy in the dust.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ryl2vj0iD4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Ryl2vj0iD4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>So how will comedians \u2013 late-night hosts and standups alike, many of whom barely came to grips with the unparalleled absurdity of the Trump campaign \u2013 handle a world after today?</p> <p>If Clinton wins, it may be tempting for some to shift back to normal as soon as possible, with the \u201cgive it to both sides\u201d mentality that has been the traditional approach to American satire. But has the way some comedians and writers have been so unabashedly partisan in their attacks on Trump broken the seal of balance, pushing comedy into advocacy? In a recent Late Night with Seth Meyers<em> </em>piece for instance, the host was unequivocal in his feelings about election day, comparing Clinton\u2019s problem \u2013 someone who was under federal investigation for using a private email server \u2013 versus a seemingly never-ending list of Trump\u2019s sins. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v97xH6Bof0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9v97xH6Bof0?start=372&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=372\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Clinton has had her fair share of mockery over the decades, but her shortcomings are so much less baroque than her opponent\u2019s that she\u2019s had an easy ride. Will comedians move back into mocking her ruthlessness, Bill\u2019s affairs, her paranoia \u2013 as if they hadn\u2019t been glossing over it for the past six months? Or will they stay kind, just grateful that she\u2019s the one who made it to the Oval Office?</p> <p>Predicting how the satirical class would react to a Trump win is even harder. Early in the race, Trump seemed like a goldmine for comedians, but his sheer grotesquery often put him beyond satire. Trump may have taken offense at Alec Baldwin\u2019s impression of him on Saturday Night Live, but such spot-on mimicry hasn\u2019t had the devastating effect that great impressions \u2013 like Tina Fey\u2019s Sarah Palin \u2013 have had in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787612552654155776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.

Bee has perhaps been better at it than anyone, as this compilation of her Trump thesaurus proves:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ItoQHCgiq8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ItoQHCgiq8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But will it still be funny to refer to President Trump as a \u201cmelting hunk of uninformed apricot Jell-O\u201d in the third year of his term? Even by the low bar of typical political discourse, this election has been abysmally short on policy discussions, particularly where Trump is involved. Are comedians ready to hit him on executive decisions? How will they frame their approach to his presidency? What comedic narrative would define a Trump administration?</p> <p>Like most people, comedians were not fully prepared for a Trump candidacy. After years of politicians like George Bush, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, the comedy institution didn\u2019t know how to handle someone so apparently immune to mockery. So if future leaders attempt to copy Trump\u2019s satire-proof, demagogue style, let\u2019s hope that future comics will have figured out a way to take it down.</p>",
  "<p>A generation ago, a man like David Brunelle would probably be working through the autumn of a long career for the same manufacturer in north-eastern Ohio.

After a late surge in polls, Trump holds a 2.2% lead <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_trump_vs_clinton-5634.html\">in the RealClearPolitics average</a>.

Only eight years ago, 86% of presidential primary voters in Youngstown and the surrounding Mahoning County, for instance, were Democrats and just 14% were Republicans. This year, the split was 51-49.</p> \n<p>Under Barack Obama, Ohio\u2019s economy has recovered steadily from the 2008 recession. The number of manufacturing jobs in the state has actually ticked up slightly in recent years, after falling sharply and consistently under the administration of George W Bush.</p> \n<p>Trump has, however, relentlessly claimed that the sector\u2019s decades-long structural decline was somehow caused directly by Clinton and her husband, Bill, who was president when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which was signed by his predecessor, came into force.</p> \n<p>The Republican nominee has turned the trade pact into a shorthand for one of the central themes of his campaign: that leaders in Washington, supposedly incapable of standing up to canny foreigners, have left US workers exposed to the ravages of international competition without protection.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery time you see a closed factory or wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Springfield last month.</p> \n<p>However untrue, the message has resonated deeply with workers such as Brunelle, who long for the stability enjoyed by their parents and grandparents.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause of global competition, we have to compete with second- and third-rate countries around the world,\u201d he said, noting that he and his friends discuss Nafta quite a bit these days.</p> \n<p>Until last year, Brunelle managed a plant in the town of Bedford for Production Pattern, a company which makes moulds for vehicles. But the firm was buffeted by competition from China, he said, where companies could sell finished moulds for less than the cost of the materials he and his colleagues were using to make them. Some jobs at Brunelle\u2019s plant were moved out of state and others went overseas, he said. Brunelle lost his position, which paid him $70,000 a year.</p> \n<p>Before that, Brunelle was a plant manager for Water Star, a hi-tech manufacturer in Newbury, Ohio. The firm makes anodes and cathodes that are used to purify and treat water. But then Water Star was bought by Tennant, a commercial cleaning company from Minnesota, which wanted the technology for its floor scrubbers. Brunelle lost his job.</p> \n<p>As he wandered around a state-sponsored jobs fair in Akron on Monday, Brunelle winced at the sort of positions on offer at many of the stands.</p> \n<p>Packing boxes of potato chips on the midnight shift for $30,000 a year. Helping gamblers use video slot machines at an out-of-town mega-casino for $10 an hour plus tips. Serving sandwiches in a popular fast-food outlet for $9 an hour.</p> \n<p>Brunelle is a smart man. He knows the arguments in favor of globalisation, knows how difficult it would be for any president to turn back the clock. But as he sets off to wander the aisles for a few more minutes while employers begin dismantling their stalls, it\u2019s just difficult to take.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the long term, maybe it is good for the world economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to go down for the rest of them to go up. And it hurts.\u201d</p>",

She will have to get used to it.</p> <p>EU leaders are planning a meeting in December to discuss Brexit without the British prime minister, the Guardian has learnt.</p> <p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, wants the EU\u2019s 27 remaining member states to discuss Brexit around the time of an EU summit scheduled for 15-16 December, according to two Brussels sources.</p> <p>The British prime minister would attend the EU summit, but would not be invited to separate Brexit talks, the third time the UK has been excluded from leaders\u2019 talks since it joined the bloc in 1973. EU leaders met without David Cameron soon after the Brexit vote and held the summit in Slovakia without Theresa May in September.</p> <p>The meeting is a sign the EU27 are intensifying preparations on Britain\u2019s EU exit ahead of article 50, which May has promised to trigger by the end of March.</p> <p>Once the UK fires the starting gun on talks, the EU will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations, a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of Gibraltar.</p> <p>That work hasn\u2019t started yet, but Tusk wants to start preparing the ground. One senior EU diplomat told the Guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and precision: \u201cif the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to adopt, if they are very detailed, they are likely to take more time.\u201d</p> <p>Brussels diplomats are keenly following Brexit fallout in the UK.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary, one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system. The reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism.</p> <p>The democratic structure of the UK and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system. The tragic recent history of Europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts. That road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction. I would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste, will want to reflect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Explaining to the assembly in Cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing, Antoniw said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.</p> <p>I think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage, as the high court itself said, this case involves a pure question of law. It is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the European Union and the politics surrounding that.</p> <p>The sole legal question at issue is whether the UK Government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the European Union. In seeking to intervene in any appeal, the Welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law: core, established principles of British constitutional law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Antoniw emphasised that the Welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having outlined what the case is about I should also make a comment on what it is not about. The first minister has made crystal clear and I repeat that sentiment now: the Welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821fae1e4b07ceadb3a39c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T16:23:28.701Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The legal commentator <strong>Joshua Rozenberg </strong>has posted a good story <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaRozenbergQC/posts/222545208167403\">on his Facebook page.</a> He says that Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination.

In contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary (\u201cwhen did the cycle start and end?\u201d, \u201cwhy 40% of GDP?\u201d, \u201cwhy should debt definitely fall between two future points in time?\u201d, \u201cwhy should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed level?\u201d) and/or were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks (\u201cwhy must there be an overall surplus in 2019\u201320?\u201d, \u201cwhy must borrowing in 2013\u201314 be no more than half what it was in 2009\u201310?\u201d). The weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821f373e4b029b92ca46a93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:56:12.758Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more pictures from Theresa May\u2019s India tour today.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00/0_94_3390_2035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572/0_240_4716_2829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1/0_240_4507_2705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256/0_0_3092_5184/596.jpg\" alt=\"Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.\" width=\"596\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is what Number 10 said about the visit in a briefing note sent out in advance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will visit the Sri Someshwara Temple in the Ulsoor District of Bengaluru later today to pay her respects at this ancient Hindu place of worship.</p> <p>She will be welcomed by a guard of honour consisting of garlanders (who place a garland of fragrant flowers around the neck) and musicians playing drums and horns. </p> <p>She will then tour the temple, built by the Chola dynasty (300 BCE\u20131279 CE) and showcasing an impressive mixture of Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagar architecture.</p> <p>Someshwara means \u201che who wears the moon on his head\u201d, and is another name for Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in the Hindu triumvirate.</p> <p>The prime minister will conclude her visit by participating in a Hindu Aarti (blessing).

So we should all give a lot of thought to that when you\u2019re talking to your friends and neighbours and trying to influence them. The first thing this election is about is how to restore broad-based prosperity and growth to the American economy. And I hope in the next presidential debate she and Senator Sanders and the others will be able to talk about what the best way to do that is. Hillary says that you have to have a campaign that appeals to the struggling, the striving and the successful. We have to do this together. And Bernie says just go get the money from the millionaires. And it sounds good because there\u2019s \u2013 to a lot of people, if you look all over the world \u2013 the British Labor Party disposed of its most (inaudible) leader, David Miliband, because they were mad at him for being part of Tony Blair\u2019s government in the Iraq War. And they moved to the left and put his brother in as leader because the British labor movement wanted it. When David Cameron thumped him in the election, they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they hadn\u2019t moved far left enough, and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the British Labor Party, who I saw in the press today said that he was really a British citizen and had real British (inaudible). (Laughter.) </p> <p>But what that is reflective of \u2013 the same thing happened in the Greek election \u2013 when people feel they\u2019ve been shafted and they don\u2019t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them. And that is perfectly psychologically understandable and predictable. Most people in America haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. 86 percent of the American people, adjusted for inflation, have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash. The median income of American families, adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. </p> <p>So this election, first of all, should be: how do we restore broad-based prosperity? We\u2019ve only had one period in 50 years, since the early 1960s, when all segments of the American economy grew together, and that was the eight years when I served. You have to work at that. It is not an accident. That\u2019s a matter of policy. It really does matter what you do. And I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we moved 100 times as many people out of poverty into the middle class through work as happened in the Reagan years.

But building a plan for further austerity in the next parliament would be prudent. Indeed even if a balanced headline budget was delivered in 2020\u201321 and then maintained thereafter public sector net debt would not be on course to reach its pre-crisis level of 40% of national income until around the mid-2040s. Unfortunately if anything the \u00a325 billion estimated deterioration in the public finances in 2019\u201320 is likely to understate the increase in the longer-term challenge that has occurred since the March Budget. The OBR\u2019s previous long-run projections were based on an optimistic assumption about NHS productivity growth which they have recently said is likely to be revised down in their future projections. More fundamentally any reduction in future immigration, any reduction in longer-term growth or any increase in future interest rates would make the fiscal arithmetic harder still. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning Nick Gibb, the education minister, and Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, are both giving evidence to select committees.

This unlikeliest of public servants began his political life as the anti-Obama candidate, seeking to ride the swinging pendulum away from a high point in racial equality and shifting into opposition to the equivalent moment in women\u2019s emancipation.</p> <p>It was a crowded field. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was long seen as the Republican frontrunner and raised more money within weeks than his self-described billionaire opponent was ever to contribute to the presidential campaign. Yet Bush was to flop disastrously at the first brush with actual voters. His measly three delegates in the Republican primary election \u2013 0.2% of the total needed to secure the nomination \u2013 were to cost $50m a piece. Fifteen other candidates copied his ignominious exit from a one-sided Republican primary that felt like an election all of its own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e544c32e1e00112248a54e2042b7604b8fc87526\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e544c32e1e00112248a54e2042b7604b8fc87526/0_0_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Eight of the Republican candidates \u2013 not even half the field.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eight of the Republican candidates \u2013 not even half the field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images and Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite failing against Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton\u2019s coronation as the Democratic nominee looked so preordained that some worried whether the party would ever find a serious candidate to run against her in the primary at all. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren was petitioned by many on the left and resisted. Sanders, an independent Vermont senator, stepped forward instead \u2013 at first with little hope of winning much beyond his home state, but determined there should at least be a debate about a more progressive alternative to the centrism traditionally associated with the Clinton family.</p> <p>The 74-year-old was to win 22 states and ride a tidal wave of enthusiasm rarely seen in politics. Fueled by anger over economic inequality and corruption, this gruff outsider came close several times to achieving enough momentum to pull off a victory that would have made Trump\u2019s nomination look tame. Like the reeling Republicans, the Democratic party too was convulsed by a wave of populism it first seemed ill-equipped to recognise, let alone respond to.</p> <p>Though a generation of young white supporters \u201cfelt the Bern\u201d, his campaign nonetheless never reached escape velocity. Quite apart from its shocking radicalism (at least by modern American standards), it was held back by a lack of early media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/02/bernie-sanders-revolution-white-african-american-voters\">limited support among African American voters</a> in the south and determined resistance from the party hierarchy. Despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, Clinton was to win nationally by a clear and convincing majority.</p> <p>But the long, and sometimes bitter, Democratic primary showed its eventual nominee\u2019s vulnerabilities just as much as it also helped shift her manifesto to the left in ways even Sanders could once only dream of.

The highlights instead were the moments when it became apparent America had left the railing and was heading off into some entirely new and uncharted territory.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tjPZvxwgEk\">first descended the golden escalator</a> of his Manhattan skyscraper into a flock of reporters hungry for excitement.

An excited press pack chased her across the plains of Iowa in a bus they dubbed the \u201cScooby van\u201d, only to discover a tightly disciplined campaign nothing like the cartoon playing on the other channel.</p> <p>Trump also immediately showed a remarkable gift for offending people. In the same first speech, Mexican immigrants were dismissed as \u201crapists\u201d, bringing nothing but drugs and crime to the US. Within minutes it was clear this would be a shockingly divisive campaign.</p> <p>But it was a weapon he would wield effectively against Republican opponents. Bush was taunted as \u201clow energy\u201d during a series of debates that played to Trump\u2019s strengths as a TV performer but brought the Grand Old Party down to the level of a schoolyard bully. </p> <p>By the time New Jersey governor Chris Christie joined in by destroying another promising rival, Marco Rubio, it was clear Trump had re-created the brutal dynamic of his reality TV franchise, The Apprentice. Like many bullies, he also showed the thin skin \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/donald-trump-hand-display-madame-tussaud-wax-museum\">small hands</a> \u2013 that Clinton would later learn how to exploit in their own debates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/republicans-lose-election-day-donald-trump-civil-war\">Win or lose, Republicans are heading for civil war after election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She showed early poise, too, in her debates against Sanders, helped by his determination to focus on their many policy disagreements. \u201cThe American people are sick of hearing about your damn emails,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-damn-email-server\">conceded</a>, rescuing his opponent from an early controversy over a private email server she had used while working as secretary of state.</p> <p>It was an issue that was to come back to haunt her again. Though many Democrats agreed with Sanders, the email controversy raised worrying questions about Clinton\u2019s penchant for privacy. Why should she evade rules designed to ensure classified information remained safely stored on government computers \u2013 measures that meant embarrassing transgressions might be subject to freedom of information requests? Meanwhile Republicans asked: what did she have to hide?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f15912430b9bd93ad742058561d7a039a8e0cae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15912430b9bd93ad742058561d7a039a8e0cae4/0_102_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making up after a rough Democratic primary season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sanders would not avoid digital controversy either.

Hers was, without doubt, one of the most qualified candidacies of modern times.

Michigan was the biggest shock, pointing to the anger in the industrial midwest over trade policy. Wisconsin and Colorado were other states where Sanders would continue to raise the hopes of his supporters and the eye of Republican strategists come November.</p> <p>But Clinton also demonstrated her strength in diverse, prosperous, metropolitan America. Her wins in New York and California finally extinguished the Bern and showed the power of the multi-racial coalition built up by Democrats. Neither Green party candidate Jill Stein nor libertarian Gary Johnson would gain much traction against such a polarising pair of candidates in the months of bitter slogging that followed the primaries.</p> <p>When things looked bleakest for Trump, he would turn abroad for inspiration. He visited Britain the day after it voted to leave Europe to align himself with the mood of rebellion and invited UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage to campaign with him in Mississippi. He would travel to Mexico to try to prove statesmanship, and developed a bizarre affinity with Vladimir Putin that would lead some to suspect Republicans had nominated a modern-day <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/is-donald-trump-a-manchurian-candidate\">Manchurian candidate</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s authoritarian streak was most visible during the Orwellian-sounding Republican convention in Cleveland where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\">proclaimed himself the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d</a>.

She arrived at the station, inside an elementary school, with husband Bill Clinton just under four hours after landing in Westchester from a final day of campaigning with four rallies across three battlegrounds.</p> \n<p>Dozens of supporters had braved a chilly fall morning to greet the candidate they hoped would be the first woman to serve in the nation\u2019s highest office. Chants of \u201cI believe that she will win\u201d and \u201cMadame President\u201d broke out as the Clintons emerged after voting in the company of an eager herd of locals who appeared to forget their own ballots in the company of the former \u2013 and perhaps future \u2013 first couple.</p> \n<p>Clinton told reporters voting for herself was \u201cthe most humbling feeling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will do the very best I can if I\u2019m fortunate enough to win today.\u201d Clinton also confessed to thinking of her late mother, Dorothy Rodham, who she has described as one of her greatest inspirations.</p> \n<p>It was then a quiet afternoon for the Democratic nominee. She taped a series of radio interviews, and prepared for the night that will seal her fate from her home with a small group of confidantes. Clinton was set to watch the returns from The Peninsula, a luxury hotel that, incidentally, sits a block from Trump Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue.

  "<p>The breakout star of this football season may very well be a punter. If that sounds like some sort of backhanded compliment of a 2016 NFL season that has seen poor reviews and declining ratings, maybe it is. But it\u2019s not intentional because, well ... have you seen Marquette King punt? The guy has legitimately made punting fun. Punting. Fun. We could be on the verge of seeing a punter\u2019s jersey on the backs of NFL fans without a single one being purchased ironically.</p> <p>The Oakland punter\u2019s breakthrough into mainstream awareness came on Sunday in a nationally televised game against the defending Super Bowl champions when he pinned the Broncos inside the five with a third quarter boot and then did this. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/795469641598599168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Marquette King pinned the Broncos inside the 5 then did this dance <a href=\"https://t.co/fRqvQzcxn8\">pic.twitter.com/fRqvQzcxn8</a></p>&mdash; Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/795469641598599168\">November 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>NFL fans and football celebratory greats of the past <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ochocinco/status/795468294421520384\">immediately took notice</a>. The 28 year-old, fifth-year pro out of Fort Valley State became the latest star on a first-place Raiders team increasingly flush with them. As entertaining as it is to watch Derek Carr fit a pass into a tight window, or Amari Cooper go up high for a reception, or Khalil Mack chase down a ball carrier, or Sebastian Janikowski power the ball through the uprights, sometimes we just want to see the Raiders fail. Sometimes we just want to see Marquette King have to punt. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/07/andrew-luck-indianapolis-colts-nfl-green-bay-packers\">Andrew Luck shows he is still a quarterback for crunch time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wanting to see a punter is a surprising thought to have, but King\u2019s punting has always surprised. In his first NFL preseason game in 2012, the opposing team was sure King\u2019s presence on the field indicated a fake punt was coming. \u201cA black punter? It\u2019s a fake! It\u2019s a fake!\u201d he says they yelled, sure he was some wide receiver or quarterback thrown into the game for a bit of trickery. But he simply booted the ball deep down the field and has continued to do so since. King is sixth in the league in punting average and eighth in net yardage and he got here not by going to punting camps or punting in high school, but by teaching himself how to punt simply because he found joy in kicking balls as hard as he could. It\u2019s like a happy version of the Draymond Green story. </p> <p>It\u2019s that joy in his job, not his stats or his color or his odd path to the NFL, that makes King such a fun player to watch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m breaking any news here: the NFL has been suffering from a severe fun deficiency. The very idea of fun has been legislated out of the game. But now we have a player not just openly enjoying himself, but doing it while punting. <em>Punting</em>. Punting has never been considered a celebratory act. In the realm of giving up, it\u2019s not far behind putting a positional player in to pitch in baseball. It\u2019s admitting defeat, admitting failure and just saying to the other team: \u201cYou stopped us so completely we\u2019re just going to give you the ball now. Congratulations.\u201d The appearance of a punter on the field never makes the fans cheer. Punters don\u2019t make the highlight shows unless the failure of punting is topped by even more failure like a blocked punt or a return for a touchdown or the punter getting annihilated by a block. And punting is completely banned from the RedZone Channel. (There is a PuntZone channel, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThpPHgYkHMI\">only as a joke</a>.) Kickers at least get credited sometimes for game-winning kicks. No one has ever been carried off the field after a game-winning, 50-yard punt because there has never been a game-winning punt. Punting is losing. </p> <p>And yet King has still turned a punt into a positive by the natural joy he takes from the job. \u201cI want kids watching the game on Sundays to look at me and say: \u201cHey, that dude is pretty cool. He\u2019s got some swag. I want to be a punter, too,\u201d King wrote in the Players\u2019 Tribune. Most parents would take their son or daughter to a child psychologist if they expressed interest in becoming a punter \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to live for, Billy!\u201d \u2013 but \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cpunter\u201d in the same sentence doesn\u2019t sound crazy coming from King. He\u2019s breaking stereotypes: racial and punting ones.</p> <p>Short of finding a referee who manages to make throwing his penalty flag 20 times a game fun and entertaining or Roger Goodell finally becoming self-aware and realizing he needs to resign immediately for the good of the game he professes to love and cherish, a happy punter might be exactly what the NFL needs right now. King might even be the athlete America needs right now. It\u2019s too late to nominate him for president \u2013 and if we\u2019re still planning on adhering to the Constitution, he\u2019s too young anyway \u2013 but the entire country could use King\u2019s mindset after this election season. It has been awful and negative and oftentimes felt hopeless. Maybe we didn\u2019t have the candidates we wanted. Maybe we won\u2019t have the president we wanted. Maybe we don\u2019t have the job we want. Maybe our whole life feels like one sad punt from deep in our own territory on 4th-and-19 on a football field that has a baseball diamond on it for half the season and for a team that is trying to leave for another city. But we can still find a way to smile and have fun. We can dance. We can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarquetteKing/status/794042631542030336\">wear our pads to the club</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarquetteKing/status/794258274212147200\">dress up like a Power Ranger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarquetteKing/status/795775292052684800 \">kick stuffed animals down the street for unknown reasons</a>. Things aren\u2019t all bad. There\u2019s good to be found even in failure. There are good punts.</p>",
  "<p>Has 2016 gotten to be a bit much? Has the election driven you to digital distraction? All right: stop, collaborate and listen.</p> <p>The internet is back with a brand new invention, one that involves stopping everything for a moment and pretending that you\u2019re a non-sentient being immune to whatever nonsense is currently going on in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/this-was-the-election-of-disillusionment\">This was the election of disillusionment | Steven Thrasher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am referring, of course, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/nov/07/the-mannequin-challenge-like-the-harlem-shake-but-stationary\">Mannequin Challenge</a>, which has recently become a thing. Indeed, it\u2019s now starting to overtake long political rants as the thing you\u2019re probably seeing most of on your social media feed. The trend apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thvtmelanin_/status/791414169329369088\">started</a> with high school kids who may have taken their teacher\u2019s supplications to \u2018please, can you all just sit still\u2019 a little too literally. It infiltrated the adult world over the weekend; the hashtag #mannequinchallenge has been mentioned <a href=\"http://time.com/4562272/hillary-clinton-mannequin-challenge/\">2.3m times</a> in the past week on Twitter. <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/destinys-child-adele-mannequin-challenge/\">Everyone</a> from Adele to Ellen DeGeneres the New York Giants has given it a go. Destiny\u2019s Child even briefly reunited briefly to film their take. And Hillary Clinton\u2019s team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/795955854059171840\">got in on the (non)action</a> Tuesday morning.</p> <p>So what exactly is the Mannequin Challenge? The clue is in the name. A group of people freeze in mid-action like mannequins while someone goes around filming them. The only thing moving in the shot should be the camera. Then you put a soundtrack on it, stick it online, and watch the likes rack up. Black Beatles by Rae Sremmurd is one of the more popular options for soundtracks. It\u2019s a perfect song for the challenge because there\u2019s a quiet build up and then, around 25 seconds in, the beat drops and \u2026 nothing happens.</p> <p>You see, normally when the beat drops in a video meme, things happen. In the Harlem Shake it\u2019s the moment where everyone starts dancing. But with the Mannequin Challenge, the song gets going and everyone stays resolutely in position. It\u2019s, like, we\u2019re all going to stand this one out, OK? We\u2019re exhausted. Let\u2019s see about dancing next year.</p> <p>In a sense, the Mannequin Challenge is not actually that new; it\u2019s just a digital reboot of a craze from the 19th century for tableau vivant. Otherwise known as \u2018living pictures\u2019, these were used to dramatize important moments of history or famous paintings. They were also a bit of after-dinner fun. People used to hang around in their parlors after dinner and recreate famous scenes. To younger readers: yes, that is what life was like before the internet. It was rough.</p> <p>But while it may date back to the 19th century, the Mannequin Challenge is also very much of the moment. The fact that just being quiet and still for a moment has been so enthusiastically embraced by everyone from high schoolers to imminent presidents is a sign, I feel, that we are all very, very tired, and we would like a little rest, please.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/trauma-presidential-election-2016-turning-point\">What can we salvage from the trauma of the US presidential election? | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Mannequin Challenge isn\u2019t the only indicator of a need for less speed in an always-on, always-moving world. In August, Netflix started to air slow TV. Something of a cultural phenomenon in Norway, slow TV is basically a genre where nothing happens for hours on end. The first installment, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7VYVjR_nwE\">7.5-hour train ride</a> from Bergen to Oslo, was watched by around 45% of Norway\u2019s population.</p> <p>Just to reiterate, absolutely nothing happens on this train ride. There\u2019s no background music or narrative. It\u2019s just train sounds. Oh, and there are several tunnels, so the screen often just goes dark. This quiet hit was followed by other instant classics such as National Knitting Morning, National Knitting Evening, and National Knitting Night (my favorite of the trilogy). That Netflix US has recently picked up Slow TV might be a sign it thinks that Americans may well be in need of a little audiovisual Xanax.</p> <p>And then, of course, there\u2019s the growing popularity of mindfulness, which has gone mainstream in the last couple of years. In a world where being busy is the ultimate badge of honor, corporatized mindfulness allows you to take some time out in a socially approved way. You\u2019re not just sitting around doing nothing, you\u2019re not taking a break, you\u2019re being <em>mindful.</em></p> <p>When there\u2019s constant pressure to be achieving, and doing, and ticking off boxes, and racking up likes, it\u2019s worth remembering that there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing nothing now and again. We shouldn\u2019t need Slow TV or mindfulness apps or Mannequin Challenges to give us an excuse to just sit quietly. </p> <p>Still, here\u2019s hoping the Mannequin Challenge ushers in a new era of Slow Viral Memes. Maybe a Putting on the Kettle For a Nice Cup of Tea Challenge? Or a Just Having a Quick Nap Challenge? Of course, depending on how the presidential election turns out, the next viral trend may well be emigrating en masse to Canada.</p>",

It will feature a range of content as well, including commercial advertising, digital and video art, and interactive media. \u201cIt will be timed, so that the thing is a living entity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will wake up in the morning, have certain content on it specifically about West Hollywood and upcoming events, traditional movie trailers, and some portion of the time allocated to it being taken over entirely for site specific artwork.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"713420d59a9013106fd481dbd54a89b2d77b7383\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/713420d59a9013106fd481dbd54a89b2d77b7383/0_4_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Weho Belltower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WeHo Belltower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Belltower</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A grant will be provided for the artists made possible by the commercial revenue from the billboard. Wiscombe has partnered with the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), who will be curating the artistic program. Although the details are still being worked out (the structure is not scheduled to be finished until 2018), Sarah Stifler, MOCA\u2019s chief communications officer, said the museum found the project attractive for two reasons. \u201cThe first is that it allows us to get out into another location in the city. The other is that this completely unconventional canvas offers an opportunity for real creative innovation. That\u2019s an exciting thing for us to help artists navigate.\u201d</p> <p>The main west-facing side will be a large LED billboard, while other surfaces will incorporate large-format projectors, mainly active at night. The interior space is also the most experimental with the potential for interactivity. Wiscombe suggests it could feature projections of faces trending on social media \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for instance \u2013 allowing visitors to combine and alter them via smartphones.</p> <p>He also sees the structure as a hub for performances, connecting local events with a worldwide audience. \u201cIt can be used as a kind of transmitter of what\u2019s happening in real time out to the world, where it\u2019s being videoed, re-projected real time on the board, and sent out on to social media all at the same time,\u201d Wiscombe predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s some kind of new stage.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Belltower Project looks like a vision from the future, something out of Blade Runner perhaps, Wiscombe looked to LA\u2019s past for precedents. \u201cIn the billboard world, the world spectacular specifically means a billboard that has special effects attached to it: a giant 3D steaming hamburger, or a shark,\u201d Wiscombe noted. \u201cThe best precedents are here on the Sunset Strip.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>As she has reminded us through her campaign, Hillary Clinton has 30 years of political experience she may drag over the finish line into the executive office. But her opponent represents a series of unknowable unknowns.<strong> </strong>Sure, Donald Trump is as well-known as Clinton, but he has chalked up not a single month of political office, and has no track record. </p> <p>It\u2019s also very hard to work out who his key advisers will be. His campaign is very much a family affair. Much of the Republican establishment has distanced themselves from him \u2013 some so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/18/stop-donald-trump-presidency-republicans-vote-hillary-clinton\">they will be voting for Clinton</a>. It is not clear who his key economic, defence or foreign policy advisers are and 50 former Republican national security advisers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\">publicly declared</a> against him in August. They are unlikely to be summoned back into the State, Defense or Homeland Security departments.</p> <p>There are also clear policy differences between Trump and his more experienced vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence. Trump has publicly declared, in a presidential debate, that he <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-mike-pence-relationship\">disagreed</a> with Pence on Syria. So the prospect that Trump would sit back and let Pence run the executive while he \u201cmakes America Great again\u201d looks low. </p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Both candidates would face challenges governing </strong></h2> <h2></h2> <p>Both candidates will face a challenge in terms of how much they could actually do if elected. That will depend on the Congressional arithmetic. But Trump and Pence are short of any of the Capitol Hill experience that can help US presidents get Congress to work. And after such a polarising election, gridlock looks the most likely outcome even for such a seasoned operator as Clinton. That means domestic inaction \u2013 but also means that the president may be tempted to focus even more on redefining the US\u2019s international role.</p> <h2><strong>These unknowns will make planning in the UK very difficult</strong></h2> <p>In the run-up to any US election, the British embassy in Washington will try to build contacts to people who are likely to form part of the next administration and try to work out how a new president\u2019s policy positions will affect UK interests.</p> <p>Most famously Jonathan Powell, who went on to be Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff, was detailed to get to know the team of a then little-known governor from Arkansas back in 1992. That set the basis for the close relationship between new Democrats and New Labour. Access to the Trump campaign will have been harder.</p> <p>The National Security Council should have been having discussions on the potential implications of a Trump presidency for Nato, relations with Russia, the Middle East and wider security issues. But they will hang on any post-election words for more concrete indications of a new style of governing. Diplomats will then lobby for an early visit to the US to cement the specialness of the special relationship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jun/24/whitehall-brexit-civil-servants-jeremy-heywood\">Whitehall has no roadmap for the gargantuan task of enabling Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>But what will they talk about?</strong></h2> <p>The UK has in the past presented itself as a bridge between Europe and the US.

  "<h2>Candidates sign off on 2016 election campaigns</h2> <p>The long, bitter presidential campaign is finally over and the two historically unpopular candidates have handed off to the nation\u2019s 225,788,000 eligible voters. At a monumental, final rally at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton, flanked by her husband, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama promised a better future for the country and vowed to \u201cbridge the divides\u201d that emerged during the campaign. Obama, passing the torch to Clinton, echoed the themes of 2008 as he urged voters to \u201creject fear and embrace hope\u201d. The party was joined on stage by Lady Gaga and Jon Bon Jovi. Meanwhile in Michigan, Republican candidate Donald Trump ended his campaign with a show of relative restraint: \u201cWe\u2019re hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change,\u201d Trump told thousands of supporters who waited until 12.30am to see him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have real change, not Obama change.\u201d Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/us-election-2016-complete-timeline-clinton-trump-president\">timeline</a> of how we got here and check out our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-results-live\">election day live blog</a> for rolling coverage.</p> <p><strong>You can also sign up for our groundbreaking mobile election alert:</strong> The new live-updating alert we\u2019re launching will be one of the fastest ways worldwide to monitor US election results.

When David Cameron thumped him in the election, they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they hadn\u2019t moved far left enough, and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the British Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton continued: \u201cBut what that is reflective of \u2013 the same thing happened in the Greek election \u2013 when people feel they\u2019ve been shafted and they don\u2019t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them.\u201d</p> <p>While he does not make it explicit, it seems Clinton is likely to be using \u201cmaddest\u201d in the US context of \u201cangriest\u201d. <br></p> <p>Such a political reaction was \u201cperfectly psychologically understandable and predictable\u201d, Clinton argued in the speech, delivered at the home of a local real estate developer and his wife.</p> <p>\u201cMost people in America haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cEight-six per cent of the American people, adjusted for inflation, have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash. The median income of American families, adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the speech made no mention of UK politics, instead covering a range of areas including the US economy, gun control and the rise of Islamic State, and talking up Hillary Clinton\u2019s qualifications to be president.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn said he had no response to Clinton\u2019s remarks. <br></p>",
  "<p>The 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton\">Republican primary</a> was supposed to be an embarrassment of riches for the GOP. </p> <p>In contrast to 2012, the Republican party was set to feature a slew of young, articulate conservative superstars fighting it out for the nomination. The only question was whether it would be the year of a tough-as-nails union-busting Wisconsin governor (Scott Walker), an inspiring Florida senator (Marco Rubio), an ideological Texas firebrand (Ted Cruz), or perhaps an Oxford-educated policy wonk from the Bayou (former governor Bobby Jindal). Or, maybe, one of the more seasoned former conservative governors would win the day, such as Florida\u2019s Jeb Bush or Texas\u2019s Rick Perry.</p> <p>But such hopes were dashed on 16 June 2015 when one Donald J Trump took what he now calls the \u201cfamous escalator ride\u201d down Trump Tower to announce his candidacy. The establishment immediately mocked him. But he went on to shock them.</p> <p>Over the next 11 months, the ideologically malleable alleged billionaire browbeat his way to the Republican nomination. He tagged his opponents as too low energy (Bush), too dishonest (Cruz) and too little and sweaty (Rubio) for the Oval Office. He would allow nothing to stand in his way \u2013 certainly not the truth \u2013 in his quest for the Republican nomination. </p> <p>To evangelicals, the thrice-married New Yorker with a potty mouth that made even Howard Stern blush pretended to be a committed Christian, even declaring that the reason the IRS was auditing his tax returns was probably because of his religious devotion. To immigration hawks, he pledged to deport each and every illegal immigrant in the country, even though he said after the 2012 election that the reason Mitt Romney lost was because of his harsh stand on immigration. </p> <p>But Trump didn\u2019t win the Republican nomination because of his policy positions. He won because of his personality and brand. For nearly four decades, he painted himself as the world\u2019s greatest businessman. Trump\u2019s lifelong marketing scheme got a boost from Hollywood in 2004 when he was cast as the star of the NBC reality TV show The Apprentice, where he flaunted his executive authority each week in front of millions.</p> <p>Trump was at his best when he wasn\u2019t talking specifics. He promised to make all America\u2019s problems go away, to make America great again, if Americans just put their faith in him. He was the strongman who was going to make everything OK if you just trusted him and didn\u2019t ask questions.</p> <p>And it worked in the Republican primary. But the nomination fight revealed much more about Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and the Republican electorate than it did about Trump. To those who cared to look, it was well known before Trump ever entered the presidential race that he was a dishonest lout whose business success was far less than claimed. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s presence in the race revealed that the supposed GOP superstars were too weak to stand up to the charlatan in their midst. As for the Republican primary electorate, we learned that perhaps they don\u2019t care so much about conservative principles after all \u2013 that the conservative movement may be nothing more than a collection of magazine offices and think tanks in Manhattan and Washington, DC. No true believer in conservative principles could ever get behind Donald Trump. </p> <p>In winning the Republican nomination, Donald Trump may have destroyed the Republican party and drastically set back the conservative movement. His anti-immigrant vitriol, his mainstreaming of conspiracy theories, his portrayal of American exceptionalism as an arrogant concept, his anti-women invective and, yes, his occasional racism will taint the Republican party for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Well, it will taint the Republican party if it lasts. But that remains an open question. The odds are Hillary Clinton will win, and the question will then be: what will become of the Republican party? Will the #NeverTrump wing and the Always Trump forces come together? Or will a civil war break out, ultimately tearing the party it apart? </p> <p>The GOP should have been ascendant this election cycle. Instead, it lies in ruins, all thanks to Donald Trump. He\u2019s the man of the hour, exactly as he would want it to be. </p>",

But, however the result goes, this has been a uniquely unsettling and frightening year for the world\u2019s biggest democracy, so it feels fitting that The Iron Heel, London\u2019s book about the collapse of US democracy and brutal rule by a thuggish elite, emerged as the first popular choice in our vote.</p> <p>Orwell called The Iron Heel a \u201cremarkable prophecy of the rise of fascism\u201d. It provides a dystopian vision of the US in which the middle class are squeezed out of existence, farmers reduced to serfdom and a few oligarchs control nearly all the wealth, not to mention a private army of mercenaries, and rule \u2013 as the title suggests \u2013 by stomping on the face of all who oppose them. It sounds uncomfortably like your average liberal\u2019s worst fears, and I hardly dare read it until the nightmare of this US election is finally over.</p> <p>There are more reasons for leaving extra time before embarking on The Iron Heel: it appears to be out of print in the UK (<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1164/1164-h/1164-h.htm\">although freely available online, because it\u2019s out of copyright</a>), so this should provide a bit of time to hunt down copies. Last week I mooted the idea that we should run a Jack London double-header, since many of his books are so short and since his output was so varied and fascinating. This was a popular idea, and dozens of votes were cast for other books. Several ran The Iron Heel a close second.</p> <p>But there was also strong support for taking London\u2019s two classic canines-in-the-Yukon books, White Fang and The Call of the Wild, together, forming, as participants neatly labelled it, a doggy diptych. This joint ticket proceeded to come in joint second along with The People of the Abyss \u2013 until reading group stalwart Natasha Fatale leaped in at just the right moment with a casting vote. So I propose that we read The Call of the Wild and White Fang first, discuss those two next week, and then come to Heel towards the end of the month, once we\u2019re all feeling a bit calmer. Or entirely terrified.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/sep/13/jack-london-the-paths-men-take-photographs-book\">Jack London documents his world \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say we\u2019ll escape politics entirely as we read White Fang and The Call of the Wild, which are not just stories about dogs. White Fang, for instance \u2013 try not to be alarmed \u2013 was partly inspired by Nietzche\u2019s ideas about the superman. The books can also be seen as allegories for London\u2019s own wild life and his journey from outcast hobo to prosperous writer. As stories about human injustice and the shape of society, they may be as sharp toothed in their politics as the Iron Heel.</p> <p>That said, the main things I remember from my own childhood reading is the evocative descriptions of the Yukon and the great northern emptinesses, particularly superb passages such as the famous opening of White Fang:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness \u2013 a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, please. As soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this, I\u2019m going to put the kettle on, put some logs on the fire and break out for the wilderness. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll learn some survival skills that will help over the next few days.</p>",

Likewise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/22/roger-ailes-fox-news-sexual-assault-allegations\">Roger Ailes</a>. Powerful men who had been in the public eye for decades were made to face the claims of their accusers. More than that, the public finally listened.</p> <p>It\u2019s upsetting but not surprising that this happened in tandem with a woman\u2019s rise to the top of a major party ticket for the first time. The forces that made that impossible for the past 240 years are same ones that taught these men to measure their power in terms of their control of women, that it\u2019s excusable to treat women as trophies or toys.</p> <p>While Trump is the only person running for high office who\u2019s had more than a dozen different women come forward to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">accuse him</a> of sexual misbehavior and assault, he\u2019s far from the only powerful man to have internalized misogynistic values. And while the wider electorate, and women and minorities in particular, have signaled we are ready to evolve from this social barbarism, the swell of popular support for Trump signals that too many men in America are not.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Republican men, either. Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest weakness when it comes to painting herself as a leader for women is her own husband\u2019s past. Bill Clinton\u2019s record doesn\u2019t look so good re-litigated by the standards of 2016. As a result, he\u2019s wisely opted to get out of the way. His most effective speech of the campaign, given at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, was more love ballad than call to arms. \u201cIn the summer of 1971,\u201d he began, \u201cI met a girl ...\u201d</p> <p>A few decades back, it was she, not Bill, who was the political liability in the relationship, famously refusing to change her last name, bake cookies, and stand by her man in the soul-crushing Tammy Wynette sense of that phrase. But our culture has shifted dramatically since then.</p> <p>As more women make the same choices young Hillary Rodham did, she appears in our rear window as ahead of her time. But so much of this race has been stuck in the gender politics of the past. </p> <p>Her character has been reduced to \u201cresilience\u201d; her theme music is Fight Song; the one thing everyone, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-fighter-229499\">even Trump</a>, will praise her for is staring down defeat after defeat after defeat. Many of the words used to describe Clinton tell us as much about us as they do about her. </p> <p>And the final insult is that she may just lose it all again. Because, well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">Anthony Weiner</a>. It\u2019s not so much that Clinton is innately secretive and often seemingly bereft of personality \u2013 it\u2019s that being a woman seeking power in our society made her that way.</p> <p>This has already been a big year for feminism, but there\u2019s a lot of work left to do. If we make Clinton president tonight, we can expect the work of equality to continue. It\u2019s hard to know whether a vision of the first female president will help destroy bygone gender identities, or drive those who cling to them screaming into the arms of the next manifestation of Trump. What we do know is that everything from parental leave to equal pay and the right to control our own bodies will get a different treatment than they\u2019ve ever had from office of the president.</p> <p>And if we get a President Trump? It\u2019s hard to fathom just how much damage he could do. He\u2019s promised to jail his opponent and wants to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws to make it easier to sue the press. He\u2019s hinted that he won\u2019t accept the results of the election unless he wins. He\u2019s said those who get abortions should endure some form of punishment. His <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-town-hall/\">walkback</a> notwithstanding, women certainly would be punished in some form or other under a Trump administration.</p> <p>Whatever happens, we shouldn\u2019t forget the trauma of the election that got us here. All the ugliness we\u2019ve seen is part and parcel of the fight to shatter that \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d. And no matter how bad it gets, and no matter how many times we have to hear phrases like \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, we know we can\u2019t plug our ears or stay quiet, because all of this would just happen again. This is the moment to speak. This is the moment to say: it stops here. </p>",

In my time here I have met very few who are enthusiastic about either but many who loathe one or the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/middletown-timeline/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Middletown timeline\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/middletown-timeline/embed.html\">Middletown timeline</a> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s always election fatigue by this point in the process. But this time, more than any other I\u2019ve seen, I think people want it to be over. The nerves it has exposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">are too raw</a>, the divisions too deep and the performances too bizarre for people to indulge as part of the back and forth.</p> <p>I\u2019ve covered too many elections in which both sides insist that the future of the republic is at stake to take that claim at face value. Once again though this one feels different. One poll showed half the voters <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/26/poll-clinton-builds-leads-nation-worried-election-day-violence-trump/92712708/\">fear there could be violence </a>on Tuesday. We will have some kind of result on Wednesday but with both sides declaring the apocalypse if the other side wins, it\u2019s not obvious to me that it\u2019ll be accepted, whoever wins.</p> <p>Next week I\u2019ll publish my final piece in The View from Middletown series. (You can catch up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/ng-interactive/2016/oct/11/view-middletown-gary-younge-us-presidential-election\">all my reporting in this series here</a>.) Remaining in Muncie for a month, guided by your suggestions, has helped me go beyond the superficial analysis and better understand this election. I hope it has helped you too. Regardless of the result, this election has laid bare the importance of reliable news sources, such as the Guardian, countering smears and rumours.</p> <p>But alongside the facts we have also brought perspective. After I wrote my first article Jamie Walsh, a former Muncie resident, wrote: \u201cI cried when I saw your article. I literally wept at the thought that there are people out there that still give a shit about us.\u201d I was able to follow up with Walsh and her voice found its way into a few articles. After the second article a student from Ball State University wrote: \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing, coming to Muncie and showing the election to the UK, to the world really, through our eyes is completely amazing. It\u2019s coverage about the election that I feel like I actually want to read.\u201d </p> <h2>What you\u2019ve been saying</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I love about this whole project is the focus on a real place ...

It will take the form of a long read in which I bring together what I\u2019ve learned in the month I\u2019ve spent in Muncie and draw whatever parallels I can between my reporting here and the national landscape after the election.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a fabulous month and I have been the recipient of extraordinary generosity \u2013 people have given me time, food, advice and friendship. I\u2019ll miss it.</p> <p>Last week, before dawn broke, I went to the Central high school to witness a twice-weekly ritual. Just after 7am, about 10 adults, black and white, stood at the doors forming a human corridor as the kids walked in. They held up signs with messages such as \u201cWe believe in you\u201d, \u201cYou are the future\u201d, \u201cLove one another\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re proud of you\u201d. Some gave fist bumps as the kids walked in, others hugs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for them to know that there are adults out here who care about them,\u201d explained Cornelius Dollison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-  middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">a well-respected figure</a> in Muncie\u2019s civic life.</p> <p>How effective it is I couldn\u2019t say. But it was certainly moving to see such a selfless piece of civic engagement seeking to make some connection and give encouragement to young people in a town where some are told and believe they have no future.</p> <p>American politics is doing a grave disservice to American people. It\u2019s not that citizens aren\u2019t out there fighting for it. I\u2019ve seen it, in a range of ways on both sides of the divide, in my time here. Sadly, whatever the result on Wednesday, they will have to fight much harder and longer for the politics they deserve.</p> <p><em>Main image by David Levene for the Guardian</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>If you\u2019ve appreciated this series, become <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/uk/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_mem_garymunciefinal_inarticle\">a Guardian Supporter</a>, or make <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/home?INTCMP=co_uk_editorial_garyyoungeelectionday_footer\">a one-off contribution</a> to fund our unique journalism</strong><br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/sep/30/enhance-middletown/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/sep/30/enhance-middletown/boot.js\" data-alt=\"Interactive script\"> </figure>",
  "<p>This election, white people in the Republican party settled upon the angriest, meanest, vilest person they could rally around \u2013 a con artist whose con they may well have been in on. He embodied their rage, and the possibility of enacting revenge for a black president, a declining white majority and a rising Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>But as the campaign wore on, the angry white man at the top of their ticket made Republicans, who have long fancied themselves Christian moralists, look increasingly hypocritical. He openly bragged about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/election-2016-sexism-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">size of his penis</a>, said he could <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/23/donald-trump-iowa-rally-shooting-sot.cnn\">shoot someone on Fifth Avenue</a> without losing voters, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/11/26/donald-trump-mocks-reporter-with-disability-berman-sot-ac.cnn\">mocked a disabled reporter</a> and boasted of grabbing women \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">by the pussy</a>\u201d. It didn\u2019t seem to matter. By the time he wrapped up the primary, I predicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/may/11/trump-has-to-be-the-next-president-american-history-dictates-it-video\">Trump would become the 45th president</a> \u2013 and if it were <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/dissecting-donald-trumps-support/499739/\">up to white men alone</a>, he probably would.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, though, people of color had different ideas about who should be America\u2019s leader. In the Democratic primary, some of those ideas took shape \u2013 and a socialist channeled the conversation in surprising new ways.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/path-election-day-hillary-clinton-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b39z\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876172\" data-video-name=\"Bumpy road to election day: Clinton's campaign in two minutes \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"C-Span, CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, AP, ABC News\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5821f678e4b07ceadb3a39aa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108clinton_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108clinton.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108clinton_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/path-election-day-hillary-clinton-video\">Bumpy road to election day: Clinton\u2019s campaign in two minutes</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton began a spirited and substantive contest, full of clashing policies and differing approaches to education, foreign affairs, Wall Street regulation, and healthcare. Sanders won an astounding <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/\">43%</a> of the Democratic primary votes (and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-young-democrats-love-bernie-sanders/\">handily won</a> its young people), after running against the biggest family machine in Democratic politics. But he never effectively made his case to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">black or Hispanic voters</a>, his team wasn\u2019t ready for primetime, and he lost \u2013 though not exactly fairly and squarely. Leaked emails revealed that the Democratic National Committee was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders\">no unbiased arbiter</a> in the primary. Meanwhile Sanders was harmed by the fact that, by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/12/17/wheres-bernie-media-ignores-sanders-though-hes-more-popular-than-trump/\">some estimates</a>, Trump got 23 times the media coverage he ever did.</p> \n<p>Then, after the primary was over, the quality of discourse dropped - particularly with regard to subjects that were important to young people and people of color. If you were against Trump, the options varied between conservative and unimaginative. Gone was the spirited debate of the primary; assuming that progressives and people of color had nowhere else to go, Clinton welcomed the endorsement of neocons like John Negroponte and offered up pabulum like \u201cAmerica is great because America is good\u201d. Black Lives Matter \u2013 the most exciting movement in contemporary American politics \u2013 was never mentioned in the general debates, not even in St Louis, a few miles away from the scene of Michael Brown\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>Many black voters, including me, came to feel the Democratic party had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">little or nothing</a> to offer us. This is not simply because Hillary Clinton once spoke of \u201csuper-predators\u201d \u2013 a whole lotta black politicians in the 1990s voted for that crime bill, too \u2013 but because the Black Lives Matter movement has changed the conversation about respectability politics. It made us ask if black politicians, or our alleged allies, are actually helping achieve black liberation. After we went all out for Barack Obama in 2008, only to discover that having a black president didn\u2019t change how black people are disproportionately unemployed, arrested, incarcerated and killed by police, it\u2019s little wonder that early voting is down among black voters. Not only that; as Luvvie Ajayi <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Luvvie/posts/10107001752798080\">points out</a>: \u201cThis is also the first major election since 1964 where the Voting Rights Act hasn\u2019t protected us\u201d. We are tired of fighting GOP <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/study-finds-republican-voter-suppression-is-even-more-effective-than-you-think-3b2562ae2f52#.olav37i1m\"> voter suppression</a>, Trump\u2019s attempts at <a href=\"https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F19%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html%3F_r%3D0\">voter intimidation</a>, and the fact that <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/335786/long-lines-minority-voter-suppression/\">black people wait twice as long as white people to vote</a>.</p> \n<p>Hispanic Americans have also found good reason to be disillusioned. When Trump called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and criminals, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/nbc-donald-trump-2015-6\">NBC cut ties with him</a> \u2013 only to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-hosts-saturday-night-live-amid-protests-n459341\">welcome him back to host Saturday Night Live a few months later</a>. The message was symbolic and clear: America would tolerate Trump\u2019s disdain for Mexicans if and when it seemed profitable. A handful of politicians distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d remark and his lewd comments about a white woman. But Paul Ryan, Newt Gingrich and the entire Republican establishment embraced Trump after he demonized Hispanic people. Hillary Clinton, likely to continue the deportation policies of the Obama administration, is not offering a satisfying alternative.</p> \n<p>Native people are disillusioned, too. They are the <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/19/the_police_killings_no_one_is\">most likely</a> to be killed by police and, in North Dakota, are supposed to accept <a href=\"http://www.attn.com/stories/12405/two-tweets-show-double-standard-standing-rock-debate\">having their water threatened</a> in a way the white people of Bismarck didn\u2019t. And while they have mounted a beautiful and sustained protest at Standing Rock, they have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/dakota-pipeline-protest-bundy-militia\">assaulted</a> by the state for peaceful demonstration while the Bundys got off scot free.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"569772bd-4556-4621-a8b0-3ee9683bf545\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"expandable\"> \n    <h1>US presidential election: five scenarios </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>1) The Clinton Crush: In which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;loses every state with even a hint of Democratic flavor and drops a few big Republican ones too \u2013 the fantasy scenario for every American offended by Trump\u2019s candidacy</p>\n     <p>2) The Trump Bank Shot: Trump has performed strongly all night, winning Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa.

  "<p>The 2016 American presidential election has been an absurd, exhausting and bruising spectacle. Now imagine living through it all as a Muslim American. Somehow, this election has managed to cram all the Islamophobic sentiments of the last 15 years into the span of 15 months, and then morph them into one ugly thing. </p> <p>Donald Trump is largely to blame. He called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country until it became clear that the proposal was embarrassingly ill-conceived, only to be replaced by the equally vague \u201cextreme vetting\u201d. He fought publicly with the Gold Star Khan family, suggesting Ghazala Khan was not \u201callowed to speak\u201d at the Democratic convention because of her Muslim faith. He <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/15/top-republicans-pretend-donald-trump-didnt-just-say-u-s-muslims-shield-terrorists/\">accused</a> Muslim Americans as a group of harboring terrorists. There\u2019s more, but we all know the story by now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/new-york-muslim-woman-set-on-fire-eid-al-adha\">A Muslim woman was set on fire in New York. Now just going out requires courage | Linda Sarsour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has insulted and defamed many different groups along the way, but what we may not realize is how it\u2019s different when it comes to Muslims. Over the course of the campaign, Trump has very publicly reached out to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-latinos-20160820-snap-story.html\">Latino</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/08/19/trump-to-african-americans-vote-for-me-what-do-you-have-to-lose.html\">African American</a> and <a href=\"http://qz.com/823649/donald-trump-unfurled-a-rainbow-flag-with-lgbt-written-on-it-at-a-rally-in-greeley-colorado-to-express-his-so-called-support/\">LGBTQ</a> voters to ask for their support. We can question his sincerity, but the gestures are there. He even briefly tempered his tone regarding Mexicans during a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-mexico-visit-20160831-snap-story.html\">quickly arranged visit</a> to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City last August. </p> <p>His daughter <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">Ivanka</a> and wife <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/melania-trump-interview/\">Melania</a> have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward women, and Ivanka also <a href=\"http://time.com/4515709/ivanka-trump-campaign-ad-women/\">recorded</a> an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father. Trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled reporter, and despite a bevy of antisemitic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-anti-semitism-young-jews-214314\">incidents</a> involving Trump and his supporters over the past months, he has also <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/broward/fl-jjbs-candidates-1102-20161101-story.html\">directly</a> sought Jewish American support. Such is his style of leadership: he may insult you, but he still wants your vote. </p> <p>Not so with the Muslims. A tiny handful of Muslim Americans may, bizarrely, be Trump supporters, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that, while attempting to engage every other constituency, Trump\u2019s campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the Muslim electorate. It\u2019s as if Muslim citizens already don\u2019t exist in Trump\u2019s America.</p> <p>The irony is that Trump\u2019s willful blindness to Muslim voters may lead to his defeat. Muslims may only account for a small part of the American population, but a concerted <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/us-election-muslim-voters/3576727.html\">push</a> by Muslim Americans during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered Muslim voters, more than double the number in 2012. And Muslims tend to live in key battleground states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. </p> <p>But Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on all of those votes either. Many Muslim Americans have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric. \u201cWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our frontlines,\u201d is a standard Clinton refrain, and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of \u201cfrontline\u201d of warfare. </p> <p>This is so not true: the front line of Costco, maybe. Most Muslim Americans are boring, middle-class folk. Clinton also seems to see Muslim Americans as separate from her idea of \u201cwe\u201d (\u201cwe\u201d need \u201cthem\u201d to be part of \u201cus\u201d) and to believe that we, as a group, carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may \u2013 or may not! \u2013 be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the United States. </p> <p>This is offensive to our citizenship, and Muslim Americans must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition. But what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for Muslim Americans today. That won\u2019t change after 8 November, regardless of who wins. </p> <p>Even with a Clinton victory, Trump and his \u201cmovement\u201d, which is how he refers to his campaign, will not simply vanish. And the suggestion that Trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly comforting, as if there has never been a connection between mass media and far-right politics. So how prepared are we, as a nation, to deal with Trumpism after Tuesday?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/911-15-anniversary-united-states-lessons\">How we learned all the wrong lessons from 9/11 | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there\u2019s any good news to come out of this election, it\u2019s that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is Islamophobia.

Now we must be prepared to do the work necessary to hold our leaders to that standard every day, and not just once every four years.</p>",

Crites said his name only appeared in the leak because he was listed as a subscriber to one of Stratfor\u2019s newsletters.</p> <p>The genesis of the fake story about Crites\u2019 grandmother, and the way in which it bubbled through from blogs to a Fox News report, seemingly without any attempt at corroboration, is unclear.</p> <p>Both of Crites\u2019 grandmothers are alive, but the trail of false allegations leads to Wilda Austin, who resides at his family address.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WDFx2EU8/status/795267833185779713\">A Twitter user</a> first made the false connection between Crites, whom it called the \u201cTrump Reno assassin\u201d and his \u201cdead granny\u201d on Sunday afternoon.

What do these stops tell us about the race?</p> <p>Typically, last-minute campaign decisions are based on internal campaign polling not available to the public. Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.</p> <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago.</p> <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes Tuesday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/clinton-trump-final-campaign-stops-election-what-it-means\">The last-minute map: how to read each presidential candidate\u2019s final stops</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214bdae4b029b92ca467a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:56:06.278Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shares in Asian markets \u2013 where it\u2019s Tuesday already \u2013 have edged up as the prospect of a Clinton win looks more likely, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday ahead of the election, with investors optimistic but cautious over improving prospects for a win by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The Mexican peso, which strengthens as the perceived chances of an election victory by Donald Trump fall, retained its strong gains from Monday.</p> <p>The dollar, which also advanced on Monday, edged slightly lower. </p> <p>Boosting Clinton\u2019s chances of winning, and markets globally, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">statement by the FBI on Sunday</a> standing by its July finding that Clinton was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server. </p> <p>That came after the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">announced on 28 October</a> it was reviewing additional emails relating to the server while Clinton was secretary of state, sending markets around the world tumbling. </p> <p>Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability, and, until last week\u2019s stumble, had been seen as the likely victor in Tuesday\u2019s presidential vote. </p> <p>But investors remained wary, noting Britain\u2019s shock vote in June to leave the European Union had defied most polls and bookmakers\u2019 odds. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs markets head into the U.S. election, a final recalibration of risk is in train,\u201d Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note. <br></p> <p>\u201cAsia-Pacific markets were the first to adjust to the political shift, and may trade more modestly today after roaring back to life yesterday.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on markets in Asia and beyond as the votes are totted up on Tuesday (or Wednesday as it\u2019s known in some parts of the globe).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214ad7e4b029b92ca467a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:48:25.836Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Miami Herald op-ed page is keeping it simple tomorrow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatriciaMazzei/status/795819819090186240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prediction: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeraldOpEd\">@HeraldOpEd</a> gonna get a *few* emails about this one.

The cities he listed then \u2013 Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte, Richmond and Fayetteville \u2013 had large minority voting populations.</p> <p>In response, local Democratic parties in six battleground states filed lawsuits against Stone, Stop the Steal, and Republican parties, alleging broad efforts to intimidate minority voters.<br></p> <p>The new guidelines for the Stop the Steal volunteers nationwide come as another federal judge expressed skepticism that Democrats had any proof that the Trump campaign, local Republican parties, Stone and Stop the Steal were \u201cconspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting\u201d, as Democrats had alleged in multiple lawsuits.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, US district judge Paul Diamond denied Democrats\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order on voter fraud prevention activities on Monday, ruling that Democrats had failed to make \u201cany credible showing\u201d that voters\u2019 rights were in jeopardy. The judge slammed the local Democratic party for \u201cbelated, inflammatory allegations<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>appear intended to generate only heat, not light\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court on Monday also denied a request to restore a sweeping temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge in Ohio last week, which had briefly enjoined the Trump campaign, Stone, and Stop the Steal, as well as the Clinton campaign, from engaging in a variety of voter intimidation behaviors. A panel of sixth circuit judges had quickly stayed the order, which a leading election law expert had <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88761\">dubbed</a> \u201clikely unconstitutionally vague\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-poll-watcher-voter-fraud-roger-stone-steal-the-vote\">Donald Trump ally swears vigilante poll watchers will not target voters by race</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582127b8e4b07ceadb3a360b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T01:18:19.213Z\">1.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump campaign creates 'voter assistance hotline'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>From an email sent to supporters this evening:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thank you again for supporting Donald Trump for President.

The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> <p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> <p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> <p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out.</p> <p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> <p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality.

They are, in fact, widespread and even predicted by some local officials.</p> <p>Since 2000, the popularity of early voting has increased from 12% of the electorate to an anticipated 40% this year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-voting-2016-election/\">CBS report of the AP Election Research Group</a>. During that same time though, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-love-early-voting-and-it-might-help-clinton/\">Republican-led</a> legislatures have pushed back against early voting in Ohio, Arizona and Nebraska. </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>In-person early voting tends to benefit Democrats. In North Carolina, for example, 60% of black voters \u2013 a reliably Democratic group \u2013 cast early ballots, as opposed to 44% of white voters, according to the <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">Institute for Southern Studies</a>.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">US Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which required some southern states to get pre-approval of election law changes from the federal government, North Carolinian state representatives passed a law that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">eliminated early voting on one Sunday</a>. In part, that move was designed to impact \u201csouls to the polls\u201d day, a powerful program that brings black churchgoers to vote after Sunday service.</p> <p>A judge struck down that state law in July, finding that it targeted African Americans \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">with almost surgical precision</a>\u201d. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">three North Carolina counties</a> still managed to limit early voting the Sunday before election day.</p> <p>Research from the Brennan Center for Justice on three states with the longest lines in 2012, Florida, Maryland and South Carolina, found that voters in urban areas tended to have fewer machines, less poll workers or both. More research cited by the center backs up findings that voters in <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/10/11/democrats-maintain-edge-as-party-more-concerned-for-latinos-but-views-similar-to-2012/\">Latino</a> and African American districts tend to wait the longest (both constituencies lean Democratic).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just this spring, lines were so long in Arizona that voters of both parties were <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/25/471891525/arizona-polling-places-overwhelmed-with-long-lines-on-primary-day\">livid</a>. Why? Republican state officials cut budgets for county officials, who in turn demanded cheap elections, which cut polling places. Democratic leaders tended to blame Republicans, who cut budgets. Arizona was another state that used to be required to seek pre-approval of election law changes under the Voting Rights Act.</p> <p>If politicians wanted to end long lines, experts say some simple recommendations could make a big impact. A January 2014 report called The American Voting Experience looked at ways that officials could predict and plan for voter turnout, after Floridians waited <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/no-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote/264506/\">seven hours</a> to vote for Barack Obama in 2012.</p> <p>They found that expanding early voting, online registration, new technologies and efficient polling place management could all help reduce and eliminate long wait times. </p> <p>So if you\u2019re waiting in a long line, congratulate your fellow voters, and consider a letter to you local election commission. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5820cee2e4b07ceadb3a34c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T19:00:40.062Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama picks up on report that aides confiscated Trump's Twitter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Don\u2019t miss this from the New York Times: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-race.html\">Inside Donald Trump\u2019s Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the juicy details: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/\">the Twitter account</a> that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals.

It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/hillary-clinton-white-house-donald-trump-bullying-barbara-kingsolver\">End this misogynistic horror show.

(In 2012, the state did not report results until four days after election day.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving the high early vote totals in both FL and NC, we&#39;re going to know fairly early on whether Clinton has won or Trump still has a shot.</p>&mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Steve Schale is a Democratic analyst who ran Florida operations for Obama in 2008. He<strong> <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">sees low-propensity Hispanic voters</a> </strong>\u2013 meaning voters who weren\u2019t judged especially likely to turn out \u2013 <strong>pushing the election in Clinton\u2019s direction:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But two things emerged last week. One, this low propensity Hispanic thing became a thing. While Trump folks argued that Trump would turn out low propensity voters, we\u2019d see slight edges for Democrats in this category. What became clear over days last week, this was a Hispanic deal, and as week 2 of early voting took hold, so did this surge. As of Saturday, Democrats had an edge of more than 175K low propensity voters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale also sees <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">serious strength</a> for <strong>Clinton in Miami-Dade:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dade is at 11.9% of all votes cast so far (should be 10.3%), and Broward is at 9.55%, where I had it pegged at 8.75%. The media market is a full two points bigger than it should be. If the Miami market finishes at 21.8% of all votes, this thing is cooked, and we will know it before 8:00 (assuming Miami decides to count all these ballots)</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale sees <strong>Clinton \u201cunder-performing\u201d in Palm Beach county,</strong> two counties north of Miami:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The red flag for Dems: Palm Beach. It is at 62% of its 2012 total, and it is also the county most \u201cunder-performing.\u201d It should be about 7% of the state vote, but today it is about 5.9%. Of all the data points right now, this is the only one that concerns me. While Miami is more than making up for it, for HRC, win path is much easier with a more robust Palm Beach.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">Here\u2019s Schales conclusion:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am going to write a wrap tomorrow for E-Day, but two questions I get a lot.</p> <p>What am I worried about for HRC?</p> <p>Really, almost nothing. I\u2019ve mentioned the Palm Beach thing a few times, but right now, the diversity mix is rounding nicely into shape, and our best counties are way out-performing the state. Right now, she needs the organization on the ground to get this done on Tuesday</p> <p>Could there be a Trump surge on Tuesday? It is possible, because the counties most under-performing right now are Trump counties. His problem, most of them are very small, part of what Jonathan Martin called the Gingrich Counties (where Newt beat Romney)-- those rural places in-between all the big counties.</p> <p>All in all, the I-10 markets are way below where they should be, maybe as much as 3% below where its share should be. If that comes in tomorrow, it will tighten the race considerably.</p> <p>Tomorrow\u2019s memo will also lay out some things you watch for. If she wins by 3, we will know pretty well, probably before the Panhandle returns come back after 8. If it is close, prepare for a long night.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c4ce4b07ceadb3a33c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:26:50.731Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>She was 9 or 10 years old (depending on whether she falls in Aquarius-Leo or in Virgo-Capricorn) when the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Desiline Victor, at 106 years old, is the oldest voter in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiDade?src=hash\">#MiamiDade</a> arrives at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthMiami?src=hash\">#NorthMiami</a> to cast her vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeCareWeVote?src=hash\">#WeCareWeVote</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobilizeFlorida?src=hash\">#MobilizeFlorida</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PfPo7aeGRx\">pic.twitter.com/PfPo7aeGRx</a></p>&mdash; 1199SEIUFlorida (@1199SEIUFlorida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209ab8e4b029b92ca464f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:18:06.012Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi Grandma, what are you doing today? </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has a granddaughter who just turned two, and a grandson who\u2019s five months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:58.9932126697% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BMg3PI8AH2J/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hillary Clinton Facetimes with her granddaughter Charlotte on final morning of the campaign trail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-11-07T15:11:20+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 7, 2016 at 7:11am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209989e4b07ceadb3a33b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:14:43.720Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Philly transit strike ends</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If voters in Philadelphia, prime Democratic territory, don\u2019t turn up at the polls tomorrow, they will not have a weeklong public transit strike to blame.

  "<p>To become the 45th president of the United States, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has to win 270 electoral college votes. The candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat, but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor. (Well, probably. If there\u2019s a 269-vote tie, or a mandatory recount, prepare for constitutional chaos.)</p> <h2>So remind me how the electoral college works again? </h2> <p>Each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes, ultimately based on its population. California has the most, with 55. Seven states \u2013 Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming \u2013 have just three electoral votes. Washington DC gets three too.</p> <p>While there are 50 states in the US, most of these are \u201csafely\u201d Republican or Democrat. They vote the same way every time going back at least six elections. So the presidential election boils down to just a handful of \u201cswing states\u201d \u2013 the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both Republicans and Democrats. </p> <p>This is why voters in places such as Ohio, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado and New Hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops. It\u2019s also why you have not seen Clinton and Trump holding rallies in Louisiana (safely Republican) or Washington (safely Democratic).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump faces a much more difficult path to victory. He needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president, whereas if Clinton wins two or three, she wins the race. </p> <p>This is because Democrats start from a stronger position. There are 18 states plus DC that have voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992. That batch amounts to 242 electoral votes. There are only 13 states that have voted for a Republican in every election since 1992. Those states carry just 102 electoral votes.</p> <p>If Clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past, then adds Florida (which has 29 electoral votes), she is the next president. If she loses Florida but wins, say, Virginia and North Carolina, she will be the next president.</p> <p>Trump needs to hold on to all the historically Republican states, win states such as Georgia and Arizona \u2013 which are usually Republican but where he has struggled in the polls \u2013 and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\" data-alt=\"Poll closing times\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\">Poll closing times</a> </figure>  <p><em>(For our international readers following along across Europe and beyond, a little light math for you ... in the UK, Ireland, Iceland and Portugal, add five hours to ET; anywhere else from Poland west, add six hours; in eastern Europe, add seven hours; Australia add 16 hours; and so on.) </em></p> <h2>6pm ET (5pm CT, 4pm MT, 3pm PT, 11pm GMT) \u2013 let\u2019s go!<br></h2> <p>Buckle in because now the real fun begins: polls close in eastern Kentucky and most of Indiana.

But Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have to worry about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency. A nice way to toast \u2013 and mock, if you were minded to do so \u2013 the 70-year-old builder might be to mix up a <a href=\"http://www.liquor.com/articles/presidential-election-cocktails/\">\u201cThe Donald\u201d</a> cocktail as you settle in for the night.

Trump likes the Rolling Stones and played this song at his rallies. The Rolling Stones do not like Donald Trump, and asked him to stop. He didn\u2019t.</p> <h2>7pm ET (6pm CT, 5pm MT, 4pm PT, 12am GMT)</h2> <p>Voting ends in three key swing states: Virginia, Florida and New Hampshire (where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm ET).<br></p> <p>Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college <a href=\" http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/election-day-voting/\">votes</a> have proved crucial in the recent past. Al Gore can tell you that. He narrowly lost the state \u2013 some still believe he actually won \u2013 and the election to George W Bush, despite winning the national popular vote. </p> <p>Away from the top of the ticket, Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is up for re-election. He has been running a bit ahead of Democrat Patrick Murphy in the polls. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who resigned as chair of the Democratic National Committee in July after leaked emails showed the party favoring Clinton\u2019s campaign, is expected to comfortably win re-election to Congress.</p> <p>Virginia was a reliably Republican state until Obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012. The state\u2019s mix of less-educated, rural voters; wealthy suburbanites; federal government employees and military families; academics; jet-setters and so on make it difficult to read, but Clinton has been decisively ahead this year. </p> <p>New Hampshire has been won by a Democrat in five of the past six presidential elections. But the Granite State gave Trump his first big primary win, and recent polling here has shown a tight race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311/0_0_1472_5321/277.png\" alt=\"Spicy Hot Sauce\" width=\"277\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spice things up</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erickson Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other states closing at 7pm ET include South Carolina and Vermont \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 home state.

Expect the result from West Virginia very quickly \u2013 Trump should win easily. </p> <p>North Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer. Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state, voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964. That run might be coming to an end, however, either <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_kyle_kondik/why_trump_will_do_better_in_ohio_than_he_does_nationally\">because of the state\u2019s changing demographics</a> or because of the strangeness of the current contest, in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates. </p> <p>While its demographics are complicated \u2013 a mix of Rust Belt, big cities, Appalachia, farmland and more \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/politics/ohio-campaign-trump-clinton.html\">Ohio electorate</a> has grown more white and less educated than the national mean. That trend appears to account in part for Trump\u2019s strength in the Buckeye State this year.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack: </strong>The Pretenders, Message of Love. Because Chrissie Hynde is was born in Akron, Ohio. You could also make a point about spreading a message of love. Or of someone pretending to spread a message of love. Not that we\u2019re questioning, in any way at all, how much politicians love the voters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>8pm ET (7pm CT, 6pm MT, 5pm PT, 1am GMT)</h2> <p>In 2012, the Associated Press called the Indiana result just before 8pm. Vigo County, which borders Illinois in west Indiana, is seen as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/portrait-bellwether-indiana-county-has-history-picking-presidents#slide1\">the ultimate bellwether</a>. It has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections \u2013 dating back to 1888. Keep an eye out for its result.</p> <p>A big swing state closes its polls at 8pm: Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Republicans have long dreamed of winning Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes, based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the state. But Clinton has been creaming Trump in polls in Philadelphia and its suburbs, which is where most of the people live, and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months. </p> <p>Pennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of Trump\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">claims</a> that there has been voter fraud in Philadelphia in the past and his calls for \u201cvolunteer election monitors\u201d.</p> <p>The results in non-swing states will start to come in thick and fast. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey and Rhode Island all close at 8pm ET, and we can expect AP to call all these states pretty much immediately.</p> <p>Maine\u2019s polls also close at 8pm. It is one of only two states \u2013 the other is Nebraska, where voting finishes at 9pm \u2013 that splits its electoral votes <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/\">according to congressional district</a>.</p> <p>The state as a whole is likely to vote Democrat, but Trump may steal an electoral vote in Maine\u2019s second district, which is made up of more rural voters.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel:</strong> There\u2019s a whole \u201cChefs for Hillary\u201d page <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?rs=ac&amp;len=2&amp;q=chefs%20for%20hillary&amp;etslf=4171&amp;eq=chefs%20for%20hilla&amp;term_meta[]=chefs%20for%20hillary%7Cautocomplete%7C\">on Pinterest</a>, a tribute to Clinton\u2019s attempts to win the foodie vote. <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/554716879086195985/\">One of the recipes is provided by John Podesta</a>, the chairman of Clinton\u2019s campaign.

In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was declared the winner just before 8.30pm. A Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t won in Georgia since proper southern boy Bill Clinton in 1992, but strong support for Hillary Clinton in Georgia counties with a high African American population, and in Atlanta, have made her a threat to Trump. </p> <p>If Clinton wins Georgia, Trump might as well concede. (Don\u2019t hold your breath.)</p> <p><strong>Election tunes: </strong>Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler). The African American vote is in, and Trump gets a big 1%.</p> <h2>9pm ET (8pm CT, 7pm MT, 6pm PT, 2am GMT)</h2> <p>Polls close in two traditional swing states: Wisconsin and Colorado, and in Arizona, which is usually firmly Republican but is swingy this year.<br></p> <p>An increasingly influential Hispanic bloc and Mormons who can\u2019t stand Trump \u2013 not to mention a superior Democratic ground game \u2013 mean that Clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first Democrat to win Arizona since her husband in 1996.</p> <p>When the polls close in New York, at 9pm ET, they will have been open for 15 hours \u2013 the longest polling window of any state. Barring an almighty upset, Clinton will quickly be declared the winner.</p> <p>Wyoming, Louisiana, North and South Dakota, Kansas and Texas all close at 9pm too. The networks should swiftly call these for Trump \u2026 unless loose talk of Clinton taking Texas, which last went Democratic in the Watergate era, comes true? If it\u2019s that kind of night, water the horses and go to town.</p> <p>Nebraska, which like Maine splits its electoral votes by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/\">congressional district</a>, shuts its polls at 9pm ET. Barack Obama won Nebraska\u2019s second district \u2013 Omaha \u2013 in 2008. Clinton could do the same this year, thanks to a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort spearheaded by Susan Buffett, daughter of Warren. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8edfd50af2c072354a729c7babe3cd48a3ecacea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8edfd50af2c072354a729c7babe3cd48a3ecacea/0_0_2261_2097/1000.png\" alt=\"Slice of plain cheesecake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"927\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Election fuel:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.food.com/recipe/new-york-cheesecake-57025\">New York cheesecake</a>. Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago but was a senator from New York for eight years. Donald Trump was born in Queens, New York, before inheriting his father\u2019s successful real estate business. In January, Trump claimed his popularity was such that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue [in New York City] and shoot somebody\u201d without losing voters. Trump <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html\">has been trailing</a> Clinton by 20% in New York.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack:</strong> Fleetwood Mac, Silver Springs. \u201cI know I could\u2019ve loved you, but you would not let me,\u201d laments Arizona\u2019s Stevie Nicks. Might Trump be thinking the same thing when the Grand Canyon State\u2019s results come in?</p> <h2>10pm ET (9pm CT, 8pm MT, 7pm PT, 3am GMT)</h2> <p>Given Clinton\u2019s apparent strength in Pennsylvania, we may see the state called for her by 10pm (or, in a deeply troubling upset for her, Trump may win). The New Hampshire result should also come in around this time. They will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going.</p> <p>Nevada and Iowa are the final swing states to close their polls. In the past two elections, Iowa was called quickly for Obama. Montana and Utah also close at 10pm; both are traditionally safe Republican states, but Trump\u2019s unpopularity means <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-24/mormon-support-could-push-mcmullin-over-the-top-in-utah\">independent Evan McMullin</a>, who\u2019s from Utah, has a strong chance of becoming the first non-Republican or Democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968. </p> <p>Utah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past. If McMullin is declared the winner, it\u2019s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory, terra incognita, in the most exciting way. Former congressional staffer Evan McMullin: buckle up, America.</p> <p><strong>More election drinking:</strong> Yuengling brewery \u2013 the oldest brewery in the US \u2013 is based in Pennsylvania. Its owner <a href=\"http://www.phillyvoice.com/beer-drinkers-disavow-yuengling-after-owner-shows-support-for-trump/\">came out in support of Trump</a> in October, a move which has seen some drinkers boycotting the beer. You could however source some craft ale from the <a href=\"http://www.victorybeer.com/\">Victory Brewing Company</a>, also based in Pennsylvania.

These are all safe Democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome. </p> <p>Back in 2012, the Associated Press called the swing states of Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 worth a combined 48 electoral votes \u2013 in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm, then declared Obama\u2019s re-election at 11.38pm. </p> <p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ksUPU0Nbo\">networks announced</a> Obama had won just after 11pm.</p> <p>We might know the outcome sooner this time. Or we might not know for a while.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls, then we may see states called for her earlier, on the back of strong early voting results. If enough swing states are called quickly, we could find out the result before 11pm ET. Or, if Trump proves the polls wrong, the race could as quickly run to him.</p> <p>Separately, there are some individual states to look out for.</p> <p>Ohio is one. Some polling experts believe that if Trump doesn\u2019t win there, it is effectively game over. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-trump-wins-heres-how-the-map-might-look/?ex_cid=538twitter\">Fivethirtyeight.com gave him</a> less than a 1% chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye State.</p> <p>Likewise, if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/most-routes-to-270-blocked-for-trump-needs-last-ditch-surge/2016/10/30/b3cf409a-9ede-11e6-8864-6f892cad0865_story.html\">it also becomes very difficult</a> for him to win.</p> <p>And beyond that, if Clinton can win Georgia \u2013 remember, these are usually solidly Republican \u2013 it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579/0_0_1197_3576/335.png\" alt=\"Queen Latifah\" width=\"335\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen Latifah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called for four days.

We may see the first female president, following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women. Queen Latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.chowhound.com/recipes/cuban-sandwiches-30428\">Cuban sandwich</a>. Florida\u2019s signature dish is said to have originated in Cuba or in Key West, part of the Florida Keys archipelago. It\u2019s got ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles in it, and might be a good way to soak up the booze.</p> <h2>Time for the the speeches?</h2> <p>In the early hours, we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech \u2013though Trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result. </p> <p>If elected, Clinton would be the first woman to be elected US president. She has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-glass-ceiling_us_579827fee4b0d3568f85272e\">repeatedly spoken</a> about breaking the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d in politics, and has chosen to hold her election night party at New York City\u2019s Javits Center, which <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/politics/hillary-clinton-election-night-javits-center-irpt/\">actually has a glass ceiling</a>.</p> <p>If Trump is elected, he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/252557-how-often-do-americans-elect-political-outsiders-to\">only the fifth</a> president to have never held elected office. </p> <p>The winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 January 2017.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re concerned about post-election withdrawal symptoms, don\u2019t worry: the midterm elections, sometimes seen as a referendum on the president, will take place in November 2018. All 435 members of the House of Representatives will be up for re-election, along with a third of the Senate and more than half the governors.</p> <p>And then, in summer 2019, a whole new cast of hopefuls will announce their presidential campaigns, and the whole thing starts over again.

  "<p>Frank Archambault is not going to vote for president. </p> <p>In mid-July, the 45-year-old member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe packed up all of his belongs and his family \u2013 five children and a grandson \u2013 to travel from Little Eagle, South Dakota, to Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to join the movement of \u201cwater protecters\u201d facing off against the federal government and the oil industry.

Generations of war, massacres, broken treaties, discrimination, police harassment, and poverty have resulted in a general feeling of distrust, disillusion, and disinterest in mainstream politics among the Native Americans gathered at Standing Rock. And historical traumas have only been compounded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">militarized police response</a> to unarmed protesters, who have been met with Mace, rubber bullets, Tasers and sound weapons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3da547d142a32bae22dd8397c0441c90ab55e8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3da547d142a32bae22dd8397c0441c90ab55e8b/0_115_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Archambault: \u2018I don\u2019t have faith in government, so I don\u2019t want to have a say.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Archambault: \u2018I don\u2019t have faith in government, so I don\u2019t want to have a say.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone here votes,\u201d said Julie Richards, an Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. \u201cWe\u2019re all like, fuck the government, fuck voting, and fuck the people running.\u201d </p> <p>The rest of the nation may be glued to cable news and the latest polls, anxious for the uncertain future of an unusual election.

  "<p>Many of us have been stuck in a Brexistential crisis since June. Uncertainty over if, whether and how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">article 50 will be triggered</a> only sharpens our distrust of political leaders, and ever more hyperbolic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\">rabble-rousing headlines</a> appear now on a daily basis. We face another looming worry: the possibility of a Donald Trump victory in the US. Like Princess Diana\u2019s death or 9/11, these are world events that we struggle to compute. They are absolutely real yet seem strangely unreal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/what-happens-after-clinton-trump-win-election-progressive\">Whether Trump or Clinton wins the US election, what follows is up to us | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Brexit and the US election raise questions about borders and identity, which trigger primitive and personal anxieties about the breaching of the boundary between inside and outside, provoking associations with the body. For example, there\u2019s the idea that the national border, our collective \u201cskin\u201d, might collapse, and that we might face annihilation. Or that we have something so precious that others wish to take us over, to invade us and steal this. A leader who promises to protect the boundary of inside and outside can thus have a special allure, as history shows. Hence the appeal of a Trump, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-presidency-america-endure-latinos-experience\">his Mexico-US wall</a> and his evocation of the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d of immigration. These images might seem laughable to many, but they touch on people\u2019s basic anxieties about boundaries.</p> <p>The supreme certitude and confidence of such leaders gains a particular power when the world feels so tenuous, fragile and uncertain. Our changing relationship to expertise, evidence and traditional hierarchical structures leaves a dreadful vacuum. We haven\u2019t really established any new forms of political organisation in their place. This is partly because new forms of organisation are quickly ridiculed as we struggle between old and new. And partly because at some level we take for granted that things can\u2019t and won\u2019t change.</p> <p>Yet, ambivalent as we so often are, we also yearn for change. The presumption that we wish to maintain the status quo forecloses our perhaps more covert desire to shake things up, turn over the apple cart, to see what happens. When these sometimes destructive whims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/meriden-brexit-leave-regret-doubts-linger-eu-referendum\">turn into a reality</a> it can be all the more unsettling, as seen in the numbers of Bregrexit voters who didn\u2019t think their vote would really count, or people who secretly want a Trump victory to see what happens. Even the philosopher Slavoj Zi\u017eek says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/794232437337247744\">he would vote for Trump</a> for precisely this reason.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a5j5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2858198\"            data-video-name=\"Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58171544e4b08d944ba4c889\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\">Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We like to ridicule such voters to assure ourselves that we act rationally, that we want the sensible, fair solution. But of course we all vote from a transitional space between reality and fantasy, influenced by pulls and pushes based on our background, and the histories of generations before us that have been transmitted to us both consciously and unconsciously.</p> <p>The reaction to this year\u2019s votes show a fundamental lack of curiosity, an increasing intolerance for other people\u2019s attitudes and ideals. People who vote for Clinton, Trump, leave, remain all believe in their position, and most will have constructed an internal logic to justify it. We must make the effort here to humanise the other by trying to find out, gently, about this logic, or we become ourselves the creators of Trump\u2019s dividing wall.</p> <p>In the face of such uncertainty, it is perhaps no surprise that experts are brought in to instruct us on how to cope. The advice tends to be quite simple. Limit your social media. Meditate. Connect with friends. Go out into nature. And, as the American Psychological Association (APA) recommends, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/10/presidential-election-stress.aspx\">avoid catastrophising, and maintain a balanced perspective</a>\u201d. These suggestions are both vaguely useful and patently ridiculous, and they serve to depoliticise our situation. In their own way, they reinforce a split between inside and outside, as if it were sane to focus on inner peace when Rome is burning.</p> <p>We need instead to remember the transformative potential of emotion. Uncertainty and fear can be a means to recognise the intimate, mutual relationship between our inner lives and outer political realities. Rather than aiming to stay calm, is it not time to remember that emotion has always been the fuel for collective action, social justice movements and political change? Advice on how to cope through techniques of self-management, here, can interfere dangerously with what our bodies are cueing us to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it. I spent last weekend at a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWelfareReform?src=hash\">welfare reform</a> conference where we were greeted by a banner with the names of those who had died as a result of benefits sanctions carefully embroidered on it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/22magoo\">Maggie Zolobajluk</a> and her allies had put love, grief, tears and passion into this creation.</p> <p>My heroes are not politicians but exceptional people such as Zolobajluk who, when a tragedy has occurred, manage to find the political drive to create something new, to try to make sure that nothing similar ever happens again.</p> <p>Here Zi\u017eek has a point. If Clinton wins, if things seem to be stabilising, we risk becoming complacent again, and losing the transformative potential of the emotions we now feel. We must resist this false calm, for it would reduce us to being subject once more to the forces that have created the current crises. Rather, we must surely use our feelings to charge us to create forms of organisation and resistance that, like Zolobajluk\u2019s banner, bear crucial messages. A breakdown, after all, always carries within it the seeds of a breakthrough if we take it seriously, and act accordingly.</p>",

Election day is \u2018choice day\u2019, but we make choices all the time, day to day.\u201d</p> <p>One of the voting machines takes its choices from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump television commercials, with Clinton and Trump edited out of them. </p> <p>\u201cI got a list of characteristics of campaign B-roll from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump commercials,\u201d DuBois says. \u201cIf you take the campaign ads and remove footage from the candidates, and you look at the other footage they use \u2013 it\u2019s pretty specific. Hillary has tons of ads where she starts with a shot of blue sky. Donald Trump has lots of ads where he shows the American flag.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Hillary shows cities she shows people,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhen Trump shows cities he tends to show empty playgrounds, or bombed-out public housing. It\u2019s pretty different. What I did was extract 12 sets of words. Do you want blue or red? Sky or ground? Do you want a building or people? Based on how you choose you get an image montage \u2013 you get your own personal one-minute video.\u201d</p> <p>Another voting machine makes odd text mashups based on how you vote, using classic book titles like Pride and Prejudice and Tropic of Capricorn, drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Offline_Catalogs\">Project Gutenberg database</a>. A voting machine next to it creates sound. It draws its categories from Luigi Russolo\u2019s classic 1913 Futurist manifesto <a href=\"http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/noises.html\">The Art of Noises</a>; you can vote on categories like roar, whistle, bang, hiss and mumble. When you\u2019re done voting, the machine makes you a custom piece of music collaged from the <a href=\"http://shop.prosoundeffects.com/products/bbc-complete-sound-effects-library\">BBC sound effects library.</a> Another machine makes drawings for you on a small screen, inspired by Logo, the brainchild of the late MIT professor<a href=\"http://www.papert.org/\"> Seymour Papert</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e1b308e46690178d5a24b081cf524cc1b527d72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e1b308e46690178d5a24b081cf524cc1b527d72/0_0_720_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Learning Machine #4: Language, using a machine from 1960.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Learning Machine #4: Language, using a machine from 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Berens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A red velvet curtain in a corner of the gallery encircles a giant voting machine from the 1950s \u2013 a behemoth weighing over 600 pounds. This machine draws its values from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/myers-briggs-employee-personality-test-accurate\">Myers-Briggs personality test</a>. An overwhelming sea of choices faces you, in alphabetical order \u2013 compassionate, dutiful, ecstatic, fashionable \u2013 on a massive steel panel. The choices feel like they were part of the original machine; DuBois had a collaborator, the designer <a href=\"http://www.samarskaya.com/\">Ksenya Samarskaya</a>, design a special vintage typeface for the choices that recalls the 1950s.</p> <p>A computer connected to the machine then looks up your choices on Instagram and the New York Times. A screen next to the machine shows the results in real time, in a disorienting, endless scrolling collage. Looking up the choices on Instagram brings up lots of strange selfies. The New York Times database brings up lots of obituaries. \u201cWe tend to only use these values when people are dead,\u201d DuBois says. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to use these values to describe living people.\u201d</p> <p>In another corner of the gallery lurks the infamous voting device that produced the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/15/2016-election-old-voting-machines-hanging-chad\">hanging chads</a>\u201d seen in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, complete with plenty of punched card ballots so you can try your hand at producing a hanging chad yourself. A glass vitrine nearby houses pieces of the old voting machines, so you can see the intriguing backs of them \u2013 along with gears, keys and other ephemera. </p> <p>\u201cBy drilling it down to playing with these machines, and doing these seemingly low-stakes actions with media, I wanted people to just meditate on what it means to have options, and to not understand what these options mean,\u201d DuBois says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we think as much as we should about it. This show is more lyrical; I\u2019m not trying to hit you over the head with a specific point of view. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an admittedly modest contribution to the discourse, but rather than making a show that\u2019s just bashing Donald Trump, I wanted to get people to focus more on what Tuesday is all about, which is choosing. We have to decide. There are 300-something million people in this country and they have to decide what country they want.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>The Choice is Yours is on view at Bitforms in New York City until 23 December 2016.

  "<p>Why do so many Americans, even a seemingly substantial proportion of those who plan on voting for her, find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a> so dislikable? Feverish with anxiety about Tuesday\u2019s election, this was the question I was pondering as I prowled my bookshelves the other&#xa0;day.</p> <p>I still can\u2019t answer it, not fully. All I am able to offer is my conviction that this loathing, unfathomable to many of us, may run deeper even than I had supposed. On my shelves, I found <em>Thirty Ways of Looking at Hillary</em>, a collection of essays by female writers that was published in the US in 2008, shortly after Clinton announced her candidacy for the presidency first time around. Picking it up \u2013 I\u2019d clean forgotten that I owned it \u2013 I felt an antidote to my perception of Americans\u2019 perception of Clinton might finally be in sight; edited by Susan Morrison, it contains pieces by such writers as Daphne Merkin, Lorrie Moore and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/20/katie-roiphe-why-paid-less-than-male-colleagues\" title=\"\">Katie Roiphe</a> (and also, a cartoon by Roz Chast). Wouldn\u2019t they be cheering her on? But, no. It isn\u2019t so much that the essays don\u2019t respond to the issue of Clinton\u2019s likability, because they do. Rather, it\u2019s that this is virtually their sole preoccupation. \u201cI have yet to meet a woman who likes Hillary Clinton,\u201d writes Roiphe at the opening of her essay, Elect Sister Frigidaire.</p> <p>Still, it makes for fascinating reading, should you be in the market for a Clinton book. Alongside the perennial question of her ambition, and whether we will ever accept such single-minded determination in a woman, here are entertaining and insightful analyses of such things as her favourite book (<em>Little Women</em> by Louisa M Alcott), her favourite foods (when Bill was in the White House, she liked to snack on a particular brand of protein burgers), and her hobbies (none, in essence, though she did once claim to have a passion for, among other things, archaeology, modern art, and the&#xa0;novels of Thomas Hardy). My favourite essay, however, is the one by Ariel Levy, in which she brutally unpicks the way, after her husband was exposed as a cheater, Clinton became \u201ca walking Rorschach test for our feelings about infidelity\u201d. Blistering, open-eyed, it makes more sense of the Clintons\u2019 marriage than just about anything I\u2019ve ever read.</p>",

He told the crowd in Manchester that it \u201cwas demeaning to the political process\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday night Trump didn\u2019t embrace everything about Massachusetts and New England, though.

It has made requests for information from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department (the Department) that are relevant to the terms of reference. This includes an order for the Department to produce documents, sent on 18 October 2016. The Department has advised the committee that it has provided relevant documents to the Attorney-General, and that these are still being considered with a view to the Attorney-General making a claim of <strong>public interest immunity</strong>. </p> <p><strong>The committee is concerned that the Attorney-General has only been prepared to provide documents that could in some way be construed to

Inquiry, Government members came to the conclusion that the position of the Solicitor-General had become untenable. </p> <p>The Solicitor-General\u2019s subsequent decision to resign was, in the view of government members of the committee, commendable and perhaps an unavoidable consequence of the public Inquiry.</p> <p>Government members regret that this Inquiry, set up by the Labor Party to attack Senator the Hon <strong>George Brandis</strong>, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia (the Attorney-General), <strong>has in the end destroyed the career of the Solicitor General</strong> who was himself appointed by the previous Labor administration.</p> <p>Government members of the Committee are concerned that the majority on the Committee have used the Senate

But without the numbers, the Greens amendment will not pass.</p> <p>So the Greens will support the crossbench/Labor amendment for a 10.5% backpacker tax.</p> <p>The treasurer, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, has said if the bill is amended, the government will knock it off in the lower house.</p> <p>Which means it will be status quo.

The key thing to remember is that though the Abbott government originally proposed the tax in 2015, this has been argued about ever since. No backpacker legislation has passed the house since then.</p> <p>That means there is no change to the existing position. </p> <p>Which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax purposes, getting a lesser rate.

The only thing due to come in on January 1 was the government\u2019s law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament. If the legislation fails to pass then the status quo remains unchanged, that is some backpackers are treated as residents, and some are not.</p> <p>Tasmanian farmers, at an individual level, have told me they want this bill dead.

Xenophon says he has told the government the NXT bloc will look at the <strong>forever ban proposal</strong> but this is a \u201cconscience issue\u201d for his parliamentarians. By this he means the <strong>NXT bloc may split on this issue</strong>. In any case, they are not yet set in stone about which way to go. Xenophon is sounding relaxed about his people voting in different ways on this proposal.</p> <p>In terms of Labor\u2019s decision this morning to reject the proposal, here\u2019s a <strong>couple of quick analytical thoughts</strong>.</p> <p>It\u2019s been obvious for a little while that the government\u2019s drive-by attacks on Labor on the boats don\u2019t resonate politically quite as much as they used to. It could be because the boats have stopped, voters are no longer so fixated on unauthorised arrivals making their way south.</p> <p>This trajectory did happen during the Howard years, voters were fixated on the problem (aided by a government telling them constantly it was a problem), but once the \u201cproblem\u201d was \u201cfixed\u201d, it was actually an electoral plus for <strong>Kevin Rudd </strong>in 2007, when he went to the election promising to wind back the punitive \u201cPacific solution\u201d.<br></p> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s just a case of the politics being moderately less toxic. Labor is certainly less worried than it used to be about standing up to the government on border protection, and the new shadow immigration spokesman, <strong>Shayne Neumann</strong>, has set quite a different tone in the portfolio to his predecessor, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>.</p> <p>But I also think there was <strong>no way on God\u2019s earth that the left faction would have supported this latest policy foray by the government</strong>. I suspect Shorten, the leadership group, and the shadow cabinet knew that. It would have been fraught if Shorten had insisted on exercising a bit of \u201cme too-ism\u201d on the government\u2019s proposal. Hence today\u2019s result.

  "<p>Gold has long thrived on bouts of uncertainty and right now markets have uncertainty in spades. The Brexit vote in Britain, the prospect of Donald Trump as US president and a raft of elections due in Europe next year have all pushed investors to ramp up their holdings of the precious metal.</p> <p>That strong demand for gold \u2013 seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u2013 has sent its price soaring on world markets this year. But while big investors like pension funds stock up, individuals who fancy their own little pot of gold for a rainy day have been priced out of the market. </p> <p>As the World Gold Council releases its <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/gold-demand-trends\">latest figures</a> we look at key trends for the metal.</p> <h2>Global climate of uncertainty is boosting investor demand</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee/0_0_547_321/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gold demand\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold demand in the third quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Metals Focus; World Gold Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Investment demand for gold was up 44% in the third quarter on a year earlier, dominated by demand from European funds. That was a bright spot in an otherwise weak quarter for gold. Demand was down 10% overall from a year ago, as the growth in investor demand failed to offset a drop in appetite for gold among central banks, the jewellery sector and technology companies that use gold in electronics.</p> <p>The solid demand among institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers builds on a strong first half to 2016. For the year to date, demand from investors is up 98%, according to the World Gold Council, a lobby group for the gold industry. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06/65_0_2402_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As polls tightened between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election, the gold price rose. But Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, says the demand for the precious metal goes beyond worries about a political upset in the US.</p> <p>\u201cFocus this week is going to be centred around the US election but it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Uncertainty rose on the back of the vote for Brexit, and with it activity in the gold market, Hewitt adds. Now investors are worrying about a series of elections in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too. <br></p> <p>\u201cGiven what we have seen in the UK referendum and what we\u2019ve seen in the US election, there is huge uncertainty about what the outcome of these [European elections] is going to be,\u201d says Hewitt.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that is completely clear to us and certainly to institutional investors is that gone are the days of the predictable status quo.\u201d</p> <h2>That has lifted the gold price 20% so far this year</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171/0_0_1323_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The spot gold price this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"510\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The spot gold price this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other factors working in gold\u2019s favour, too. </p> <p>Investor demand has also been helped by the fact interest rates are negative in the eurozone, Japan and elsewhere. That effectively means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/rbs-charging-customers-cash-negative-interest-rates\">people end up paying for the privilege of parking their cash with a bank</a>. In the US and UK, official rates remain in positive territory but they are not far off zero, making returns meagre for savers. That has made gold a more attractive asset and coupled with the boost from geopolitical and economic worries has seen the spot gold price rise more than 20% this year to $1,279 an ounce on Monday.</p> <h2>Pricier gold has put off retail investors</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f/0_97_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A saleswoman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A saleswoman arranges a gold necklace inside a jewellery showroom in the southern Indian city of Kochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand for coins, gold bars and jewellery have all suffered from the rise in prices, says Hewitt at World Gold Council. Both China and India, the world\u2019s leading gold markets, experienced a drop in consumer demand this quarter, of 22% and 28% respectively as price savvy customers waited to buy on a dip - something many did at the start of October, he adds.</p> <p>In China, ongoing economic uncertainty also contributed to a softening in sentiment towards gold, as did changing consumer behaviour. </p> <p>In India, appetite has been affected by more stringent government regulations, such as a 1% excise duty on gold jewellery manufacturing, designed to formalise the gold industry, the World Gold Council said. Added to that is the impact of a squeeze on disposable rural incomes. With consistently high prices hurting demand, one or two stores in Southern India introduced gold-plated silver jewellery.</p> <h2>Millennials don\u2019t have the gold bug</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A trend among millennials to spend more on going out and travel is impacting the gold market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinopix/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In China and elsewhere changing tastes are impacting the gold market. Hewitt at the World Gold Council says millennials living in Chinese cities do not go for the top grade gold favoured by their parents but instead tend to look for design over quality. They also share a trend seen among other young consumers around the world to spend on experiences rather than objects. </p> <p>\u201cThe industry also faces the challenge of the rising popularity of \u2018experiential\u2019 purchases at the expense of physical consumption,\u201d says the World Gold Council\u2019s report. </p> <p>\u201cEvidence of this can be seen in the way the Chinese populace chose to celebrate the recent Golden Week national holiday. Over the last three years, the number of people choosing to travel during this holiday has grown by nearly 25%, reaching 589million. 31% of this year\u2019s tourists were millennials, born after 1980.\u201d</p> <h2>Gold teeth are out of fashion too</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24dd8f2efff4cbe1d9942a7801f50e963fc858c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24dd8f2efff4cbe1d9942a7801f50e963fc858c5/203_587_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand from dentists has been on a declining trend and gold used in dentistry fell another 6% year-on-year in the third quarter. \u201cDemand is expected to fade further as the industry and consumers turn to ceramic materials for cosmetic reasons,\u201d says the World Gold Council report.</p> <h2>Recycling is all the rage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e80cd2cebc8f1077faceccc2180899e9888be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e80cd2cebc8f1077faceccc2180899e9888be9/0_0_5476_3286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shop buying gold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shop buying gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the gold price high, people are being encouraged to dig around their cupboards and take old trinkets and jewellery into services that buy gold from consumers for recycling.</p> <p>That trend was particularly prevalent in India, where consumers cashed in their holdings, swelling the amount of recycled gold in the region to its highest level for almost four years.

Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/campaign-stops-map/\" data-alt=\"final stops\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/campaign-stops-map/\">final stops</a> </figure>  <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear what explains Trump\u2019s visit, in the final week of the election, to Minnesota, which has been a solidly Democratic state since the Great Depression. Trump may see something there no one else does. The visit may have been a mistake. Conspiracy theorists have even noted that the Trump campaign chairman loathes the Republican congressional leadership, the theory being that sending Trump to Minnesota may have been a play to disrupt two delicate House races there.<br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign, which during the primary season at one point was <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-spending-more-polling-six-gop-candidates-combined\">spending more on polling</a> than the top six Republican candidates combined, does not dabble in such freelancing. Most of her visits are where one might expect them to be, in obvious swing states: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada. Clinton also made one trip to Arizona, where some polls have suggested that she has a shot at toppling Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-day-final-voting-push\">Clinton and Trump make climactic final pitches on eve of historic election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Two final observations. </p> <p>One: Trump made almost two more stops per day, on average, than Clinton did. That\u2019s either working harder \u2013 or being less focused. Clinton also was able to take advantage of high-profile surrogates \u2013 such as the president, first lady, vice-president, and her husband \u2013 to pop up in key states for her, while Trump is the only major star, political or otherwise, in his universe.</p> <p>Two: in only two states did Clinton make more stops than Trump in the final week, Arizona and Ohio. For whatever reason, she may have sensed a need to work harder in those states, while still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/hillary-visits-arizona-in-unprecedented-show-of-bravado-for-democratic-nominee\">seeing opportunity in those states</a>, perhaps in contrast to some extent with Iowa, where Clinton let Senator Bernie Sanders do the work of campaigning. </p>"
