But he was also explicit about saying he wanted Labour to stop the UK leaving the EU. This came in a discussion with David Dimbleby.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>DD: </em>You said you would like to see Labour going into the next election saying our party policy is to go back into the EU.</p> <p><em>OS:</em> Yes.</p> <p><em>DD: </em>You ignore the Brexit vote.</p> <p><em>OS:</em> Exactly.</p> <p><em>DD: </em>Exactly?</p> <p><em>OS:</em> Exactly. We need to find out what it is. The Brexit vote set a direction, if we like. We don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.</p> <p><em>DD:</em> You know where you are going. You are going back in. </p> <p><em>OS:</em> Well, I hope we are. And I think we should be strong about that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith said Labour would be entitled to go against the referendum vote because people were lied to. But Jeremy Corbyn disagreed. He said parliament should accept the vote to leave the EU, but he said it was important to ensure that the Brexit deal protected workers rights.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smith claimed people around Corbyn were encouraging people with antisemitic views to join Labour.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think Jeremy has not been strong enough in speaking out against antisemitism ... Under Jeremy\u2019s leadership we have seen people coming into Labour from the hard left of politics who are bringing in antisemitic attitudes ... Some of the people around Jeremy are encouraging it. There is absolutely no doubt.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn strongly objected, saying that Smith\u2019s claim was unfair. \u201cI have spent my life opposing racism in any form, as have you,\u201d he told Smith.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said Labour should review the Shami Chakrabarti report in the future to see what progress was being made on tackling antisemitism.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he wanted the UK to remain in the single market after Brexit \u201cif it\u2019s possible and I think it probably is\u201d.</strong> Earlier this week one of his aides suggested Corbyn was not committed to full single market membership.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he expected the Labour party to unite behind him if he won the leadership election.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think after the election is over and after the conference is over you will see the wish of MPs to reflect the wishes of party members all over the country that there is a coming together in order to oppose this Tory government.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn claimed that he could increase support for Labour through a political \u201cre-energisation\u201d that would mobilise people who had never voted in the past, like the young</strong>. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The core vote ... is also a very large number of people who are intrinsically inclined towards Labour but have not bother to vote in the past. Only 47% of young people voted in the last general election. I tell you this now. There is a re-energisation in politics over the past year. Many of those that have joined the party, many of those that are very active in local groups, are very well connected with colleges, with universities, with young people at work. I tell you this; after this leadership [election] is over, there is going to be that energisation in politics which will challenge the Tories ...</p> <p>A Labour opposition offering investment in a growing economy, a Labour opposition offering to invest, to drive down the inequalities in Britain and invest in a growing economy with sustainable jobs, I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s very attractive and will bring an awful lot of people over to Labour.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T22:44:42.702Z\">at 11.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1e01ee4b08465d44fec43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T22:03:47.395Z\">11.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong>\u2019s story about the debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-claims-he-can-unite-labour-to-take-on-tories\">Jeremy Corbyn claims he can unite Labour to take on Tories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I will post a summary with a further set of quotes shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1da04e4b08465d44fec3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T21:56:24.603Z\">10.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are some Tweets from Labour/left figures who are not Corbyn supporters.</p> <p>From <strong>Adrian McMenamin</strong>, a former Labour special adviser and staffer</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adrianmcmenamin/status/773992323499917312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you come at the king, you best not miss.

Having adopted large chunks of the Corbyn policy agenda, he has two main offers: competence/electability, and Europe. He was probably at his best in the early stages of the debate, talking about Labour\u2019s performance in the polls but it did not feel as if his arguments, robust as they were, were going to make much impression on those like the \u201cfeel the love\u201d Corbynista councillor. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-v-owen-smith-on-bbc-question-timess-labour-leadership-hustings-live?page=with:block-57d1c56fe4b08465d44fec05#block-57d1c56fe4b08465d44fec05\"> 9.10am.) </a></p> <p>On Europe, Smith has a distinctive position which should be attractive to Labour\u2019s pro-European membership. And tonight he seemed to go further than he has in the past, making explicit something previously only implicit and saying that if he were leader Labour could reject the EU referendum result and opt to keep the UK in the EU. Many pro-European politicians, like Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair, would back this 100%. But it is a tricky argument to make now, because it is tantamount to saying \u201cignore the referendum\u201d, and the studio audience reacted quite badly when he made his case.</p> <p>Smith should have had the edge over Corbyn too on security, but the reminder of his Isis gaffe set him back.</p> <p>Generally, though, Corbyn seemed to exude confidence. With the polls suggesting he is well ahead, this is not surprising, but what was striking was how much better a performer Corbyn is now at this format than he was a year ago. He was relaxed and even funny at times, and he managed to brush off Smith\u2019s most aggressive criticisms, over extremism. It helped that the audience seemed more on his side than Smith\u2019s (so much for \u201cBBC bias\u201d - see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-v-owen-smith-on-bbc-question-timess-labour-leadership-hustings-live?page=with:block-57d1c108e4b013613fffb619#block-57d1c108e4b013613fffb619\">8.57pm)</a> His claim that he would be able to take Labour to power by inspiring the young may sound fanciful (the psephologists say boosting youth turnout mostly helps Labour get larger majorities in the seats they hold anyway), but it seemed to strike a chord with a large Labour chunk of the studio audience. What the public at large think is another matter, but this was a Labour-dominated audience and they seem happy to keep him as leader.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T22:48:57.180Z\">at 11.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1d117e4b07ac3d446a51b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T21:00:49.361Z\">10.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Would you work with your opponent?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says he would be delighted to work with Smith.</p> <p>Smith says he has already said he would not serve under Corbyn.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it.

The contest was triggered because 75% of Labour MPs voted for a motion saying they had no confidence in Corbyn but Corbyn refused to resign. Corbyn\u2019s allies saw this as a coup mounted by 172 MPs prepared to defy the will of more than 400,000 members and supporters who voted in the leadership contest last year. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/04/corbyn-and-smith-face-off-in-tense-labour-leadership-hustings\">The first hustings between Jeremy Corbyn and the challenger, Owen Smith, in Cardiff at the start of August, was frosty. </a>Since then it\u2019s got worse.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s hustings may be the most high-profile yet, although its impact on the result could be limited because many members will have already cast their vote. Corbyn and Smith are on a Question Time special. According to Wikipedia (I did try the BBC press office, but they would not say) a normal Question Time gets seen by almost 3m people. But this one is going out at 9pm, an hour and a half earlier than when the programme usually airs.</p> <p>As the leadership contest nears its end - the winner will be announced on 24 September, a fortnight Saturday - Corbyn remains the overwhelming favourite. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/04/corbyn-and-smith-face-off-in-tense-labour-leadership-hustings\">A YouGov poll of people voting in the leadership contest last week</a> found Corbyn ahead by 24 points.

  "<p>One day after Donald Trump reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian president was a better leader than Barack Obama, Republicans on Capitol Hill struggled to explain why their party\u2019s presidential nominee was enamored with a man they have long cast as one of America\u2019s primary foes.<br></p> <p>Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer recess expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both tone and message. But on Thursday, they found themselves in the familiar routine of distancing themselves from Trump\u2019s comments \u2013 the latest being his praise for Putin in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy\">NBC News national security forum held on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re running for leader of the free world and you\u2019re expressing admiration for Putin, well then you\u2019re losing me,\u201d Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters.</p> <p>\u201cI think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler who has his opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his neighbor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/vladimir-putin-is-a-gangster-and-thug-says-us-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio\">Vladimir Putin is 'a gangster and thug', says US presidential candidate Marco Rubio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Graham said he found Obama to be \u201cweak\u201d, \u201cindecisive\u201d and someone Putin had \u201cwalked all over\u201d, the visibly frustrated senator added: \u201cBut no, I\u2019m not going to say that Putin\u2019s a better leader than a democratically elected president of the United States even though I have differences with him.\u201d</p> <p>It was just earlier this week that Graham, who has thus far declined to endorse Trump and has been among the candidate\u2019s biggest critics, spoke positively for the first time of the direction his campaign had taken. After telling reporters on Monday that Trump would give Hillary Clinton \u201ca hell of a race\u201d, the senator hardly minced his words when reacting to Trump\u2019s overtures toward Putin. </p> <p>\u201cThis whole idea of admiring Putin is the biggest misunderstanding of a relationship in a person since Munich,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who made his opposition to Putin a central tenet of his own presidential campaign, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/vladimir-putin-is-a-gangster-and-thug-says-us-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio\">similarly disagreed with Trump\u2019s assertion</a> that the Russian president was a better leader than Obama.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I have tremendous policy disagreements with President Obama, but Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one,\u201d Rubio told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership. I think what he exhibits is thuggery \u2026 and we should be clear-eyed about that,\u201d he added, noting that Putin controlled the media, the military and often his political opponents were either imprisoned or found dead.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that Trump had a penchant for commending Putin, despite those facts, Rubio said he was hopeful the candidate\u2019s posture might evolve.</p> <p>\u201cMy sense is those views will probably change once he understands better who Vladimir Putin truly is \u2013 that\u2019s my hope,\u201d responded the senator, who is backing Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"972a9499a6ac1e40df907b7fec8b63dc3732b20d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/972a9499a6ac1e40df907b7fec8b63dc3732b20d/0_289_5971_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio: \u2018Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio: \u2018Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Broadimage/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary Clinton was part of the single biggest blunder ever when it came to Vladimir Putin, and that\u2019s the reset with Russia.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump\u2019s habit of making pro-Russia statements is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/378102285001576448\">not new</a>, his refusal to adopt the GOP\u2019s hard line against Putin has become a source of discomfort for Republicans. </p> <p>Not only has his party argued that Russian military intervention in Ukraine would not have been possible had the Obama administration sufficiently stood up to Putin, but it has also cited Clinton\u2019s role as former secretary of state to discredit her foreign policy experience.</p> <p>But Trump, since becoming the nominee, has both continued to extol Putin\u2019s leadership and even called on the Russian government in July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">to hack Clinton\u2019s emails</a>. While drafting the GOP platform at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, the Trump campaign also fought to eliminate language around arming Ukraine in its fight with Russia \u2013 bringing further scrutiny to the ties between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time</a>, and pro-Russian interests. (Manafort was let go from the campaign last month.)</p> <p>The paradox was palpable as many Republicans approached in the hallways of the Senate declined to address Trump\u2019s latest string of pro-Putin comments.</p> <p>John McCain of Arizona and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both vulnerable Republican senators facing tough re-election battles, had nothing to say.</p> <p>\u201cYou should ask Donald Trump about that,\u201d Toomey said, while McCain simply stated his own opinion that Putin is \u201ca murderer and a thug\u201d but pointedly refused to discuss Trump.</p> <p>Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the runner-up in the Republican presidential primary who memorably declined to endorse Trump at the convention in Cleveland, referred the Guardian to his press office. And two members of Senate Republican leadership \u2013 John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas \u2013 said they had not seen Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Asked directly if it was fair to say that Obama has been a better president for America than Putin has been for Russia, Cornyn demurred: \u201cI\u2019m not gonna go down that path.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Corker, the senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, also initially said he was no longer responding to each one of Trump\u2019s controversial statements. But when pressed by the Guardian about the implications of the mutual respect between Putin and Trump, if the latter was elected president, Corker acknowledged that \u201cpersonal relationships end up affecting things\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have national interests right now that are very different in many cases than those of Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think one has to be careful not to succumb to flattery.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, faced several questions pertaining to Trump\u2019s appearance at the foreign policy town hall. The nation\u2019s top Republican dubbed Putin as \u201can aggressor who does not share our interests\u201d and suggested Russia was behind state-sponsored cyber-attacks \u201con what appears to be [the US] political system\u201d.</p> <p>But Ryan, too, reached his limit while fielding repeated queries about Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand up here and do a tit-for-tat on what Donald said last night,\u201d he said.</p>",

She realized looking around that room that she was one of just a handful of women taking the exam.

He looked at a mourning Gold Star mother and he made assumptions about her silence in grief. He looked at an accomplished anchor and suggested she was a \u2018bimbo\u2019.

Her serious demeanor was commensurate with the topics being discussed: the war in Syria, the rise of Isis, the threat of terrorism and the high rate of veteran suicide.<br></p> <p>\u201cI had a very short window of time in that event last night to convey the seriousness with which I would approach the issues that concern our country,\u201d Clinton said before turning back to her opponent. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for Vladimir Putin.

After all, when you are running for leader of the free world, you should be prepared to answer pretty much anything in the name of selling yourself to the American public. This should especially be true for candidates who make bold claims about their knowledge base. So why haven\u2019t journalists forced Trump to prove he is the expert he claims to be?</p> <p>Or why not see if he knows as much about Isis as a relatively informed middle school social studies teacher? Why not ask him, for instance, whether Isis is a Sunni terror group or a Shia one? And while you\u2019re at it, ask him to explain the difference between Sunni Islam and Shia Islam?

  "<p>The Obama administration has offered to sell $115bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia over its eight years in office, more than any previous US administration, according to a <a href=\"http://securityassistance.org/fact_sheet/us-arms-transfers-saudi-arabia-and-war-yemen\">new report</a>.</p> <p>The surge in sales is in part to reassure the Saudi monarchy of US backing in the wake of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-18-days-in-vienna\">nuclear deal with Tehran</a>, which raised fears in the Gulf that Washington would tilt more towards Tehran in its foreign policy. </p> <p>The report\u2019s author, William Hartung of the Centre for International Policy, said another factor was a drive by US arms manufacturers to boost sales to compensate declining procurement by the Pentagon. However, the most recent deals \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/saudi-arabia-close-to-deal-to-buy-115bn-worth-of-military-equipment-from-us\">the offer to sell more than 150 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks for an estimated $1.15bn</a> \u2013 were principally intended to replenish the Saudi arsenal, depleted in the war in Yemen. </p> <p>\u201cI think that though the Obama administration is not thrilled about the Yemen episode; it feels it can\u2019t stay out of it, because of the need to reassure the Saudis,\u201d Hartung said. </p> <p>His report found that since taking office in January 2009, the Obama administration has offered to sell $115bn in weapons to Saudi Arabia, half of which are accounted for by deals that are still in the pipeline.</p> <p>\u201cThere are $57bn in sales in formal agreements so far, which is also head and shoulders above other administrations,\u201d Hartung said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/mps-poised-to-call-for-suspension-of-uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\">MPs split over UK-Saudi arms sales amid bid to water down report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report comes as concerns about the UK\u2019s arms sales to Saudi Arabia and their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/mps-poised-to-call-for-suspension-of-uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\">implication in potential war crimes in Yemen</a> have split MPs on parliament\u2019s arms control committee.</p> <p>Arms sales over the eight years of the Obama administration have also included combat aircraft, attack helicopters, bombs, air-to-ground missiles, warships and military training. A division of Northrop Grumman is involved in a $4bn train-and-equip programme for the Saudi Arabian national guard, which has reportedly played a key role in the Yemen intervention. </p> <p>The latest tank deal has drawn resistance from congressional Democrats, who have called for a freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, because of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/why-do-they-target-us-yemeni-civilians-pay-the-price-of-escalating-crisis\">bombing of civilian targets in Yemen</a>. UN officials have estimated that airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition are responsible for most of the 3,000 civilian casualties in the war so far, twice as many as those caused by Houthi insurgents and other forces in the conflict put together. </p> <p>Ted Lieu, a Democratic congresman from California, took a leading role in a letter by 64 members of Congress calling for the tank deal to be delayed, given the coalition\u2019s campaign\u2019s \u201cdeeply troubling impact on civilians\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI do not oppose assisting the country of Saudi Arabia, which has been a longstanding ally of the United States,\u201d Lieu told the Guardian in a written statement. \u201cWhat I do fundamentally oppose is continuing to sell arms to a military coalition that has repeatedly committed war crimes. The Saudi-led coalition has killed children, patients, doctors and newlyweds. A significant number of the killings of civilians by the Saudi coalition were nowhere near military targets. I will continue to do all that I can to see that the United States offers no support to Saudi Arabia\u2019s operations in Yemen. The letter that 64 Members of the House sent last week shows that there is a growing chorus in Congress that shares these concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Porteous, deputy programme director for Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cAs Human Rights Watch has documented in frequent field missions to bombing sites, US weapons are being used in coalition attacks that violate the laws of war and in some cases may constitute war crimes \u2026 To continue to sell arms is to fuel the flames and enable further violations.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/why-do-they-target-us-yemeni-civilians-pay-the-price-of-escalating-crisis\">'Why do they target us?'

But the committee has shared information with the UN but not made its findings public. Hartung argued that such messages are least likely to be taken seriously while arms sales are booming.</p> <p>\u201cI think the US is such a significant supplier of bombs, ammunition, artillery and tanks and playing such an important role in the prosecution of the war in Yemen that there is signficant leverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the US were to signal that part of that assistance would be frozen or withdrawn if they don\u2019t show they are implementing measures to limit civilian casualties, that would send an effective message.

Nor is Ann Coulter\u2019s assertion that \u201cany Republican with those numbers of character flaws, with that sort of behavioral problem and psychopathic psychology could not run or be elected dog catcher if it were a Republican\u201d.</p> <p>Attacking her problems, or Bill Clinton\u2019s problems, with ineligible or unethical campaign donors and the potential ties to a foreign power, such as China, seeking to influence the US election is certain to raise too many uncomfortable questions, given the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">appearance of a cozy relationship</a> between parts of the Trump campaign and Russia, and some of the people (like white supremacists) supporting him. Dick Morris\u2019s assertion that Clinton didn\u2019t pass enough far-reaching legislation during her tenure in the Senate isn\u2019t useful when your candidate is a political neophyte who\u2019s never been elected to office and makes that part of his supposed allure.</p> <p>Travelgate, which gets extensive \u2013 if slightly inaccurate \u2013 treatment in the film, is likely too obscure a scandal for most people in 2016; Hillarycare, though still a conservative bugaboo, is now the law of the land and <a href=\"http://kff.org/interactive/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear\">about as many people</a> approve as disapprove it. And although the film criticizes her for her lack of support for the Iraq war, particularly in its later years, Trump has criticized her for supporting it at all (although he reserves the right to change his own mind).</p> <p>More effective \u2013 and more dirty \u2013 are assertions about the Clintons\u2019 marriage, included unsubstantiated but continuing allegations that she personally hired private investigators to dig up dirt on and intimidate women who had had contact with Bill Clinton and accused him of affairs or assault. (The Clintons have long denied these claims.) Given Trump\u2019s willingness to invite questions about his own less-than-squeaky-clean marital history by alleging that it\u2019s fair to ask Hillary Clinton questions about Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior, it seems likely that Bossie\u2019s background with Clinton accuser Kathleen Willey \u2013 who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/268590-bill-clinton-sexual-assault-accuser-to-campaign-against\">alleged</a> that Bill Clinton groped her in the Oval Office and that Hillary Clinton <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/01/did-clintons-try-whack-cat\">had her pet cat killed</a> \u2013 and Jared K Stern \u2013 the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Magazine/July-August-2012/Sex-Lies-Videotape/\">private investigator</a> who says he was hired to follow Willey in 1998 \u2013 will come into play before the election season is over.</p> <p>Most interesting, though, is the last major anecdote of the Bossie film: he uses the story of Joe Connor \u2013 whose father, Frank, was killed in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/puerto-rican-terrorists-plant-bomb-tavern-1975-article-1.2484977\">Puerto Rican separatist group FALN\u2019s bombing of the Fraunces Tavern</a> in New York City in 1974 \u2013 to highlight Bill Clinton\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/us/12-imprisoned-puerto-ricans-accept-clemency-conditions.html?pagewanted=all\">granting clemency</a> to 12 members of the organization in 1999. Though the man allegedly responsible for the bombing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141219/financial-district/cuba-decision-gives-fraunces-tavern-bombing-victims-son-hope-for-justice\">remains in exile in Cuba</a>, 10 of the members granted clemency were convicted of charges related to a series of bombings in Illinois, and the others were convicted in relationship to the hold-up of an armored car in Connecticut.</p> <p>The Senate <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/09/14/senate.faln/\">opposed</a> the granting of clemency 95-2 and Hillary Clinton, who was then running for the New York Senate seat, eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/07/hillaryclinton\">opposed the offer</a> and said she\u2019d had no prior knowledge of it. Still, the move by the White House was widely seen as an attempt to help her curry favor with the large (and voter-rich) Puerto Rican community in New York City \u2013 though her subsequent denouncement of the offer did her no favors.</p> <p>Connor is <a href=\"http://thenewfounders.net/joseph-f-connor/\">an occasional Fox News guest</a> and a columnist on the conservative site TownHall, where he <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/joeconnor/2015/12/22/hillary-not-qualified-to-win-war-on-terror-n2096386\">has</a> <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/joeconnor/2016/09/04/flight-to-terror-n2213667\">inveighed</a> against electing Hillary Clinton. But in Bossie\u2019s documentary he came across as genuine, still hurting from his father\u2019s death, and very, very likable. It\u2019s unlikely Bossie\u2019s forgotten him in the intervening years \u2013 and more likely that he and the rest of the Trump campaign are just waiting for the right moment to bring him up again.</p>",
  "<p>Viggo Mortensen has just been on <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/thismorning\">This Morning</a>. Before his slot on the breakfast show, the actor sat backstage watching hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford present an item about children crying on planes. Feeling playful, he began his interview by saying he liked to scream on planes himself. Kids, he said, asked him to be quiet. There was a dilated moment of live TV silence. Eventually, the uncertain laughter of Holmes filled the studio. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK,\u201d Mortensen went on, \u201cbecause I always wear a helmet when I fly.\u201d</p> <p>He is still in the slick dark suit he wore for TV.

Not much of a comedian, perhaps \u2013 or, as he says, not known for it. In a 30-year career, his signature movies are probably two he made with Cronenberg a decade ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-history-of-violence\">A History of Violence</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/eastern-promises\"> Eastern Promises</a>. In the first he was a small-town dad with a grisly past; in the second, a Russian mobster who stabbed a man in the eye while naked in a London bathhouse. These roles may have played on Holmes\u2019 mind.</p> <p>But Mortensen\u2019s new film is a comedy, mostly: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-fantastic\">Captain Fantastic</a> is bittersweet and spiked with radicalism. He plays Ben Cash, raising six children off-grid in the woods of the Pacific north-west. The kids haven\u2019t just been taught to hunt deer and rock climb, but read Chomsky and reject capitalism. In a very funny film, Mortensen\u2019s grizzled deadpan may be the funniest thing of all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0f2b0297a931eb28489ae5b82b91a3ab11aebdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0f2b0297a931eb28489ae5b82b91a3ab11aebdb/0_114_2496_1497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viggo Mortensen with George MacKay, Nicholas Hamilton, Annalise Basso and Samantha Isler in Captain Fantastic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viggo Mortensen with George MacKay, Nicholas Hamilton, Annalise Basso and Samantha Isler in Captain Fantastic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cReally,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no plan to what I do beyond finding movies people might still like in 10 years.\u201d But fatherhood keeps turning up.

Mortensen has an adult son \u2013 Henry, a documentary-maker \u2013 from his former marriage to <a href=\"http://www.exenecervenka.net/\">Exene Cervenka</a>, singer in LA punk band X. \u201cParenting is humbling. You vow to not make the same mistakes your parents made, and then inevitably, there you are.\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen speaks calmly, on the edge of quiet. \u201cThe way the family is portrayed in movies is often binary. You either have the happy family or total dysfunction, where you watch and say: \u2018Oh, they were so fucked up, I was so moved.\u2019 The reality is happiness <em>and</em> dysfunction. But that\u2019s less comfortable to sell.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the movies you either have the happy family or total dysfunction. The reality is happiness and dysfunction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The politics of his character in Captain Fantastic are not a world from his own. On the first day of filming, he arrived with his canoe and a stack of his own books to fill the family library: Quebecois poetry, Howard Zinn\u2019s A People\u2019s History of American Empire. But nothing is simple. Despite their Marxism, he says Donald Trump would approve of the Cashes for their insularity. The family can become a bubble, a retreat from the world. I tell him this reminds me of the infamous Margaret Thatcher speech about there being <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10377842\">no such thing as society</a>, just individuals and families. \u201cRight, I remember Thatcher saying that, using the idea of the family to attack the welfare state. Promoting self-sufficiency to eliminate investment in public projects.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48285bde821b55af7bc14f6e5c92701763f5c22f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48285bde821b55af7bc14f6e5c92701763f5c22f/0_5_512_307/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mortensen in Eastern Promises, 2007.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mortensen in Eastern Promises, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC FILMS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On movies, Mortensen can tend towards the businesslike. Talking politics, he could go all day. \u201cIt was the same credo with Reagan, supported by the media, and from there all roads lead to Trump. Shocked editorials ask: \u2018How can this have happened?\u2019 And you think: \u2018Because of you.\u2019 But, of course, it\u2019s more complex than Trump. Do you mind?\u201d I realise he wants to get some air at the window. London churns below as he lists the sacred cows of US politics. \u201cTalk about going to church. Say the military is underfunded. Be seen shooting animals. And the Democrats do all these things.\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen has had an eventful election. An enthused supporter of Bernie Sanders, the selection of Hillary Clinton left him so dispirited he decided to vote for Jill Stein of the Green party. On mentioning this publicly, the response from some fearful of a backdoor Trump victory was raw. The prominent film blogger Sasha Stone <a href=\"http://www.awardsdaily.com/2016/07/17/an-open-letter-to-viggo-mortensen-stop-the-madness-before-its-too-late/\">wrote</a> a 2,000-word open letter: \u201cViggo, I expected you to have compassion and regard for the most vulnerable. As evidenced by your recent words, you clearly don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He half-nods. Clinton, he says, is simply dishonest. \u201cI understand the argument that I\u2019m helping Trump. But people said it was a problem in 2000 voting for Ralph Nader and not Al Gore, and that election was stolen by Bush anyway.\u201d He screws up his face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"714332616e4bdd150ba4bdf3f6d898f086f91a56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/714332616e4bdd150ba4bdf3f6d898f086f91a56/0_6_3140_1884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Maria Bello in A History of Violence, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Maria Bello in A History of Violence, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NEW LINE CINEMA/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nestled in Captain Fantastic is a ticklish idea \u2013 that for all his revolutionary theory, Ben Cash is just another patriarch, the oldest white man in the room. To emphasise that point, Mortensen says, there was briefly a plan to have one of the children be adopted from Latin America. \u201cBut a film can only tell so many stories.\u201d Still, in 2016, aren\u2019t there times when, if you\u2019re leftwing, white and male, you feel the best thing you can do is just let someone else speak? \u201cAgain, I understand that.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThe dangerous thing with this conversation is that one thing gets taken out of context, or is underlined. But I\u2019m not afraid of any question.\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen recalls the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/captain-fantastic-sundance-2016-first-look-review-viggo-mortensen\">premiere</a> of Captain Fantastic at the Sundance festival in January. Standing on the red carpet, he was asked about the news that the Academy was to expand the diversity of its membership before next year\u2019s Oscars. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Sounds good. But with the Oscars, you should always follow the money. Terrible decisions are made every year because of the money. Because the Oscars are a racket. Yes, there are black performers and Native Americans, and Asians, and Hispanics who are unfairly excluded from this awards circus, but many white performers are too.\u2019 Then the interview appears and all I\u2019m saying is white actors get unfairly left out. And of course there are all these comments on YouTube about how I\u2019m just a privileged Hollywood white guy. And I thought: \u2018OK \u2013 I should have just said yes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen\u2019s film career began with a small part opposite Harrison Ford as an Amish farmer in the thriller <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjh-y7NQdI8\">Witness</a>. He was 27. Before acting, he had worked as a truck driver, shipyard worker and flower seller, pinballing between Europe and the US. The son of a Danish father and American mother, migration defined his childhood too: from Manhattan to Copenhagen and then Argentina, where his father managed poultry farms, until his parents divorced and at 12 he and his mother ended up in Watertown, so far in upstate New York it was almost Canada. (He now lives in Madrid with his partner, the actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadna_Gil\">Ariadna Gil</a>). Film work proved a slow burn \u2013 but Witness hinted at an old world aura others finally saw too. Off camera, he became known for the depth of his research. For Eastern Promises, he had his gangster\u2019s dialogue translated into Russian, then checked its authenticity among people who would know while travelling alone through Moscow and St Petersburg. (More prosaically, Captain Fantastic saw him learn the bagpipes.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a891c2297cd16d032ddad3ae7a8307022361d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a891c2297cd16d032ddad3ae7a8307022361d47/0_85_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With his partner, the Spanish actor Ariadna Gil, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his partner, the Spanish actor Ariadna Gil, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a parent, research only takes you so far. Before Cervanka had Henry, the couple made plans. \u201cWe looked into diapers. Brain development.\u201d He says he learned how a child really defines itself. Still, he rented Henry cartoons on video to avoid commercials, glowed with pride when he wouldn\u2019t join an ovation for Titanic. \u201cAnd the money I\u2019ve made at times was useful, allowing me to expose him to different cultures.\u201d</p> <p>Henry\u2019s taste would have a seismic impact on his father\u2019s career. In 1999, Peter Jackson was a day from shooting his Lord of the Rings trilogy when he decided he no longer wanted actor Stuart Townsend in the role of Aragorn. Though Mortensen was offered the job, it had limited appeal; Henry, an avid reader of Tolkien, nagged him into accepting. Three films later, a new level of celebrity had engulfed an actor who had previously answered fan mail by hand.</p> <p>For somone so self-sufficient, you wonder how strange the film business has been. I mention that the British actor Mark Strong once told me he had to ask an assistant on a blockbuster to stop trying to put his socks on for him. Mortensen winces. Does big budget film-making infantilise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bb87d90382b632400186feee853158ae7fc5f8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb87d90382b632400186feee853158ae7fc5f8a/0_0_512_307/500.jpg\" alt=\"Aragorn in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002).\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aragorn in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Line Cinema</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt can. But people let themselves be infantilised. And you set the tone as an actor. Young actors see older actors behaving in infantile ways. \u2018I want the biggest trailer. I want to go to the premiere in this country and take my family even though the distributor has to pay for the hotel and it\u2019s going to make it harder for them to buy another movie.\u2019 Having their agent fill their contract with privileges then saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s in my contract\u2019, as if they had nothing to do with it. As adults these are not good excuses.\u201d He stretches out his limbs, his voice fractionally louder. \u201cAnd the way you behave on set, how you talk to the crew. A lot of experienced actors choose not to even stay around off camera, or do such a poor job on camera it\u2019s obvious they couldn\u2019t give a fuck what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve had to say to an actor in a scene where the focus was on me: \u2018You know, you seem very tired, why don\u2019t you go home? I\u2019d rather just do this with someone from the crew.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI say this without naming names. But it\u2019s just one example of the piggishness.\u201d He keeps going. He\u2019s on a roll. \u201cThen there\u2019s the sense of competition, fuelled by these mushrooming award shows. Accepting jobs because you might get nominated. Trying to win scenes. They\u2019ve decided to cry because it\u2019s going to get them their nomination, and the other actor doesn\u2019t matter a fuck. But that also happens in independent movies. It\u2019s not unique to studio movies. It\u2019s not unique to American movies. I\u2019ve seen that working in London.</p> <p>\u201cA movie only works because people adjust to each other. And if they don\u2019t, well, the philosopher Lao Tzu said that if you don\u2019t change direction \u2026\u201d \u2013 suddenly a huge grin flashes up on his face and for a second gets wider and wider \u2013 \u201c\u2026 then you may just end up where you\u2019re headed.\u201d</p> <p><em>Captain Fantastic is released in the UK 9 September </em></p>",

He did not watch the forum event, he said, and did not wish to respond to every comment Trump makes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand up here and do a tit-for-tat on what Donald said last night,\u201d Ryan said.</p> <p>In New York, Clinton also criticized Trump\u2019s remarks about US generals, who he said had been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d under the leadership of President Obama, to a degree that is \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhat would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks America\u2019s generals and heaps praise on Russia\u2019s president?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI think we know the answer.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton challenged Republicans to denounce Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cEvery Republican holding or seeking office in this country should be asked if they agree with Donald Trump about these statements,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>In the forum, Clinton and Trump diverged on whether the US should deploy ground troops to Iraq. Clinton restated her opposition to sending a contingent of troops into Syria and said she would not deploy ground troops to Iraq \u201cever again\u201d. Trump disagreed.</p> <p>\u201cWe would leave a certain group behind and they would take the various sections where they have the oil,\u201d he said, regarding a policy apparently meant to prevent terror groups such as Islamic State from gaining command of such a vital resource. </p> <p>On Thursday, Clinton denounced this approach. \u201cThe United States of America does not invade other countries to plunder and pillage,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil. </p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not even getting into the absurdity of what it would involve \u2013 massive infrastructure, large numbers of troops, many years on the ground. Of course, Trump hasn\u2019t thought through any of that.\u201d</p> <p>After the press conference, Clinton departed for Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was due to hold a rally on Thursday afternoon. </p>",

She was the only one to set up a private email server in her home, however, and has admitted this was a mistake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/hillary-clinton-short-circuited-statements-classified-emails\">Clinton says she may have 'short-circuited' statements about emails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The emails also offer a rare glimpse of relations between America\u2019s top diplomats across party lines, evolving technology in an era when the BlackBerry was still king and the daily frustrations of a security detail.</p> <p>Clinton and Powell were on first name terms. At 7.37am on Friday 23 January 2009, two days after she was sworn into office, she wrote flatteringly: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear Colin, I hope to catch up soon w you, but I have one pressing question which only you can answer!</p> <p>What were the restrictions on your use of your blackberry? Did you use it in your personal office? I\u2019ve been told that the DSS [Diplomatic Security Service] personnel knew you had one and used it but no one fesses up to knowing how you used it!</p> </blockquote> <p>Barack Obama was the first president to own a BlackBerry at a time when celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears made the hand-held device fashionable. He gave it up for a smartphone only this year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcKi1TS2Zs\">although his phone cannot text or play music</a> for security reasons.</p> <p>Clinton wrote to Powell: \u201cPresident Obama has struck a blow for berry addicts like us. I just have to figure out how to bring along the State Dept. Any and all advice is welcome. All the best to you and Alma, Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>Skipping formalities, Powell replied that he did not have a BlackBerry but explained how he circumvented official channels:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell has previously admitted using a laptop on a private line and sending notes to ambassadors and foreign ministers via personal email, according to a report by the state department\u2019s inspector general.<br></p> <p>In the message to Clinton, Powell said the main issue for him was PDAs \u2013 once-popular devices that included Palm Pilots \u2013 that the DSS would not allow into secure spaces. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them.</p> <p>We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell went on to offer Clinton a friendly warning first reported last week when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/hillary-clinton-emails-laptop-thumb-drive-archive-missing\">FBI released notes of its now closed investigation</a> into her handling of sensitive information. \u201cHowever, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it [sic] government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law \u2026 Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.\u201d</p> <p>Giving an insight into the routine frustrations of balancing security with convenience, Powell, who was secretary of state under George W Bush, added: \u201cYou will find DS driving you crazy if you let them. They had Maddy [possibly a reference to former secretary Madeleine Albright] tied up in knots. I refused to let them live in my house or build a place on my property. They found an empty garage half a block away.</p> <p>\u201cOn weekends, I drove my beloved cars around town without them following me. I promised I would have a phone and not be gone more than an hour or two at Tysons or the hardware store. They hated it and asked me to sign a letter relieving them of responsibility if I got whacked while doing that. I gladly did.</p> <p>\u201cSpontaneity was my security. They wanted to have two to three guys follow me around the building all the time. I said if they were doing their job guarding the place, they didn\u2019t need to follow me. I relented and let one guy follow me one full corridor behind just so they knew where I was if I was needed immediately. Their job is to keep you hermetically sealed up. Love, Colin.\u201d </p> <p>The email saga has continued to haunt Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign even after the FBI concluded in July that she should not face criminal charges. She was quizzed about it closely during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy\">\u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum</a> with military veterans on NBC News on Wednesday night. </p> <p>Cummings said the 2009 exchange showed that Republicans were unfairly critical of Clinton and argued that Powell \u201cadvised Secretary Clinton with a detailed blueprint on how to skirt security rules and bypass requirements to preserve federal records, although Secretary Clinton has made clear that she did not rely on this advice\u201d.</p> <p>It \u201calso illustrates the longstanding problem that no secretary of state ever used an official unclassified email account until the current secretary of state\u201d, Cummings said.</p> <p>The date of the Clinton-Powell email exchange raises questions over Powell\u2019s recent denial of responsibility for providing her advice. \u201cThe truth is she was using it for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did,\u201d <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2016/08/21/colin-powell-sets-record-straight-on-involvement-in-email-scandal/\">he told the New York Post</a>. \u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me.\u201d</p>",

An uninformed person looking at the picture may have concluded that he was in charge and that the woman beside him (Theresa May) was some sort of aide. His name is<strong> Nick Timothy</strong>, he is May\u2019s co-chief of staff and, on the basis of today\u2019s grammar school news, you could be forgiven for thinking he is running the country.</p> <p>Timothy used to be May\u2019s chief of staff when she was home secretary and during that period he did not have a media profile. But then he left to work as head of the New Schools Network and, during that time, he spoke to the media and wrote a regular (and very good) column for ConservativeHome, which means we know a great deal about what he thinks.</p> <p>Two of the most surprising announcements to come from May since she became prime minister can be directly traced to his thinking. The last-minute decision to delay agreeing the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station? Timothy set out the thinking behind that in a ConservativeHome column last October, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html\">The Government is selling our national security to China.</a> And extending grammar schools? Timothy proposed exactly that in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11981856/Nick-Timothy-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools.html\">an interview with the Daily Telegraph last November.</a></p> <p>So what else in on Timothy\u2019s agenda? Here are five policies that he is likely to be pushing, based on what he has said in the past.</p> <p><strong>1 - Introducing tighter curbs on student visas. </strong>(Timothy wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">here.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Making it easier for faith schools to expand.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/01/nick-timothy-how-schools-can-bring-our-divided-communities-together.html\"> a ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government should abolish its admissions rule for faith-designated free schools \u2013 which requires a school, when it is oversubscribed, to limit the number of pupils it accepts on the basis of faith to fifty per cent \u2013 and replace it with a more effective approach. The existing rule fails according to its own objective: it does little to increase the diversity of Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu schools, because for now at least they are unlikely to appeal to parents of other faiths. But the rule is effectively discriminatory for Roman Catholics: it prevents them from opening new free schools because it is almost certainly <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2N.HTM\">against canon law</a> for a Catholic Bishop to set up a school that turned away Catholic pupils on the basis of their Catholicism. Given that there is growing demand for Roman Catholic schools, which are more likely to be ethnically diverse than other schools, more likely to be in poor areas, more likely to be rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted, and more likely to provide what parents want, the rule should be replaced by a legal duty on faith schools to ensure that their pupils mix \u2013 perhaps through sport, performing arts, or school visits \u2013 with children of other backgrounds.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3 - Making welfare more contributions-based.</strong> In another article Timothy said one problem with the Conservative election defeat of 1906 was that it led to plans for contributions-based welfare backed by his hero Joe Chamberlain being shelved.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 1906, MPs behaved as though their identities as free traders and tariff reformers were more important than as Unionists, and the consequences of their defeat continue to be felt even now. The Lloyd George \u2018People\u2019s Budget\u2019 of 1908 introduced a non-contributory pension system \u2013 unlike the contributions-based proposal made by Chamberlain that was rejected by Salisbury and Balfour \u2013 and our welfare state to this day remains non-contributory (a fact that is, coincidentally, relevant to the debate about EU nationals claiming benefits in Britain).</p> </blockquote> <p>As my colleague Heather Stewart has already reported, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/theresa-may-urged-revive-social-insurance\">May\u2019s new director of policy, John Godfrey, is also interested in social insurance systems that create stronger links between what individuals pay and the welfare they get. </a></p> <p><strong>4 - More housebuilding.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/03/nick-timothy-what-does-the-conservative-party-offer-a-working-class-kid-from-brixton-birmingham-bolton-or-bradford.html\">In another ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Often \u2013 on aspects of welfare reform, the increase in the minimum wage, and the investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the (excruciatingly badly-branded) Midlands Engine \u2013 the Government has got these calls right. But when it comes to energy policy, house building, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">high immigration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\">cuts to tax credits</a>, the protection of pensioner benefits, and the profile of spending cuts, it has not.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5 - A full inquiry into Orgreave. </strong>The Home Office is still considering calls for a full inquiry into Orgreave, but Timothy said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-as-with-hillsborough-we-must-get-to-the-bottom-of-what-happened-at-orgreave.html\">in a ConservativeHome article </a>he was in favour of a proper inquiry.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy needed to be reformed, the unions needed to be faced down, and unprofitable pits needed to be closed. But if the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are two ideas that Timothy strongly supports - but which May is much less likely to back because they would involve abandoning Conservative party manifesto promises.</p> <p><strong>6 - Getting rid of the \u201ctriple lock\u201d that ensure state pensions rise every year in line with growth or inflation or by 2.5%, whichever is higher.</strong></p> <p><strong>7 - Abandoning plans to lift the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\"> one ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The chancellor] could redistribute the welfare cuts to take the pressure off low-paid, working people. But the obvious alternative is already off the table: pensioner benefits are protected and so is the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which means that the state pension goes up by the highest out of the growth of wages, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Another option \u2013 to demonstrate that the Government really does value hard work above all else \u2013 is to stop the inheritance tax cut for estates valued between \u00a3650,000 and \u00a31 million. But that policy is not only a manifesto promise but a totem for the Conservative party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:50:37.251Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1697de4b07ac3d446a39c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T13:40:29.517Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sam Freedman</strong>, who used to be a policy adviser to Michael Gove when Gove was education secretary and he is now executive director at <strong>Teach First</strong>, the organisation that gets high-powered graduates into teaching, has put out a statement strongly criticising the plans to extend grammar schools.

Cameron was opposed to opening brand new grammar schools. Letwin said that he personally was \u201cperfectly content\u201d to see the government explore the idea of expanding them, but he also said he was \u201ccompletely agnostic\u201d about whether one type of school was necessarily better than another.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1430be4b08465d44fe9b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:08:11.900Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">5 thing we've learnt from Justine Greening's UQ on grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ministers are often hauled to the Commons to answer an urgent question (UQ) when the government has floated a policy idea in the media but has not yet made a formal announcement. That is exactly what happened today, when <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the shadow education secretary, was granted a UQ on the back of the Telegraph splash. Normally the minister just turns up and tells MPs to wait until the formal policy paper is published, and in many respects that\u2019s what <strong>Justine Greening,</strong> the education secretary, was doing today, but these sessions can be nevertheless be quite illuminating and today\u2019s certainly was. Here are five things we learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 - Theresa May\u2019s plan to \u201cbring back grammar schools\u201d is popular with Conservative MPs - but only up to a point.</strong> Most of the Tory MPs who spoke expressed support for grammar schools. But the very first backbencher to be called, and arguably the most important on this issue, <strong>Neil Carmichael</strong>, the Conservative who chairs the Commons education committee, expressed strong reservations. Telling Greening that the UK was well down the table in international literacy and numeracy league tables, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is absolutely necessary for any discussion about grammar schools to not distract us from that fundamental task that we have of improving social mobility and making sure that we have the best use of all of the talent across the whole country and not just talk about the few.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Desmond Swayne,</strong> a former PPS to David Cameron and certainly no Tory leftie, told Greening that he would not fancy having to face parents in his constituency who could not get their children into a local grammar school. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb#block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb\">11.14am.)</a> And<strong> Lucy Allan, </strong>another Conservative, demanded an assurance that there would be no return to the days of the 11-plus. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d#block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d\"> 11.07am.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Greening herself seems to sceptical about championing a grammar school renaissance.</strong> Some Labour MPs said they thought Greening sounded distinctly lukewarm about the policy she was supposed to be defending and they were right. Greening kept stressing the importance of having an open mind on the matter of educational reform and she said nothing to suggest that she is a grammar school enthusiast (while, quite cleverly, also avoiding sounding disloyal to May.) In fact, Greening even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cgrammar school\u201d, instead preferring to talk about selection.</p> <p><strong>3 - A full return to a grammar school system seems to be off the table - although the government is considering letting more grammar schools open and extending the principle of selection in state education. </strong>Greening was not specific about much, but she did make it very clear that the government was not planning a full return to the grammar/secondary modern era. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be no return to the simplistic, binary choice of the past where schools separate children into winners and losers, successes or failures. This government wants to focus on the future, to build on our success since 2010 and to create a truly 21st century schools system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And when asked if she would return to the days of the 11-plus, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can assure you that there will be no return to the past. This is about moving forward. This is about having a 21st century approach to our school system, precisely not one that is rooted in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Greening did say: \u201cWe do think selection can play a role.\u201d It could be that May is keen to talk about grammar schools is because the phrase is popular with the public. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361#block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361\">10.08am.) </a>But whether the government\u2019s proposals really do involve a large number of new grammar schools, in the traditional meaning of the word, remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>4 - </strong><strong>Labour is remarkably united in strongly opposing grammar schools. </strong>By my count only one Labour MP expressed some support for the government\u2019s idea (<strong>Kate Hoey</strong>) and otherwise it was striking how MPs from all wings of the party spoke out very strongly against the idea. <strong>Angela Rayner,</strong> the shadow education secretary, was particularly effective. She told Greening:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can you tell the House what evidence you have to support your belief that grammar schools will help disadvantaged children and close the attainment gap? At a time when our schools are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, with the thousands taught in super-sized classes and schools facing real-term cuts to their budget for the first time in nearly two decades, pushing ahead with grammar schools shows a dangerous misunderstanding of the real issues facing our schools.</p> </blockquote> <p>This makes it all the more surprising that Jeremy Corbyn chose not to raise the grammar school issue at PMQs yesterday. Perhaps he chose to avoid the subject because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3778820/Corbyn-s-team-attended-used-grammars-children.html\">his son attended one, and his head of strategy and communications Seumas Milne sent his children to grammar schools.</a> Given that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/13/uk.politicalnews2\"> Corbyn\u2019s second marriage broke up because he did not want his son to go to a grammar school</a>, he could argue that his opposition to grammar schools is so strong and sincere that it has led to great sacrifice. But it is understandable why someone very reluctant to discuss his family in public may have decided it was a subject best avoided at PMQs.</p> <p><strong>5 - T</strong><strong>he Tories will try to turn this into an issue of what works versus ideology. </strong>Greening did not really engage with the arguments raised about grammar schools and social mobility. Instead, she just argued that it was sensible to have a debate, and she accused Labour of being dogmatic. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be wrong to discount how we can improve prospects for those children, especially the most disadvantaged, purely because of political dogma. If Labour is not willing to ask itself these difficult questions, how can it possibly come up with any of the solutions? </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8/49_0_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Greening.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Greening answering the UQ on grammar schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:21:32.756Z\">at 1.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d14114e4b013613fffb3e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T10:49:10.638Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> on Justine Greening\u2019s UQ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/773821240209465344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Justine Greening sounding less-than-enthusiastic about grammars in House.

However, it is certainly interesting to note that public opinion is quite nuanced; when people were confronted with two counterarguments to grammar schools, support was in some cases strong. What does this mean for the overall stance of public opinion? It could mean two things: first, it could suggest that public opinion is malleable and that if parties opposed to new grammar schools exploit that malleability, the voters may be turned away from grammar schools. Alternatively, though, it could suggest that while voters are clearly aware of the counterarguments to grammar schools \u2013 and have some degree of affinity with them \u2013 this is already baked in to the polling numbers; in other words, that voters know the problems with grammar schools but feel overall that grammar schools should still be opened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Polling Digest also says that people \u201coverwhelmingly agree that grammar schools help academic success and increase social mobility\u201d.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s political brand is mainstream, incremental and pragmatic. She presents herself as \u201cthe progressive who wants to get things done\u201d, a tagline that emphasizes the need to sacrifice grand visions on the altar of results. She may prioritize reform over revolution, but she is also the candidate of much bigger ideas than is typically recognized.</p> <p>One of these touches the heart of government itself: the role of the state. The modern state was created to protect its citizens; although the line between defending citizens from one another and foreign invaders and waging war as a foreign invader was blurry at best. As the sociologist Charles Tilly wrote: \u201cWar made the state and the state made war.\u201d The state thus created was the \u201cfiscal-military state\u201d. In Manuel Lin-Miranda\u2019s rap retelling of precisely this struggle between Hamilton and Jefferson: \u201cIf we assume the debts, the union gets a new line of credit, a financial diuretic; If we\u2019re aggressive and competitive the union gets a boost.\u201d<br></p> <p>Over the course of the 20th century, in part because of the depredations of wars and economic depressions triggered by adventures and miscalculations of fiscal-military states, government as protector also become government as provider. In The Fourth Revolution<em>, </em>John Micklethwaite and Adrian Woolridge chronicle the evolution of the night-watchman state into the nanny state, even as they call for another revolution \u2013 this one to decouple \u201cdemocracy from elephantiasis\u201d and end the \u201csupersizing of the state\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/07/clinton-email-nightmare-not-over-jill-abramson\">For Hillary Clinton, the email nightmare is far from over | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A perusal of Hillary Clinton\u2019s policy positions may not satisfy these criteria, but they do offer view of the state that is neither night-watchman or nanny: government as investor. The rhetoric of investment is everywhere. Policies to create jobs and raise wages, for instance, are described as part of the American tradition of \u201cbipartisan investments in our future\u201d. She calls for massive infrastructure investment, as well as research investments, most notably in clean energy, all of which are government\u2019s most traditional investor roles.</p> <p>She is also recommending major investments in human capital. Family policy is typically a backwater for politicians, but for Clinton it is central. She headlines her commitment to early childhood education with a sentence that she used repeatedly as secretary of state: \u201cEvery child deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.\u201d</p> <p>That is not just a platitude. It\u2019s an investment philosophy. As for a venture capitalist, it is impossible to know which investments in a portfolio will pay off, only that it is necessary to seed as many as possible to find the winners and the steady earners. Government must invest in all citizens to harvest the full range of potential growth, knowledge, creativity, grit and resilience a society requires. As we now know, investing in children in the first five years of their lives, a period of intense brain development, determines not just how much they know at age five but how much and how well they will be able to learn for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Government must also invest in the ability of citizens to care for each other, largely through families, but also with the help of skilled paid caregivers. Clinton would increase \u201cinvestments in childcare\u201d such that no family has to pay more than 10% of its income to afford high-quality care. She supports paid family and medical leave of 12 weeks for every American and would raise wages and improve working conditions for childcare and eldercare workers. These jobs and services are part of \u201cthe caring economy\u201d, one that will only grow as baby boomers age and millennials begin to have children of their own.</p> <p>Clinton may find support for her vision of government in an unexpected place: Silicon Valley. Technology reporter Gregory Ferenstein has polled leading Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-7430741808315564159__ftn1\">concluded</a> that they \u201cwant the government to be an investor in citizens, rather than as a protector from capitalism\u201d. In the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-7430741808315564159__ftn2\">words</a> of the Alphabet chairman, Eric Schmidt, \u201cthe combination of innovation, empowerment, and creativity will be our solution.\u201d</p> <p>The world that all of our children will enter, indeed that we ourselves must navigate in the coming decades, is whirling too fast and too unpredictably for any government to credibly promise either absolute protection or comprehensive provision of services. It can and will continue to do some of each. But its best bet is to cultivate talent and build resilience, investing in both individuals and families to allow them to take care of themselves and one another. Those investments must be substantial and long-term, but countries will not be able to compete without an infrastructure of care.<br></p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be the substantive counterpoint to a primary season dominated by frivolity, but Wednesday\u2019s national security forum \u2013 hosted by NBC and featuring back-to-back appearances by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 was nothing of the sort.</p> <p>To say it wasn\u2019t television news\u2019 finest hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">would be an understatement</a>.</p> <p>Instead of testing the limits of Trump\u2019s knowledge or probing Clinton to move beyond her standard talking points, the forum\u2019s setup seemed to encourage candidates to assume their usual roles. Trump was allowed to ramble on topics utterly devoid of policy content, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11057968/donald-trump-iraq-war-2002\">while occasionally asserting lies as truths</a>; Clinton was forced to repeatedly defend herself against the same accusations regarding her private email server that have plagued her all election cycle. </p> <p>Trump was able to play all his greatest, phoniest hits \u2013 saying, for instance, he was against the war in Iraq all along. <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11057968/donald-trump-iraq-war-2002\">That\u2019s a lie</a>, pure and simple, as has been documented by a whole cadre of journalists by now. But NBC moderator Matt Lauer didn\u2019t correct him, instead rerouting the conversation to a soft-ball referendum on Trump\u2019s temperament.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">a tweet in which</a> Trump seemed dismissive of sexual assault in the military came up, the mogul got to have it every which way, saying first that the tweet was \u201ccorrect\u201d, and then that \u201cmany\u201d agree with him, and finally, in so many words, that he no longer supports it. He did the same routine a second time when asked about his relationship to Vladimir Putin, saying first that Putin\u2019s favorable impression of him would not have any impact on him and then saying the exact opposite thing in the next sentence: \u201cIf he says great things about me, I\u2019m going to say great things about him.\u201d No matter, both Trump and Lauer had moved on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">Trump: Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The approach allows listeners to hear whatever they want to hear, something Trump, in his myth-making book, The Art of the Deal, touted as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/trump-immigration-code-switching-not-skillful-disingenuous\">one of his greatest strengths</a>. It also gives Trump an opportunity to parrot compliments he\u2019s received \u2013 in this case, from Putin.</p> <p>Lauer\u2019s not a national security expert and doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being hard-hitting. But even with that disposition and background, he still should have managed to call Trump out some of these things.</p> <p>Yet to simply blame Lauer for what\u2019s widely considered to be a missed opportunity is to miss the forest for the trees. Sure, he failed to elicit a substantive policy discussion from Trump. But he also failed where every other major moderator has failed as well. If there\u2019s a formula for stopping Trump from coasting on insults and babble, nobody\u2019s found it yet, and playing PolitiFact in real time is no easy feat.</p> <p>There were a few places where Trump walked himself into a corner, like his comment about how, under President Obama, military generals have been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d and things have eroded to a point where \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing\u201d. Those remarks came off as deeply unpatriotic. But any resulting controversy, like the comment he made last year about John McCain not being a war hero, will fade.</p> <p>Trump is winning the military vote handily, after all, as every Republican candidate in recent elections has. It\u2019s a vote that\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/military-communities-favor-trump-over-clinton-n644176\">disproportionately white, male and lacking a college degree</a> \u2013 which is to say, it checks all the right boxes for him. And no outlier comment about generals in a policy forum is going to change that.<br></p> <p>What does matter and should scare Clinton is that she just got an ugly preview of the coming debates: despite establishment insistence that Trump\u2019s playground-style taunts won\u2019t work on her in the general, we saw during Wednesday night\u2019s forum that they can.</p> <p>Trump is already using such tactics against Clinton, as he did at a town hall in Virginia earlier this week when he made a gendered dig about how <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putin-clinton-laughs-2016-9\">\u201cPutin looks at her and he laughs\u201d</a>. He did it when he observed her to be lacking a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/donald-trump-says-clinton-doesnt-look-presidential.html\">\u201cpresidential look\u201d</a>, and when he insinuates she\u2019s untrustworthy through silly monikers like Crooked Hillary. It\u2019s an approach Paul Krugman referred to earlier this week as the politics of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/opinion/hillary-clinton-gets-gored.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fpaul-krugman&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">innuendo</a>. It\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s employing it, but he\u2019s channeling it more effectively than anyone else in recent memory.</p> <p>It was evident during the forum on Wednesday night, and it was evident afterwards, when Clinton\u2019s camp came after Trump on all the inconsistencies he spouted to Lauer, attacking his defense of sexual assault in the military, his embrace of Putin and his tarring of military generals. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the chairman of the Republican party attacked Clinton for, of all things, having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/status/773694140404170752\">\u201cno smile\u201d</a>. She was left playing defense against innuendo at an event <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/773673483884720129?lang=en\">expressly billed</a> as the antidote to vapid dialogue. If that\u2019s any indication of what we\u2019re in for this fall, Clinton and anyone in support of examining actual political policy needs to come up with a new strategy.</p>",

  "<p>Plans for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next month have been plunged into disarray after a court in Ramallah ordered that the vote be postponed until at least December.</p> <p>The municipal elections, scheduled for 8 October, which Fatah and Hamas had both planned to contest, had been seen as a key step towards ending the prolonged impasse in Palestinian politics, and the first step towards long-delayed legislative and presidential elections.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, some in the Fatah movement, to which the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, belongs, view the prospect with deep trepidation, fearing a repeat of the 2006 election, when the Islamist movement Hamas won over large parts of the electorate, not least in its stronghold of Gaza.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, some Fatah figures have been pressuring Abbas to cancel or postpone the vote. Indeed, rumours have been circulating that a way will be found to cancel the elections.</p> <p>The court in Ramallah on the West Bank, where Abbas\u2019s Fatah movement rules, ordered the postponement following disputes over candidate lists, not least in Gaza where Fatah activists have complained of interference by Hamas.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3497f84fefcc0f91a70f4df19c81d38358cef0b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3497f84fefcc0f91a70f4df19c81d38358cef0b4/203_324_3225_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahmoud Abbas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahmoud Abbas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A key issue in the postponement was the claim that Hamas-run courts in Gaza had annulled candidate lists in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, barring Fatah figures from standing for infringements including alleged \u201cimmorality\u201d, such as reported claims of a picture of one candidate dancing in a nightclub.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cElections can\u2019t take place in one place and not the other,\u201d the presiding judge of the Ramallah court said in his ruling. \u201cThe election can\u2019t take place in Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. Also, there are problems with the formation of courts in Gaza \u2026 Therefore, the court decides to stop the election.\u201d</p> <p>In fact local elections in 2012 did proceed under exactly those conditions, with polling taking place in a fraction of the West Bank\u2019s 350 municipalities, and Hamas refusing to recognise the outcome.</p> <p>A Hamas spokesman said it rejected the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is a political decision,\u201d the Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. \u201cWe reject the decision to cancel the election and call on everyone to reject it.\u201d</p> <p>The court will hold another session to consider the issue on 21 September, but legal experts said Thursday\u2019s decision was unlikely to be changed, meaning it is almost certain that the municipal elections will not go ahead as planned.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sources suggested Abbas would not seek to intervene to overrule the court by decree to ensure the elections went ahead on schedule.</p> <p>Official campaigning had been due to start in the coming weeks.

The elections would have seen parts of Gaza that have not voted since 2006 participate, including 90,000 new young voters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The postponement of the elections also underlines the growing problem of Abbas\u2019s own long-expired democratic mandate. He is now in the 11th year of his four-year mandate, ruling by decree, with no sitting Palestinian legislative assembly since 2007. Opinion polls suggest most Palestinians would like him to step down.</p> <p> Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, boycotted the last Palestinian municipal elections in 2012. Fatah and Hamas have not contested an election since 2006 parliamentary polls, which Hamas won \u2013 sparking a conflict that led to near civil war in Gaza the following year.</p> <p>Both sides were quick to blame the other for the postponement. \u201cWe hold Hamas fully responsible for foiling the election, starting with the unjustified petitions it filed,\u201d the Fatah spokesman Osama al-Qawasmi said, accusing Hamas of using \u201cprivate courts\u201d in Gaza to block Fatah\u2019s lists.

  "<p>These days it is en vogue in Washington DC to be itching for conflict with Russia. Politicians and pundits alike are outdoing each other for how they can describe the supposed threat Putin now poses to the west. To his credit, Barack Obama seems to be the only politician not playing into the cold war 2.0 hysteria.</p> <p>In little noticed comments last week, Hillary Clinton suggested that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/771418337096134656\">the US should start preparing</a> \u201cmilitary\u201d responses to cyber-attacks allegedly perpetrated by Russia on the DNC and voter registration files.

Trump is a menace and a buffoon in countless ways, but the idea that he is secretly doing secretly Putin\u2019s bidding is beyond absurd.</p> <p>The media, in turn, largely seems to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/757255490866933760\">eager to portray Putin</a> as a 11th dimensional chess grandmaster, who is behind every major world event. (Conspiracy theories are almost universally mocked in the US, unless they involve Putin and Russia \u2013 then they are encouraged.)</p> <p>Even some inside the Obama administration, like defense secretary Ash Carter, seem open to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-russia-sowing-seeds-global-instability/\">ratcheting up the tension with Russia</a>, which, by the way, the sprawling defense industry is also openly rooting for.

In a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-obama-60-minutes-syria-isis-2016-presidential-race/\">60 Minutes interview last year</a>, correspondent Steve Kroft kept trying to get Obama to admit that Putin was asserting his dominance over the US, but as Obama calmly (and correctly) explained, what Russia is doing in Syria and Ukraine is not borne out of strength, but out of desperation. The idea of using our military purely to \u201cshow strength\u201d against Russia in some sort of macho capacity may only make things worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/russia-hack-america-not-help-donald-trump-win-election\">If Russia is trying to hack America, it is not to help Donald Trump win | David Klion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Obama\u2019s best moments during the 2012 debate <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/09/why-obama-is-to-blame-for-russias-spywar-on-america/#.V8hjRIAToNc.twitter\">was mocking Mitt Romney</a> for calling Russia the US\u2019s \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe,\u201d quipping \u201cthe 80s called and wants their foreign policy back.\u201d Yet this has now been turned into an attack on Obama by the very same people who seem to be almost wishing that Russia returns to its cold war status as Enemy No1.</p> <p>The Obama administration seems intent on trying to negotiate a deal with Russia in Syria. Putting aside the flawed rationale for bombing Syria at all, this seems like the entirely logical move \u2013 yet it barely gets mentioned by the various parties who are currently fanning the Russia-is-the-enemy flames.</p> <p>By the way, Reuters reported last week how Obama\u2019s comments on Russia in Syria have been borne out by reality: Russia has realized <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-russia-idUSKCN1141VN\">that their airstrikes in Syria</a> aren\u2019t having the effect they thought they would (beyond killing a lot of civilians).</p> <p>All this is not to say that the allegations against Russia aren\u2019t disturbing. And no one is saying the US should be best friends with Russia or that they shouldn\u2019t be publicly criticized. If they are trying to disrupt the US election for whatever reason, it\u2019s a significant story and cause for alarm for anyone concerned about the sanctity of our elections. But as Obama calmly stated the other day: \u201cWe are moving into a new area where a number of countries have significant capacities. And frankly we have more capacity than any other country, both offensively and defensively.\u201d We know that the NSA, after all, is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/757618414554939393\">authorized</a> to hack political parties in other countries as well.</p> <p>Yet agitating for yet another foreign policy crisis and ratcheting up the pressure on the administration to \u201cdo something\u201d \u2013 even if no one knows what that is \u2013 is only going to make things worse. The goal should be de-escalating the chances of a larger war, not finding ways to encourage it.</p>",
  "<p>Even a stopped clock is right twice daily. So we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, whose economic policies can broadly be described as a big goofy mess, has managed to hit the nail on the head with at least one critique. And it happens to be an important one for the wallets of most Americans.</p> <p> On Labor Day, Trump said that the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultra-low interest rates have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/trump-us-federal-reserve-false-economy-interest-rates\">created a \u201cfalse economy\u201d</a> and that \u201cat some point the rates are going to have to change.\u201d </p> <p> That\u2019s hardly earth-shattering news. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve\u2019s team of policymakers, and her colleagues agreed to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade since December. But they also passed up a handful of opportunities to hike rates further, while events beyond their control (China\u2019s economic struggles, unexpectedly anemic US economic data, the Brexit shock) forced them to the sidelines on other occasions.</p> <p> When interest rates are that low, there\u2019s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market. And there\u2019s no other reason to invest in stocks except the fact that there\u2019s no other place to put it that might earn a reasonable return.</p> <p> Translation? At this stage, the geriatric bull market is hooked on cheap money from the Fed, not fundamentals. Which means all those records you keep reading about the S&amp;P 500 index and other market bellwethers setting <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/08/investing/stock-market-sp500-high/\">simply aren\u2019t justified</a>. That, in turn, means that Trump has correctly pointed out that the Fed\u2019s policy of flooding the market with cheap money, via ultra-low interest rates, is creating a speculative stock market bubble. You remember how the last one of those \u2013 in housing \u2013 ended, don\u2019t you? Yes, exactly.</p> <p> The Fed\u2019s policymakers seem to be terrified of what will happen when they begin normalizing interest rates. Perhaps they\u2019re right to worry, because almost certainly we\u2019ll witness a big hit to our stock and bond portfolios simultaneously. </p> <p>Bond prices will fall because that\u2019s what happens whenever interest rates rise \u2013 they move inversely, because the value of the fixed interest payments on those existing bonds declines as new bonds are issued at a higher price. Stocks will lose value because by this point in the geriatric bull market, the chief element supporting them is the fact that rates are low \u2013 the argument in their favor is a relative one rather than an absolute one, that stocks are alluring in their own right.</p> <p>Pundits of all kinds have been making that argument for months now, pointing out that stocks are expensive. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-no-medal-winners-stock-183812662.html\">downgraded stocks of all kinds to \u201cunderweight\u201d in early August</a> and noted that the median valuation for an S&amp;P 500 stock was in the 98th percentile. Kostin anticipated a 5% drop in the months following his note to clients, but in its immediate aftermath, the S&amp;P index only went on to post new highs. </p> <p>Investors who are looking at their statements and celebrating really should send the Fed flowers and chocolates in gratitude. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"154a098c7405de1e10245b6163367cc6761050a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/154a098c7405de1e10245b6163367cc6761050a3/0_130_4704_2822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"When interest rates are that low, there\u2019s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When interest rates are that low, there\u2019s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But these gains aren\u2019t happening because of a robust improvement in corporate fundamentals across the board. In the second quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, S&amp;P 500 corporate profits actually declined 2.2.%. Stripping out money-losing energy companies improved the picture somewhat and resulted in a second-quarter increase in profitability of 2.2%. But the reality is that we\u2019re in the midst of a prolonged period in which profits are barely growing, and corporate revenues are shrinking \u2013 and yet in which stock prices are roaring higher. That\u2019s counterintuitive. </p> <p>In fact, one analyst has calculated that low interest rates <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-caused-93--of-the-entire-stock-market-s-move-since-2008--analysis-194426366.html\">can explain 93% of the first eight years of the stock market\u2019s bull run</a>, from March 2008 until March 2016. </p> <p>So, Trump is right: the Fed has spawned a bull market, and quite possibly one that has spun out of control. </p> <p>During the Republican primary season, some other isolated bits of Fed-related common sense surfaced from Trump, including noting that low rates aren\u2019t always such a bad thing, especially if you happen to be running a business or otherwise in need of debt financing.</p> <p>\u201cThe best thing we have going right now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren\u2019t being done, amazingly,\u201d <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/620637/donald-trump-shockingly-sane-federal-reserve\">he said</a>. Toss out the mangled syntax, and what Trump is suggesting is that we squandered the opportunity to borrow at a low cost and reinvest in innovation and infrastructure. </p> <p>In Trump\u2019s worldview, of course, the Fed\u2019s reason for keeping rates so low for so long was political. Yellen and her predecessors were trying to make Barack Obama and his economic policies look good. </p> <p>They did so by getting us all hooked on monetary crack: cheap money, via low interest rates. Debt became inexpensive (if we could get it from the banks) and stocks (for those of us with the cash to invest) were guaranteed to go higher because, let\u2019s face it, what else was everyone else going to invest in? It was a great way to transform a speculative market \u2013 stocks \u2013 into what was very nearly a sure thing. </p> <p>In fact, if the Fed is in anyone\u2019s pocket, it\u2019s likely to be that of the treasurers of Fortune 500 corporations. The minute that policymakers raise interest rates, <em>swoosh,</em> in will come a lot of capital from overseas, in search of the higher yields they could get on short-term US Treasuries. Zoom \u2013 up would go the US dollar in response. And that crashing sound? Well, that would be the reverberations from the plunge in corporate profits. </p> <p>As I\u2019ve already pointed out, revenues and profits are already under pressure, and nearly half (about 48%, to be precise) of revenues at S&amp;P 500 companies come from overseas. If the dollar goes up in value, every pound, euro, yen, etc that they earn overseas <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/february/rate-hikes-affect-dollars-exchange-rate\">will be worth fewer dollars</a>. The Fed has a mandate to keep unemployment levels stable, and you can be reasonably sure that they\u2019re aware that a sudden plunge in earnings would lead to layoffs. They don\u2019t need Obama to whisper into their ears.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton chose to seize the moment that Trump finally said something sane and sensible to scold him, warning him not to comment about what the Fed does \u201cwhen you are either running for president or you are president\u201d. She went on to warn: \u201cWords have consequences. Words move markets. Words can be misinterpreted.\u201d</p> <p>Not Trump\u2019s, clearly. The market has plodded along ever since he made his remarks, apparently oblivious to his views of the Fed and the market. Trump isn\u2019t Warren Buffett, BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink or David Kostin of Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>It\u2019s a pity, because this time he\u2019s right. It may not happen very often \u2013 we may not see it again on an issue of real substance during this campaign. But this is a stock market bubble that has been inflated by the Fed\u2019s easy market policy. You don\u2019t have to believe that the Fed is politicized to agree on that diagnosis. You should accept that this is what we\u2019re confronting, however \u2013 and prepare for the fallout whenever it ends.</p>",

Populist demands grow loud when the \u201cbastards\u201d are identified as Washington insiders, constrainers of liberties, corrupt and incompetent. Nativist demands increase when the \u201cbastards\u201d are immigrants or other suspect groups. In both, a troubled world will be set right when evil forces are purged.</p> <p>The country was born in a revolution against central government, but long before, early settlers, fleeing the centralization of Charles I, were wary of London: the king\u2019s men were the bastards to be thrown out in order to preserve local control. \u201cThe Congregational churches and self-contained towns of Massachusetts,\u201d the historian TH Breen writes, \u201cstood as visible evidence of the founders\u2019 decision to preserve in America what had been threatened in the mother country.\u201d </p> <p>The many early settlers who were religious dissenters were doubly suspicious of government, first for its centralizing efforts and second for the persecution it had foisted upon them. Internal migration through sparsely settled land contributed to the dismissal of central government and growing self-reliance, as there was relatively little government to rely on. Individual initiative and local community were the keys to survival. </p> <p>National government took a larger role as the country grew, yet the value of individual and local effort combined with a suspicion of central authorities were rooted in America\u2019s civil faith.</p> <p>Protestantism, born also in revolution (against Rome), added to the mix. The mandate to read the Bible for oneself and find one\u2019s own path to God encouraged the view that the responsible moral agent is the individual (with guidance from her local church). The Great Awakenings of the 1730s-1740s and 1820s-50s were festivals of individual iconoclasm, religious groups splintering off from established institutions, and populist religious ideas.</p> <p>Reformed Protestantism, which came to America through Puritan and other Calvinist traditions, had an even stronger impact on political development. It held that the sovereign nation does not start with central government but with the local covenanted community \u2013 the foedus \u2013 which form networks to constitute the nation. It\u2019s these ideas that gave the US its federal system of government and the continuing political and legal battles about states\u2019 rights. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494/0_0_3500_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ammon Bundy greets occupier Duane Ehmer and his horse at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channelling American history and zeal. </p> <p>Today, Trump is giving this civil religion voice in populist form, and because \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d is rooted in US culture and worldview, it wins votes. </p> <p>In April 2016, the Public Religion Research Institute reported: \u201cTwo-thirds of Trump supporters think the nation needs a leader who breaks the rules\u201d (a ritual redux of Boston\u2019s \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d Tea Party). Other Republican candidates had populist, small-government positions but lacked Trump\u2019s feathers-and-warpaint yelp. Ted Cruz came closest, which is one reason, along with his social conservatism, why he was second in line and why there is substantial support for his running in 2020.</p> <p>Even when Trump says he\u2019d keep governmental social security for retirees, his jeremiad is brimstone and hellfire for Washington. The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it \u201cclicks\u201d with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels.</p> <p>Trump University taught: \u201cYou don\u2019t sell products, benefits or solutions \u2013 you sell feelings.\u201d Trump had no hand in the development of America\u2019s civil-religious anti-authoritarian feelings, but he taps into them. His first and continuing charge against Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine is that they are \u201cultimate insiders\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66f51b5788b3ec60dea5c6421e893a633a4e02a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66f51b5788b3ec60dea5c6421e893a633a4e02a9/0_0_5203_3127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Immigrant rights activists hold up a fabric wall to protest against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Immigrant rights activists hold up a fabric wall to protest against Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In nativist form, \u201crid ye of the devil\u201d is extended from the populist Satan of big government to other spoilers of the City on the Hill, especially traditionally suspect groups like immigrants and Muslims. Many factors go into antipathy against these communities, and surveys have correlated support for Trump with pre-existing intolerance for immigrants, racial minorities, and Muslims. But intolerance becomes calls for deportation and border closings where \u201cthrow the devil out\u201d is seen as the way to save a fallen world. </p> <p>One definition of \u201ctragic\u201d is getting behind solutions that don\u2019t solve problems. Closing borders to keep or throw the bastards out will probably not address America\u2019s economic or national security problems. Given the extensive vetting process, it\u2019s not clear that barring Muslims will boost security, but it does do Isis\u2019s PR for them, giving weight to the claim that America is in a war against all Muslims. It\u2019s also not clear that reducing immigration would yield economic benefits, since legal and illegal immigrants to the US create companies and jobs and boost the economy by a surplus of $35bn annually, benefiting all but the lowest earners. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/kentucky-trump-obama-unemployment-drugs\">Pride and pain in Trump country: 'We all grew up poor, but we had a community'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>America\u2019s employment crisis could be addressed through education, job (re)training, and regional redevelopment, for a start.

  "<p>In the lead-up to his Yeezy Season 4 show, Kanye West ruffled some fashion feathers. The casting call for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/05/was-kanye-west-wrong-cast-multiracial-women-only\">\u201cmultiracial women only\u201d</a> was branded controversial, and the last-minute announcement that the show would be streaming via Tidal had many thinking it would follow the non-traditional model of February\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/kanye-west-new-album-the-life-of-pablo-launch\">Season 3 show</a> (an album playback-cum-art installation). And in an interview with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13473191/kanye-west-spring-2017-interview/?mbid=social_twitter_vr\">Vogue </a>posted hours prior to the show, West made a point of being anti-elitist. He said his garments were \u201capparel\u201d, not fashion, with a purposefully limited colour palette to give them a timeless appeal. </p> <p>Despite these purist intentions, initial reports about the show, which took place in Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island, sounded more Zoolander than utilitarian. There was a time delay, models <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3778732/Off-shoes-Tyga-s-former-flame-Amina-Blue-stumbles-Yeezy-runway-rips-plastic-heels-walks-BAREFOOT-catwalk-ex-Kylie-Jenner-watch.html\">fell</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stellabugbee/status/773620675944865792?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">collapsed in the heat </a> and many thought that model Jasmine Sanders was, in fact, Malia Obama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SXPAHS/status/773626259347681280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I thought this was Malia Obama on glance lol <a href=\"https://t.co/igZ48iWwSK\">pic.twitter.com/igZ48iWwSK</a></p>&mdash; Kylie (@SXPAHS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SXPAHS/status/773626259347681280\">September 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But what about the clothes? We\u2019d already seen West\u2019s wife Kim Kardashian in perspex, over-the-knee boots, and this collection focused on close-fitting styles: athleisure unitards, knitted cut-out tops, oversize hoodies and jackets, and elasticated separates.</p> <p>The colour scheme was toned down from the earth tones of red, sand and orange that dominated Season 3. Instead, the palette was creme, beige, nude, brown and muted pistachio. Its had quite a mass appeal and honed Yeezy\u2019s aesthetic: terra firma bodycon. Like Season 3, it was also a statement about black female beauty and style, which is a victory in itself. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Booth/status/773697586507214848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Twirling and posing: style of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TOMFORD\">@TOMFORD</a> show very old school runway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYFW?src=hash\">#NYFW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2bzbzqLyC9\">pic.twitter.com/2bzbzqLyC9</a></p>&mdash; @Booth (@Booth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Booth/status/773697586507214848\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If West was experimenting with what fashion means now, Tom Ford, who showed later in the day, went for old-school glamour.

The clothes were equally luxurious: shimmering sequins and ombre feathers met leather and velvet in pencil-thin silhouettes evoking classic Tinseltown glamour and elegance. </p>",
  "<p>As Somalia slid into civil war almost 26 years ago, a family in Mogadishu sold everything to send a teenage girl to safety overseas. The 18-year-old arrived in northern Europe as a penniless and poorly educated asylum seeker. Now an expert in public health and an award-winning activist, <a href=\"https://fqdayib.com/\">Fadumo Dayib</a> hopes to return to her homeland to end the killing and corruption and help lead Somalia towards prosperity and stability.</p> <p>Dayib, who has lived in Finland since 1990, is standing in crucial presidential elections in Somalia scheduled for October. It is a move that has brought her daily death threats but also, she says, massive support in the country she left behind.</p> <p>The poll has been billed by international backers, including the US and the UK, as the country\u2019s first truly democratic election for decades. The reality is less inspiring, and <a href=\"https://unsom.unmissions.org/fact-sheet-somalia\u2019s-2016-electoral-process\">much more complicated</a>. A full election with a vote for all adults is considered impractical for security and institutional reasons, so Somalia\u2019s next president will be selected by members of a bicameral national assembly picked by 14,000 delegates chosen by tribal elders. </p> <p>At best, analysts say, the election can be described as a \u201cstepping stone\u201d towards universal suffrage, a goal optimists believe will be reached in 2020. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/27/ifrah-ahmed-helping-somalias-government-end-fgm\">Ifrah Ahmed: helping Somalia's government end FGM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are 18 candidates for the presidency, including the incumbent, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, a former academic and activist who has been in power since 2012.

If you are not corrupt you will not get into the system. I will never pay one cent to anyone so the likelihood of me winning is non-existent,\u201d Dayib told the Guardian, speaking from her home near Helsinki.</p> <p>But her campaign has already had an impact: raising her profile, prompting a broader discussion about women in Somalia, and, according to the candidate, showing the country\u2019s 11 million inhabitants that there is an alternative to the existing political elite.</p> <p> \u201cIn 2020 we will have democratic elections and then \u2026 we will win,\u201d Dayib said. \u201cA lot of Somalis are in shock because I appeared out of nowhere but managed to challenge all those in power \u2026 and [now] everyone inside the country knows who I am.\u201d </p> <p>After decades of conflict, Somalia was said to have turned a corner in 2012 with a new political settlement and major gains against the insurgency led by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/somalia-terrorist-carpenter-al-shabaab\">al-Shabaab movement</a>.

Officials in Kenya, where many diplomats and aid workers dealing with Somalia are based, talk of a \u201crecalibration of objectives\u201d.</p> <p>Dayib was born in Kenya, the daughter of Somali parents. Her mother had travelled to the neighbouring country to seek better medical treatment after 11 siblings died of preventable disease. Dayib, the 12th, survived. Expelled from Kenya in 1989, the family tried to remake their lives in Mogadishu. Then came the collapse of the Siad Barre regime and civil war.</p> <p>In Finland, Dayib studied as a critical care nurse, trained health specialists for the United Nations and gained a doctorate. She also works with the private sector on employment for refugees and<a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/05/a-onetime-refugee-aims-high/\"> won a fellowship to Harvard University</a> to study public administration.</p> <p>\u201cI hit the ground running and never stopped \u2026 I did not want to assimilate and lose my culture or my religion but to integrate.

He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> <p>He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against female service members \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday \u2013 by arguing the military needed to set up internal courts, as if the military does not already have its own well-established justice system.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent. Hillary Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former Navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member.</p> <p>She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved it away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions, a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president.</p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not this minute thousands of them there.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0d178e4b042bbfb3246c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:53:24.444Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Colin Powell's advice to Clinton on using personal email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Although it didn\u2019t directly come up in the forum on Wednesday evening, this is intriguing reading: a 2009 email exchange between Hillary Clinton and former secretary of state Colin Powell in which she asks for \u2013 and he gives \u2013 advice on using her Blackberry in the state department.</p> <p>The full exchange is <a href=\"https://medium.com/oversightdems/cummings-releases-full-powell-email-advising-clinton-on-personal-email-use-65904c1ccfa#.lo7sv941t\">here</a>, released by Deomcratic Rep. Elijah Cummings via the House oversight committee, but here\u2019s a snippet of Powell\u2019s email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I didn\u2019t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> <p>Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> <p>However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the President\u2019s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won\u2019t be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0ceace4b042bbfb3246be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:42:22.336Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those now wondering when we can watch the two candidates go head to head \u2013 on the same stage, at the same time, presumably answering something like the same questions \u2013 here\u2019s the schedule:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Monday 26 September, </strong>Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY.

Troop reductions in Afghanistan would not necessarily end, but their pace would be determined by ground commanders.

Liberals would find much to dispute, but a dispute could proceed on the merits of Romney\u2019s national security perspective weighed against Obama\u2019s. </p> <p>No one could ever accuse Donald Trump of being Mitt Romney. </p> <p>Before boarding the aircraft carrier turned museum USS Intrepid, Trump gave a speech on Wednesday gesturing in the direction of Republican national security orthodoxies. The army\u2019s active-duty force levels, known as \u201cend strength\u201d, ought to return to 540,000 soldiers, where they were earlier in the decade, reversing a trajectory heading <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/careers/army/2016/05/07/army-shrinks-smallest-level-since-before-world-war-ii/83875962/\">down to 450,000 by 2018</a>.

Superficially at least Romney might not have disagreed, either. That was likely the point: to reassure voters Trump possesses a baseline level of familiarity with the basics of military responsibility. </p> <p>By the evening, however, at NBC News\u2019 touted \u201cCommander-in-Chief Forum\u201d, Trump ordered off his familiar campaign menu of word salads. He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"703937ccd93adfb357da71693e0a38a4f045cc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/703937ccd93adfb357da71693e0a38a4f045cc80/0_0_4257_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump waits to be introduced at the Commander in Chief Forum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump waits to be introduced at the forum on Wednesday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. The current senior officer corps has been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d, Trump said, and were \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would consist of some parts of his still-unspecified plan and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics on a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy. </p> <p>Trump again lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, pledging a new era of US-Russian cooperation \u2013 something both Obama and George Bush attempted and failed to achieve after US and Russian interests diverged. Despite months of the Russian military\u2019s demonstrating in Syria that Putin\u2019s objective is to suppress Bashar al-Assad\u2019s domestic resistance, Trump claimed that Russia wished to defeat Isis \u201cas badly as we do\u201d. Putin might be a dictator \u2013 Trump waved away moderator Matt Lauer on this point \u2013 but he had \u201cvery strong control\u201d, he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">\u2018Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nor did Trump demonstrate greater mastery of urgent issues of US service members\u2019 health and safety. He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against women service personnel \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed-gender service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent, the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling on the Intrepid defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member. She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved this away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions \u2013 a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president. </p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience, Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Every presidential aspirant issues that boilerplate \u2013 as it elides an explanation of what the candidate thinks is worth fighting for \u2013 but Clinton\u2019s long public record, which she uses as a selling point against Trump, gives reason to doubt it. \u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not thousands of them already there.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s gestures in hawkish directions are at least predictable. Trump is something wilder, less disciplined and far less grounded. Asked about his fitness for diplomacy, Trump boasted of his disastrous meeting in Mexico last week with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in which the Mexican president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">publicly contradicted Trump\u2019s claim</a> that the two did not discuss payment for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, and which left Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/enrique-pena-nieto-donald-trump-public-relations-disaster\">diminished at home</a>.</p> <p>For all the derision Romney endured in his presidential bid, at least he never engineered a lose-lose diplomatic summit.</p>",

In the original <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fems%2Fr5707_ems_09829908-eec8-4210-b967-aacc6567463c%22\">explanatory memorandum</a> accompanying the proposed legislation, item 11 claimed a saving of $405.6m from changes to student start-up scholarships \u2013 but the sum of the annual savings, as reported, only adds to $298m.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, had to go back into the House of Representatives to correct the error. The Treasury later issued a statement saying a computational error had caused the discrepancy.</p> <p>Chalmers said on Thursday Labor\u2019s \u201ccautious and careful approach\u201d to the omnibus savings proposal had been warranted, given the $100m error.</p>"
