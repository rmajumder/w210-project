  "<p>Tom Brady clammed up last week when asked to comment on the genital-grabbing talk of his good friend Donald Trump, but on Monday he explained why he acted so evasively: because he didn\u2019t want to be a distraction to his team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/tom-brady-refuses-locker-room-talk-question-donald-trump\">Tom Brady refuses to answer question on friend Trump's genital grabbing talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week, in the wake of Trump\u2019s unpleasant boast that he could \u201cgrab women by the pussy\u201d without their consent because he was so famous, Brady was asked by a reporter at Patriots media day: \u201cTom, you have kids of your own \u2026 how would respond if your kids heard Donald Trump\u2019s version of locker-room talk?\u201d</p> <p>Brady didn\u2019t answer the question, and after a brief thank you, hurriedly left the stage. His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New England\u2019s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didn\u2019t want to create extra headlines.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is right now. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of headlines to make, and I\u2019ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. I\u2019ve been in an organization where we\u2019re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we don\u2019t do the trash-talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always thought is I don\u2019t want to be a distraction for the team. That\u2019s what my goal is. Not that there are things I\u2019ve said and done that haven\u2019t been, but you try not to be. It\u2019s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions it\u2019s even harder to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>However, Brady\u2019s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201c[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, \u2018I don\u2019t condone it\u2019 and then walk off the stage. The optics of it weren\u2019t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time he\u2019s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. I\u2019m not responsible for what comes out of my friend\u2019s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good time with him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI met him probably 15, 16 years ago,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played golf together many, many times and I\u2019ve always had a good time with him. He\u2019s been a friend of mine. He\u2019s supported our team. He\u2019s supported the Patriots. He\u2019s been on the Patriots sideline a lot. He\u2019s always called me after games to encourage me over the course of 15 years. That\u2019s kind of the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>Brady didn\u2019t reveal who he\u2019d be voting for on 8 November, but he did say he would certainly be casting his ballot. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll vote,\u201d Brady said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll talk about [my vote] after Super Tuesday or whatever it is.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Last week, the group Liberty Students Against Trump <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdLe5fbVw0d12MtiYcJCf-hLDjpr7AdiYTIkMBttqdLuTQbg/viewform\">released a statement</a> rebuking both the Republican presidential nominee and the Liberty University president, Jerry Falwell Jr. In the statement, the group notes: \u201cWe are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As for Falwell, the group argues: \u201cWhile he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.\u201d Trump is then further criticized for \u201cactively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to offer my kudos to these young evangelicals; it\u2019s <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/donald-trump-monster-gop-helped-create\">about time</a> those who <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/life/2016/03/who-is-afraid-of-donald-trump\">claim to be</a> all about morality take a stand against a racist, sexist xenophobe. </p> <p>Falwell claims to be \u201cproud of these few students for speaking their minds\u201d, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/16/falwell-jr-deepens-rift-with-anti-trump-liberty-u-students.html\">though there are reports</a> claiming he has already punished his top critic at the university for public disagreement. </p> <p>Like his daddy, Falwell wants to attach himself to powerful politicians. At what point, though, does one realize the stench of someone is too disgusting to ignore? You can\u2019t pretend to be BFFs with Jesus and sing the praises of one of Howard Stern\u2019s most notorious guests.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why I\u2019m most impressed with the Liberty student group, part of a demographic with whom I never anticipated finding common ground: their objections break with a long-established custom in which the religious right claims to have the moral high ground but is really using religion to sell the world a very rigid strain of righteousness.</p> <p>There has traditionally been little room for discernment in rightwing Christian dogma, and Jesus has not so much been a savior as he\u2019s been a weapon used to inflict guilt, fear, and shame \u2013 mostly at gay people, women who like autonomy and non-white people in general. </p> <p>I\u2019m not saying everyone has to be pro-choice, pro-marriage equality, and less anal about sex performed outside of marriage to qualify as moral \u2013 our worldviews don\u2019t have to totally align. But as far as Trump goes, anyone claiming to be for the right thing cannot be supportive of this orange monster. So to those students blasting Trump: I may not agree with you on most issues, but that gesture is one step in making you all more believable to anyone outside your orbit.</p> <p>\u201cTying yourself to a man who promotes and laughs about sexual assault and creepy, awful things like that doesn\u2019t exactly do well to advance the mission of making the teachings of Jesus Christ the center of your life,\u201d Dustin Wahl, executive director of Liberty United Against Trump, said in <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/15/trump-sexism-young-voters/\">an interview with Time</a>.</p> <p>Wahl is 21 years old and realizes Jesus probably wouldn\u2019t be co-signing for the guy who boasts about grabbing women by their pussies. Meanwhile, Falwell <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/falwell-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-59c80a2460a2#.dx8cm6gmb\">has condemned Trump\u2019s comments yet says he will still vote for him</a>. </p> <p>But his influence in American politics is on the wane. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/the-eclipse-of-white-christian-america/490724/\">With shifting demographics and a stunted message</a>, white evangelical numbers are declining. If the next generation is to try to salvage what\u2019s left of their influence in American politics, it\u2019s about time they start having a more practical version of morality.</p>",

That meant being a father \u201cdid not come naturally: the suspension of deep personal time; the giving over of yourself at any moment of the day. I was used to my work taking over my time. It was my sacred space. To have \u2018Hey! I need a ride to Billy\u2019s house,\u2019 was something it took me a while to get used to. But I have a good relationship with my kids. I wouldn\u2019t say I was perfect, but I did OK.\u201d</p> <p>He spoke, too, about how playing live had helped him cope with the depression that had struck him at intervals over the past 30 years. Playing such long sets \u2013 Springsteen routinely goes well past three hours when performing with the E Street Band \u2013 meant he would be \u201ctoo tired to be depressed. To be depressed you need to have certain amount of energy, to go hunting through the weeds. There\u2019s also a great centring element that wards off [the effects of depression].

She had not yet settled on voting for Clinton, but described the impact of the Trump tape as \u201cterrible\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think that Donald Trump is worse than anyone, so it\u2019s anyone but him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Laura Rexford, 37, offered a similar response. \u201cIf we condone what he\u2019s saying, what about that guy who raped an unconscious girl?\u201d she said, invoking the sexual assault of an unconscious woman by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/29/stanford-sex-assault-case-victim-blaming\">Stanford University swimmer</a> outside a fraternity house last year. \u201cDo Trump\u2019s comments make that OK?\u201d</p> <p>Rexford, too, is an independent who views neither major-party candidate favorably but said it would be wasting her vote not to cast a ballot for one of them. In spite of her trust issues with Clinton, she said she was beginning to lean toward her: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the ability to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Following numerous shakeups in his campaign, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">hired as his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway</a>, a Republican strategist whose background was heavy in its emphasis on helping the party communicate with female voters. Briefly, he showed signs of message discipline, bound mostly to a teleprompter in August and September, and embarking upon what his campaign described as outreach toward minorities.</p> <p>Republican operatives outside the Trump campaign said it was a shift in tone designed to make suburban women see past his inflammatory rhetoric and feel comfortable voting for him.<br></p> <p>But then came the tape. Dozens of Republican elected officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">rescinded their endorsements of Trump</a>, with some even calling upon the nominee to step aside.<br></p> <p>The New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte, one of the more vulnerable Republicans facing re-election in November, was the first to withdraw her support for Trump after the tape emerged.<br></p> <p>But her opponent, the Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan, has cast Ayotte\u2019s decision to renounce Trump as one of \u201cpolitical calculation\u201d. \u201cShe stood by Donald Trump as he not only insulted women, but insulted a Gold Star family [who lost a son in the Iraq War], insulted people with disabilities,\u201d Hassan said on Wednesday after touring a pin manufacturing plant in Ayotte\u2019s hometown of Nashua.</p> <p>Hassan also seized upon Ayotte\u2019s response, in a debate just days before the release of the tape, when asked if Trump was a role model. After stumbling around her answer, Ayotte said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d was \u2013 a characterization she immediately retracted, but not before the damage had been done.</p> <p>Ayotte held her own conversation with reporters in Manchester on Wednesday, after attending a ceremony for fallen police officers. On a television screen behind her, an attack ad by Hassan tied her to Trump while featuring her \u201crole model\u201d comment.<br></p> <p>Ayotte, who spent much of the last year condemning Trump\u2019s statements, said she made the decision to revoke her support \u201cas a matter of principle\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s more important to me than winning an election,\u201d the senator said.</p> <p>Clinton holds a five-point edge over Trump in New Hampshire based on <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-president-trump-vs-clinton\">the Huffington Post\u2019s pollster model</a>, which takes an average of publicly available surveys.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.uml.edu/docs/TOPLINE%20-%20UMassLowell-7NEWS%20NH%20GENERAL%2020161013_tcm18-262711.pdf\">UMass Lowell/7 News poll</a> released in the wake of Trump\u2019s offensive tape found that more than four in five likely New Hampshire voters had either heard his comments or discussed them with others. While 66% said it did not make a difference, 30% said they were less likely to vote for Trump \u2013 with women more inclined than men to drop their support for the Republican nominee.<br></p> <p>Trump has spent the past week waging scorched earth warfare against the Republican lawmakers who spurned him, while also seeking to discredit the women who have accused him of sexual assault. He has also insulted the physical appearance of some of his accusers and questioned their motivations for coming forward now.</p> <p>While it\u2019s improbable that Trump\u2019s base would alone be enough to carry him over the finish line on 8 November, it may be all that he has.<br></p> <p>As dusk fell upon the historic downtown of Nashua, Jean and Lise Parent, a married couple, were wrapping up the day inside their property management office. The window was adorned with Halloween cobwebs and spiders and a sign in support of the Republican nominee: \u201cThe silent majority stands with Trump.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cIf a woman waits 30 years to come and say a story like that \u2026\u201d Lise, 69, said of the sexual assault allegations against Trump.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d her husband Jean, 73, interjected.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d Lise continued. \u201cShe\u2019s getting paid for it.

In February, Iowa held its caucuses, marking the traditional start to the primary process whereby each party chooses its candidate for president. Trump came second, losing to the Texas senator Ted Cruz. No one was very surprised. Cruz is a Christian conservative, and Iowa\u2019s Republicans often pick Christian conservatives. Trump was a thrice-married New Yorker more familiar with mammon than with God. But to Trump there could be only one explanation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694879900256354304\">\u201cTed Cruz didn\u2019t win Iowa, he stole it,\u201d</a> Trump tweeted. \u201cThat is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!\u201d Forty-five minutes later, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694890328273346560\">tweeted again</a>: \u201cBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec3918044c146e5be6dbf464107176bfac0ad82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3918044c146e5be6dbf464107176bfac0ad82d/0_0_1522_2048/743.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His assorted bankruptcies and collapses were never his fault\u2019 ... the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, one of the Republican candidate\u2019s many expensive failures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted Thai/Life Images Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The basis of this claim was a release by the Cruz campaign falsely notifying Iowans that rival conservative candidate Ben Carson had dropped out of the race and urging Carson supporters to back Cruz instead. It might have been an innocent mistake or perhaps a dirty trick, typical of primary season. Either way, it was enough to allow Trump to claim he was robbed \u2013 and to give the US a glimpse of Trump\u2019s modus operandi. When he loses, he claims immediately that the game is rigged.</p> <p>He\u2019s doing it again now. His current stump speech alternates between claiming that the women accusing him of sexual assault were too unattractive for him to abuse and warning his supporters that the Democrats and the press are colluding to steal the presidency from him. As he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787699930718695425\">tweeted on Sunday</a>: \u201cThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary \u2013 but also at many polling places \u2013 SAD.\u201d</p> <p>Some Democrats take a kind of perverse comfort in the fact that Trump is banging this drum again. It\u2019s a sure sign he thinks he\u2019s losing. (The last time he talked of ballot rigging was in August, when Hillary Clinton opened up a big lead.) It seems to be his way of getting his excuses in early, ensuring that no one brands him a loser on 9 November.</p> <p>Trump might also be laying the ground for a post-election career in which he sets himself up as the champion of a diehard Trumpian rump within the Republican party or perhaps as the head of a new media empire \u2013 Trump News Network \u2013 that will outflank Fox News on the hard right. Either way, he understands that there is no more potent variety of political rocketfuel than a righteous sense of grievance. Trump is priming those who are now crying \u201cLock her up!\u201d to bellow \u201cWe was robbed!\u201d</p> <p>But this comes at a cost that has made plenty of Americans \u2013 Republicans among them \u2013 anxious. Central to the self-image of the US is its status as a self-governing democracy. Election fraud is meant to be something that happens in other countries, with the US casting itself as monitor or even referee, determining which overseas ballots are free, fair and legitimate. Trump\u2019s claims, pre-emptively challenging the integrity of a presidential election, seek to upend that notion, challenging the legitimacy of America\u2019s own system. And they seem to be striking a chord: one survey released on Monday found that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/poll-41-percent-of-voters-say-the-election-could-be-stolen-from-trump-229871\">41% of Americans</a> believe the election could be stolen from Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e78ed80d246e2a53543c14062d086807c65ceab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e78ed80d246e2a53543c14062d086807c65ceab9/0_0_4700_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporter outside the CNN building in Hollywood, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If Trump wants to claim media bias in this election, he could make a strong case that the bias has been in his favour\u2019 \u2013 a Trump supporter outside the CNN building in Hollywood, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the US\u2019s view of itself, this is not uncharted terrain. <a href=\"http://dailysignal.com/2016/08/08/rigged-election-a-history-of-presidential-candidates-whove-made-allegations/\">Claims of rigged contests have surfaced before</a>. In 1824, a narrow race was settled when the House of Representatives made John Quincy Adams president; partisans suspected behind-the-scenes dealmaking. In 1876, a similar dead heat left supporters of Samuel J Tilden furious when he won the popular vote but was denied the presidency thanks to the arcane mechanics of the electoral college. Amid allegations of multiple voting and shredded ballots, the incumbent president Ulysses Grant warned \u2013 in words that resonate today \u2013 that \u201ceither party can afford to be disappointed by the result, but the country cannot afford to have the result tainted by suspicion of illegal or false returns\u201d.</p> <p>More recently, some Republicans remained convinced that John F Kennedy was helped to his narrow victory over Richard Nixon in 1960 by ballot-tampering involving the mafia in Chicago, which helped him win the crucial state of Illinois. But what makes Trump\u2019s challenge different is that he is contesting the election before it has happened. This has made many fearful that the fury Trump is stoking could get out of control. They worry that, should the reality TV star lose, things could get violent. They point to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheriffClarke/status/787314656641712128\">tweet posted on Saturday by David Clarke Jr</a>, a vocal Trump supporter and the sheriff of Milwaukee county in Wisconsin. Alongside a picture of an angry mob wielding weapons, Clarke wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ [Department of Justice], and big media are corrupt &amp; all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.\u201d In this climate, what if one crucial state is particularly close? Few have forgotten the photo-finish in Florida in 2000. How would such deadlock play out in this atmosphere?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c04b57b6ef6d89f47317acaf6fcbd0f80972eace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c04b57b6ef6d89f47317acaf6fcbd0f80972eace/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Some Republicans remained convinced that John F Kennedy was helped to his narrow victory over Richard Nixon in 1960 by ballot-tampering involving the mafia in Chicago.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Clark/Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because this is the US, no talk of election rigging can be separated from race. When Trump tells mainly white crowds <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/01/trump-urges-supporters-to-monitor-polling-places-in-certain-areas/\">to spend election day monitoring voting</a> in areas other than their own \u201cbecause of you know what I\u2019m talking about\u201d, he is repeating, in the thinnest code, his accusation that Democrats will bulk up their vote by fraudulently inflating the numbers in African-American or other minority communities.</p> <p>The hint is certainly not lost on his supporters. Witness the words of one Trump enthusiast, a 61-year-old carpenter in the crucial battleground state of Ohio by the name of Steve Webb. \u201cTrump said to watch your precincts. I\u2019m going to go, for sure,\u201d he told the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/10/15/donald-trump-warnings-conspiracy-rig-election-are-stoking-anger-among-his-followers/LcCY6e0QOcfH8VdeK9UdsM/story.html\">Boston Globe this weekend</a>. \u201cI\u2019ll look for ... well, it\u2019s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can\u2019t speak American ... I\u2019m going to go right up behind them. I\u2019ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I\u2019m not going to do anything illegal. I\u2019m going to make them a little bit nervous.\u201d</p> <p>It will comes as little surprise to those who have paid even the slightest attention to the post-truth campaign of Donald Trump that these claims of voter fraud and ballot rigging are almost entirely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">fact-free and lacking in evidence</a>. One legal scholar dedicated years to studying the issue and could find only 31 cases of voter fraud out of more than a billion votes cast. As the ThinkProgress thinktank <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-claims-polling-places-are-rigged-12ba70beb551#.bk0wz8ix8\">has noted</a>: \u201cIowa\u2019s Republican secretary of state uncovered zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls during a two-year investigation.\u201d Even the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/16/election-rigged-not/\">hard right Breitbart website</a> \u2013 so close to Trump that its boss, Steve Bannon, is the chief executive of the Trump campaign \u2013 had to admit that, \u201cgiven the sheer variety of jurisdictions that run a typical presidential election, the nationwide effect of voter fraud may be much harder to measure, and probably small\u201d.</p> <p>Conceding that point, Breitbart then attempted to redefine \u201crigged\u201d away from the mechanics of ballot-stuffing and the like and on to the terrain of media bias. If the election is being stolen from Trump, runs the argument, it\u2019s because the press is, in effect, acting as an ally of Clinton by being so hostile to the Republican nominee. Just look at the chorus of women assembled by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Palm Beach Post and People magazine last week, all of whom alleged that had Trump sexually assaulted them. Surely that represents a coordinated attack, weeks before election day, designed to damage Trump and help Clinton?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4842ee22fdb6878bf26154efe5838a156fe99c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4842ee22fdb6878bf26154efe5838a156fe99c/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supports at a Hillary Clinton event in Miami, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supports at a Hillary Clinton event in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristobal Herrera/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s a perilously thin argument, for the media all but created the Donald Trump candidacy. During the primary campaign, they lavished attention and airtime on him in a way that squeezed out all his rivals. He only had to pick up the phone to be on the air with Fox or MSNBC, a privilege not extended to Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. His rallies were carried live and at length; theirs were lucky to get a 10-second clip. One study showed that while Bush spent tens of millions on TV ads, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">Trump got $2bn-worth of airtime absolutely free</a>.</p> <p>But it was more than just quantity. The media allowed Trump to get away with lies they would have stamped on had Clinton been the culprit. For example, in recent weeks, Trump has been challenged on his wholly false claim to have opposed the invasion of Iraq. (At the time, he told shockjock Howard Stern on the record that he approved of it.) But, for many months, the supposedly liberal media, especially television, allowed him to get away with that fiction. If Trump wants to claim media bias in this election, he could make a strong case that the bias has been in his favour.</p> <p>The other limb of the \u201crigged\u201d argument is that the forces of Hillary have already fixed one contest this election season, corruptly engineering the Democratic primary race to defeat Bernie Sanders. There\u2019s no doubt that the rules \u2013 and the power given to party officials as \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 favoured Clinton, nor that Clinton had much of the party machine on her side. That\u2019s why Sanders, who wasn\u2019t even a Democrat a year before he sought the nomination \u2013 he sits in the Senate as an independent \u2013 was always the underdog. But even the most diligent hacking of Democrats\u2019 emails \u2013 undertaken, the FBI believes, by Russian intelligence and released in recent days by WikiLeaks \u2013 has not produced evidence that Sanders was defrauded of the nomination, rather than simply being outmuscled.</p> <p>Indeed, you could make a decent case that an attempt to rig the 2016 election is underway \u2013 one designed to hurt Clinton and help Trump. WikiLeaks would be a key exhibit in that case. Julian Assange has been consistent in leaking documents that embarrass the Democratic nominee, yet strangely reluctant to publish any paperwork that might discomfort Trump. You would have thought WikiLeaks might have been able to produce the elusive Trump tax returns, for example, but no luck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aefd75b63026831ca1f54e46a27b26d41dc5868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aefd75b63026831ca1f54e46a27b26d41dc5868/285_0_4087_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018During the primary campaign ... he only had to pick up the phone to be on the air with Fox or MSNBC.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You would put the media in the dock, too, replaying all the softball interviews <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-08/nbcs-matt-lauer-receives-bad-reviews-for-his-forum-with-clinton-and-trump\">Trump has been granted</a> \u2013 glossing over his multiple lies, his bankruptcies and his overt bigotries \u2013 while Clinton was grilled again and again over her use of a private email server. But your argument would not need to end there. You would also look at what\u2019s actually set to happen \u2013 and already happening \u2013 at the heart of the matter: the ballot itself.</p> <p>There is a mountain of evidence, going back years, of voter suppression: the deliberate exclusion of large groups of voters from the electoral rolls. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-gops-stealth-war-against-voters-w435890\">Rolling Stone magazine has reported</a> on a programme designed to purge rolls of voters wrongly eligible to vote in more than one state. It sounds technical, but it just so happens that the programme \u201cdisproportionately threatens solid Democratic constituencies: young, black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters \u2013 with some of the biggest possible purges underway in Ohio and North Carolina, two crucial swing states with tight Senate races.\u201d</p> <p>Few have been more vigilant on this subject than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ariberman\">Ari Berman</a>, the author of Give us the Ballot: the Struggle for Voting Rights in America. Every week, he brings word of another scheme by Republican authorities at state level \u2013 and, remember, Republicans are in charge in most of the 50 states \u2013 to suppress voting among those likely to vote Democratic. Recently, he reported on Wisconsin\u2019s failure to issue <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/wisconsin-is-systematically-failing-to-provide-the-photo-ids-required-to-vote-in-november/\">voter-identification documents</a> to people who needed them, a failure that disproportionately affects black voters. Some of his revelations are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriBerman/status/785894221349650432\">jaw-dropping</a>, among them the story of an Indian-American woman, a US citizen since she was eight years old, who was told she had to spend $345 on naturalisation papers just to be able to exercise her right to vote.</p> <p>Every four years there are incidents like this, such as polling places in African-American areas with too few voting machines, causing long lines. Were that not enough of a deterrent to voting, this year \u2013 thanks to Trump\u2019s call for groups of vigilante polling monitors to take up their positions in urban areas \u2013 plenty of minority voters might well feel intimidated as well as simply put off.</p> <p>So, Democrats could cry foul if they wanted to. They have the recent memory of Florida 2000, when Republican state officials stood in the way of a thorough recount, ensuring that George W Bush held on to a razor-thin lead. They could also point to Ohio 2004, where questions linger <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2005/11/recounting-ohio\">over Bush\u2019s defeat of John Kerry</a>.</p> <p>But most who cherish US democracy choose not to go there. They prefer to defend the integrity of the system. They know the peril that could befall the republic if nearly half the country believe the person occupying the White House is there fraudulently. Yet that is precisely the chaos Trump is seeking to create. He is proving that Donald Trump represents a threat to the stability of the US even if he loses. But we should remember: he never loses.</p>",

  "<p>A cook. An ornament. And perhaps something else depending on the mood. During a recent press conference with the German chancellor Angela Merkel, Nigeria\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, was clearly miffed at being asked about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37642282\">criticism of his government\u2019s performance</a> by his wife, Aisha Buhari. He responded by reminding Nigeria\u2019s first lady where her place was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/nigerias-president-says-wife-belongs-to-my-kitchen\">in his kitchen, his living room and \u201cthe other room\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/nigerias-president-says-wife-belongs-to-my-kitchen\">Nigeria's president says wife 'belongs to my kitchen'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been a lot of media focus on male entitlement and the treatment of women in recent weeks. From the former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 the outwardly gentlemanly Ben Carson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-37661793\">who sought to silence a female journalist</a> asking a question he found annoying \u2013 to the proudly abrasive Donald Trump, who obviously has no regard for women. In between these high-profile examples are the countless women whose voices are lost, silenced or taken away from them in societies such as Nigeria where there is less media and societal focus on gender equality.</p> <p>While Buhari\u2019s statement was swiftly excused by his spokesman as a joke, the issue of a woman\u2019s place in contemporary society hardly seems comedy material for a president. Besides, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsPvZbq912s\">a later interview</a> Buhari boldly reiterated his stance, saying his wife\u2019s most important duty was to \u201clook after\u201d him and the home \u201ceven if she\u2019s working\u201d. The sad truth is that while the Nigerian president\u2019s comments could be dismissed as the rantings of a 73-year-old with outdated views, in reality his statements accurately reflect widely held beliefs in a stubbornly patriarchal society.</p> <p>His comments came just three days after the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/girlchild/background.shtml\">International Day of the Girl Child</a>, meant to focus on the plight of disadvantaged girls all over the world. Unicef statistics <a href=\"http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UNICEF-Child-Marriage-Brochure-High-Single_246.pdf\">reveal</a> Nigeria is home to the largest number of child brides in Africa, with 23 million girls and women having been <a href=\"http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/212730-katsina-emirate-says-marriage-abducted-14-year-old-emirs-aide-irreversible.html\">married in childhood</a>.

No woman has ever been elected governor in any of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, a female president or even vice-president remains unimaginable to most. Leadership is generally not associated with women. This sad reality is all the more reason Buhari should realise there are concrete implications for how his words could affect the aspirations of young Nigerian girls.</p> <p>Buhari, standing beside Merkel, one of the most prominent leaders in the world, who also happens to be a woman, squandered the opportunity to send a positive message to young Nigerian girls on the achievable. Furthermore, his assertion that his wife\u2019s major role is to \u201clook after\u201d him serves to validate the widespread perception in Nigerian society that women exist merely to make men\u2019s lives easier.</p> <p>As is often the case in strongly patriarchal societies, many women have internalised the male point of view and accepted it as common sense. On social media, some Nigerian women have even condemned Buhari\u2019s wife for daring to criticise him in public, saying she should stand by her man no matter what, the way Hillary Clinton did.</p> <p>Such logic is mind-boggling as these women fail to see Buhari\u2019s statements have wider-reaching implications that affect them as well. Whether they agree with Aisha Buhari\u2019s political views or not does not detract from the underlying disdain for a woman who dared to speak contentiously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any idea of feminism is still viewed very suspiciously in Nigeria \u2013 even by women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any idea of feminism is still viewed very suspiciously in Nigeria \u2013 even by women. I know some very well-educated professional females who view feminism as a western ideology aiming to usurp the rightful dominant role of the man in society. These women are sometimes highly successful in the corporate or business world, but still believe that once they get home, they need to dance around their husbands, be it in the kitchen or \u201cthe other room\u201d, just to keep them happy. I also know hardworking, uneducated women who do strenuous, grimy jobs outside the home and also undertake a second or even a third shift in the home, again, to keep the man happy. They believe this is their duty as women. I know many women who absolutely hate cooking, yet they do it out of fear they would be considered bad wives by society if they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>What\u2019s important to remember is that however Nigerians choose to interpret Buhari\u2019s comments, behind such statements that demean and relegate women to positions of servitude is a woman or girl belittled. The statements of the most powerful man in the country also have an impact on how millions of impressionable boys will tailor their expectations of women. Millions of Nigerian girls struggle every day to find their place in a male-dominated society where they are constantly told they need to stifle and adapt their dreams to the expectations of an unashamedly patriarchal society. The last thing they need are flippant statements from their president.</p>",

  "<p>In any other election year, a massive battle involving US force to seize a city of hundreds of thousands from the Islamic State might affect how voters choose their next president. But 2016, defense analysts and political advisers observing the mid-October campaign for Mosul point out, is no normal election year.<br></p> <p>Two years after senior US officers described the fight for Mosul as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/12/politics/isis-baghdad-martin-dempsey/\">decisive</a>\u201d \u2013 something experts have become wary of predicting in Iraq \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/us-lloyd-austin-iraq-emphasis-airstrikes-isis-syria-kobani\">frequently delayed </a>battle for Iraq\u2019s second city is under way. Should Iraqi ground forces and US warplanes prove successful, Isis will lose its final stronghold in the country.</p> <p>The fight is expected to be the toughest in Iraq since Isis conquered the city in June 2014. Isis is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/last-battle-against-isis-in-iraq-forces-mass-for-mosul-assault\">6,000 fighters</a> prepared for close urban combat. The US military\u2019s spokesman for the war called Mosul \u201cby far the largest challenge the [Iraqis] have undertaken to date\u201d, far outstripping the battles to retake Ramadi and Fallujah in 2015 and 2016. Already civilians are fleeing the northern Iraqi city, and the United Nations is bracing for <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/battle-mosul-aid-agencies-warn-humanitarian-disaster-241710471\">as many as 1 million refugees</a>.</p> <p>The American public is expected to pay minimal attention.</p> <p>\u201cCompared to domestic issues, the electorate doesn\u2019t really care very much about this and probably is not following what\u2019s going on in Mosul in particular,\u201d said Steven Simon, who was mideast director for Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council from 2011 to 2012.</p> <p>The election calendar has been a factor in previous wars, even previous wars in Iraq. Only after George W Bush secured reelection in 2004 did the second battle of Fallujah unfold. But this time, according to a former Iraq adviser to both George W Bush and Obama, the differences between the second and third US wars in Iraq overwhelm their similarities, as do their electoral implications.</p> <p>While the US is providing a significant advisory presence for the Iraqi military, as well as a special-operations presence in the shadows, its primary combat contribution is aerial. With Iraqi forces on the ground doing the bleeding and dying, the American public does not consider the Iraq issue urgent, despite anxieties about the group known as Isis, Isil or Daesh featuring significantly in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not a divisive issue. There\u2019s not a huge lobby in the US for not having the Iraqis fight Isil in Iraq,\u201d said Doug Ollivant, a former NSC staffer and army veteran of the second Iraq war, who discloses that he has business interests in southern Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the two candidates would tell you they probably approach the battle of Mosul differently, I don\u2019t think anyone takes this seriously. There are not going to be, at least, many publicly acknowledged Americans directly involved, so it\u2019s difficult for me to see this taking a turn that has a significant impact on the presidential election.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Trump were arguing to do nothing, then a protracted campaign would help him.

There\u2019s always a certain number like that \u2013 but I\u2019ve never seen it like this, and my first election was 1968.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-vp-debate\">Trump and Clinton return to center stage after lackluster VP debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI would say that more than half of our customers are what I call \u2018Trumpets\u2019,\u201d Sanguinetti said. \u201cWhich is unusual, because many of our customers are socio-economically challenged \u2013 dollars are short for them, and they typically vote Democrat.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of anger, he said, likening the feeling to Britain\u2019s Brexit vote.</p> <p>Charles Bland, a construction worker and Republican precinct captain in Washoe, seemed exhausted defending his candidate. \u201cI think the things he says have been twisted to seem offensive,\u201d he said, speaking to the Guardian before Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-vp-debate\">spoke to a fired-up crowd</a> of several thousand at the Reno/Sparks convention center last week.</p> <p>\u201cHe says things that Americans feel,\u201d said Bland, who had brought his young grandson to the rally. \u201cThey\u2019re tired of everything being politically correct.\u201d He said he had seen a lot of lifelong Democrats shift their allegiance to Trump for the first time.<br></p> <p>Clinton currently holds a razor-thin lead of just 1.2% in Nevada, according to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nv/nevada_trump_vs_clinton-5891.html\">RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling average</a>. A poll by Emerson University and conducted between October 4 and 8, putting the two candidates at a dead heat on 43% each, though a new GOP poll conducted October 11-12 showing Clinton with a six point lead implies that recent allegations of sexual assault made against Trump may be hurting him; early voting begins here in just over a week, on October 22.</p> <p>The so-called rurals, which is the term loosely used by locals to mean everywhere outside of Clark and Washoe counties \u2013 within which lie Las Vegas and Reno/Sparks, and therefore most of the state\u2019s population \u2013 are as solidly Republican as can be. </p> <p>There is a way it plays out, one Republican party insider said, in which Washoe County would be the fulcrum on which the whole election balances.</p> <p>\u201cThis county makes all the difference in the world for the state,\u201d said Kim Bacchus, the president of the Northern Nevada Republican Women\u2019s Pac. \u201cThe rurals are always solidly conservative; Clark County, with two thirds of our population, is fairly solidly Democrat. So \u2026 Washoe County has always been the determiner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is Washoe a big deal for the presidential election?\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause without Washoe County, Trump loses. Period.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, Washoe County went blue, voting for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a slim margin of around 6,000 votes. But since then, the town has seen an influx of people moving in along the I-80 corridor from California, many of them conservatives looking to escape the Golden State\u2019s liberal politics. In other parts of town, attitudes toward Washington DC have degraded from distrust to contempt.</p> <p>The polarization is especially glaring within the Republican party. The Washoe County party is barely on speaking terms with the state party, insiders told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s October of a presidential election year and they\u2019re doing nothing to elect candidates,\u201d Bacchus said of the county party.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t raise money, have no message, they have no volunteers, they have no plan for getting the vote out, they\u2019re doing nothing. It\u2019s just a little club, and they have a little clubhouse to meet in until they run out of money for rent,\u201d she continued. </p> <p>Her Pac deals with the candidates directly now; she circumvents the county party entirely. Many others do the same. \u201cSome Democrats I talk to say \u2018I\u2019m just not gonna vote for that candidate,\u2019\u201d Bacchus said. \u201cSome Republicans I speak to say the same \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not gonna vote for that candidate.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cPeople are sick of politics,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As for Sanguinetti, the manager of Duds and Suds, his disgust with the toxicity of 2016\u2019s political discourse has driven him, for the first time in his life, to abandon mainstream politics entirely. He\u2019s planning on voting Libertarian in November.</p>",

As we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal with tensions that have boiled over since <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> last Friday night backed his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyer <strong>Kimberley Kitching</strong>, to replace the departing <strong>Stephen Conroy</strong>.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to run the veteran leftwing powerbroker, <strong>Kim Carr</strong>, off the front bench. Folks aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench after the election.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call that a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor caucus.</p> <p>It appears to have done exactly that. <strong>Gavin Marshall</strong> (a long time Carr ally) decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He named <strong>Andrew Giles</strong> and <strong>Catherine King</strong>, the shadow health minister. </p> <p>Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the front bench. Clearly he\u2019s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a vent about people he views as being disloyal.</p> <p>The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight\u2019s special caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things escalate.<br></p> <p>We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared.<strong> Bill Shorten is the leader of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional fellow travellers).</strong><br></p> <p>That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy\u2019s departure. The caucus is something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it isn\u2019t. <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> once talked about exciting times. Seems, they are catching.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T07:06:52.933Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58046ba7e4b01ffb8ffcc70b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T06:12:49.816Z\">7.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Xenophon to Abbott on 18c: no, no and no</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> has responded to <strong>Tony Abbott</strong>\u2019s suggestion that changes to section 18C would \u201creadily\u201d pass if the Nick Xenophon Team supported them.<br></p> <p>Asked if his party was considering supporting a change, Xenophon told Guardian Australia: \u201cthe answer is no, no and no.

  "<p>If Donald Trump should win the presidency it would represent a threat to press freedom, <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2016/10/cpj-chairman-says-trump-is-threat-to-press-freedom.php\">says the Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ).</p> <p>The US-based press freedom watchdog has taken what it calls \u201can unprecedented step\u201d by issuing a statement by the chair of its board, Sandra Mims Rowe, in which she accuses Trump of consistently betraying first amendment values.</p> <p>Earlier this month, said the statement, CPJ\u2019s board of directors passed a resolution declaring Trump to be a \u201cthreat to the rights of journalists and to CPJ\u2019s ability to advocate for press freedom around the world\u201d. It continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the beginning of his candidacy, Trump has insulted and vilified the press and has made his opposition to the media a centrepiece of his campaign. Trump has routinely labelled the press as \u2018dishonest\u2019 and \u2018scum\u2019 and singled out individual news organisations and journalists.</p> </blockquote> <p>It recalled that Trump, the Republican candidate, \u201cmocked a disabled New York Times journalist and called an ABC News reporter a \u2018sleaze\u2019 in a press conference\u201d. </p> <p>It also stated that Trump had refused to condemn attacks on journalists by his supporters while his campaign team had \u201csystematically denied press credentials to outlets that have covered him critically\u201d.</p> <p>Rowe\u2019s statement mentioned the rally in Texas in February, in which Trump pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">\u201copen up our libel laws so when [newspapers] write purposely negative stories</a>\u2026 we can sue them and make lots of money\u201d.</p> <p>In September, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/777280259875975169\">Trump tweeted</a>: \u201cMy lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching\u201d.</p> <p>The CPJ statement said: \u201cWhile some have suggested that these statements are rhetorical, we take Trump at his word. His intent and his disregard for the constitutional free press principle are clear\u201d.</p> <p>It believed a Trump presidency would have a negative effect on press freedom outside the United States, arguing that any failure by the US to uphold its own standards <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2016/05/why-trumps-insults-of-journalists-must-be-taken-se.php\">would embolden despotic leaders</a> to restrict the media in their own countries. The statement concluded: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Through his words and actions, Trump has consistently demonstrated a contempt for the role of the press beyond offering publicity to him and advancing his interests... </p> <p>This is not about picking sides in an election. This is recognising that a Trump presidency represents a threat to press freedom unknown in modern history.</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement was issued before Trump implied that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/trump-groping-accusations-new-york-times-rally\">the New York Times was part of a Mexican conspiracy to undermine him.</a></p> <p>This was the \u201clogic\u201d of his claim: \u201cThe largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim [who]... comes from Mexico.

The Chinese believe the US has emboldened Manila to challenge China and has been instrumental in pulling the US into South China Sea issues. If China can successful defuse some of the tensions with the Philippines \u2026 then I think the Chinese hope they can reduce US involvement in the South China Sea.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Bisley, an international relations professor from Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University, said that for all the \u201csurface-level fireworks\u201d surrounding the Philippines\u2019 president, he was in fact a pragmatic politician who would travel to China with clearly defined domestic objectives. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going into this thinking he is some sort of Kissinger of the south Pacific.\u201d</p> <p>Rather, Duterte was hoping to secure billions of dollars of much-needed investment to address a looming infrastructure crisis. \u201cHe sees China as a pretty likely source of that.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s trip is the strongest hint yet of a stunning diplomatic volte-face towards China from the Philippines. </p> <p>In recent years the two countries repeatedly clashed over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, with Beijing reacting furiously in 2014 after Duterte\u2019s predecessor, Benigno Aquino, compared its activities in the region to Nazi Germany\u2019s expansionism. </p> <p>\u201cAt what point do you say, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019? Well, the world has to say it \u2013 remember that the Sudetenland was given in an attempt to appease Hitler to prevent world war two,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/asia/philippine-leader-urges-international-help-in-resisting-chinas-sea-claims.html?_r=0\">he told the New York Times</a>. </p> <p>In July, just weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/rodrigo-duterte-sworn-in-as-philippines-president-extends-olive-branch-to-elites\">Duterte\u2019s landslide election victory</a>, an international tribunal issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">a thorough rebuttal</a> of China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea when it ruled on a case originally brought by the Philippines government, in 2013. </p> <p>But Duterte \u2013 who has described his trip to China as \u201ca key turning point in both our histories\u201d \u2013 has not pressed Beijing over the tribunal\u2019s ruling, apparently seeking to use that verdict as leverage with which to extract concessions from Beijing.</p> <p>Last week he instructed the country\u2019s navy <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/824760/duterte-determined-to-stop-joint-patrols-in-south-china-sea\">to halt joint patrols of the South China Sea</a> with the US in order to avoid \u201cany Philippine action that China might deem hostile\u201d.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KtLTXXej8\">interview last week</a> with al-Jazeera, Duterte said that during his visit he would fight to maintain islands in the South China Sea.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is going to give up anything there,\u201d he said, adding that under the constitution, a president cannot give away Philippine ground.</p> <p>But he added that although he would raise the Hague tribunal verdict, he could not be forceful. \u201cWe have this judgment. I can go into a rage because it\u2019s being occupied ... the other [option] is to talk. What do you think will happen to my country if I choose to go to war?\u201d he said. \u201cWe can only talk.\u201d </p> <p>Experts say Duterte will seek billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese investment to bankroll projects including as <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/128807-duterte-railway-systems-china-legacy\">an ambitious network of rail links</a>.</p> <p>Francis Chua, the head of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/824775/big-business-group-to-join-duterte-in-china\">told the Inquirer</a> he would seek to \u201creawaken\u201d dormant trade ties with Beijing. He said: \u201cWe expect to have a bounty of business opportunities from this visit, especially with a president willing to explore the limits of a fruitful partnership with China.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte is also expected to press for Filipino fishermen to be allowed to fish around the Scarborough Shoal, a disputed area in the South China Sea. </p> <p>Bisley said it was crucial the president could return from China with tangible achievements to show voters. </p> <p>\u201cHe needs to have face in this whole thing. He can\u2019t come back to the Philippines looking like he\u2019s gone on bended knee and he\u2019s got all these gifts but is really a Chinese cat\u2019s paw,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Bisley said he believed Washington had been \u201cgenuinely surprised\u201d by Duterte\u2019s actions since taking office but cautioned that a permanent shift towards Beijing was far from guaranteed. </p> <p>\u201cIt is still really early days. He\u2019s three months in and he moves around a lot. It could well be that if he feels slighted in Beijing for whatever reason \u2013 if he feels it doesn\u2019t go his way \u2013 he could easily just come back to Manila and pretend it all hasn\u2019t happened and tell everybody how much he loves America. You can\u2019t rule that out.\u201d</p>",
