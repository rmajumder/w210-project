  "<p>Washington and Moscow are engaged in a new standoff over Syria, and this time it has gone beyond words. The US has broken off talks and recalled its negotiators from Geneva. Russia, meanwhile, has suspended an agreement on the destruction of plutonium, setting conditions \u2013 including an end to Ukraine-related sanctions \u2013 for the resumption of the accord.</p> <p>Cue doom-mongers, mostly on the western side, warning that US-Russia relations are every bit as bad as they were during the darkest days of the cold war, with corresponding dangers for everyone else. Some, indeed, would argue that the risks are greater still, because the restraint forced by the prospect of \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d and any formal framework for contact are both missing.</p> <p>Of course, the return to hostilities in and around Aleppo is a catastrophe for those on the ground and a fresh setback for those trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Where US-Russian relations are concerned, however, there are reasons to take a less apocalyptic view, and the same applies to the wider consequences.</p> <p>If the fiercest measure the US has taken is to break off somewhat fitful talks on Syria, and the strongest response Russia has chosen to offer is the suspension of a single arms agreement that Moscow anyway accuses Washington of breaking, that says a lot in itself. It could reflect how little the two countries currently have to talk about, in which case a break makes little difference. Or, more likely, it shows their concern to spare other areas of cooperation, such as wider arms control or the space station. Indeed, the US said talks about avoiding bilateral clashes in Syria would continue, while the conditions Moscow has set for resuming the plutonium deal suggest it is open to bargaining even as it stamps its foot.</p> <p>To an extent both sides are playing to their domestic galleries. This is an often neglected aspect of many a diplomatic spat, but it is especially true of this one. The US is in the grip of a highly unusual presidential campaign that has barely a month to run. While Barack Obama is not running, the charges of foreign policy weakness levelled against him, not just by Donald Trump and the Republicans but by some on his own side, are a factor in the campaign. It is important for Obama and his legacy, but still more so for Hillary Clinton\u2019s prospects, that the Democratic administration does not appear spineless \u2013 especially not before its old Russian foe.</p> <p>President Putin, for his part, has to attend to national morale in the face of the first fall in living standards for many Russians since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is judged to be such as risk that there is talk he could bring forward the presidential election to next year. Neither he nor his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, can afford to play too nice with the Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/aleppo-syria-war-humanitarian-crisis-un\">'Syria is bleeding': Aleppo facing war's worst humanitarian crisis, UN says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is another reason why the health or otherwise of US-Russia relations should not be judged exclusively by their talks about Syria: to believe that the two countries are capable of ending the conflict in Syria is to believe that the cold war continues, and that every war is a proxy superpower war.</p> <p>We are living in different times, and Syria is not a cold war-era conflict. It is wider than that, with many different proxies involved, and loyalties shifting to and fro; it is also narrower, in the sense that the only settlement that will stick must be acceptable to the people who live there. Outside powers cannot force a peace so long as the parties to the dispute believe they still have ground to gain.</p> <p>If the conflict has demonstrated anything, it is that neither erstwhile superpower has the clout to control its clients on the ground. The latest ceasefire failed not only because the US mistakenly bombed a contingent of Syrian troops, and not only because an aid convoy was destroyed, but because the sponsors of the deal \u2013 the US and Russia \u2013 were unable to control what happened next.</p> <p>The US clearly cannot marshal its so-called moderates, and may not even be quite sure who they are. Something similar applies to Putin and Assad. From the wording of the US state department\u2019s announcement on breaking off talks, it would appear that even Washington is starting to accept that Putin cannot just switch Assad on or off.</p> <p>There may well still be diehards \u2013 in the Pentagon, perhaps, and the Russian ministry of defence \u2014 who believe the world is still theirs to fight over and divide up between them. The failed ceasefire illustrated something different: that US-Russian sponsorship is no longer enough.</p> <p>For any ceasefire in Syria to endure, let alone any settlement, either many more parties will have to be involved as sponsors \u2013 including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey \u2013 or the Syrians themselves will have to call a halt. That may not happen until there is a victor.</p> <p>This is not a palatable thought. But it may be the case that the US-Russian peace efforts in Syria have to be seen as a laudable effort, but one that was ultimately doomed to fail. Not because the US and Russia could not agree, but because an old-style superpower deal is no longer enough. This may not be good news for Syria, but it does mean it need not be the sole gauge of US-Russian relations. There are hints Moscow and Washington understand this, even as they trade recriminations.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe destabilisation of Malcolm Turnbull is starting.\u201d</p> <p>That was the veteran commentator Ross Fitzgerald <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/the-destabilisation-of-malcolm-turnbull-is-starting-20160930-grsqe7.html\">in the Sydney Morning Herald</a> a few days ago.</p> <p>In reality, the destabilisation of Malcolm Turnbull started almost as soon as Tony Abbott lost the leadership, with Abbott\u2019s decision to remain in the House of Representatives an obvious indication of his unwillingness to accept the spill.</p> <p>Moreover, the public knew it.</p> <p>By April, the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australians-overwhelmingly-want-tony-abbott-to-quit-parliament-poll-20160401-gnwn6i.html\">majority of Australians</a> believed Abbott wanted to topple Turnbull \u2013 and if voters think you\u2019re destabilising, then, almost by definition, you\u2019re destabilising.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/how-conservatives-made-hansons-ideas-part-of-the-political-furniture\">How conservatives made Hansonist positions part of Australia\u2019s political furniture | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that survey also revealed a deep hostility to Abbott\u2019s ambition, with some 63% of respondents wanting the former PM to quit parliament altogether.</p> <p>That\u2019s worth remembering in the context of Abbott\u2019s latest grandstanding: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/03/tony-abbott-says-australia-should-strike-shotgun-trade-deal-with-post-brexit-uk\">his proposal for an \u201copen slather\u201d free trade agreement with post-Brexit Britain.</a></p> <p>Now, humble backbenchers intent on serving their electorates don\u2019t generally put forward their blueprints for foreign policy for public consideration. Obviously, this scheme, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/tony-abbott-urges-open-slather-postbrexit-trade-with-uk/news-story/f66f0fa35944a3d70bca6ddc03b5783f\">dutifully published in the Australian by Abbott\u2019s long-term stenographer, Greg Sheridan</a>, was another shot across the bow of the SS Turnbull, a vessel in danger of foundering with all hands.</p> <p>Yet Abbott\u2019s decision to differentiate himself from his prime minister through, of all things, a free trade agreement illustrates how delusional the \u201cBring Abbott back\u201d push has become.</p> <p>In the United States, the public hostility to such deals has forced both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to pledge their opposition to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/trans-pacific-partnership-provisions-questionable-says-productivity-commission\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, a pet project of Barack Obama.</p> <p>But, of course, Abbott\u2019s not speaking to the public. On the contrary, he\u2019s addressing an insurgent Liberal base and the bomb throwers of the rightwing commentariat.</p> <p>In the course of stalking Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd could at least point to a deep and stable reservoir of personal popularity. Abbott, however, has never been a Rudd.</p> <p></p> <p>Under Turnbull, the Liberals\u2019 poll ratings may <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3808660/Malcolm-Turnbull-popular-Tony-Abbott-dumped-leader-latest-Newspoll-shows.html\">now be back down to those that motivated the coup against his predecessor</a>, and Turnbull\u2019s dissatisfaction rates may be rising, but his unpopularity has not translated into public enthusiasm for Abbott.</p> <p>On the contrary, Abbott\u2019s backing comes almost entirely from conservative activists and their media cheerleaders, probably the only people in the nation to share his delight in \u201copen slather\u201d free trade.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/its-good-to-catch-up-pauline-hanson-and-tony-abbott-bury-the-hatchet\">His bizarre reconciliation with Pauline Hanson</a> neatly illustrated where Abbott now stands.</p> <p>During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Abbott <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/22/1061529330032.html\">spearheaded the campaign</a> that resulted in Hanson\u2019s jail term. Back then, he was acting on behalf of his parliamentary leader \u2013 essentially, working as John Howard\u2019s hardman in the interests of the Liberal mainstream.</p> <p>By contrast, the meeting with Hanson was directed <em>against</em> the current leader. Abbott knows that the Liberal rank and file admires the One Nation founder.

  "<p>It is among the most venerable election rituals of the smartphone era: down the home stretch, a recording surfaces containing embarrassing audio of a candidate elite-\u2019splaining politics to a room of rich, self-satisfied donors. </p> <p>In 2008, Barack Obama was caught talking in San Francisco about Rust Belt left-behinds who \u201ccling\u201d to guns and Bibles. Four years later, Mitt Romney never recovered from his \u201chopeless 47%\u201d comments in Boca Raton. And last Friday splashed the arrival of Hillary Clinton\u2019s very own \u201cbasement tape\u201d, recorded at a fundraiser in a tony Virginia suburb. In it, Clinton is heard caricaturing young Sanders supporters as frustrated, fist-pounding baristas \u2014 \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement\u201d \u2014 clinging to their Bernie T-shirts and naive fantasies of system change. </p> <p>Sanders dutifully rose to Clinton\u2019s defense over the weekend, but he also conceded on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that the tape bothered him. How could it not? Clinton\u2019s comments were a bald revelation, condescending and dismissive, assuring wealthy Democrats that the millennials making noise on the left just don\u2019t know any better. </p> <p>As Emmett Rensin <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-millennial-voters-502298\">ably enumerated</a> for Newsweek, young people did not support Sanders because they are, in Clinton\u2019s recorded words, \u201cnew to politics\u201d. They flocked to him because they have very different politics than she does. Clinton\u2019s comments remind us just how different, and suggest her rhetorical commitments to parts of the Sanders platform won\u2019t find reflection in her appointments. </p> <p>And at bottom, they reveal a politician who still holds to the old Thatcher motto that defined the neoliberal era\u2019s boost phase: there is no alternative. The impacts of deregulation and free trade are real, Clinton says in the tape, but organizing for radical change is just role-play fantasy politics. As she brushed it off in Virginia, it reflects \u201ca deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare \u2026 you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s comments also belie an incapacity to get her head around the full meaning of Sanders\u2019 campaign. The political revolution Sanders invoked was not just a plan to get college graduates out of America\u2019s basements and into sweet lofts. In reducing the campaign to crude economism, Clinton sounds like someone who doesn\u2019t understand that many Sanders supporters don\u2019t just want a bigger piece of the pie, they want a fundamentally different kind of society. Clinton\u2019s message to her donor audience was essentially one of patience, of letting capitalism work its magic: as soon as these kids start making good money, they\u2019ll fall in line behind center-right candidates. It\u2019s perfectly natural that Clinton and her audience would think this, and that \u201ceverybody\u201d, as Clinton described the political class in Virginia, would be \u201cquite bewildered\u201d in the meantime. </p> <p>You can see a similar economism in media attempts to disentangle the motivations of Trump supporters. In August, much was made of a Gallup poll showing that Trump\u2019s base was statistically no worse off than other voters. For many, this was the ultimate ballast for the argument that they couldn\u2019t possibly be motivated by distress over inequality or the economic and social dislocations of free trade agreements. </p> <p>This conclusion is as wrong, and for similar reasons, as Clinton\u2019s supposition that Sanders supporters would Be With Her if only they\u2019d gotten a cushy marketing gig after graduation. </p> <p>I spent much of primary season reporting a book about Trump supporters. As with Sanders backers, their outrage and sense of injustice was bigger than their own position. Economically secure Trump supporters \u2013 business owners, retirees with good pensions \u2013 are still members of communities. They see nephews, daughters and neighbors suffering the same burdens as Clinton\u2019s \u201cchildren of the recession\u201d; they generally view economic progress not in quarterly reports, but directionally, over decades. </p> <p>As with Sanders supporters, some of the Trump supporters I met have begun to think critically about the bigger picture, about systems, and wonder why we can\u2019t have some of the nice things they have in Scandanavia, such as universal healthcare. This view was especially common among Trump-supporting veterans, whose experience with war, homelessness and socialized healthcare led them to give Sanders a good listen before choosing the toxic fool\u2019s gold of the other insurgency. </p> <p>If Sanders\u2019 baristas can find a way to bring these people over, they might make some decent music together. Even if they have to start out practicing in their parents\u2019 basement. </p>",

And that took me aback. I don\u2019t want to be without parents. That means there\u2019s no one to fall back on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/27/kathleen-turner-live-qa-post-your-questions-now\">Kathleen Turner Q&amp;A \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was this visceral experience that made Turner choose The Year of Magical Thinking for her latest performance <a href=\"http://www.arenastage.org/shows-tickets/the-season/productions/the-year-of-magical-thinking/\">at the Arena Stage in Washington</a>, starting on Friday. Or perhaps it was the work that chose her. Both the 2005 memoir and the stage adaptation, starring Vanessa Redgrave and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/apr/01/theatre.broadway\">directed by David Hare on Broadway</a>, were praised as a lucid account of grief that offered the bracing comfort of looking death in the eye.</p> <p>Turner, 62, says of her mother Patsy: \u201cIt was as good a death, I think, as you can hope for. My brother and I were with her; we were holding her. One thing I absolutely adored, about an hour or so before she died, she kind of turned her head around and she went: \u2018What a dumb way to die!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Turner lets out a gritty yet graceful laugh. \u201c\u2018Wait, mom?\u2019 But when thinking back on it I went, oh, I love that! But I miss her very much. We were close. She would go on many adventures with me and we were probably the most alike in personality; I have two brothers and a sister. So trying to understand better my life without her and value the time that we had, I thought of this.\u201d</p> <p>She has met fellow New York resident Didion, 81, over the years but is not consulting her for this production. Didion <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/books/review/the-year-of-magical-thinking-goodbye-to-all-that.html?_r=0\">had been preparing for dinner</a> with her husband, the novelist John Gregory Dunne, on Christmas Day in 2003 when he had a fatal heart attack. The couple had spent the morning at a New York hospital, where their daughter Quintana lay comatose. Didion writes coolly, penetratingly and self-revealingly about losing her husband and the mysterious illness of her only daughter.</p> <p>In her storied, smoky voice, Turner reflects: \u201cAmericans in particular \u2013 and I would not speak for other cultures necessarily \u2013 really don\u2019t want to deal with death. We don\u2019t want to even pretend it happens, unless you\u2019re a super-Christian, I guess, of some kind, which I am not. And in fact, in a way, I think we disrespect the process, our own lives, by not honouring that part of it as well.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think that death is the end? Turner, a divorcee with one child of her own, a 28-year-old daughter, replies: \u201cI believe in God but not in organised religion. My mother lives in me and my siblings and all the actions of our lives which have myriad ripples ... She touched many, many people\u2019s lives. So yes, she lives on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a2ac106a89a63a70d0e0214f3355b761a068d24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a2ac106a89a63a70d0e0214f3355b761a068d24/0_155_4045_2427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turner onstage with Ian McDiarmid in Bakersfield Mist by Stephen Sachs in the West End in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turner onstage with Ian McDiarmid in Bakersfield Mist, by Stephen Sachs, in the West End in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Patsy Magee Turner, married to Richard Turner of the foreign service, who died when Kathleen was 17, was not always a great fan of her daughter\u2019s choice of career. \u201cI think for a long time she really just simply didn\u2019t understand what the whole thing was at all,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it was really until <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/21/theater/reviews/marriage-as-blood-sport-a-nowin-game.html\">Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

The tributes and obituaries that followed made clear that he did not always suffer fools gladly, particularly actors foolish enough to meddle with his words.</p> <p>\u201cHe reserved the right to give any notes he wanted regardless of the director,\u201d Turner says. \u201cHe came backstage and he said, \u2018Second act, monologue about the gardener. You left out the word \u201cHa!\u201d\u2019 I said, \u2018Did I?\u2019 I said, \u2018It will be there tomorrow.\u2019 It was, and you can be sure he was in the back listening.\u201d</p> <p>But they had a positive relationship, she recalls fondly. \u201cIn fact, when we closed the show on Broadway, there was an envelope on my dressing room table. It was Edward\u2019s stationery and inside there\u2019s a card in his handwriting that said, \u2018You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m a playwright.\u2019 So that is in my safe. It was a wonderful thought, a wonderful gift from him.\u201d</p> <p>Turner cites Virginia Woolf, for which she earned a Tony nomination, as perhaps her best work to date. On film, where she made a sensational femme fatale debut opposite William Hurt in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082089/\">Body Heat (1981)</a> and was nominated for an Oscar for Peggy Sue Got Married (1987), she names The Accidental Tourist (also with Hurt) and Romancing the Stone (with Michael Douglas) as among personal favourites.</p> <p>She has less happy memories of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096203/\">Switching Channels</a> in 1988. \u201cI only did one film for money and that\u2019s the one film I dislike because I did it for money. I was pregnant and figured I wouldn\u2019t work for a year, so grab the money and run, and I hate the film. It wasn\u2019t all my fault, though. It was supposed to be with Michael Caine and he got stuck on Jaws 4, and so the producer hired Burt Reynolds.\u201d</p> <p>With devastating sarcasm, she drawls: \u201cNot exactly the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>Reynolds was difficult? \u201cHe\u2019s been saying terrible things about me for years.\u201d A burst of laughter. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a6fa5f43b9a4c1be6a0206286142cb8853ef89b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a6fa5f43b9a4c1be6a0206286142cb8853ef89b/0_0_3220_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorable femme fatale: Turner with William Hurt in Body Heat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorable femme fatale: Turner with William Hurt in Body Heat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the mid-1990s, Turner fell ill. Her neck locked and she could not turn her head, and her hands swelled so badly that she could not pick up a glass. Eventually she was <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/juliet-belkin/kathleen-turner-against-a_b_10012774.html\">diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis</a>, a swelling of the lining of the joints that left her in continual, chronic pain.</p> <p>\u201cIt was crippling,\u201d she recalls. \u201cYou stop taking things for granted when you lose them, even temporarily. What I took for granted \u2013 my athleticism, my ability to throw myself around, and just be able to move however I wanted to. When I lost that, that was a real crisis of self: who am I if I cannot do this?\u201d</p> <p>The showbiz-industrial complex that once cast her as a sex symbol now turned on her with an unforgiving lens. \u201cI was on so much prednisone and prednisone just blows you right up, so there was all the: \u2018What drugs is she on? What booze is she on?\u2019 But the point was at that time autoimmune diseases and rheumatoid arthritis were pretty unknown, unexplained, and quite simply to have a mysterious illness was far worse than to be a known alcoholic. Lovely business, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Despite their side effects, the drugs worked. Turner came back in 2000, playing Mrs Robinson opposite Matthew Rhys in a stage version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/feb/06/features.davidsmith\">The Graduate</a> in London\u2019s West End. There was a predictable hullaballoo around a brief, dimly lit scene in which she dropped a towel and appeared nude. She got letters from middle-aged women saying things such as: \u201cI have not undressed in front of my husband in 10 years and I\u2019m going to tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie Smith, meanwhile, was performing at the theatre next door in Alan Bennett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/12/the-lady-in-the-van-review-maggie-smith-alan-bennett-nicholas-hytner\">The Lady in the Van</a>. Turner recalls: \u201cThey had all these police barricades around my stage door because the crowds were pretty crazy and I would be standing there signing autographs and I\u2019d see Maggie walk out of her stage door and no one even notice her or anything. It was absolutely shocking, and then I get this note one day: \u2018May I please borrow a barricade?\u2019 So I walked it over and we went out to dinner and we were friends ever since.\u201d</p> <p>The production was a box office hit and she took it to New York, but only just. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to do The Graduate in the United States because I thought Americans are so screwed up about sex, so hypocritical, I don\u2019t need this crap. So when we finished in London and they said, \u2018Do you want to take it to New York?\u2019 I said no, thank you very much.</p> <p>\u201cI went off and did a tour of another play and then \u2013 absolute truth \u2013 I got a film script and the character was described as \u201837 but still attractive\u2019. I was 46 when I did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2000/apr/07/theatre.artsfeatures\">The Graduate in London</a> so I called up the producer and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Broadway.\u2019 So I did it at 48 on Broadway. Screw you, still attractive! But that\u2019s real America, that\u2019s my country, I\u2019m afraid to say.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd527b95e142e7c526329f00e3fff64ac2fed59a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd527b95e142e7c526329f00e3fff64ac2fed59a/0_62_2049_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoking: Turner and Matthew Rhys in the London production of The Graduate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoking: Turner and Matthew Rhys in the London production of The Graduate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keenly aware of Hollywood\u2019s endemic ageism, she never lost touch with her stage career: \u201cBecause I knew that the better roles as I got older would be in theatre, which is absolutely true, so that was a little foresight on my part of which I am justly proud. Next year will be 40 years as a professional and I am thankful for that, and that I still have a lot of choices because that\u2019s not true for a lot of women, and that\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p> <p>Turner is also a seasoned activist and chairwoman of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/09/27/kathleen-turner-on-why-white-men-are-scared/\">Planned Parenthood\u2019s board of advocates</a>. Planned Parenthood has been a punching bag for many conservatives in election year.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that any man of any faith should tell a woman what to do with her body is so incomprehensible to me,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I can say in these speeches is, \u2018Who the fuck do they think they are?\u2019 I don\u2019t actually say fuck. I think I say hell.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how she feels about the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">Donald Trump</a> becoming president, Turner nearly chokes on her lunch. \u201cUtterly terrified. I really, really do believe that the American people are good and do the right thing. It truly is our nature, our national character. I cannot believe that we will fall prey to this kind of divisive, target-making rhetoric that he uses. I honestly believe that it cannot happen, that Hilary Clinton will be our next president, and I think that she is tremendously capable of doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump came to hog the camera as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/business/media/donald-trump-apprentice.html\">host of The Apprentice</a>. Turner acknowledges that Clinton is not a TV natural. \u201cSome people do not go through the camera. When I was starting out and I would say to people, \u2018How do you make the camera love you?\u2019 and they would say, \u2018You can\u2019t \u2013 it does or it doesn\u2019t.\u2019 I would say, \u2018No, no, no, not good enough. How do I make it love me?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true and Hillary does not go through the camera. Because in person, if you\u2019ve ever been in the room with her, there\u2019s tremendous warmth and you can\u2019t understand what other people are talking about. But she doesn\u2019t go through the camera.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton is said to have a sharp sense of humour by those who know her. Turner herself is great company. She seems to belong to another era, as if she should have been one of the smart, stylish, independent women in the screwball comedies of the 1930s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/13/lauren-bacall-obituary\">Lauren Bacall</a> reputedly once told her: \u201cOh, I hear you\u2019re the young me.\u201d</p> <p>Turner chuckles as she recalls a game they used to play.

Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave.</p> <p>At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">would immediately start sliding into recession</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">House prices would crumble. Shares would crash</a>.</p> <p>So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right.</p> <p>No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017.</p> <p>This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund\">IMF left shamefaced after peak pessimism over Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ac35e4b0d3973ef5f809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:21:24.999Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF singles out the UK\u2019s referendum as a key factor hurting global growth, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere is a more subdued outlook for advanced economies following the June U.K. vote in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit) and weaker-than-expected growth in the United States.</p> <p>These developments have put further downward pressure on global interest rates, as monetary policy is now expected to remain accommodative for longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also cites China\u2019s economic rebalancing, and a general slowdown in trade growth since 2012.

  "<p>It\u2019s turning out to be an awful week for Donald Trump. The Republican nominee for president is worth some $800m less this year than he was last year, according to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/09/28/the-definitive-look-at-donald-trumps-wealth-new/#32c6bf277e2d\">the Forbes 400</a>, an annual ranking of the world\u2019s wealthiest people.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s net worth fell from $4.5bn to $3.7bn between the 2015 and 2016 ranking. He is now tied for 156th place in the magazine\u2019s annual wealth competition with fellow real estate developers Jerry Speyer and Igor Olenicoff, FedEx founder Frederick Smith, and Steven Spielberg, who saw his own net worth rise by about $100m. Trump is down 35 places from 2015.</p> <p>His fall came as the rich got even richer. The country\u2019s 400 richest were worth $2.4tn this year and had an average net worth of $6bn, both record highs. For the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/10/04/inside-the-2016-forbes-400-facts-and-figures-about-americas-richest-people/#64c189b39730\">23rd straight year</a>, the wealthiest person on the list was Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Gates gained $5bn in the last year \u2013 his net worth has increased from $76bn to $81bn.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, too, gained ground: an additional $20bn makes him the second-richest person on Earth, up from the fourth-richest last year. Entrepreneur Warren Buffett\u2019s ranking dropped second to third, though his net worth went up from $62 to $65.5bn. Mark Zuckerberg also had a good 2015: the Facebook CEO made $15.2bn between this list and the last, placing him in fourth place and knocking Oracle CEO Larry Ellison down to No 5. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s $6.4bn increase to $45bn put him up at sixth place from eighth last year. Republican financiers the Koch brothers are tied for No 7: their personal fortunes grew by only $1bn this year. Meanwhile, Pierre Omidyar, founder of the Intercept, was up $100m to $8.1bn, rising three places from #57 to #54. </p> <p>Notable absences from the list included Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/08/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-banned-medical-lab\">biotech startup Theranos</a>, which is being investigated for fraud. Forbes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/06/01/from-4-5-billion-to-nothing-forbes-revises-estimated-net-worth-of-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes/#67b4d6392f29\">revised Holmes\u2019s net worth to zero</a> from $4.5bn after investigations into Theranos\u2019s proprietary technologies suggested the company had falsely claimed a number of scientific breakthroughs.</p> <p>Holmes isn\u2019t the only one with money troubles this year: among Trump\u2019s woes are uncertainties in the New York City real estate market, where demand for retail and office space has become less urgent, according to the magazine.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s net worth has been a subject of much debate over the course of his presidential campaign, as his steadfast refusal to release his tax returns has kept most details of his financial dealings out of the public eye. The New York Times revealed last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-income-tax-returns-published\">Trump had declared a $916m loss</a> on his 1995 state tax returns; the partial returns provided to the Times by an anonymous source are the largest single disclosure of Trump\u2019s financial dealings.<br></p> <p>Fortune\u2019s research into Trump\u2019s wealth has the advantage of 35 years of research on the man \u2013 the first time Forbes published an estimate of Trump\u2019s wealth was on its first-ever Forbes 400 in 1982, when he was worth a mere $100m. Nowadays, young Trump wouldn\u2019t even make the list \u2013 the poorest person on the 400 is car dealership magnate Gail Miller, with $1.7bn. Even adjusted for inflation, Trump\u2019s $100m in 1982 is \u201conly\u201d $249m.</p>",
  "<h2>Dear Barack Obama,</h2> <p>According to a racist clock I found on the internet, you only have 107 days, 22 hours, 37 minutes and five seconds left as president of the United States. Hopefully, when that clock runs out, you will be replaced by our first female president instead of an authoritarian lamprey, but either way I will miss you a lot, bro.</p> <p>For the first seven years of my life, Ronald Reagan was the president; then came George H W Bush for four. Thus it was imprinted upon me very young that a \u201cpresident\u201d is a sort of evil robot accountant who has been bitten by a radioactive awkward liar. Like if your dad\u2019s worst friend got to decide who to bomb. Like if every vice principal on Earth was distilled into a sentient nectar and poured into the ear of a waxwork <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Baxter\">Ted Baxter</a>. It never occurred to me that I could like a president, or look up to a president, or want to hang out with a president, let alone be a president. Presidents were old white dudes. That\u2019s what having only old white dudes be the president for the entire history of a country will teach a child.</p> <p>My stepdaughters are 12 and 14. They don\u2019t have many distinct memories of George W Bush, as he was not a character on Lilo &amp; Stitch or a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli. For all of the most salient and self-aware years of their lives, their president has been black, like their dad. If Hillary Clinton is elected in November, they may reach bona fide adulthood without ever associating the word \u201cpresidential\u201d with the condescending white guy at work you always \u201cforget\u201d to send an e-vite to (\u201cSorry, Greg, oh no, my email\u2019s being weird!\u201d). It\u2019s too late for me to become president \u2013 I have said \u201cdoodoofaeces\u201d on the internet far too many times, and also politics sounds like boring death \u2013 but it\u2019s not too late for my kids and their friends and their kids\u2019 friends and their friends\u2019 kids. And, unlike me 25 years ago, they know it. You did that.</p> <p>As information becomes more accessible and our lives become less opaque, we\u2019re losing the ability to unreservedly celebrate our leaders. We\u2019ll probably never again be able to gloss over a president\u2019s darker and deadlier decisions, and that\u2019s a good thing. Accountability is an engine of progress. I don\u2019t agree with every decision you\u2019ve made (though neither, I suspect, do you), and I hope you\u2019ll spend your post-presidential career listening and campaigning and amending your more egregious faults.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/04/leonardo-dicaprio-obama-at-the-whitehouse-climate-change-deniers-should-not-be-in-office-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56vc6\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2775633\"            data-video-name=\"President Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change at the White House \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f390b7e4b0a497243b6d58\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/04/161004LeoObama_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733787&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733787&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/04/leonardo-dicaprio-obama-at-the-whitehouse-climate-change-deniers-should-not-be-in-office-video\">President Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change at the White House \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, thank you for calling yourself a feminist without caveat.

Laughing at your enemies, holding on to your identity undimmed and letting your anger out when it really matters \u2013 those are lessons that have helped me, personally, in a very direct and tangible way.</p> <p>Thanks for being funny. You\u2019re the first president in my lifetime that Saturday Night Live couldn\u2019t get a toehold on \u2013 you never made a good target for satire \u2013 which was one of the most comforting things about you, especially on the heels of the Bush years. It felt like there was finally a real grownup in the White House, and not in a Donald Trump \u201cdaddy, save us\u201d way, but in the way where I felt like I could say a sentence to you and you would actually understand it. A surprisingly high bar in American politics.</p> <p>To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t mind if there wasn\u2019t another straight, white dude president for the rest of my daughters\u2019 lives. And all the Twitter \u201cegalitarians\u201d can quit crying, because we would still be at, like, a 25-president deficit. I\u2019m being generous, if you think about it. Mr President, I know you can\u2019t agree with me on this one because you still have to be in charge of this racist, sexist rodeo for 107 more days, but blink twice for yes. Blink three times for abolishing term limits and four times for forever-president Michelle. I see you, Barry.

The downside is that his political career will forever be marred by his connection to a guy who goes around claiming his political rival\u2019s father may have been an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/trump-ted-cruz-father-222730\">accomplice</a> in the JFK assassination.</p> <p>Pence has been forced to defend some pretty un-Pence-like statements during his time connected with Trump, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/raddatz-grills-pence-why-did-trump-keep-birtherism-going-for-so-long/\">such as</a> Trump\u2019s half-decade-long birther crusade. But nothing will compare to what Pence might get on the debate stage on Tuesday. Donald Trump just had one of the worst weeks in the history of presidential campaign politics. After getting shown up at the first presidential debate, he extended the most politically toxic storyline of that debate for days, standing by his 1990s claim that a Miss Universe winner was a problem because she \u201cgained a massive amount of weight\u201d and then going on a middle of the night Twitter rant encouraging his 12 million followers to go look up the beauty queen\u2019s non-existent sex tape.</p> <p>Then there was Trump\u2019s Saturday night apparent hint, without evidence, that perhaps Hillary Clinton has been unfaithful to her husband.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself,\u201d he said to a crowd in Pennsylvania. \u201cI don\u2019t even think she\u2019s loyal to Bill, you wanna know the truth. And really folks, really, why should she be, right? Why should she be?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign has ramped up its rhetoric about Bill Clinton\u2019s past sexual escapades. We seem to be just moments away from Trump authorizing the \u201c<a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/02/if-trump-decides-to-go-nuclear-on-the-clintons-this-is-how-hell-do-it/\">Roger Stone nuclear option</a>\u201d where Team Trump accuses Bill Clinton of being a serial rapist and his wife an enabler of his crimes.</p> <p>All of which brings us to Tuesday night. If the moderator Elaine Quijano brings any of this up, how willing will Mike Pence be to defend it, much less enthusiastically hammer the campaign line?</p> <p>\u201cGov Pence, Donald Trump hinted Saturday that Hillary Clinton has been unfaithful to her husband,\u201d you can just hear being asked as Pence\u2019s eyes glaze over as he wonders why he decided to accept Trump\u2019s invitation to be his number two. \u201cWhat evidence do you have of that?\u201d</p> <p>Who knows if Quijano will go there. But if she does, you\u2019ll be able to find Tim Kaine standing silently opposite Pence, watching intently, his hand in a bag of popcorn.</p> <p>Whatever happens, the takeaway from the debate will be that both vice-presidential contenders, whatever their flaws, are far superior options than their presidential counterparts.</p>",
  "<p>He is out-Trumping Trump.

From another perspective, Giuliani is merely reverting to his old self, albeit in more extreme form, and 9/11 was the exception that proves the rule. Under the headline, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-2016-214207\">\u201cIs Rudy Giuliani Losing His Mind?\u201d</a>, the Politico website argued: \u201cEven in New York, \u2018America\u2019s Mayor\u2019 was always a lot more like Trump than people realized.

He described Trump\u2019s pitch to African Americans in Milwaukee as \u201cthe best speech that any Republican, at the least, has ever given\u201d.</p> <p>Last week he claimed that Trump beat Clinton in the first debate and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/nyregion/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump.html\">told an interviewer</a> that the Democrat is \u201ctoo stupid to be president\u201d, because of her defence of Bill Clinton\u2019s extramarital cheating.</p> <p>Then, on last Sunday\u2019s political TV shows, he reacted to the report that Trump declared a $916m loss on his 1995 income tax returns, which could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any taxes for up to 18 years. \u201cThe man\u2019s a genius,\u201d Giuliani said on Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cHe knows how to operate the tax code for the people that he\u2019s serving.\u201d</p> <p>Over on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd asked Giuliani if he was \u201cthe right person\u201d to bring up <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/bill_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Bill Clinton</a>\u2019s past infidelities. \u201cYou have your own infidelities, sir,\u201d Todd said.</p> <p>Giuliani shot back: \u201cEverybody does.

Rich Galen, a Republican strategist and former press secretary to Dan Quayle, said: \u201cI think he\u2019s gone off the rails. I hadn\u2019t paid much attention until his shrieking at the Republican convention. He\u2019s like the guitarist in This Is Spinal Tap going up to 11, except he\u2019s going up to 12.\u201d</p> <p>Galen added: \u201cHe was always pretty brash but this is a different level of disconnect. Calling Trump a \u2018genius\u2019 for losing $900m a year: I don\u2019t understand how you ever get to that point.\u201d</p> <p>The reality is that, before 9/11, Giuliani was already a troubled individual with a suspect record. In 1992, as a mayoral candidate,<a href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/rudys-racist-rants-nypd-history-lesson\"> he egged on thousands of predominantly white off-duty police officers</a> in a huge New York riot that saw innocent people attacked, property vandalised and city hall occupied. Giuliani reportedly stood on top of a car while denouncing Mayor David Dinkins, an African American, through a bullhorn.</p> <p>He succeeded Dinkins in 1994. Violent crime dropped by 56% during the eight years he served as mayor, although <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/sep/01/how-much-credit-giuliani-due-fighting-crime/\">it had begun falling three years before he took office</a> and reflected a wider trend in big cities across the country. There were also consequences to Giuliani\u2019s tough-on-crime approach.</p> <p>In 1999, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/nyregion/officers-in-bronx-fire-41-shots-and-an-unarmed-man-is-killed.html\">Amadou Diallo</a>, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea, was shot 41 times by police while reaching for his wallet. A year later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/opinion/editorial-observer-the-mayor-can-defuse-the-dorismond-case.html\">Patrick Dorismond</a>, an unarmed 26-year-old security guard, was shot dead after a brief struggle outside a cocktail bar; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/20/nyregion/giuliani-cites-criminal-past-of-slain-man.html\">Giuliani attacked Dorismond\u2019s reputation</a> and released part of his juvenile police record, as if to imply that he got his just desserts.</p> <p>Like Trump, Giuliani has been married three times and has a chequered personal life. In 2000, following an affair, he told the media before his wife that he would seek a separation from her.</p> <p>An article on Politico last month contended: \u201cIt might seem like this summer has marked a sad break with that old Rudy, or proved him a sellout. But if you\u2019ve followed Giuliani\u2019s career, in fact it\u2019s clear he swallowed the whole Trump persona many years ago \u2013 the race-baiting, the law-and-order pose, the incessant lying used to both steal credit and avoid responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this summer isn\u2019t a crackup: It\u2019s the inevitable, supernova explosion of what long ago became one of the most toxic and overrated political careers in our history.\u201d</p> <p>If he was speaking on behalf of a conventional candidate, such behaviour could be severely damaging. With Trump, however, it is all of a piece. <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/profiles/lanhee-j-chen\">Lanhee Chen</a>, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s hurting anything because he\u2019s not saying anything more outlandish than the nominee himself. If the nominee was Mitt Romney, it would be a problem because it would be a surrogate gone rogue.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIn 2012 he was a good surrogate, as far as I can tell, and we can continue to admire him for his work on 9/11. I\u2019m not sure who the real Rudy Giuliani is.\u201d</p>",

Pence fuelled this feeling with <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/indiana-gov-mike-pence-controversial-religious-freedom-law/story?id=29985752\">an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week</a> where he was given six opportunities to say the RFRA was not meant to discriminate against LGBT people, but failed to do so. </p> <p>\u201cRIFRAs have become a symbol of the resentment of a certain slice of right-wing Christianity that feels its social hegemony and privileged cultural and political position slipping away,\u201d wrote Steve Sanders, a professor of constitutional and family law at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, <a href=\"http://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/indiana%E2%80%99s-rifra-the-law-is-complicated-but-the-anti-gay-politics-are-not\">in a March 2016 blogpost.</a> </p> <p>The backlash was led by major businesses that threatened to cancel plans for expansion in Indiana, or leave the state completely, unless the bill were changed. Mayors of cities including Seattle and San Francisco called for a boycott of Indiana. Pence eventually amended the bill, but has failed to instill confidence that his internal beliefs had changed. \u201cHe\u2019s done nothing to indicate a change of attitude on whether or not LGBT should be added to our protections,\u201d Lanane said. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you could expect him to be very enthusiastic about championing those rights, however they might exist or play out on a federal level,\u201d said Lanane.</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidate\u2019s role during a campaign is ultimately to reflect his running mate\u2019s views. As such, Pence\u2019s history has faded into the background.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cTrump does not have a problem with the LGBT community and never has,\u201d said Black. \u201cHe\u2019s always been very open about his views on it.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s now Mike\u2019s obligation to reflect Trump\u2019s views.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>More than four months into the lockout, Allan Enright and Jose DeLeon \u2013 both wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a bald eagle and the word \u201cSolidarity\u201d \u2013 were picketing outside the Honeywell factory that makes airline brakes. <br></p> <p> On a street without any traffic or pedestrians, the two were showing their defiance toward Honeywell, the aerospace plant in South Bend, Indiana, which locked out 316 union members here on 9 May after they voted overwhelmingly to reject a proposed contract that they say contained a significantly worse health plan. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/indiana-carrier-factory-workers-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">'Trump talks a big game' on Indiana factories \u2013 but workers express doubt</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Honeywell says it locked out the members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/united-auto-workers-reject-fiat-chrysler-contract\">United Automobile Workers</a> (UAW) \u2013 and brought in replacement workers \u2013 to assure continued production and meet customers\u2019 deadlines. Enright, 59 and soft-spoken, sees things differently. \u201cBottom line, they want to get rid of the union completely,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they locked us out.\u201d</p> <p> Honeywell and the UAW resumed talks this week after reaching a stalemate but tempers are high. The company has embraced a weapon that has grown increasingly popular across corporate America as organized labor has grown weaker: locking out workers to throw the union on the defensive and perhaps break the union\u2019s and the workers\u2019 will. </p> <p> \u201cI really think they\u2019re just trying to hold us out, to make us hungry, to make the membership fold,\u201d said Bryan Rodgers, the recording secretary of UAW Local 9 in South Bend. Honeywell has also locked out 42 UAW members at a second airline brake factory, in Green Island, New York, just north of Albany.</p> <p> Notwithstanding on-again, off-again negotiations, the company and union have been deadlocked since May. Tensions have festered and the workers have grown restive as the clashing sides continue to present vastly different views of the situation. The UAW says the airline brake factory here has fallen badly behind in keeping up with customer orders, while Honeywell insists that production is going well, better than with its unionized workforce.</p> <p> The union asserts that Honeywell should not be demanding concessions on health coverage, seniority and other matters when the company had record profits of $4.77bn last year and income in its aerospace division rose. But Honeywell says it needs to rein in costs because the aviation industry has hit some turbulence.</p> <p> \u201cThe union is ignoring the stark economic realities currently facing the global aviation industry, which has lost approximately 35,000 jobs since 2015,\u201d said Scott Sayres, a Honeywell spokesman.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t persuade John Suher Sr, a 60-year-old millwright, who is furious about the lockout. \u201cIt\u2019s basically corporate greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eliminate the middle class.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute\u2019s main sticking point is health coverage. Union members say Honeywell\u2019s proposal would make many of them pay several thousand dollars more each year for health coverage. They also complain that Honeywell is demanding the power to unilaterally change health coverage, premiums and deductibles without the union\u2019s approval.</p> <p> \u201cThe unilateral healthcare changes are unacceptable to us,\u201d said the UAW\u2019s Rodgers. \u201cThey want to be able to change healthcare any time they want.\u201d</p> <p>But Honeywell\u2019s Sayres defended the proposal. \u201cWe are offering the same healthcare benefits available to nearly all other Honeywell employees in the US, including those represented by unions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon, Enright and DeLeon carried placards with bright red letters saying \u201cUAW Locked Out\u201d, as they stood alongside a makeshift shelter \u2013 a grey tarpaulin held up by wooden poles stuck into concrete-filled plastic buckets. A previous shelter had literally blown away during a ferocious summer storm. </p> <p> Wearing a bandanna on his head to shield him from the sun, DeLeon, a Honeywell employee for seven years, acknowledged the lockout was taking its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a daughter in college, and my wife is ill. She\u2019s only got a part-time job. Between that and unemployment insurance, we\u2019re making it.\u201d</p> <p> Many workers are getting by only because they receive $390 or so in weekly unemployment insurance. But they worry about what will happen when those benefits expire in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/united-auto-workers-reject-fiat-chrysler-contract\">United Auto Workers reject Fiat Chrysler contract by wide margin</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Honeywell workers average $22 an hour, or $45,760 a year for a full-time worker before overtime.

The company\u2019s contract offer includes a 8% raise over five years. </p> <p> The UAW has sought to turn up the pressure on Honeywell. On 21 September, 100 union members and supporters demonstrated outside a federal building in Albany to protest against the government\u2019s recent decision to award Honeywell\u2019s South Bend factory an $18.3m contract to produce replacement brakes for the navy\u2019s F/A-18 plane. </p> <p>Julie Kushner, director of the UAW\u2019s New York region, said: \u201cWe believe the government should stop giving new contracts or extending old contracts to a deplorable company that is locking out its workers and destroying good, middle-class jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Barbara Fick, a labor law professor at Notre Dame University here, questioned how long the workers could hold out. \u201cThese workers were used to making pretty good money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re out four or five months without wages, they have obviously got to be hurting.\u201d</p>",

Kaine, 58, is a former Harvard-taught trial lawyer who served as mayor, governor and now senator. Pence, 57, is a governor and former talk radio host, and he has in effect become Trump\u2019s apologiser-in-chief during the election campaign, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/us/politics/mike-pence-republicans-senate.html\">trying to persuade disaffected Republicans</a> to tolerate the nominee and return to the fold.</p> <p>But both men are also defiantly low-key.

His verdict: \u201cKaine came across as the more charismatic debater. Pence was solid and unflappable and never made a mistake, but his style left a little bit to be desired in terms of energising people and being watchable. Some of his gubernatorial performances in Indiana put you to sleep.</p> <p>\u201cKaine has the perfect combination of substance and delivery. He comes across as affable with a smile on his face but he\u2019s also like a pitbull attack dog armed with information. His style suits televised debate better: he\u2019ll come across as more polished and with sunny optimism.\u201d</p> <p>George Ajjan, a Republican strategist, predicted that Kaine will seek to exploit differences betweenTrump and his running mate. \u201cThe question is whether Pence will be well-prepared enough to pivot the discussion back to policy, economics and the frustration of the everyman,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf he succeeds in distilling the nuggets of clarity from Trump\u2019s debate performance and explain them in his rational and calm way, he can come out the winner. But Kaine is no slouch and, in either case, the two presidential candidates are so larger-than-life that it\u2019s hard to see this as a make-or-break moment for anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Shaun Bowler, a professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, said: \u201cPart of Pence\u2019s job will be to shore up Trump\u2019s credentials with evangelical voters. Kaine\u2019s job will be to shore up Clinton\u2019s appeal to Latino voters. Both are experienced politicians and so \u2013 famous last words \u2013 there may not be many fireworks. </p> <p>\u201cIt is likely to be a more measured debate \u2013 even as they act as surrogates for their principals. But whatever they do there can only be a limited effect from these debates. There just can\u2019t be many people left who do not have definite opinions on either of the presidential candidates, which means there just isn\u2019t that much room for an effect.\u201d</p> <p>In Kaine\u2019s mock debate rehearsals, the role of Pence is being played by Robert Barnett, a Washington lawyer. Pence, meanwhile, has held sessions with <a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/\">Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker</a> as a stand-in, avoiding the criticism that Trump faced for trying to wing it. But Kall observed: \u201cIn the Republican primaries, Scott Walker came across as the most boring debater of all time.\u201d</p> <p>Both Pence, a Christian evangelical, and Kaine, a Catholic former missionary, are likely to emphasise their religious faith. Kaine has sometimes found it hard to square with his political positions on abortion and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/us/politics/tim-kaine-death-penalty.html\">the death penalty</a>.</p> <p>The senator from Virginia has said he is \u201cthinking hard\u201d about what Pence\u2019s record says \u201cabout the guy who chose him, because it really is more about Donald Trump than it is about Governor Pence\u201d.</p> <p>Pence, for his part, \u201chas been studying briefing books, and dossiers on his laptop\u201d, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/tim-kaine-mike-pence-debate.html\">the New York Times reported</a>. \u201cThe Republican National Committee has also uploaded copious videos of Mr Kaine \u2013 everything from interviews to past debates \u2013 to an online file-sharing service for Mr Pence to view.\u201d</p> <p>Pence attended the first presidential debate in New York last week, whereas Kaine went to a watch party in Orlando, Florida. Predictably, both men claimed victory for their running mates. Kaine said Clinton\u2019s showing \u201craised the bar\u201d, adding wryly: \u201cThat puts pressure on me.\u201d</p> <p>Before flying to Wisconsin for two days of preparations with Walker, Pence said similarly: \u201cDonald Trump raised the bar for his running mate.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-jokes\">Pence v Kaine: why you should watch the vice-presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But even in a normal year, the VP debate has only limited impact.

He turned to economic history to explain his turnaround skills.</p> <p>The 1990s, he claimed, saw \u201cconditions far worse than the great depression for real estate developers\u201d.

  "<p>When six senior Italian detectives arrived in Cairo in early February, following the discovery of the brutally battered body of 28-year-old Italian PhD student Giulio Regeni, they faced long odds of solving the mystery of his disappearance and death. Egyptian officials had told reporters that Regeni had probably been hit by a car, but clear signs of torture on his body had raised an alarm in Rome.</p> <p>The Egyptian authorities guaranteed \u201cfull cooperation\u201d, but this was quickly revealed to be a hollow promise. The Italians were allowed to question witnesses \u2013 but only for a few minutes, after the Egyptian police had finished their own much longer interrogations, and with the Egyptian police still in the room. The Italians requested the video footage from the metro station where Regeni last used his mobile phone, but the Egyptians allowed several days to elapse, by which time the footage from the day of his disappearance had been taped over. They also refused to share the mobile phone records from the area around Regeni\u2019s home, where he disappeared on 25 January, and the site where his body was found nine days later.</p> <p>One of the Egyptian chief investigators in charge of the Regeni case, Major General Khaled Shalaby, who told the press that there were no signs of foul play, is a controversial figure. Convicted of kidnapping and torture over a decade ago, he escaped with a suspended sentence.<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/21/who-murdered-giulio-regeni-podcast\">Who murdered Giulio Regeni? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Egyptians may well have hoped that the outside world, with no independent information, would have little choice but to accept their unsatisfying explanation for Regeni\u2019s death. But in the digital age, getting away with murder has become more difficult.</p> <p>About 10 days after the recovery of Regeni\u2019s body, Italian prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco and a couple of police officers travelled to Regeni\u2019s hometown of Fiumicello, in north-eastern Italy, to attend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/12/giulio-regeni-funeral-in-italy-for-student-found-dead-in-cairo\">his funeral</a>. It would be a rare opportunity to question many key witnesses in the case, gathered in one place.</p> <p>The family had asked guests not to bring cameras, or to carry signs of protest, preferring a simple, sober ceremony. But more than 3,000 mourners attended the service, most of them spilling out of a school gymnasium into the street. The funeral turned the town of less than 5,000 people into a kind of miniature United Nations \u2013 a tribute to Regeni\u2019s short but global life.</p> <p>There were friends from the US, where he had studied during high school; from Latin America, a region he knew well; from the UK, where he had done both university and graduate studies; from Germany and Austria, where he had worked; and from Egypt, where he had lived since November 2015, researching the trade union movement for his Cambridge doctorate. \u201cWe put people up in the houses of friends according to which languages they had in common,\u201d said Paola Regeni, Giulio\u2019s mother, who works as a teacher.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not only did the police have the chance to question witnesses, they received an unexpected bonus. In a gesture of astonishing openness, Giulio Regeni\u2019s grieving friends and relatives handed over their phones and laptops to the Italian police. As members of the Facebook generation, they were used to living transparently, ceding chunks of their privacy as the price for living in a connected world. If it could shed some light on the circumstances of Giulio\u2019s death, they were prepared to share their personal data.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s parents also gave the police his computer, which they had taken from his Cairo apartment after he disappeared. This, together with the mass of emails and text messages collected from his friends, has allowed Italian prosecutors to work around the holes in the evidence provided by the Egyptian government, and to reconstruct Regeni\u2019s world.</p> <p>The prosecutors also obtained another vital piece of evidence: Regeni\u2019s battered corpse, which, after an extremely thorough autopsy in Italy, has told them volumes about the final nine days of his life, from the time of his disappearance to the time his body was dumped in a concrete channel beside the road from Cairo to Alexandria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a/211_0_864_864/500.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While this evidence will almost certainly not be enough to help Italian investigators identify Regeni\u2019s killers by name, it has<strong> </strong>allowed them to refute a series of lies from the Egyptian government about Regini\u2019s murder \u2013 and keep up pressure on Egypt for hard information about his killing.</p> <p>Italian prosecutors recently made an important breakthrough: the Egyptian government agreed to hand over mobile phone records from both the area where Regeni was last seen, and the place where his body was found.<strong> </strong>Perhaps even more important, during a visit to Rome in early September, Egyptian prosecutors admitted for the first time that Regeni had been under police surveillance before his disappearance.</p> <p>The Egyptian government continues to deny that it had any involvement in Regeni\u2019s death.

It is, in fact,  a crucial clue to understanding his murder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That Regeni should have disappeared on 25 January is not coincidental. It is, in fact, a crucial clue to understanding his disappearance and murder. It was the fifth anniversary of the Egyptian revolution of 2011, and the massive demonstrations in Tahrir Square that brought the Arab Spring to Egypt and led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo\">ousting of President Hosni Mubarak</a>. The date has a totemic significance for the regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, for whom it represents a traumatic climbdown \u2013 a moment in which the military\u2019s apparently unassailable grip on power seemed to slip. As a result, the army had been forced to accept the trial of Mubarak and the election of Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi, posing a serious threat to its position in Egyptian life. Such a thing could never be allowed to occur again.</p> <p>When Sisi and the military took control of the government and arrested Morsi in July 2013, Morsi supporters occupied two public squares and staged sit-ins, hoping for a repeat of the peaceful revolution in Tahrir Square. But this time Sisi sent in tanks and soldiers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/egypt-braced-violence-morsi-supporters\">massacred at least 1,000 people</a>.</p> <p>Although Sisi came to power himself in the wake of mass demonstrations against Morsi, he seems to live in terror of the crowd. One of his first official acts was to ban any unauthorised assembly of more than 10 people. And each anniversary of the Tahrir Square uprising has brought bloodshed. In 2014, Sisi\u2019s government killed more than 60 protesters around the country at the time of the anniversary. A year later, 25 people were killed, including a woman poet who tried to lay a wreath of flowers in the square.</p> <p>In the days before his disappearance, computer records show that Regeni had laid low, mostly staying inside his apartment. He probably knew that the Egyptian authorities were working themselves up to a fever pitch in anticipation of the anniversary. Police had reportedly searched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/egyptian-police-raid-cairo-homes-2011-uprising\">5,000 apartments in Cairo</a>, in an effort to intimidate anyone who might be planning a demonstration. The raids were mostly concentrated in downtown Cairo, and did not include Regeni\u2019s apartment in the Dokki neighbourhood of Giza, a separate city that includes the site of the ancient pyramids.</p> <p>Although Regeni\u2019s mother had asked him to remain at home, where it was safe, he decided to attend the birthday party of a friend on the evening of 25 January. Downtown Cairo appeared to have returned to normal by nightfall and he and another<strong> </strong>friend agreed to meet at their usual place, not far from Tahrir Square. And so, Regeni walked into the force field of police activity in central Cairo, at its point of greatest alert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"404bcab5e086e105b1fd3a399ed7d05707635795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/404bcab5e086e105b1fd3a399ed7d05707635795/0_81_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tahrir Square is almost deserted and heavily policed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 25 January uprising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tahrir Square is almost deserted and heavily policed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 25 January uprising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 21 April, Reuters reported that Regeni had been picked up on the night of his disappearance by Egyptian police in downtown Cairo, near the Nasser metro stop. The news agency claimed that he was taken to a local police station for half an hour, then transferred to a Homeland Security compound in the area. The Egyptian government categorically denied the story, insisting that Regeni had never been in police custody. Reuters has stuck by its story, citing six independent but anonymous sources \u2013 three in the police and three in the security services. After publishing the report, Reuters\u2019 Cairo bureau chief was threatened with criminal prosecution and left the country. Egyptian police recently detained an Egyptian Reuters reporter for unspecified reasons.</p> <p>In May of this year, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior accidentally leaked an internal memo proposing a ban on all press coverage of the Regeni case.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is unclear whether Regeni\u2019s arrest was planned, or the result of a random sweep, but once they had him in custody, Egyptian authorities would have been quick to realise that they already had a file on him. \u201cThere is no question that he would have been monitored,\u201d said Marie Duboc, a French scholar who now teaches at the University of T\u00fcbingen, in Germany. Like Regeni, she has studied Egyptian labour unions. \u201cEven historical research that would seem harmless to any outsider, is still extremely sensitive in Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Duboc lived under surveillance from 2008 to 2010, when she was in Cairo, working on her own PhD. \u201cI would get strange phone calls from the Ministry of Higher Education, asking about my research,\u201d she told me. Later, when she visited Egypt to do follow-up work, she was turned away at the airport and barred from entering the country. Clearly, her name had been placed on a blacklist. (She has subsequently been allowed to return, she said.)</p> <p>Independent labour unions are a particularly sensitive topic in Egypt under the Sisi government, because unions were seen as a key galvanising force in the 2011 revolution. Traditionally, labour unions were government-run \u2013 more a means of controlling workers than representing their interests. The first independent trade union was formed in 2009, but the movement truly took flight after Tahrir Square. A thousand independent labour unions sprouted up after the fall of Mubarak and<strong>,</strong> within days of the 2011 revolution, the first federation of independent unions was formed. Many democracy advocates in and outside Egypt, including Giulio Regeni and his Cambridge supervisor, the Egyptian political scientist Maha Abdelrahman, regarded the independent trade union movement as a positive development, with the potential to strengthen civil society, democratic participation and workers\u2019 rights \u2013 all things that seem threatening to a military regime determined to repress autonomous sources of power.<strong> </strong></p> <p>On 11 December, six weeks before he disappeared, Regeni attended a public meeting of the independent unions. He was impressed by their combative energy and wrote an enthusiastic article about it, together with a friend, which they published (in Italian) under a pseudonym. But something disconcerting happened at the meeting: although Regeni sat to the side and was not on the roster of speakers, a woman in a headscarf came over and photographed him. Regeni was shaken and told several friends about it. It was the first sign that he might be being watched.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s particular area of research was a nascent independent union of street vendors, a large group that was difficult to control and a cause of considerable concern to the government. Egypt has an estimated five million street vendors, who sell everything from snacks and drinks to cheap clothes and kitchen utensils. In a country of 80 to 90 million people, as many as a quarter of Egyptian families depend to some degree on the income of a street vendor.</p> <p>The Sisi government regards these workers with clear suspicion. Street vendors moved rapidly into Tahrir Square during the massive demonstrations of 2011. Most were simply looking to make a little money, selling food and drink to protesters, but their very presence was viewed by the authorities as aiding and abetting the revolution. Since then, the government has sought unsuccessfully to remove street vendors from the centre of Cairo, using fines, prison sentences and violence.</p> <p>\u201cAfter repeated failures to clear Cairo\u2019s city centre of street vendors \u2026 the Cairo governorate issued a shrewd decree,\u201d wrote Abdelrahman, in an article she published last year. The decree required store owners to report any street vendors working near their shops, or risk losing their own trading licenses. This served a dual purpose of forcing shopkeepers to keep tabs on street vendors for the government and pushing the vendors into the hands of the police.</p> <p>In order to remain on the street and avoid police harassment, street vendors were themselves expected to let police know of anything or anyone unusual or suspicious.<strong> </strong>\u201cOne of the things that has happened in Egypt in the past few years, which we didn\u2019t fully recognise, is that the street pedlars are frequently used as police informants,\u201d said one Cambridge scholar, who preferred not to be named.<strong> </strong>Scattered around the city, present on nearly every block and square, the street vendors form a natural surveillance network.</p> <p>For his doctorate, Regeni was engaged in what is known as \u201cparticipatory research\u201d \u2013 a method that involves spending substantial amounts of time in the field with one\u2019s subjects. While this is standard practice, a young Arabic-speaking foreigner, hanging out for hours in street markets, and asking about unionisation, future organising plans and attitudes toward the government, is likely to have looked extremely suspicious to most Egyptians \u2013 who have been told over and over to be on the lookout for foreign agents.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s good intentions may also have blinded him to how his actions could have been interpreted. During the autumn of 2015,<strong> </strong>he had learned of a grant of up to \u00a310,000 issued by a British foundation to fund a development project. He was interested in applying because he could use the money to support his own PhD research and help the people he was studying. He mentioned his idea to a leader of the independent street vendors\u2019 union, Mohamed Abdallah. Abdallah\u2019s level of interest \u2013 in the money, rather than the project \u2013 worried Regeni. As a result, Regeni dropped the idea. Still, news of a young well-funded foreigner, ready to finance an internal Egyptian movement, may have struck police as exactly the kind of foreign conspiracy they wanted to stamp out.</p> <p>Those most familiar with Regeni\u2019s work in Egypt dismiss the idea that he could have discovered anything valuable or threatening to the Egyptian government. \u201cGiulio had been out doing field work, talking to street pedlars, maybe six or seven times,\u201d says one of his close friends in Cairo. \u201cHe would have known only a fraction of what any of the Egyptian government\u2019s informants would have been able to tell them.\u201d Even the independent union meeting that he attended and wrote about was a well-publicised event, authorised and monitored by the authorities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"edbfbf755b25d3d9eaac61083f8a0321e4f734b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edbfbf755b25d3d9eaac61083f8a0321e4f734b6/0_0_4832_2899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street vendor near Tahrir Square, in 2013.

One of Sisi\u2019s first moves was to make the chief of the federation of independent unions his minister of labour, an appointment intended to co-opt the movement and bring it under government control. Just this summer, in a further threat to their independence, a new measure was introduced, forcing the independents to re-register or risk decertification.</p> <p>And yet, to a government on constant alert to security threats, there may have been much in the meeting that Regeni attended \u2013 and in the article he wrote about it \u2013 that the government would have found alarming. One of the proposals was for a \u201cseries of regional conferences that lead after a few months to a large national assembly and perhaps a unitary protest (\u201cTo Tahrir!\u201d said several of those present.)</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s article ends with a few sentences that look like fighting words. \u201cIn the repressive context of the Sisi government, the fact that there are popular and spontaneous initiatives that break the wall of fear is significant and represent in and of themselves an important push for change.</p> <p>\u201cTo challenge the state of emergency, the government\u2019s appeals to stability and social harmony in the name of the \u2018war on terrorism\u2019, means today, even indirectly, to challenge the very basis on which this regime bases its existence and its repression of civil society.\u201d</p> <p>On 7 January, just a month after the union meeting, Mohamed Abdallah denounced Regeni to the authorities. After Regeni\u2019s death, he told the Arabic-language newspaper Aswat Masriya that he became suspicious of Regeni because his questions \u201cwere not about street vendors \u2026 and had other intentions \u2026 I am not an informant but I believe I am protecting my country.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian government says that as a result of Abdallah\u2019s tip-off, it placed Regeni under investigation, but decided after a few days that his research was of \u201cno interest to national security\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During the nine days after his disappearance, Regeni\u2019s case became an international cause celebre, inspiring the Twitter hashtag #whereisgiulio? It was also a source of serious concern at the Italian Embassy in Cairo, which was preparing for the visit of a major business delegation, led by the Italian minister of economic development, Federica Guidi. On 3 February, while Guidi was meeting with Sisi and other Egyptian officials, a mini-van driver got a puncture on the road from Cairo to Alexandria. While fixing his flat tyre, he discovered Giulio Regeni\u2019s body.</p> <p>The Egyptian forensic expert who first examined the corpse initially said that the multiple signs of torture suggested Regeni had suffered a \u201cslow death\u201d. This claim, however, was quickly retracted. The deputy head of criminal investigations in Giza, the city where the body was found, told the Associated Press that initial investigations showed Regeni was killed in a road accident.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Regeni case had become a huge story in Italy. In the following days, as pressure mounted, Egyptian officials began floating various theories in the local press: that Regeni was gay and the victim of a crime of passion, that he was involved in a drug deal gone bad, or that he was a foreign spy.</p> <p>Upon further investigation, these theories fell apart. The digital record in the possession of Italian investigators showed that Regeni had a girlfriend in Ukraine, and there were Skype logs, emails and texts to prove it. His computer, email and bank records showed no trace of contact with any intelligence services. \u201cWe had his bank accounts, which showed he had almost no money,\u201d said Alessandra Ballerini, the lawyer for the Regeni family. \u201cThis is a boy who wore his father\u2019s old bathing suit and used his mother\u2019s old backpack because he didn\u2019t want to be a financial burden to his family.\u201d</p> <p>Most important was the rigorous second autopsy carried out in Italy, using Cat scans and tissue analysis. The Egyptian pathologist\u2019s report had said that Regeni was killed by a blow to the head. More detailed analysis in Italy showed that he had been hit repeatedly on the head, but that these blows were not fatal. Blood had coagulated around the points where he had been hit, and other cuts, bruises and abrasions on his body showed different stages of healing. This indicated that Regeni had been tortured more than once \u2013 and that days had passed between his initial torture, later sessions, and the moment of his death. He was covered with cuts and burns, and his hands and feet had been broken. Even his teeth were broken. His torturers appear to have carved letters into his flesh, a well-documented practice of the Egyptian police.</p> <p>The forensic doctors at the University of Rome used a highly accurate technique for determining time of death, which measures potassium levels in the vitreous fluid of the eyes. They established that Regeni died between 10pm on 1 February and 10pm on 2 February. \u201cThis is important because it means that he was alive for at least six or seven days and tortured repeatedly during that time,\u201d said one Italian investigator. The cause of death was a broken neck.

Sisi suddenly granted an interview to the editor-in-chief of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, which was published on 16 March and dominated by the Regeni case. As the autopsy evidence implicated the Egyptian police, Sisi seemed to suggest that Regeni\u2019s death was part of an elaborate conspiracy.</p> <p>\u201cWhy was the body found right when the minister of economic development and the Italian delegation were here to strengthen our cooperation?\u201d he asked. Sisi also mentioned the shooting down of a Russian tourist airliner in October 2015. \u201cRussian tourism and Italian tourism [in Egypt] have collapsed to nothing \u2026 Fill in the dots of these different episodes and you have a clear picture of an attempt to strike the Egyptian economy and isolate Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Just days later, in early March, a witness stepped forward with a new hypothesis. An Egyptian engineer claimed that he had seen Regeni, on the afternoon before his disappearance, having a furious argument with another foreigner near the Italian consulate. The engineer, Mohammed Fawzy, then appeared on a popular Egyptian TV programme to say that he thought that the Italian government knew who killed Regeni, but was hiding the evidence. Echoing Sisi, Fawzy speculated that whoever killed Regeni was trying to sabotage commercial relations between Egypt and Italy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Relatives of the alleged criminal gang have insisted that its members were killed in cold blood at close range</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The engineer\u2019s story collapsed when the Italian prosecutors\u2019<strong> </strong>digital archive showed that Regeni had been at home all afternoon on 24 January. He had been on Skype with his girlfriend, chatting as they streamed the same movie and watched it together, 3,500km apart. Mobile phone records also showed that the engineer was not in the neighbourhood of the Italian consulate in Cairo at the time of the alleged quarrel.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, on 24 March, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior announced a definitive resolution to the case. The ministry announced on its Facebook page that the perpetrators were a gang of four men \u201cspecialised in impersonating policemen, kidnapping foreigners and stealing their money\u201d.</p> <p>As proof, the government displayed a tray of objects that included Regeni\u2019s passport, Italian identity card, a credit card and his ID card from Cambridge University. Not only had the Egyptian police found the culprits, they had already killed them. \u201cIn an exchange of fire between police forces and the men,\u201d the ministry explained, \u201call the gang members were killed.\u201d</p> <p>However, phone records placed the leader of the gang more than 100km away from Cairo at the time of Regeni\u2019s disappearance. Relatives of the alleged criminal gang have insisted that its members were killed in cold blood at close range, rather than in a shootout. The government\u2019s scenario also made little sense: why would a band of thieves keep Regeni\u2019s identity cards, given that they would provide incriminating evidence that tied them to the crime? Why would they torture a robbery victim for a week without ever asking for ransom money or using his credit card? Egyptian officials have now accepted that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/new-twist-in-case-of-italian-student-giulio-regenis-in-egypt\">is unlikely the dead men had anything to do with Regeni\u2019s death</a>. In fact, by producing Regeni\u2019s passport and identity cards, the Egyptian police have apparently incriminated themselves.</p> <p>The string of improbable cover stories was becoming an embarrassment even in Egypt. In a rare public rebuke, Mohammed Abdel-Hadi Allam, the editor-in-chief of al-Ahram, a government-owned newspaper, wrote: \u201cThe naive stories about Regeni\u2019s death have hurt Egypt at home and abroad and offered some people grounds to judge what is going on in the country now to be no different from what went on before the 25 January revolution.\u201d He compared the Regeni case to that of Khaled Said, a young Egyptian who had been seized by police in an internet cafe in 2010, and beaten to death. Photographs of Said\u2019s body taken by his brother were posted on Facebook and became an important rallying cry for the protesters who helped bring down Hosni Mubarak.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite clear indications of involvement by the nation\u2019s security forces, the Egyptian government is left with what might be called the stupidity defence. As the Egyptian ambassador to Rome put it: \u201cWe\u2019re not so naive as to kill a young Italian and throw away his body the day of Minister Guidi\u2019s visit to Cairo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are two theories,\u201d said Karim Abdelrady, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. \u201cOne is that there is a feud between the Egyptian secret services, and one branch dumped the body in order to embarrass the other.\u201d A long, detailed anonymous letter that was sent to the Italian embassy in Bern, Switzerland and published by La Repubblica described complicated machinations within different branches of the Egyptian secret services, and reported that Regeni\u2019s body had been wrapped in an Egyptian army blanket, as if to direct suspicion towards the military police. But Italian investigators say that they have no way to confirm or deny the information in this document.</p> <p>\u201cThe other theory,\u201d explained Abdelrady, \u201cis that the Egyptian police thought they could get away with it by blaming a band of criminals, and that people would not think the Egyptian police would be so stupid as to leave the body where it could be found.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis case cannot be understood without understanding the context of generalised paranoia in the country,\u201d said one foreign scholar who has lived in Cairo for many years. \u201cFor the last three years, many high-level government officials, including members of the military, have spoken publicly about foreign conspiracies to undermine Egypt. This is bound to seep down to all levels of the police and military.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b46d91361a968c7e8420a72690d3578effa7635b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b46d91361a968c7e8420a72690d3578effa7635b/0_40_550_550/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Egyptian government put Giulio Regeni\u2019s possessions on display in an attempt to prove they had found his killers.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Egyptian government put Giulio Regeni\u2019s possessions on display in an attempt to prove they had found his killers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost immediately after taking over during the summer of 2013, the Sisi regime seemed anxious to stress that the 2011 revolution was not the result of popular dissatisfaction, but collusion between outside powers and Egyptian subversives.</p> <p>Since then, the human rights situation in Egypt \u2013 which was never good under Mubarak \u2013 has continued to deteriorate. There are now an estimated 40,000 political prisoners. Between late January and November 2015, Egypt\u2019s Al Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence documented 281 extrajudicial killings, 119 murders of prisoners in detention, 440 cases of torture in police stations,<strong> </strong>and 335 forced disappearances. After documenting these cases, the Nadeem Center was forced to shut down, allegedly for violating its charter as a medical organisation.</p> <p>While in the past, Egypt had tried to avoid trouble with foreigners, it now seemed intent on making public examples of them. \u201cGiulio died like an Egyptian,\u201d says Ballerini, the Regeni family\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>The climate of xenophobia and police brutality in Egypt has raised questions for Italian prosecutors as to whether it was appropriate for Cambridge University to allow a young foreign student<strong> </strong>to go Cairo and undertake field research into such a delicate topic. Regeni\u2019s supervisor, Maha Abdelrahman, is very knowledgeable on this subject: she has been a vocal critic of Egypt\u2019s military governments and has written extensively about the country\u2019s unions and protest movements. In early 2015, she wrote about the tendency of turning ordinary citizens into police informants and the increasing criminalisation of previously harmless activities.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Relations between the Italian investigators and Cambridge University got off to a bad start when Abdelrahman declined to hand over her emails and text messages after the funeral. She also kept the police waiting for three hours, turning up for her interview at the police station at 10pm. Abdelrahman\u2019s reluctance to hand over her personal data is understandable, given her background \u2013 she had grown up in Egypt under a military regime, when a person would never have given anything to the police if they could help it. Abdelrahman has chosen not to speak to the press since Regeni\u2019s death, but told colleagues at Cambridge that she cooperated with the Italian police the day of the funeral.</p> <p>The Italian prosecutors have been keen to find out whose idea it was that Regeni should write his PhD dissertation on independent unions, and the street vendors\u2019 union especially. When detectives asked her whether she had pushed Regeni to pursue his research into that particular topic, or if she had been aware that he might have felt in danger, Abdelrahman felt that she was being treated like a suspect.</p> <p>The lead prosecutor, Sergio Colaiocco, travelled to England in June, having sent a request to two Cambridge professors for an interview. The university says it received no notification from the Italian government, but learned of the request informally from Cambridge police. The two professors initially agreed to meet with the prosecutor, but then declined to be interviewed. This prompted a brief firestorm, with the Italian deputy foreign minister, Mario Giro, taking to Twitter to shame Cambridge for its lack of cooperation. An Italian professor who teaches at Oxford, Federico Varese, also criticised Cambridge in an interview with La Repubblica: \u201cThe university bears some measure of moral responsibility for not protecting [Regeni] and not grasping that the kind of \u2018participatory research\u2019 he was doing increased the risk. It seems that their priority is only to protect Cambridge from possible legal responsibility and a request for damages.\u201d</p> <p>In June, Cambridge\u2019s vice-chancellor and a number of academics signed a letter stating that the university had not received any request for help from the Italian authorities, and that Regeni had no particular reason to be afraid for his safety, since \u201cno foreign student, researcher or academic\u201d had ever been murdered in Egypt. The university subsequently hired an Italian attorney to facilitate relations with the Italian government and has received, and fully complied with, a request for various documents in the Regeni case.</p> <p>\u201cI think this polemic with Cambridge has been overblown,\u201d said one close friend of Regeni\u2019s in Egypt. He pointed out that Abdelrahman had continued to do the same kind of field research that Regeni was pursuing. \u201cShe was not a professor who remained in the library and sent out her students to do field work. The truth about Giulio\u2019s murder is in Egypt, not Cambridge, in the increasing paranoia of the regime.\u201d</p> <p>In December, 2015, he said, Egyptian police detained a young French scholar who was conducting research on a workers\u2019 movement, keeping her in jail overnight. \u201cThese kinds of things had been happening more often \u2013 but they go unreported because the scholars don\u2019t say anything, so that they can return to Egypt in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian government\u2019s softer and more cooperative approach in the last few months suggests, however, that it now accepts an urgent need for reputation management. The government and the Regeni family have agreed, in principle, to meet, which the family hopes will push the investigation another few steps closer to the truth.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s death is a mystery hiding in plain sight: his seemingly inexplicable, brutal torture and killing reflects the demise of Egyptian democracy, the stripping away of already limited liberties and protections, the brutal crackdown on dissent, the increase in torture and forced disappearances, the tendency to blame the country\u2019s problems on outside conspiracies. In this closed world, Giulio Regeni, with his ability to speak five languages, his mobile phone full of foreign and Egyptian contacts, might look like a spy, and police, in a system with little or no accountability, might make reckless mistakes.</p> <p>The Egyptian prosecutors seemed unable to understand why their Italian colleagues did not accept the evidence they were given. \u201cThe Egyptian authorities seemed shocked that our police kept asking questions after they came up with the \u2018gang\u2019 of killers and the tray with Regeni\u2019s documents,\u201d said one Italian investigator. \u201cTheir attitude seemed to be: \u2018hey, we found the criminals, we have even killed them. This should put an end to it.\u2019\u201d Surely, they thought, concerns of state \u2013 the close relations between two nations, billions of dollars of commercial ties \u2013 should count more than the life of one person, who had been killed by mistake. They seemed to find it impossible to understand that the Italian government would have to account to public opinion and could not, even if it had wanted to, accept a flimsy, implausible account of Regeni\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThis didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d Heba Morayef, an Egyptian human rights advocate, said. \u201cIt came after three years of almost constant rising xenophobic propaganda, fed by the security services, encouraging citizens\u2019 arrests of foreigners, and so on \u2026 There are so many people in the Egyptian security forces that talk about this foreign conspiracy, that more and more people start to believe it.

  "<p>A record number of people and organisations have been nominated for the 2016 Nobel peace prize, which will be announced on Friday. This year 376 candidates \u2013 228 individuals and 148 organisations \u2013 are in contention for the award. </p> <p>The selection of Nobel prizewinners is always shrouded in secrecy \u2013 the names of nominees are not released until 50 years after the decision is made, which makes predicting difficult, but here are some of those that Guardian writers think have a greater chance.</p> <h2>Syrian White Helmets</h2> <p>During the past five years of war in Syria, the White Helmets, a group of volunteer rescue workers, have run towards bombs in opposition-held areas to rescue tens of thousands \u2013 by some estimates up to 60,000 people \u2013 from the ruins and battlefields.</p> <p>There has been no more dangerous place in the world to be a first responder for most of that time. The ranks of the group, made up of pre-war Syria\u2019s middle classes, have lost 160 of their own, most killed by jets that have returned to target buildings they had already bombed.</p> <p>They are often the first on the scene of any airstrike, picking through rubble and cradling the dead and injured, wearing the distinctive white helmets that gave them their name. Their motto throughout Syria\u2019s withering conflict has been \u201cto save one life is to save all of humanity\u201d.</p> <p>The volunteers have been one of the few signs of hope in a desperate and destructive war that otherwise shows little mercy. They have been hailed across rebel areas of Syria and in Europe as a model of community cooperation and coexistence \u2013 and of success. Russian and Syrian attacks on medical centres have tried to deny care to the dying, but the White Helmets have defied that, giving comfort and life-saving care where no one else can.</p> <p>Their work has made them a prized military target for pro-regime forces, who regularly attack ambulances as soon as they arrive at the scene of a strike. The lethal threat has not been a deterrent; to many among the White Helmets it has instead been an incentive to continue serving. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Martin Chulov</em></p> <h2>Angela Merkel</h2> <p>Were Angela Merkel to win the Nobel peace prize it would hang like an albatross around her neck.

They are asking whether the influx of refugees \u2013 more than 1 million last year, and several hundreds of thousands expected by the end of this year \u2013 is making Germany a less secure place. They also worry about the impact of refugees on integration, gender equality, public services and the labour market.</p> <p>Merkel is under huge pressure to show her government is able to deal with such concerns. In his speech to the UN refugee summit in New York in September, Barack Obama thanked Merkel and the Germans for their efforts in dealing with the refugee crisis, an example of the moral pressure Merkel is under to ensure she does not do a U-turn despite growing domestic pressure.</p> <p>Merkel would be the first to agree she does not need a Nobel peace prize to add to the pressure, and the jury should do her and Germany a favour by waiting, at the very least, until she retires. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Kate Connolly</em></p> <h2>Pope Francis</h2> <p>No pope has ever won the Nobel peace prize before, but Francis is seen as a frontrunner for the accolade this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c111f4b0d777fa9981e8cd0bbdac25c5b6b9a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c111f4b0d777fa9981e8cd0bbdac25c5b6b9a29/0_0_2141_2674/801.jpg\" alt=\"Pope Francis.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pope Francis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Sekretarev/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since becoming pontiff three-and-a-half years ago, he has won the hearts of millions of people \u2013 not only Catholics \u2013 across the world for his strong stance on issues such as refugees, poverty and climate change. </p> <p>Francis has repeatedly implored politicians and citizens to offer a generous welcome to refugees.

No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 months to two years.</p> <p>Posner wrote that Pence\u2019s idea of exclusion by nationality is: \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/indiana-refugee-resettlement-mike-pence-court-decision\">Court rejects Pence's efforts to deter refugees as 'nightmare speculation'</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2e4ebe4b01506cbf24df9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-gabbatt\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T23:10:16.416Z\">12.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prepare for the clash of veeps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Like the Gulf stream, or a young Republican who doesn\u2019t wear beige chinos, we know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a> and Tim Kaine exist \u2013 we just don\u2019t really see them.</p> <p>With the media focused on Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-interview-bill-hillary-clinton.html\">near daily</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/trump-overnight-media-tweets/\">indiscretions</a>, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/hillary-clinton-twitter-national-service-scholarships-trump\">various</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-affairs-joel-benenson-229046\">responses</a> to those indiscretions, both the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential nominees have been forced into the shadows.<br></p> <p>But no more.

This year, the Trump Foundation made its most wide-ranging request for donations yet: It set up a public website, donaldtrumpforvets.com, to gather donations that Trump said would be passed on to veterans\u2019 groups.</p> <p>But the Trump Foundation never registered under article 7A of New York\u2019s Executive Law, as is required for any charity soliciting more than $25,000 a year from the public.

The president sat down with Jonathan Chait to discuss five key situations during his presidency: the Republicans, Obamacare, BP oil spill, Cuba and drones.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very in-depth chat with Obama, who delves into what sort of legacy he\u2019ll leave behind. Here he is on drone strikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I will say, though, is that the critique of drones has been important, because it has ensured that you don\u2019t have this institutional comfort and inertia with what looks like a pretty antiseptic way of disposing of enemies. I will say that what prompted a lot of the internal reforms we put in place had less to do with what the left or <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/donate-now?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&amp;gclid=CJuEsvCouM8CFQEkhgodwA4PCA\">Human Rights Watch</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/\">Amnesty International</a> or other organizations were saying and had more to do with me looking at sort of the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up and the routineness with which, early in my presidency, you were seeing both DOD and CIA and our intelligence teams think about this. And it troubled me, because I think you could see, over the horizon, a situation in which, without Congress showing much interest in restraining actions with authorizations that were written really broadly, you end up with a president who can carry on perpetual wars all over the world, and a lot of them covert, without any accountability or democratic debate.</p> <p>But I will say that having these nonprofits continue to question and protest ensured that, having made that initial decision, we kept on going and that it got pushed all the way through. And it\u2019s not \u2014 as I announced when we released our best estimates of the civilian casualties \u2014 it\u2019s not a perfect solution. I think America will continue to have work to do in finding this balance between not elevating every terrorist attack into a full-blown war but not either leaving ourselves exposed to attacks or, alternatively, pretending as if we can just take shots wherever we want, whenever we want, and not be answerable to anybody.
