In a keenly awaited ruling, France\u2019s highest administrative court, the Conseil d\u2019Etat, today overturned the burkini ban because, the judges said, \u201cit represents a severe and manifestly illegal threat to fundamental freedoms that are the freedom of coming and going, freedom of conscience and personal freedom\u201d.</p> <p>The Conseil d\u2019Etat gave no credence&#xa0;whatsoever to claims that the burkini ban, as some of its defenders have claimed, was necessary to uphold&#xa0;<em>la\u00efcit\u00e9, </em>France\u2019s brand of secularism; nor was it a way of protecting \u201cpublic order\u201d. In a context&#xa0;where France is still officially in a state of emergency following the recent terror attacks in the country, this is significant.</p> <p>It took France a long time to find the right balance between respecting the Catholic traditions of many of its people and implementing its 1905 law of separation of church and state. In recent decades, what has been unfolding \u2013 and has now taken on an increasingly hysterical dimension \u2013 is a new quest for a democratic notion of inclusiveness within French society for Muslims, especially French-born youngsters who feel disenfranchised. None of this has been made easier by the fact that France still has to come to terms with its colonial past, and that terrorism has made toxic passions swirl.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat gave no credence to claims that the burkini ban was necessary to uphold France\u2019s brand of secularism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1909, the Conseil d\u2019Etat had to rule on an issue not altogether different from today\u2019s burkini question. The city of Sens had at the time outlawed religious processions and even the wearing of cassocks on its streets. Anti-clerical sentiment was so high that the very public appearance of religious clothing was itself deemed disruptive.</p> <p>But the judges struck down the ban with arguments that strikingly echo today\u2019s ruling. And they included a reminder that the 1905 law was about freedom of conscience just as much as it was about ensuring the \u201cneutrality\u201d of the republic in all things religious (the latter point being, by the way, the reason&#xa0;for the 2004 veil ban in French&#xa0;state schools). Article 1 of the 1905 law guarantees the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of any faith, for which \u201crestrictions\u201d can&#xa0;only be made \u201cin the interest of public order\u201d.</p> <p>French politics today has been upended by the public order question: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/26/nicolas-sarkozy-ban-burkini-france-presidential-election-video\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy called this week</a> for the banning of all religious clothing in public areas \u2013 a message intended to court far-right and anti-Muslim voters ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/26/nicolas-sarkozy-ban-burkini-france-presidential-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xd6t\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2686545\"            data-video-name=\"Nicolas Sarkozy demands burkini ban across France \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c031efe4b0fe30498a4fab\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/26/160826SarkozyBurkini1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/26/160826SarkozyBurkini1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/26/160826SarkozyBurkini1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/26/nicolas-sarkozy-ban-burkini-france-presidential-election-video\">Nicolas Sarkozy demands burkini ban across France \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Claims that the burkini is a threat to \u201chygiene\u201d or \u201cgood manners\u201d have been exposed as completely groundless, but it has been trickier to sweep aside claims that, in France\u2019s tense atmosphere, the burkini might set off scuffles or other violent incidents on French beaches. Many people reading this will&#xa0;immediately jump: applied to beaches in Britain, does that mean a Sikh wearing a turban, or any other person carrying \u201cconspicuous\u201d religious&#xa0;clothing, would represent some sort of risk?</p> <p>However, it is possible that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\" title=\"\">mayor of Nice</a> \u2013 a city still traumatised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/15/nice-terror-attack-truck\" title=\"\">July\u2019s terror attack</a>, and where there have been signs of inter-ethnic tensions \u2013 may have had reasonable concerns that racist&#xa0;people might want to attack a woman wearing the burkini. Of course, the first thing to say about this is that upholding public order should be the responsibility of the police \u2013 not of women, who must be free to choose their clothes.</p> <p>But the reason the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, recently shifted from talking about the \u201censlavement\u201d of women (as a way of explaining his support for the ban) to mentioning \u201cpublic order\u201d is that this offered a potentially more solid basis for his views \u2013 which this week led to a show of divisions within the government. Now the highest court has clearly ruled that neither \u201cpublic order\u201d nor \u201cemotions linked to terrorist acts\u201d can be invoked to legitimise the ban.</p> <p>President Hollande has carefully stayed away from the arguments, no doubt waiting for the ruling. But that does little to hide the fact that France\u2019s&#xa0;second socialist president under the Fifth Republic has failed to genuinely reach out to Muslims, especially the young, to reassure them&#xa0;that they will be considered equal&#xa0;citizens, and need not feel overlooked. Again, there is historical precedent: in the 1980s, when the Front&#xa0;National first reared its head, Hollande\u2019s predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/28/mitterrand-study-ambiguity-philip-short-review\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand</a>, also missed an opportunity to convey that sense of inclusiveness, despite many slogans heard at the time (such as <em>touche pas \u00e0 mon pote</em>, for those who remember).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/france-burkini-ban-secularist-equality-muslim\">France\u2019s burkini ban exposes the hypocrisy of its secularist state | Iman Amrani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The roots of France\u2019s republican model go back to the battle between church and state, and also to its colonial past.

It will hopefully restore common decency and the rule of law, and emphasise that the burkini does not in itself threaten public order. If that had been the case, then France\u2019s state of emergency would have meant that, officially, citizens of different backgrounds or faiths could no longer safely sit on a beach together. The ruling isn\u2019t the solution to all the issues that have to be dealt with \u2013 that\u2019s some way off. But hopefully it will give a troubled nation some breathing space.</p>",

Some races are better at some things than others\u201d, he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Taylor also sees the racial separatism he strives for as a matter of \u201cfreedom of association\u201d, and denies that the alt-right is a hate movement, as Clinton has claimed. </p> <p>\u201cIf a white person says, \u2018I like being white, and I prefer my associates to be white\u2019, that\u2019s hate? Why?\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not be taboo to talk about these things.\u201d</p> <p>Political scientist George Hawley, who authored a book on the crisis of mainstream conservatism in the face of the challenge of the far right, said that until recently, mainstream conservatives were partly responsible for enforcing whatever taboos existed on this kind of open racial language and thinking. </p> <p>\u201cThe mainstream conservative movement has never wanted any kind of formal relationship with Taylor or his organisation. In fact, an association with American Renaissance could be damaging to a conservative\u2019s career.\u201d</p> <p>This enmity is mutual. Taylor said: \u201cMainstream conservatives have completely conceded the question of race, at the cost of their own political fortunes.\u201d </p> <p>Taylor has been a presence on the racially motivated fringes of the right for more than a quarter of a century, following the founding of his New Century Foundation in 1990, and American Renaissance in 1991. In articles \u2013 many written by Taylor \u2013 at events and in podcasts, the website stresses white people are discriminated against, black people are inclined to crime and mainstream conservatives who deny these assertions this are culpable and headed for disaster. </p> <p>According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Taylor\u2019s career has involved lending a <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jared-taylor\">\u201cpseudo-academic polish\u201d</a> to racial thought. He presents as urbane: he is a trilingual Yale graduate, and his work has mainly involved producing \u201cresearch\u201d that backs up his positions on race. </p> <p>His influence can be seen in the alt-right Twitter accounts that brandish IQ tables and selective crime statistics to bolster their arguments on race. </p> <p> He has not only adopted the alt-right tag, first coined by white nationalist Richard Spencer, but also their online methods. In addition to the website, he is active on Twitter, and acts as a moderator on alt-right subreddits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Chip Berlet, a veteran researcher of the far right, finds the mainstreaming of Taylor\u2019s views concerning, even if Trump loses the election. </p> <p>\u201cThe problem is not that they will take state power, because they almost never do. The problem is that in the course of this social movement, in action and propaganda, they target scapegoated groups of people who become victims of violence,\u201d said Berlet.</p> <p>While the Republican presidential nominee has apparently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">softened his stance on immigration</a> as of this week, Taylor said, \u201cMr Trump speaks in elliptical phrases that sometimes make it hard to pin him down. At this point all talk about \u2018softening\u2019 seems to be speculation. I will wait until he gives that postponed speech on immigration policy.\u201d </p> <p>Berlet, too, is unconvinced and called it an insincere pivot to recover lost ground. But even if it were, it could not remedy Trump\u2019s actions in helping bring figures like Taylor to prominence.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t undo the damage he\u2019s done. The antagonisms he\u2019s bred will be longstanding, and will be apparent well beyond the election,\u201d said Berlet. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

I hadn\u2019t realised quite how damaged America\u2019s self-esteem was.</p> <p>That a significant section of people feel left behind by mainstream politics is clear from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/britain-right-wing-brexit-america-trump\" title=\"\">rise of populist movements</a> on both sides of the Atlantic. That Trump can make their lives better seems considerably less likely even than Farage being able to do the same. The only way these two men can show their supporters how much they care about them is to display how much they despise almost everyone else. Yet the suspension of disbelief holds, and shows no sign of breaking in the short- or even medium-term future.</p> <p>A highly indifferent former City trader cosies up to the bizarre confection of megalomania that is Trump, yet the sense of rebellion against elites among their supporters is real. It may seem odd, considering he resembles a picture too hideous even for the attic, but Trump frequently reminds me of a line in The Picture of Dorian Gray: \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray\" title=\"\">You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found</a>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These two men show their supporters how much they care about them by displaying how much they despise everyone else</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is no need for a word cloud after a Farage event these days, because his shtick can be reduced down to about four phrases that would sound patronising in any less looking-glass a world. \u201cLittle people\u201d. \u201cOrdinary people\u201d. \u201cDecent people\u201d. \u201cReal people\u201d. Farage thinks America\u2019s infinitely superior polling is as out of whack as the UK\u2019s, so you can see why Trump likes him so much right now. But on the off chance that the Donald isn\u2019t triumphantly landing his private jet on Pennsylvania Avenue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/election-2016-100-days-facts-and-figures\" title=\"\">on 9 November</a>, I\u2019d like to see Trump launch a range of colognes to go with his established lines, <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/merchandise/trump-fragrance/\" title=\"\">Success by Trump, and Empire by Trump</a>. Why not market Little People by Trump, Real People by Trump, Ordinary People by Trump, and Decent People by Trump?</p> <p>After all, Trump is incapable of having an experience without wondering primarily how it might be monetised. Persistent rumours suggest he is <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/donald-trump-tv-network\" title=\"\">eyeing the establishment of a rightwing news network, post-election</a>, which would allow him to maximise the opportunity of the audience he has acquired.</p> <p>Perhaps Farage envisages a role for himself on this putative network. It would be something to fill the time and keep him in a version of the limelight before his inevitable return to lead Ukip \u2013 or whatever successor to the party Banks is planning \u2013 in time for the 2020 election. As Farage was saying with hilarious specificity by the end of his own resignation speech: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader\" title=\"\">Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see where we are in two and a half years\u2019 time</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Any Farage show on the Trump network wouldn\u2019t be within four hours of prime time, obviously. I see him in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/14/late-night-radio-djs-confession-priest-iain-lee-hattie-pearson-pete-price-dotun-adebayo\" title=\"\">Alan Partridge graveyard slot</a> \u2013 3am till 6am \u2013 taking calls from deranged insomniac survivalists and consoling himself with the thought that there are far higher callings than spending time with one\u2019s family.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps he prefers the smaller pond. Farage\u2019s failure to go as far as endorsing Trump suggests he has more than one eye on how it might play back where it really matters to him, while his reaction to Hillary\u2019s speech could scarcely have been more UK-centric, leading with: \u201cShe sounds rather like Bob Geldof and can\u2019t accept Brexit.\u201d If that line was designed to land anywhere in the States, then Farage probably wants to buy in some new writers.</p> <p>Still, look at him now \u2013 all dressed up and doing the town. As I was sorry to have to observe before the referendum vote itself, all those who voted out for reasons of sovereignty or whatnot would eventually discover that what they really ended up voting for is something embodied in Farage. A lot of those same people are always complaining we don\u2019t make and export anything in this country any more. I beg to differ: we make desperately grateful straight men for Donald Trump.</p>",

After all, it\u2019s much easier to horrify moderate voters \u2013 and motivate the party base \u2013 with Trump\u2019s plans to deport 11 million US residents, close the borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China and cozy up to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In this target-rich environment, who has the time or energy to go after his credibility?</p> <p>Why, Donald Trump does, of course.</p> <p>This week the GOP nominee managed to flip-flop on his signature issue: the one that got him through all those noisy primary debates. The one that allowed him to destroy most of his rivals and connect at a visceral level with the party\u2019s nativist core.</p> <p>Of Trump\u2019s top three opponents \u2013 Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush \u2013 two are Latino and one is married to a Latina. Trump tarred all three, despite their protestations, with the same brush of being soft on immigration.</p> <p>And then, out of sheer desperation or stupidity, Trump decided this week to copy them. At a town hall-style show on Fox News, hosted by his unofficial adviser Sean Hannity, the GOP candidate <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/24/trump-asks-his-supporters-to-weigh-in-on-deportation-policy/\">rolled out</a> his kinder, gentler immigration policy to a mixed response from the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have somebody that\u2019s been in the country for 20 years, has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK. Do we take him and the family, her or him or whatever, and send them out? Are they gone?\u201d Trump mused out loud.</p> <p>\u201cOr when somebody really has shown \u2013 you know, it\u2019s called like the merit system \u2013 other than they did break the law in the first place, OK \u2026 So do we tell these people to get out, number one, or do we work with them and let them stay in some cases?\u201d</p> <p>And so it came to pass, with a rambling response on Fox News, that Trump demolished the foundation of his own campaign. Which naturally left his audience a little confused.</p> <p>Trump may have previously given the impression that he thought all these undocumented immigrants were little more than a gang of murderers and rapists. But now, after some reflection, he concedes there may be some decent families mixed in with the gangs of thugs. Under Trump\u2019s new plan, there would be no citizenship for these people, but there would be legal status after the payment of some back taxes.</p> <p>This plan is otherwise known as the Obama proposal for comprehensive immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me,\u201d he explained on Fox News. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve said, Mr Trump, I love you, but to take a person that\u2019s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out. It\u2019s so tough, Mr Trump. I mean, I have it all the time! It\u2019s a very, very hard thing,\u201d</p> <p>Then he turned to his crowd and asked, \u201cWho wants those people thrown out?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/trump-trying-to-woo-black-voters-not-buying-it\">Trump is trying to woo black voters.

But when pressed about Trump\u2019s paramilitaries on CNN, his new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said meekly: \u201cHe has not said that for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Back in 2004, John Kerry\u2019s campaign was destroyed for pointing out obtusely that he had voted both for and against funding the Iraq war. This flip-floppery led to TV ads of him windsurfing back and forth to the tune of the Blue Danube. As a result, it was hard to think of a less manly American leader in the midst of the war on terror.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wondering what Team Bush thinks of Donald Trump\u2019s far more dramatic flip-flop, you don\u2019t have to look that far. Jeb Bush, the low-energy brother who was so easily dispatched by Donald Trump in the GOP primaries, told WABC radio that the nominee\u2019s reversals were \u201cabhorrent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a typical politician,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAll the things Donald Trump railed against, he seems to be morphing into. I don\u2019t know what to believe about a guy who doesn\u2019t believe in things.\u201d</p> <p>If only he had been capable of such quips in the primaries, he might now be working on his transition to government.</p> <p>Of course, in later speeches and interviews, Trump suggested he might deport more people. Or fewer. Depending on the TV interview or crowd he\u2019s talking to at the time.</p> <p>Until now, honesty has been one of the very few areas where Trump has been running ahead of Hillary Clinton. While both candidates score poorly on such traits, Trump still maintained an edge, according to a recent NBC News/Survey Monkey <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-maintains-big-lead-voters-doubt-trump-s-temperament-n631351\">poll</a>. Even while losing badly overall to Clinton, Trump enjoyed a five-point advantage over Clinton on being honest and trustworthy. This is unlikely to last for much longer.</p> <p>The bottom fell out of the Trump campaign last month after a disastrous convention season. He picked a miserable fight with a Muslim American gold star family, and gave a series of TV interviews that would have got him fired from his own show. Straight talk, no matter how offensive, was his last remaining quality.</p> <p>People say that Trump learns nothing from his past errors, but that clearly isn\u2019t true.

The one consequence of his unpredicted win was that he felt forced to hold an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum</a> that he had never expected to be in a position to schedule.

But if, in their hotel suites or campaign buses, these unplanned candidates seek illuminating entertainment on their circumstances, American cinema offers a small but eloquent corpus of movies, made across eight decades, that dramatise or satirise outsider assaults on the political crown.</p> <p>The founding father of the genre is Frank Capra\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76022/mr-smith-goes-to-washington#skiplinks\"><em>Mr Smith Goes to Washington</em> (1939)</a>, in which Governor \u201cHappy\u201d Hopper, following the sudden death of a senator from a western state, is required to nominate a successor. He selects Jefferson \u201cJeff\u201d Smith (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-stewart\">James Stewart</a>, in one of his career stand-out roles), who has become a local hero for saving victims in a fire. It is a mark of more innocent times that Jeff\u2019s unimpeachable integrity derives from his devoted leadership of a pack of Boy Rangers, a detail that, in a modern movie, would set up expectations of a scandal of hypocrisy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e621496fc2f0ddc03fb73d5610207ee7beec069f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e621496fc2f0ddc03fb73d5610207ee7beec069f/0_230_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Stewart (right) in Mr Smith Goes to Washington (1939).

The now glittering print was restored by the US Library of Congress as part of its scheme to conserve key works of culture.</p> <p>A close second among the best-known and most-referenced political movies is <em>The Candidate</em> (1972), directed by Michael Ritchie. Bill McKay (Robert Redford) is a sort of latter-day Jeff Smith, an environmental campaigner in California, who is persuaded by Democrat power brokers to run for a US senate seat against a three-term Republican incumbent. The passage of a candidate from idealism to trimming pragmatism at the hands of political aides has become commonplace in political fiction and fact, but the film got in early with its pessimism about consensus politics and portrayal of the candidate as a puppet of funders and image manipulators. Aaron Sorkin\u2019s later classic TV series <em>The West Wing</em> seemed to acknowledge it, by making presidential aide Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff) a visual and linguistic ringer for Peter Boyle\u2019s Marvin Lucas, the campaign manager who makes Redford\u2019s character more electable.</p> <p>Seen now, the film is still filled with scenes that would surely resonate with members of the Trump, Corbyn and May teams, such as the flinch of the political professionals when McKay answers a reporter with the words \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. His response leads to a tremendous sequence in which the senatorial wannabe is prepped on future likely lines of questioning and the \u201cright\u201d answers to them. A key line \u2013 \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d \u2013 is often quoted sardonically in real political offices.</p> <p><em>The Candidate</em> has latterly acquired an unlikely running-mate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/27/campaign-review\"><em>The Campaign </em>(2012)</a>. Although its chosen genre is gross-out comedy, Jay Roach\u2019s film adapts the premise of the Redford-Ritchie one, with the twist, probably aimed at the box office in Middle America, that a Democrat, Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is the corrupt incumbent and a Republican, Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), the stable-cleansing challenger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3124d340eedb72dca8934dbacd48794359875a8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3124d340eedb72dca8934dbacd48794359875a8d/58_272_3313_1989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell in The Campaign (2012).

PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scenes in which Brady inadvertently has phone sex with a devoutly Christian family and punches a baby during a photo op reflect the broad nature of the comedy, but there is sharper satire when a stump speech reference to \u201cThe greatest American who ever lived \u2013 Jesus Christ!\u201d wins wild cheers from the crowd. As Brady becomes more desperate, his rhetoric \u2013 accusing Huggins of having \u201cChinese dogs\u201d and being an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-qaida\">Al-Qaida</a> sympathiser because he has a moustache \u2013 is now impossible to view without wondering if Trump watches a DVD of <em>The Campaign</em> as debate prep.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s metaphor about building a wall to keep out Mexicans seems to have been taken as an actual blueprint by many of his supporters. As such, he might also usefully stream <em>Being There</em>, Hal Ashby\u2019s 1979 adaptation of a novel by the Polish-American writer Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski. Peter Sellers is Chance, a gardener with an autism-spectrum condition whose horticultural observations \u2013 \u201cThere will be growth in the spring\u201d \u2013 are misunderstood as sagacious economic predictions. As a result, and with his name and trade misheard as \u201cChauncey Gardiner\u201d, he becomes an adviser to an American president and candidate to replace him. The fictional American electorate\u2019s response to Chauncey\u2019s \u201csimple brand of wisdom\u201d has subsequently been echoed at the ballot box.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4959e053bd13a89e44f6dfe1fbe95d31648442b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4959e053bd13a89e44f6dfe1fbe95d31648442b/0_137_1717_1029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Sellers in Being There (1979).

Bob\u2019s songs \u2013 including the paranoid-patriotic \u201cThis Land Is My Land!\u201d and various anti-PC satirical numbers \u2013 were intended as savage exaggeration of what have now become fairly mainstream attitudes on the American right. There is also a memorable supporting performance by Gore Vidal, greatest of 20th-century American political commentators, as the threatened Senator Paiste, whose warnings about the dangers of \u201cthe politics of emotion\u201d also serve as a soundtrack for our times.</p> <p>One of the most celebrated cinematic anti-politicians is never seen. The multiple storylines of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertaltman\">Robert Altman</a>\u2019s <em>Nashville</em> (1975) are converging on a rally organised by a local businessman for Hal Phillip Walker, a populist outsider running for president on the Replacement party ticket. Walker\u2019s Godot-like tendency to remain always in prospect is part of the satire of politics, encouraging viewers to construct an image of the democratic saviour and put their faith in him, as, by implication, voters are prone to do.</p> <p>The accidental politician genre is mainly American because the US political system requires no party affiliation or representation in the legislature from those who seek to run the country. Britain\u2019s parliamentary structure makes emergency insurgency hard to achieve. Corbyn and May, though both surprise leaders of their parties, served in the House of Commons for 32 and 19 years respectively before achieving power.</p> <p>One reason that <em>The Amazing Mrs Pritchard</em>, a 2006 BBC1 series with Jane Horrocks as a supermarket manager who makes a populist assault on British politics, proved less successful than other work by writer Sally Wainwright (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/20/last-tango-in-halifax-tv-review\"><em>Last Tango in Halifax</em></a>, <em>Happy Valley</em>), was that the character\u2019s rise lacked credibility. The UK archive, though, does hold <em>Bill Brand</em> (ITV, 1976), a provocative Trevor Griffiths drama, with Jack Shepherd as a lecturer who is persuaded to become a northern Labour MP. Its depiction of the presentational emasculation of a conviction politician makes it a conscious transatlantic cousin to <em>The Candidate</em>. Griffiths\u2019s dramatisation of a stand-off in the parliamentary Labour party between socialism and social democracy gives it fresh contemporary relevance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0d0777a339739694032408d3797fb0eda93b262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0d0777a339739694032408d3797fb0eda93b262/0_2_2105_1263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Horrocks in The Amazing Mrs Pritchard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Horrocks as an unlikely prime minister in the 2006 TV drama The Amazing Mrs Pritchard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PHIL FISK/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American movies, like colleagues on the senate benches, often nod appreciatively to each other. Apart from the many shared platforms between <em>The Candidate</em> and <em>The Campaign</em>, senior political figures in both <em>The Candidate</em> and <em>Being There</em> are played by the same actor, Melvyn Douglas, while the shamanic passivity of Sellers looks like a deliberate nod to Stewart\u2019s Mr White. The characters in <em>Nashville</em> include a rabidly patriotic country singer, who surely influenced Bob Roberts.</p> <p>And, as might be expected, Washington-outsider films have tended to appear at particular moments in American political history, although the movies can be divided into two types, being deliberately or prophetically topical.</p> <p>On the eve of the second world war\u2019s testing of the strength of western democracy, <em>Mr Smith Goes to Washington</em> fretted about the integrity of the heart of US government. Its interesting tensions perhaps reflect the Italian-American Capra\u2019s shared heritage from a nation notorious for political instability and one that boasted of its inviolability.</p> <p>Also impressively prescient is <em>The Candidate</em>: released in the year of Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide re-election, it anticipates both the American suspicion of liberalism that would doom Nixon\u2019s Democratic opponent, George McGovern, and the newly ruthless methods of campaigning that led the Republicans to bug their opponents\u2019 offices in the Watergate building. This would cause Nixon to resign in 1974, which bequeathed America an accidental president in Gerald Ford.</p> <p>Redford\u2019s Bill McKay \u2013 likable, intelligent, but uncomfortable with the muddying effects of power \u2013 can also be seen to have anticipated the presidency of Jimmy Carter, elected in 1976 to make the presidential residence look white again after Watergate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/25/donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton-campaign-live-coverage\">Trump's campaign CEO once charged with domestic violence, reports say \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unsurprisingly, it was in the era of Nixon and his aftermath that explorations of alternative politicians polled highest. Chauncey in <em>Being There</em> is even more of a holy innocent than McKay, as, we suspect, would Hal Philip Walker have been, had Altman let us see him. And, if Senator McKay rehearsed the Carter presidency, Gardiner and Walker seem now to have been previewing Ronald Reagan\u2019s folksy-populist takeover of the Republican party.</p> <p>The genre then became quiescent until the next wave of American anti-political populism in the early 1990s. Spookily, <em>Bob Roberts</em> was released in the year that the Texan oilman H Ross Perot became one of the most successful outsider presidential candidates until Trump, and a joke in the film about the incongruity of a \u201crebel conservative billionaire\u201d skewers both late-vocation politicians. <em>The Campaign</em> clearly drew on the ascendancy of the neo-con Tea Party wing of the Republican Party and its throwing up of non-traditional candidates, such as Sarah Palin, vice\u2011presidential nominee in 2008.</p> <p>In such prediction-defying times, it is probably sensible to say that Trump and Hillary Clinton are <em>expected</em> to contest the November election, rather than that they will. As the most elderly and unpopular pair of candidates of modern times, is it just possible that either might still have to be replaced by an emergency accidental stand-in? Democrats will dream of a Jefferson Smith; rightwing Republicans of a Bob Roberts. Hollywood, widely seen as an enclave of liberalism and other un-American activities, has often been an easy target for rabble-rousing candidates. But the movie business offers an illuminating archive of the dream and nightmare candidates across the electoral spectrum.</p>",

That falls into a wider theory that Google is suppressing negative stories about the Clintons \u2013 another favorite complaint of Assange\u2019s.</p> <p>Fox News mentioned Google\u2019s lack of autofill on Wednesday , citing InfoWars as its source.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/768409512562819072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fox News anchor pushes Clinton murder conspiracy, explicitly citing InfoWars <a href=\"https://t.co/wEgboKUxVt\">pic.twitter.com/wEgboKUxVt</a></p>&mdash; John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/768409512562819072\">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

Just days before Wednesday\u2019s launch of Our Revolution, an organisation which aims to build on the momentum of the senator\u2019s Democratic primary campaign, more than half of its staff resigned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/fleeing-the-bern-half-of-staff-quit-sanders-legacy-project-before-it-begins\">Fleeing the Bern: half of staff quit Sanders legacy project before it begins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not a case of a few volunteers deciding they didn\u2019t have the time to work towards a revolution. This was core staff members in key positions deciding Our Revolution was doomed to failure. Eight people quit \u2013 from a staff of 15. The entire organising department went. The digital director, Kenneth Pennington, went too.</p> <p>For an organisation aiming to organise grassroots volunteers through digital media, this was quite a blow. It landed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/fleeing-the-bern-half-of-staff-quit-sanders-legacy-project-before-it-begins\">Jeff Weaver</a>, who managed Sanders\u2019 primary campaign, was appointed president of the group.</p> <p>Under the stewardship of Weaver \u2013 who has worked on Sanders campaigns for three decades \u2013 the Vermont senator won <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/\">more than 13 million votes</a>, proving an unlikely challenger to the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton. But even as Sanders was riding a wave of activism and involvement not seen for decades, dissatisfaction with Weaver was spreading.</p> <p> Younger Sanders staff members were critical of money spent on television ads, funds they felt would be better spent on outreach. Grassroots activists spoke of a lack of coordination between the campaign and volunteers on the ground. </p> <p>Claire Sandberg, until this week organising director at Our Revolution, was among the most vocal critics. \u201cI left and others left because we were alarmed that Jeff would mismanage this organization as he mismanaged the campaign,\u201d she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-our-revolution-group.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Sandberg said she was concerned about how Our Revolution would raise and spend money, fearing the group would \u201cbetray its core purpose by accepting money from billionaires and not remaining grassroots funded and ploughing that billionaire cash into TV instead of investing it in building a genuine movement\u201d.</p> <p>An anonymous staff member <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/bernie-sanders-group-turmoil-227297\">told Politico</a> they joined Our Revolution after promises from Sanders and his wife Jane Sanders \u2013 chair of Our Revolution\u2019s board \u2013 that Weaver would not be involved.</p> <p>Weaver\u2019s appointment was not the only thing to turn activists away. Our Revolution has been registered as a 501(c)4 organisation, which means it is able to accept large donations from anonymous donors. Given that a large part of the senator\u2019s appeal in the primary lay in his criticism of the acceptance of anonymous money in politics, this is anathema to many Sanders supporters.</p> <p>Furthermore, the group is being run by two white men: Weaver and executive director Shannon Jackson. This is worrying to some supporters, given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">Sanders\u2019 struggle to appeal to minorities</a>. One source close to the project, from a minority background, said they had \u201cconcerns about how are these two people qualified to do the kind of work that needs to be done to organise people of color\u201d.</p> <p>There are also questions over what Our Revolution will actually do. On Wednesday Sanders spoke for 40 minutes. He spent 30 minutes heralding the success of his presidential campaign. Beyond listing the candidates and issues on which he said Our Revolution would focus, operational details were scarce.</p> <p>There was talk of organising people to campaign for candidates and protest against issues such as Citizens United, the supreme court decision that unfettered political donations, and a single-payer healthcare system. </p> <p>Sanders also said: \u201cReal change never ever takes place from the top on down. It happens when people come together and demand fundamental change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>This did not quite chime with the idea of a nationwide organizing project that, it seems, will aim to issue top-down missives to activists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">Third-party presidential candidates fight for 15% in polls \u2013 and a spot in debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One more thing could hamper Our Revolution: it seems Sanders isn\u2019t going to be a part of it. Listening to his speech on Wednesday, it seemed as if he planned a distinctly hands-off role. </p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cOur Revolution will endorse 100 candidates.\u201d</p> <p>Later he mentioned a ballot initiative in Colorado in support of single-payer healthcare. </p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cOur Revolution will be supporting that ballot item.\u201d</p> <p>The attention of some supporters has already started to drift. After the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia last month, many of the \u201cBernie or bust\u201d crowd <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/about-a-third-of-bernie-sanders-supporters-still-arent-backing-hillary-clinton/\">turned</a> to Jill Stein, the Green party candidate for president, or even the Libertarian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">Gary Johnson</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The 2016 presidential race on Thursday circled closer to the poisonous pulse of racial resentment, as Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton for a video featuring white supremacists and Clinton prepared to deliver a speech detailing how, she said, the Trump campaign \u201cis taking a hate movement mainstream\u201d.</p> <p>Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has moved aggressively to capture non-white voters. The Republican nominee met African American and Latino activists at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday morning, after moderating his stance on immigration and including in his stump speech a sales pitch for African American voters: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/what-do-you-have-to-lose-donald-trump-appeals-for-black-vote\">What do you have to lose?</a>\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have great relationships and the numbers are going up with the African American community rapidly,\u201d Trump said at the meeting, which included retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson and members of the Republican leadership initiative to develop conservative minority leaders. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had great relationships with the African American community, and now I\u2019ve made it such a focal point.\u201d</p> <p>Prior to the meeting, two protesters hung a flag over a second-floor railing in the building\u2019s lobby just outside a branch of Starbucks, reading \u201cTrump = Always Racist\u201d, according to a pool reporter with the Trump campaign. A protester was quickly escorted out, although he shouted to the small gaggle of reporters that Trump was \u201ctrying to pander to black and Latino leaders\u201d and \u201cnothing will change\u201d.</p> <p>The magnitude of the challenge for Trump as he tries to attract non-white support was underscored by a Quinnipiac University <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2375\">poll</a> released on Thursday in which Clinton led among non-white likely voters by a 62-point margin, 77%-15%. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-gets-0-support-black-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-nbc-n609026\">A July poll</a> of battleground states found Trump with 0% support among African Americans.</p> <p>This is not the first week of the campaign in which racial tensions have been laid bare.

If he doesn\u2019t respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Trump accused Clinton of trying to bully his supporters.</p> <p>It was a video released on Thursday by the Clinton campaign that drew the sharpest rebuke from Trump, however. The video features white supremacists describing their support for Trump, and depicts newly minted Trump campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon as an avatar of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">alt-right</a>, defined in voiceover as \u201cthe sort of dressed-up-in-suits version of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf Trump wins, they could be running the country,\u201d the ad warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/768823064033308673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There&#39;s a reason the most hateful fringe of the right wing is supporting Donald Trump.<a href=\"https://t.co/AqB3DM2m0N\">https://t.co/AqB3DM2m0N</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/768823064033308673\">August 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Trump campaign called for the ad to be retracted through a statement from Mark Burns, a <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2016/07/the-rnc-is-over-but-can-we-talk-about-pastor-mark-burns/\">controversial</a> pastor from South Carolina and, next to Carson, one of Trump\u2019s most prominent African American supporters. </p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign went to a disgusting new low today as they released a video tying the Trump campaign with horrific racial images,\u201d Burns said. </p> <p>\u201cThis type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale.

  "<p>If you want to get ahead, be nice to receptionists.

But Burbidge\u2019s receptionist rule seems to be about more than that. To grow a business, she explained, you have to be able to attract people \u2013 staff, customers, other investors \u2013 and that means treating others with respect no matter who they are. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell people how to behave but do believe one\u2019s talents will go further when combined with good manners and&#xa0;decorum.\u201d</p> <p>As starchily old-fashioned as the words \u201cmanners and decorum\u201d always sound, what Burbidge is saying could hardly be more contemporary in a world increasingly obsessed by notions of power and responsibility, of how the big shot treats the little guy. Like the age-old advice never to marry a man who is rude to waiters, the receptionist rule is less a test of good manners than a chance to see how people behave in circumstances where they think they have power over others \u2013 even if it\u2019s just the person bringing them a coffee.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lagging in the polls, Trump no longer has supporters queuing around the block for his\u00a0rallies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Natural bullies, given half a chance, will invariably be tempted to throw their weight around to make themselves feel important.

By way of a punchline, the candidate list ends with Phillip Broughton, Ukip\u2019s 2015 candidate in Hartlepool, and a former semi-professional wrestler \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/philip-broughton-wrestling-ukip-euro-7055385\">who traded</a>, for some reason, as \u201cthe one and only Phillip Alexander\u201d.</p> <p>It is all a rum do, and in some of the commentary about the party\u2019s travails one can detect a view of its prospects that has perennially bubbled up since it decisively began moving on to the political map around 12 years ago.</p> <p>In this reading, Ukip was only ever a personality cult built to serve Farage \u2013 in which case, to quote one of an endless sea of tweets, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlieT62/status/760823084928688128\">\u201cUkip are finished \u2013 [because] Farage was Ukip\u201d</a>. And in any case, its entire reason for existing has been fulfilled. By overseeing Brexit and pushing the Tories away from Notting Hill and back to a petit-bourgeois populism, Theresa May could re-establish their complete dominance of the political right \u2013 while even if Labour fails to get its act together, the former Labour voters who supported Farage will either go back to abstaining, or vote Ukip in much smaller numbers.</p> <p>At which point, a few corrective thoughts. First, whatever the state of Ukip\u2019s internal affairs, the state of politics in both Europe and the US suggests that as economies and societies continue to fragment, and the mainstream seems to have no clear answers, the new rightwing populism is going be with us for some time to come.</p> <p>Second, given that the referendum happened only two months ago, it is worth at least briefly reflecting on the part Ukip played in the outcome. With a solitary MP and a flimsy activist base, it still played a huge role in embedding the connection between most of Britain\u2019s ills and the EU, and thereby carrying its cause from the margins of politics to its very centre. Here is an example of postmodern politics from which people on the left would do well to learn. Moreover, the people responsible are hardly likely to simply disappear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ukip\u2019s whole schtick has always been to insist that some things matter more than economics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then there is the associated question of Brexit, and what it might actually entail (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d says the prime minister, but that hardly clarifies anything). Just as it is hard to know at this early stage what exactly will be the terms of any British departure, it\u2019s unclear where the vote for leave now sits in the minds of the people responsible. We are talking about England here, so the questions are valid: will it turn out to have been some Diana-esque spasm, after which everybody once again switches off? Or a matter of keenly felt conviction and expectations that people will demand are met?</p> <p>On this score, though it\u2019s painful to make the point, do not underestimate the centrality of immigration to the Brexit vote, and how irate a lot of people may get if the status quo persists \u2013 a point underlined by this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/net-migration-to-uk-fell-to-327000-in-past-year-figures-show\">net migration figures </a>(in the year to March 2016, 633,000 people arrived in the UK, while 306,000 moved overseas).</p> <p>More generally, there is still a sense of far too many of the political class thinking the vote can soon be nullified \u2013 witness the hapless Owen Smith claiming that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/owen-smith-labour-should-continue-to-fight-brexit\">we didn\u2019t actually know what we were voting on</a>\u201d and holding out the prospect of another referendum. If the Brexit vote was motivated by people\u2019s sense that Westminster either ignored them or failed to take them seriously, what does he think will happen if their one briefly successful protest is treated the same way?</p> <p>Political journalism too often overlooks the social nitty-gritty, and the way it pushes people in this or that direction far more than dramas at the top. Self-evidently, in the old Labour heartlands that still represent Ukip\u2019s biggest political opportunity \u2013 and to which Jeremy Corbyn and his followers still show few signs of convincingly speaking \u2013 the rise of Farage\u2019s party was fed by deep problems, which are unlikely to change. These barely need outlining: the fact that there is an ongoing housing crisis; that employment is ever-more insecure; that the cultural distance between a confident middle class at ease with globalisation and millions of others suffering its malign effects is growing ever larger. In addition, if one of the big sparks for Ukip\u2019s rise over the past 10 years was the impact of the economic crash of 2008, the turbulence that could yet result from Britain leaving the EU may have exactly the same results.</p> <p>Obviously, that would be an outrageous irony: the party that so enthusiastically pushed Britain out of the EU making hay with the adverse consequences. But to that, there are two answers: that politics has little time for paradox; and that in any case, Ukip\u2019s whole schtick has always been to insist that economics isn\u2019t everything, not least for people with precious little to lose. Farage restated the basic point this week: \u201cThere are some things in life that matter more than just money: your community, your street, your town, your neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>In the midst of all these possibilities lurks Arron Banks, the insurance tycoon who spent \u00a35.6m of his own money on the Brexit campaign, and who was recently heard speculating about either reforming Ukip \u201croot and branch\u201d, or funding a new populist party that may succeed it: a force that may have a chance of \u201ctaking over from Labour as the opposition, because Labour are imploding and Labour voters for the first time ever have defied their party, voting for leave\u201d. He is with Farage in the States.</p> <p>Which brings us to the recently retired leader himself. After working flat-out for upwards of a decade, to the point that he began to complain about his health, Farage might have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resignation-ukip-leader-brexit\">expected to disappear for a while</a>. And yet here he is again, evidently loving every minute, and saying he is minded to \u201csee where we are in two and a half years\u2019 time\u201d.

You\u2019re racist you\u2019re racist you\u2019re racist, they keep saying it. It\u2019s a tired disgusting argument. And it\u2019s so predictable... it\u2019s the last refuge of the discredited Democratic politician. They keep going back to the same well.</p> <p>But you know what?... The people are too smart.
