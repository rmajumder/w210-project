Machar reportedly has a home in the same neighbourhood.</p> <p>The document says: \u201cThe key catalyst of South Sudan\u2019s civil war has been competition for the grand prize, control over state assets and the country\u2019s abundant natural resources between rival kleptocratic networks led by President Kiir and (former) Vice-President Machar.</p> <p>\u201cThe leaders of South Sudan\u2019s warring parties manipulate and exploit ethnic divisions in order to drum up support for a conflict that serves the interests only of the top leaders of these two kleptocratic networks and, ultimately, the international facilitators whose services the networks utilize and on which they rely.\u201d</p> <p>Kiir\u2019s 12-year-old son held a 25% stake in a holding company formed in February this year. Overall, there was evidence that at least seven of Kiir\u2019s children, as well as his wife, have held stakes in various business ventures, the report said. Journalists were shown several passports for individuals who gave their occupation as \u201cpresident\u2019s son\u201d.</p> <p>Clooney\u2019s fellow actor and campaigner Don Cheadle said: \u201cThe Sentry has found evidence that these top officials responsible for mass atrocities in South Sudan have managed to accumulate fortunes and have been involved in illegal transactions, insider deals and outright fraud.</p> <p>\u201cImmediate family members of President Kiir and his wife have held interests in almost two dozen companies operating in oil, mining, construction, gambling, banking, telecommunications, aviation and government and military procurement.\u201d</p> <p>The Sentry said its undercover investigators pored over thousands of pages of legal records, corporate filings, financial statements and other official correspondence, tracked suspects on social media and used satellite imagery to gather and analyse data. The researchers travelled to locations including Melbourne, Adelaide, Kampala, Juba, Cairo and Nairobi to gather evidence and interview hundreds of experts and eyewitnesses.</p> <p>The investigation focused on top officials with command authority over those responsible for mass atrocities, he added. They have accumulated personal fortunes despite modest salaries. Gen Paul Malong, the chief of military staff, owns two villas in Uganda in addition to a $2m mansion in a gated community in Nairobi, according to the report, which cites his annual salary as roughly $45,000.</p> <p>Among Kiir\u2019s associates, Lawrence Lual Malong Jr, 28, describes himself as \u201cYoung Tycoon\u201d and \u201cSmart Boy for Life\u201d, according to the report, which includes social media photos of him wearing gaudy blue, purple and yellow suits in the first class section of various planes.</p> <p>Veteran activist John Prendergast said: \u201cThis is not a study of a few corrupt officials in Africa \u2026 What it is is an attempt to get at the nexus of what drives violent conflict and mass atrocities in South Sudan: the connection between endemic corruption and deadly violence and about how these networks benefit from a system that\u2019s built on corruption and uses extreme violence to keep in place.\u201d</p> <p>The report claimed individuals and major firms outside South Sudan had facilitated the deadly corruption. It said there was hard evidence of foreign companies making direct payments to the bank accounts of high-ranking South Sudanese generals. The banks that process the transactions also play a role, it said. Cheadle added: \u201cThese companies and banks can no longer say they didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Clooney and his colleagues said they would present the findings to Obama and urge the international community, including South Sudan\u2019s neighbours, to crack down on banks that fail to stop dubious transactions, and impose asset freezes on those responsible for human rights violations.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, Ateny Wek Ateny, a spokesperson for Kiir, said he was reading the report. \u201cWe will be able to respond tomorrow. Not now.\u201d<br></p>",

The news that Hillary Clinton is suffering from pneumonia points up a truth that distinguishes politicians from the rest of us: for them, illness is not a phenomenon that has to be treated only medically, but is also something that must be managed by teams of PR goons working round the clock so that their boss doesn\u2019t seem too feeble to hold the proverbial reins of power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/hillary-pneumonia-more-important-things-donald-trump\">Eight things that are more important than Hillary's pneumonia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump, 70, has already questioned his 68-year-old rival\u2019s physical and mental capabilities to become president.

In reality, he suffered various problems controlled by doses of steroids and other drugs. Among those problems was Addison\u2019s disease or autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy\u2019s adversaries claimed that he had the disease, but as the Los Angeles Times reports, a cunningly worded statement issued at the time by his doctors asserted that Kennedy did not have Addison\u2019s disease caused by tuberculosis (which is the cause of the diseases in only 20% of sufferers). As a result of this statement, the matter was dropped. The truth was, though, that JFK did suffer from Addison\u2019s disease, but in his case it was autoimmune in origin. The disease causes the adrenal glands (which produce adrenaline and other hormones) to wither and results in symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, weight loss, difficulty standing up, nausea, sweating, and changes in mood and personality. Kennedy collapsed twice, once during a congressional visit to Britain, as a result of Addison\u2019s disease.</p> <p>JFK\u2019s medical records, studied posthumously by navy doctor Lee R Mandel, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/05/science/sci-jfk-addisons5\">revealed that the president was taking</a> 500mg of vitamin C twice daily; 10mg of hydrocortisone daily; 2.5mg of prednisone twice daily; 10mg of methyltestosterone daily (to combat weight loss and gonadal atrophy associated with the steroids he was taking); 25mg of liothyronine (a synthetic thyroid hormone) twice daily; 0.1mg fludrocortisone daily; and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, two tablets as needed.</p> <h2>Franklin D Roosevelt (1882-1945)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c37c4c8a06c708a0ce676c33548abd6fbb34950\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c37c4c8a06c708a0ce676c33548abd6fbb34950/0_11_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"FDR in 1924.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FDR in 1924.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PhotoQuest/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1921, at the age of 38, Roosevelt suffered a severe attack of polio, which resulted in the total paralysis of both legs. The previous year he had run as vice-president on Democratic candidate James M Cox\u2019s ticket. His illness seemed to threaten his future political career, but it did not. In 1928, he was elected governor of New York and in 1932 defeated Herbert Hoover to become president, in which office he served until his death in 1945 \u2013 becoming thereby the last president to serve more than two four-year terms in office. In 1944, hospital tests revealed that the president, a lifelong chain smoker, had high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease causing angina pectoris and congestive heart failure, but his declining health was hidden from the public. During the 1944 election campaign, his personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, told reporters what he must have known to be untrue, namely: \u201cThe president\u2019s health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all.\u201d There are even claims that he used the office of censorship to quash reports of his declining health before the election, which he won \u2013 only to die the following year, shortly after experiencing a massive cerebral haemorrhage.</p> <h2>Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (1916-1996)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80f8ac68e97c50b0dede6151542e6b4cf19317f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80f8ac68e97c50b0dede6151542e6b4cf19317f9/0_167_2878_1726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitterrandin 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitterrandin 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Perry/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The French president died of prostate cancer in 1996, a year after the end of his two-term, 1981-95 presidency.

David Owen, in his book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/in-sickness-and-in-power.html\">In Sickness and in Power: Illness in Heads of Government During the Last 100 Years</a>, reveals the lengths they went to to conceal his condition.</p> <p>When Mitterrand <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3636287/David-Owen-Tony-Blair-and-John-F-Kennedy-may-have-been-power-crazy.html\">had to be given regular intravenous oestrogen hormone therapy</a>, the president\u2019s personal physician \u201chung the intravenous drip on a picture hook or a coat hanger so as not to have to hammer a nail into the wall of an embassy or another government\u2019s guest house\u201d.</p> <p>Shortly before his death, Mitterrand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/15/1\">had an intimate farewell supper with friends</a>. Each diner was presented with a sizzling roasted ortolan, a sparrow-like bird the size of a lemon. He and his guests placed napkins over their heads. Then each bent over their dish, inhaled its delicate vapours, took the bird by its beak and sucked out the innards, including bones, through its rectum. In part because hunting the songbird was illegal in France, this supper \u2013 just like Mitterrand\u2019s cancer \u2013 remained a secret until after his death.</p> <h2>Harold Wilson (1916-1995)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f2f15b9ce17cb037fdd837e5eaecd8aa60a7ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f2f15b9ce17cb037fdd837e5eaecd8aa60a7ad/0_1483_6036_3621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson in 1971.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson in 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the British prime minister\u2019s second term of office from 1974-76, he suffered symptoms that were later diagnosed as colon cancer. He may also have suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s while in office (like Reagan). Neurologist Dr Peter Garrard analysed Wilson\u2019s changing speech patterns at the dispatch box, just as he had those of novelist Iris Murdoch, and found evidence that the prime minister might well have been suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s without knowing it. Garrard said: \u201cLanguage is known to be vulnerable to the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and the findings of the earlier Iris Murdoch project confirmed that linguistic changes can appear even before the symptoms are recognised by either the patient or their closest associates.</p> <p>\u201cIf such changes are apparent during the effortful and relatively controlled process of creative writing, then the cognitive demands of spontaneous speech production make it even more likely for them to be detectable in spoken output.\u201d Garrard argued that such effortful cognitive demands may have prompted Wilson to retire from office.</p> <h2>Winston Churchill (1874-1965)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad/0_257_2723_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Churchill in 1942.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Churchill in 1942.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his 1966 memoir, Churchill\u2019s personal physician Charles Wilson, the first Baron Moran, revealed that \u201cBlack Dog\u201d was the name Churchill gave to \u201cthe prolonged fits of depression from which he suffered\u201d. The claim that Britain\u2019s wartime leader was clinically depressed has ever since remained controversial, though Churchill acknowledged in his book Painting as a Pastime that he was prey to the \u201cworry and mental overstrain [experienced] by persons who, over prolonged periods, have to bear exceptional responsibilities and discharge duties upon a very large scale\u201d. To combat such worry and overstrain, Lord Moran reported, Churchill was prone to take solace in whisky and cigars, especially during the darkest days of the second world war. He suffered a heart attack at the White House in 1941 and contracted pneumonia a few years later.</p> <p>During his second term as prime minister from 1951 to 1955, Churchill was, in the words of his biographer Roy Jenkins, \u201cgloriously unfit for office\u201d. Ageing and increasingly unwell, he often conducted business from his bedside. He had suffered a stroke while on holiday in 1949 and, while in office in 1953, suffered another. Despite being paralysed down one side and doctors fearing he might not survive the weekend, he conducted a cabinet meeting without, it is claimed, anyone noticing his indisposition. News of this stroke was kept from parliament and the public, who were told that he was suffering merely from exhaustion. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/winston-churchill\">He left office in 1955</a>.

The Guardian reported at the time: \u201cNo 10 immediately played down the incident, but the image of the youthful prime minister struck down by a heart condition sent shockwaves through the government.\u201d He was found to be suffering from supraventricular tachycardia, and the following year was treated for a heart flutter. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly alarming but it\u2019s something that you should get fixed \u2013 it\u2019s a routine procedure,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019ve had it for the last couple of months and it\u2019s not impeded me doing my work and feeling fine, but it is as well to get it done.\u201d At the time, Blair placed a great deal of emphasis on being fit and healthy. He told interviewers that, at 51, he weighed about 83kg (13st), less than he did a decade before. In part, this was due to his healthy lifestyle \u2013 playing tennis regularly and insisting his aides ensure time for for workouts in his daily diary.</p> <h2>Gordon Brown (1951-)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eedd775026a0a0849f4dfc11c33a93ba6552eb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eedd775026a0a0849f4dfc11c33a93ba6552eb0f/0_267_3004_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brown last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brown last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/27/andrew-marr-gordon-brown-health\">on Andrew Marr\u2019s Sunday morning BBC TV show</a>, prime minister Gordon Brown gave a detailed description of his difficulties with his eyesight. He lost the sight in one eye after a teenage rugby accident and has a retinal detachment in his other eye, leaving him with the \u201csame fear\u201d that he will completely lose his sight. He told Marr: \u201cAlthough I have problems with my eyes and it has been very difficult over the years, I think people understand that you can do a job and you can work hard. And I think it would be a terrible indictment of our political system if you thought that because someone had this medical issue, they couldn\u2019t do the job.

He had started smoking aged nine and continued the habit as an adult, suffering emphysema and heart failure as a result. A year before he succeeded Yuri Andropov, he had been absent for three months because of bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia. Despite these seeming disqualifications for office, he still managed to serve \u2013 in name at least \u2013 as the leader of the Soviet Union for 13 months. In reality, from the end of 1984 until his collapse into a coma and death in March 1985, he rarely left Moscow\u2019s heavily guarded Central Clinical hospital, and when he did, he only upset the Soviet people with his cadaverous TV appearances.

There has been much speculation since that Fidel suffers from diverticulitis, a digestive disease in which pouches within the large bowel wall become inflamed; Havana has not confirmed this. Quite possibly, Castro worries that Americans are still trying subtle techniques to kill him.

There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u2019s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u2013 endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. </p> <p>Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u20ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u20ac86bn bailout as soon as possible.

One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u2019 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement. All of which is why few believe this latest chapter will end anytime soon - with ever growing numbers believing that Greece will only regain competitiveness when it eventually leaves the eurozone. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cf10e4b013613fffc863\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:01:43.283Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 76.05 points or 1.12% at 6700.90, its lowest level since the start of August</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.34% at 10,431.77</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.15% lower at 4439.80</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 16,840.28</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% lower at 8866.6</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.68% to 557.25</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 63 points or 0.36%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:02:01.448Z\">at 5.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cb33e4b013613fffc852\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:40:11.973Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets recover from post-Brexit lows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After early plunges this morning, European markets have recovered from their worst levels.</p> <p>For much of the day the FTSE 100 was suffering its worst day since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June, with a similar story on the Dax.</p> <p>Much of the falls came after Friday\u2019s comments from Federal Reserve members suggesting a US rate rise was possible next week, with the news of Hillary Clinton\u2019s illness adding to the uncertainty.</p> <p>But Wall Street regained its poise and in turn gave a lift to European markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US stock markets have managed to regain their composure this afternoon, bouncing off the lows for the time being. What has been widely heralded as a result of hawkish comments from the Fed\u2019s Rosengren seems to have had as much to do about the implications of finally breaking out of a two month lull in US indices. Volumes and thus volatility seem to be back, much to the joy of traders worldwide.</p> <p>Given that Rosengren\u2019s speech signified a no more divisive message than we have already heard from him and other Fed members, it seems the key is in the market\u2019s willingness to run with it as the curtains fall on the holiday season. This afternoon\u2019s speech from Fed\u2019s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period. The noted dove is expected to temper fears sparked by Rosengren, yet with market sensitivity heightened, any shift in tone could set markets on their way once more.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:50:56.994Z\">at 4.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6c6a8e4b08465d44ffe10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:20:01.856Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As part of its economic stimulus measures, the Bank of England has announced it will start buying \u00a310bn worth of corporate bonds on September 27.

  "<p>On Sunday afternoon, Hillary Clinton\u2019s doctor revealed that she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">diagnosed with pneumonia</a> two days earlier. The admission came after she was filmed stumbling into her van after leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony early. Pneumonia is a serious illness, but it can be treated with antibiotics.</p> <p>The incident divided opinion along familiar lines: for the Trumpian right it was confirmation that Hillary is sickly, perhaps far more than she lets on. Some Clinton supporters railed against the press\u2019s obsession with her health, arguing that it feeds conspiracy theories \u2013 and why on earth should it matter?</p> <p>Of course a presidential candidate\u2019s health matters. Both Trump and Clinton can rightly expect scrutiny of their records and fitness for office. But the press also has a duty to place medical problems in perspective.</p> <p>The effects of the illness may last a few more days, or a month. And the coming hours will be utterly dominated by coverage of it. But the next president is going to be elected for at least four years. Hillary Clinton is sick right now, but her opponent has flaws that won\u2019t disappear with a course of pills. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the factors that should weigh heavier than a bout of pneumonia. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude to climate change</h2> <p>The Republican candidate has said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">withdraw</a> from the Paris deal on cutting emissions, and in 2014 referred to the scientific consensus on global warming as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en\">bullshit</a>\u201d, stating that \u201cour planet is freezing\u201d. The <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-10-hottest-years-on-record\">10 hottest years on record</a> have all occured since 1998. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s religious test for migrants</h2> <p>In December 2015, Trump called for \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d. Since then his position has shifted somewhat; in June he <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-25/trump-says-immigration-plan-wouldn-t-feature-mass-deportations\">said</a> \u201cI want people that have bad thoughts out\u201d and his finance chairman <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-election-2016/\">explained</a>: \u201cIt is about Muslims from countries that support terrorism.\u201d The RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, has denied that this would amount to a religious test. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s support of torture</h2> <p>In February, Trump <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trump-torture/\">said</a> \u201cTorture works. OK, folks?\u201d and has endorsed waterboarding, which was banned by George W Bush in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-ohio-rally-isis-torture-tpp-rape\">saying</a>: \u201cI like it a lot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tough enough.\u201d</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards freedom of the press</h2> <p>He argued that libel laws should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">expanded</a>, so that \u201cwhen the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece, we can sue them\u201d.</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards women</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/?utm_term=.6feaf23fe1e0\">written</a> that \u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers.\u201d He has criticized female public figures for their appearance and retweeted the question: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton can\u2019t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\u201d before deleting it. He also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfJpTUYr2Q\">stated</a> that \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have abortions (he subsequently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-says-abortion-ban-should-carry-punishment-for-women\">released a statement</a> that, where abortion was illegal, doctors, not women, should bear criminal responsibility). </p> <h2>The prospect of Donald Trump as commander in chief</h2> <p>Retired General John Allen has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/john-allen-donald-trump-226479\">warned of</a> a \u201ccivil military crisis where the military could be ordered to conduct illegal activities\u201d if Trump is elected. Former CIA director, Michael Hayden, has expressed concern about how \u201cerratic\u201d Trump is, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/michael-hayden-trump-military-226606\">saying</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s inconsistent. And when you\u2019re the head of a global superpower, inconsistency, unpredictability, those are dangerous things. They frighten your friends and they tempt your enemies. And so I would be very, very concerned.\u201d The Trump campaign <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/290227-trump-camp-denies-questioning-of-us-nuclear-policy\">denies reports</a> that, referring to nuclear weapons, he asked a foreign policy expert, \u201cIf we have them, why can\u2019t we use them?\u201d three times during a briefing. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s donations to public officials<br></h2> <p>Trump told the Wall Street Journal in 2015: \u201cAs a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d Trump donated $25,000 to Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, a few days after her office said it would review allegations made against Trump University in 2013. The review was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">ended</a> without any action being taken. Bondi denies any impropriety. </p> <h2>Mike Pence\u2019s beliefs</h2> <p>The man who will be a heartbeat away from the presidency also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/14/watch-mike-pence-trumps-likely-vp-pick-question-global-warming-and-demur-on-evolution/?utm_term=.f3b8fe5e6687\">questions</a> the expert consensus on global warming, saying the \u201cscience is very mixed\u201d. He has refused to say he\u2019s convinced by the theory of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/jul/29/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-makes-true-claim-mike-pence-denies-evo/\">evolution</a>. He voted against measures designed to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and opposed equal marriage. </p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago, almost to the week, Bob Dole, then the Republican nominee for president, slipped and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-20/news/mn-45687_1_bob-dole\">fell off a stage</a>. He was 73, and his aides moved fast to put a positive spin on the tumble: if he can fall down and get right back up again, that proves he\u2019s fit enough for the White House!</p> <p>But that\u2019s not how most people saw it. Earlier that same day Dole had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/19/opinion/the-artless-dodger.html\">offered congratulations to the Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, a team that had not existed for four decades. (They became the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1958.) By nightfall TV comedians were renaming the candidate Bob Old. His already ill-starred campaign never recovered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/hillary-pneumonia-more-important-things-donald-trump\">Eight things that are more important than Hillary's pneumonia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the precedent that will currently be terrifying the Hillary Clinton team, as they watch the endlessly replayed clip of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">coming close to collapse</a>, knees buckling as she\u2019s helped into a car following Sunday\u2019s 9/11 memorial events in New York. Veteran Clintonites remember that Dole moment well, for it was Bill Clinton who benefited, comfortably winning re-election less than two months later. Now they fear history is repeating itself \u2013 with Hillary on the wrong side.</p> <p>Are they right to be anxious? Could the image of a frail Hillary Clinton, coupled with the belated admission that she is suffering from pneumonia, prove devastating for her candidacy? Suddenly that is the central question of the 2016 contest \u2013 and it touches on far more than the nasty turn the candidate endured on Sunday.</p> <p>The reasons for Democrats to worry are obvious. For months, with next to no evidence, Donald Trump has been ventilating the claim, long nurtured among rightwing conspiracists, that <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/giuliani-hillary-clinton-illness-videos-000000972.html\">Clinton has a severe and secret illness</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a doubly effective strike for Trump. First, by claiming that 68-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-day-wrong-florida-video\">Clinton lacks \u201cstrength and stamina\u201d</a>, or that she \u201csleeps a lot\u201d, the Republican, who\u2019s 70, has been able to tap into the lingering sexist belief that a woman is too weak to lead. Second, the notion that Clinton has hidden this frailty plays nicely into the view, held by some 60% of the US electorate, that she is dishonest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-radical-transparency-trump-accusations-dishonesty-whitewater-emails-health\">untrustworthy</a>.</p> <p>Until Sunday Clinton defenders were able to hit back, dismissing the first line of attack as rank misogyny and the second as unfair exaggeration. But by fainting in view of a camera, and by initially concealing a pneumonia diagnosis that came on Friday, Clinton has allowed Trump to claim vindication. If he has not yet done an \u201cI told you so\u201d tweet, it\u2019s only because he doesn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>No less damaging are the practical implications. Those who\u2019ve had the illness \u2013 including those much younger than Clinton \u2013 say that recovery demands total rest and can take seven or eight weeks. She simply does not have that kind of time.</p> <p>Even if she lightens her campaign schedule, she cannot retreat to her bed between now and 8 November. The first TV debate with Trump, a key moment in any campaign and one that many suspect will determine this race, is just two weeks away. Preparation for that is exacting. What if Clinton forces herself to work, or to do at least a few appearances on the stump, and is visibly unwell again?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-radical-transparency-trump-accusations-dishonesty-whitewater-emails-health\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s best riposte to Trump? Radical transparency | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All this matters in the US especially because of the particular relationship Americans have with their president. The White House is not quite like, say, 10 Downing Street. Americans are electing not merely a head of government, but also a head of state and national figurehead. There can be an almost primal need to see the president as a protector, the alpha lion strong enough to ensure the safety of the pride.</p> <p>Of course there have been sick men in the Oval Office: Franklin Roosevelt used a wheelchair, while <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/us/in-jfk-file-hidden-illness-pain-and-pills.html?pagewanted=all\">John F Kennedy</a> had regular steroid injections for excruciating back pain. But both men concealed their frailties from the US public: they knew the voters would struggle to accept weakness in the man they hail as the chief.</p> <p>Clintonites looking for reassurance can extract a morsel of consolation from the procession of young, fit pundits on the US airwaves sharing their own pneumonia experiences, saying they were knocked sideways by it \u2013 but bounced back to full strength.</p> <p>They\u2019d also note the curious, and surely gender-related, tendency for Hillary to poll better when she has shown vulnerability: her numbers rose when she seemed to shed a tear during her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama, and, 10 years earlier, when she was the injured party during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/13/monica-lewinsky-wasnt-betrayed-feminism\">Monica Lewinsky scandal</a>.</p> <p>Those with the rosiest tint to their spectacles would also note that when the media are talking about Clinton\u2019s health, at least they\u2019re not talking about her earlier consignment of half of Trump\u2019s supporters into the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">basket of deplorables</a>\u201d as racists, sexists and Islamophobes \u2013 a gaffe that meant she was already in trouble even before she crumpled in New York.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have been sick men in the Oval Office: Roosevelt used a wheelchair, while Kennedy had injections for back pain.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole episode, with its focus on both Clinton\u2019s health and honesty, has confirmed again that she is judged by not one but two double standards. The most obvious is <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/fear-of-a-female-president/497564/?utm_source=atltw\">gender</a>. Trump\u2019s \u201cstrength and stamina\u201d line is just part of a constant and decades-old pattern of faulting aspects of Clinton that would barely be noticed in a man.</p> <p>Criticised for shouting too loud on the podium or for using her hands too much, or for a thousand other flaws, she said recently that she\u2019s often doing no more than emulating the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/filmguitarist/status/773991245420998657\">oratorical style</a> of the men she\u2019s admired. But what we accept in them, too many find unappealing in a woman.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another double standard that\u2019s costing her dear. Clinton is judged as a politician, held to the standards expected of a serious elected official. Her opponent is not.</p> <p>It\u2019s undeniable that it has long been the Clinton modus operandi to reveal little, and only when forced. That has fed the impression, for nearly 25 years, that the Clintons are hiding dark and terrible secrets. Once they let in the light, reporters usually find there\u2019s barely anything there: witness the Whitewater \u201cscandal\u201d, talked up as the next Watergate, but which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/21/hillaryclinton\">amounted to nothing</a>. Or Clinton\u2019s alleged culpability for the jihadi attack in <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/republicans-11-hour-gift-to-hillary-clinton-20151023\">Benghazi</a> which left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\">the US ambassador and three other Americans dead</a>.</p> <p>So 60% of Americans think Clinton is dishonest, yet an <a href=\"http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/08/hillary-clinton-one-americas-most-honest-politicians\">analysis of her statements</a> showed she was more truthful than every prominent US politician, including Bernie Sanders, bar one: Barack Obama. And now she has promised to release more medical records.</p> <p>Trump, meanwhile, is such a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-big-lies-at-the-commander-in-chief-forum\">compulsive liar</a> it\u2019s almost impossible to keep up. (His lies about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarlowNYC/status/774852355967873024\">what he saw on 9/11</a> could fill a small pamphlet on their own.) Yet somehow this is seen as part of the shtick, part of Trump being Trump \u2013 and he\u2019s rarely called on it. So while Clinton was relentlessly grilled during an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-veterans-forum-debate-preview-moderators-elections-2016\">NBC special</a> last week about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-email-state-department?CMP=share_btn_tw\">her emails</a>, Trump was unchallenged when he breezily claimed that he opposed the Iraq war before it started \u2013 even though he\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trump-iraq-war-219471\">on tape</a> supporting it.</p> <p>This is Clinton\u2019s fate, to be doubly judged by double standards. She is a woman and an establishment politician \u2013 and now she is ill. Politically, if not medically, her condition is critical.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-day-wrong-florida-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qgkz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2649750\"            data-video-name=\"Trump mocks Clinton for mental stamina then gets the day wrong - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ad8600e4b0f231200da26b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/12/160812Trumpud_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/12/160812Trumpud.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/12/160812Trumpud_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-day-wrong-florida-video\">Trump mocks Clinton for mental stamina then gets the day wrong - video</a></figcaption> </figure>",

But such idealistic sentiments are not popular in the Croatia of today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/croatias-conservatives-take-lead-preliminary-election-results\">Croatia's conservatives set for coalition talks after losing majority</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In January, the country\u2019s conservative coalition government appointed as culture minister Zlatko Hasanbegovic, a man described by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre as a \u201cfascist\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-culture-minister-wrote-for-pro-nazi-journal-02-11-2016\">He had lionised the country\u2019s pro-Nazi Ustase movement as a student in the 90s</a> and labelled Croatia\u2019s anti-fascist history and culture <a href=\"http://www.telegram.hr/politika-kriminal/novi-ministar-kulture-prilicno-je-kontroverzan-covjek-a-ovo-je-8-njegovih-spornih-izjava/\">\u201can empty phrase\u201d</a> with no constitutional relevance. (Hasanbegovic has since emphasised that his current party is anti-fascist.)</p> <p>On Sunday, Croats went to the polls in a snap election, returning the ruling nationalist party HDZ as the biggest party, but changing nothing. Just 53% of all Croats voted: the likely outcome is a coalition of the same old \u201ccentrist\u201d parties \u2013 nationalists and social democrats. On the face of it, the country faces the same old problems. Unemployment at 16%, rising to 40% among the young; debt at 90% of GDP; the coast dependent on tourism, the interior sending migrant workers to Germany and Austria by the coachload.</p> <p>What\u2019s new is the return of nationalism. By 2013, Croatia\u2019s conservative nationalist politicians had made enough liberal noises to convince Brussels they could meet the basic criteria for EU membership. Since then, they\u2019ve been sucked into the surge of nationalist rivalry that\u2019s gripped the Balkans. Just across the mountains lies Republika Srpska \u2013 the Serb enclave created in the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Dayton Agreement in 1995, after a bitter civil war. Republika Srpska\u2019s leaders are threatening to hold a referendum on independence, which would blow up the deal that has brought peace to the region for 20 years.</p> <p>In response, Croatia\u2019s politicians have upped the rhetoric, with the leader of its centre-left party secretly recorded threatening to \u201cact to protect Croats\u201d if the referendum goes ahead, labelling Bosnia a \u201cfailed state\u201d and calling the government of Serbia \u201cmiserable people\u201d.</p> <p>If this were just a recrudescence of the Balkan ethnic conflict of the 1990s, it would be bad enough. But it comes on top of years of economic failure, amid growing geopolitical tension, and rising xenophobia in the face of the refugee crisis.</p> <p>Russian money has poured not just into Serbia but into Republika Srpska, too, together with increased diplomatic influence. Meanwhile, Croatia has joined the EU. As a result, the Balkans today have become a more clearly diplomatic and systemic frontline than they were in 1995, when the wars ended. The assumption that globalisation, economic growth and time would heal the region is looking more uncertain than at any point since the peace deal.</p> <p>If the Serbs of Bosnia were to go for their independence referendum, and Putin were to back them, the Kremlin would have a new pawn in the same game it is playing with the west in Syria, Ukraine and the Baltic States.</p> <p>Amid this, the intellectual life of the Balkans has retreated to a set of parallel compartments. There is the globalist left, applauding the partisan veterans in the squares, but insignificant in mainstream politics. There is the far right, whose main achievement in Croatia this year was to erect a statue to a convicted ethnic terrorist from the 1970s.</p> <p>Many people in their 40s and 50s live a post-traumatic lifestyle: getting on with business, family or early retirement, rarely speaking about what they did, or suffered, but gripped by an innate concern that the conflict might come back.</p> <p>Meanwhile, young people across the region try to live in a cannabis-softened, networked dreamworld \u2013 where electronic dance music or Pok\u00e9mon Go replace the national and political identities formed 20 years ago.</p> <p>If Europe wants to make the Balkans work, it needs to understand the limits of its current approach. It has lowered accession standards for countries in east and southeast Europe, in order to bring them into its enlargement project.</p> <p>Albania got candidate status in 2014. Bosnia submitted its application in February this year. Macedonia, which gained brownie points in Brussels for erecting a fence on the Greek border last year, is so mired in ethnic violence and rampant corruption that EU membership is impossible. Yet there are loud voices calling for its admission.</p> <p>The region\u2019s politicians, be they corrupt, chauvinist or simply incompetent, know that by ticking a few boxes on an EU checklist they can advance the process of accession with only paper reforms. The fact that many of the region\u2019s progressives, above all the young, yearn for EU membership is one more incentive for Brussels to look the other way.</p> <p>If the EU is to live up to the hope and trust placed in it by young people in the Balkans, it needs to start by being firm with the incoming Croatian government. All cultural nods and winks towards the fascist regime in the second world war must go. Ultimately, the EU must be prepared \u2013 as it has threatened with Poland and Hungary but not done \u2013 to trigger the Article 7 processes that can see member countries warned over inadequate rule of law, and ultimately be suspended from membership, or see their voting rights curtailed.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s leaders lost no time after Brexit in reigniting the common defence and security policy process \u2013 what the Daily Mail calls the \u201cEuropean Army\u201d. They are right to do so \u2013 for if the Balkans goes wrong again, Croatia as an EU member would have the right to call for support under the mutual defence clause of the Lisbon treaty, and all EU members would have the obligation to support it. But in the short term, what is vital is for western European democracies to engage with the Balkans and promote democratic culture and institutions. It was, ultimately, US diplomacy that imposed the peace of 1995. Today it is squarely the EU\u2019s task to maintain it.</p>",

  "<h2>What is pneumonia?</h2> <p>Pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue in one or both lungs, usually caused by a bacterial infection. It causes tiny air sacs at the end of the breathing tubes in the lungs to fill up with fluid. The body sends white blood cells to the lungs to try to fight the infection, which helps kill the germs but can also make it harder for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream.</p> <h2>Who\u2019s at risk?</h2> <p>People with a weaker immune system, whether because of age, illness or disease. Babies, infants and older people, as well as smokers and heavy drinkers, are at higher risk. People with other health conditions, including cancer, long-term heart, lung and kidney diseases and diabetes are also at increased risk, as are those whose immune system has been weakened through chemotherapy or certain medications or because they have HIV/Aids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">Hillary Clinton cancels California trip after pneumonia forces departure from 9/11 ceremony</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2> <p>They are typically similar to a flu or chest infection so would include a high temperature or fever, sweating, shivering and a cough that brings up phlegm, as well as a loss of appetite. Signs that it is more serious include breathing quickly and feeling confused or disoriented, which is mostly observed in older people. A sharp pain in the side of the chest, which becomes worse when taking a deep breath, usually means that pleurisy \u2013 an inflammation of the thin outer covering of the lung \u2013 has developed.</p> <h2>How serious is pneumonia?</h2> <p>The vast majority of people will recover from pneumonia and return to good health. In milder cases it could involve a few days or a week of being unwell and then a steady return to normality. But in severe cases it can take six months or even longer to clear and it is a leading cause of death among old and seriously ill people. In a person in poor health or with a weak immune system, untreated pneumonia can cause oxygen levels to fall so far that body tissue is starved \u2013 particularly in the heart and brain \u2013 of the oxygen it needs to function.</p> <h2>How is it treated?</h2> <p>In a healthy person, rest and plenty of water \u2013 plus antibiotics if it is bacterial \u2013 can suffice as their natural defences kick in. If symptoms are severe (more common with bacterial infections), hospital treatment will be needed. Patients will receive antibiotics and fluids through a drip, and may need oxygen to help them breathe. In very serious cases patients may be put on a ventilator.</p>",

  "<p>For years, the BBC has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/27/bbc-false-balance-fox-news-global-warming\">criticised</a> for the false balance of its climate change coverage. And for years, the BBC has apparently been doing \u201c<a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf#page=3\">ongoing work</a>\u201d to fix it. So far, however, this \u2018reform\u2019 has been more like a triumph of the middling. Yes, the BBC may broadcast less outright misinformation, but as a scientist and a citizen, I still feel let down by its continually careless handling of climate denial - most recently two weeks ago. This nod to mediocrity is a disservice to science, to public trust, and to the biggest news story in the world. And it is a huge, missed opportunity.</p> <p>As a young PhD graduate working on climate change solutions, I am confronted daily by a world where the warnings of science are undercut by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/17/fox-news-inner-struggle-with-climate-misinformation\">Fox \u2018News\u2019</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.ecowatch.com/wall-street-journal-willing-to-print-truth-about-climate-change-if-you-1891174269.html\">ilk</a>. It is a very different world to the trustworthy BBC broadcasts of David Attenborough and the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures that I grew up with, which helped inspire me to become a scientist. But as a recent BBC News segment by Science Editor David Shukman sadly reminded me, those worlds can too easily collide.</p> <p>Shukman\u2019s broadcast was an interesting one. An important perspective on the \u201cpolitical battle over the future of fuel\u201d in the swing state of Ohio, and its implications for U.S. energy policy. I transcribed it <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnTclsQtlshkrj7Xz1XU0GoyFD_yVUlGpoI-9Nktf_M/edit\">here</a>. It was all pretty benign until, halfway through, something in Shukman\u2019s narration caught my ear (emphasis mine): </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The problem with coal comes when you burn it. It releases carbon dioxide, which is <strong>blamed </strong>for global warming. <strong>Donald Trump says</strong> that isn\u2019t a problem. But <strong>Hillary Clinton says</strong> it is, and she\u2019s offering a greener future instead ... </em></p> <p><em><strong>While the debate rages over whether climate change is a threat or not</strong> \u2026</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Shukman\u2019s accompanying BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37034052\">blog post</a> beats the same drum, outlining the candidates\u2019 \u201cstarkly different visions of global warming\u201d: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The Democratic Party contender says she believes in the science of climate change.

But they also deserve to know that the debate is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/04/global-warming-debate-not-about-science\">political, not scientific</a>.

And they deserve to know that President Trump <a href=\"http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2016/07/report-trump-would-be-only-world-leader-deny-climate-science\">would be</a> the only leader in the world to oppose that consensus. </p> <p>Pat Moynihan once said, \u201cEveryone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.\u201d So how can the BBC avoid its damaging lapses, where the two get blurred? </p> <p>Extrapolating from the \u201cdisappoint[ment]\u201d of the Parliamentary committee chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\">Andrew Miller</a>, \u201cthat the BBC does not ensure all of its [programs] and presenters reflect the actual state of climate science in its output\u201d, here\u2019s one idea: The BBC could adopt a new reporting protocol, whereby whenever individuals express opinions on climate change of any kind, or perhaps whenever the subject arises at all, reporters must include a one-sentence summary of the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002\">scientific consensus</a> in their story. </p> <p>This (partial) solution would give journalists an uncontroversial way to apply the recommendation of Miller\u2019s committee \u201cto challenge statements that stray too far from science.\u201d And <a href=\"http://eiui.ca/current-literature-the-conflict-between-journalistic-balance-and-scientific-credibility-in-science-reporting/\">empirical studies</a> suggest that while this approach would not be enough to fully offset the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html?wt.ec_id=nclimate-201112\">crippling confusion</a> caused by \u201c<a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2014/04/02/false-balance-in-climate-reporting-reveals-bbcs-sensitivity-to-political-pressure/\">falsely balanced</a>\u201d reporting, it <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013EF000226/full\">would help</a>.

This comes on top of fears that central banks may be running out of ammunition to boost the global economy following suggestions of a rate rise by the US Federal Reserve and last week\u2019s lack of further stimulus by the European Central Bank. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A negative open comes as markets price in a higher probability that the US Fed will hike rates again next month. This comes after Boston Fed Governor Rosengren (FOMC voter) reiterated a hawkish message on Friday that served as the nail in the coffin for market concerns regarding global monetary policy divergence. This sealed a week-end sell-off for equities. Add to this questions being asked of the health of US Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and a new layer of political event risk sees markets on the back foot into the new week.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market North Sea oil business <strong>Xcite Energy</strong> has slumped 66% to 2.87p.

  "<p>This should not be news. But in today\u2019s febrile world of Twitter-fed headlines, it bears repeating: there are two old people running for president.</p> <p>One is a 68-year-old woman whose legs gave way in the late summer heat on Sunday<em> [Editor\u2019s note: shortly after publication of this article, the Clinton campaign revealed she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">suffering from pneumonia</a>]</em>. Hillary Clinton has also coughed a few times on camera. Both events have taken on cosmic significance in this otherwise sedate and stately presidential contest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/hillary-pneumonia-more-important-things-donald-trump\">Eight things that are more important than Hillary's pneumonia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four years ago, Clinton fainted and banged her head while sick with a stomach virus. Her doctor detailed last year the handful of pills she takes regularly: for her allergies, thyroid, and blood thinning. These facts have driven the conservative media into the kind of hysteria that requires its own medical attention.</p> <p>If American voters (or journalists) still expect their candidates to be \u2013 in the <a href=\"http://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-my-shot-lyrics\">words</a> of a popular musical \u2013 young, scrappy and hungry, they have not been paying attention. The primaries have left us with two nominees who are rather geriatric, stiff and well-fed.</p> <p>But as Joe Biden (73 years old) likes to say: don\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.</p> <p>In this case, the alternative is an overweight 70-year-old man who loves fast food, and whose gastroenterologist declared that he would be the healthiest president ever.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s gut doctor explained in recent interviews that this \u201chealthiest\u201d judgment was compared mostly to people now residing in their graves. \u201cAll the rest of them are sick or dead,\u201d Dr Harold Bornstein <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-doctor-wrote-health-letter-just-5-minutes-limo-waited-n638526\">told</a> NBC News.</p> <p>This is an unkind comparison for the current commander-in-chief, who works out every day and seems not to have an inch of fat on his bones. It is true that Barack Obama gave up basketball a few years ago, so maybe Bornstein knows something we don\u2019t. Then again, he also admitted he wrote about Trump\u2019s health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-doctor-letter-health-harold-bornstein\">in five minutes</a> while a Trump limo idled outside his office.</p> <p>Still, there are no two ways about it. This was Hillary\u2019s Worst. Weekend. Ever. (Apart from that whole impeachment saga and the 2008 primaries.) Just as she looked like she was running away to a landslide victory, a combination of a gaffe and a hot wobble has thrown the entire election into disarray.</p> <p>Of course until now, the gaffes have all emerged from the motor-mouth of Donald Trump. They have been so numerous, and so offensive, they have almost lost their power to shock. </p> <p>But with Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">off-the-cuff remarks about the bigotry of Trump\u2019s supporters</a>, we have officially reached the point of no return. This deplorable election, featuring a deplorable candidate, is now circling the drain because the only respectable candidate expressed her disdain for racist voters.</p> <p>Voters hold an unusual amount of respect in any election. We may have lost our respect for politicians, sports stars, religious leaders and just about every profession, but voters remain sacrosanct. So Clinton\u2019s comments have crossed a line: an unforced error that reveals how flawed a campaigner she is.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic,\u201d she told a Manhattan fundraiser, \u201cyou could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2013 you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that.

And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren\u2019t like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations.\u201d</p> <p>The speaker of these grossly generalistic insults of the pro-gun, pro-God culture of Middle America? Barack Obama, of course.</p> <p>Those comments came to light in April 2008, as Obama was fighting one Hillary Clinton for votes in the Pennsylvania primary. \u201cI was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small-town America,\u201d Clinton said at the time. \u201cHis remarks are elitist and out of touch.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s staffers started handing out stickers saying \u201cI\u2019m not bitter\u201d and she went on to win the primary by nine points. She ultimately lost the nomination by a convincing margin.</p> <p>What of the lasting damage to candidate Obama from this revealing insight into this elitist character? In the general election, Obama won Pennsylvania by 10 points. He took God-fearing Virginia by 6 points, and gun-loving Indiana by 1 point.</p> <p>Ah, yes. But what about Mitt Romney\u2019s unforgettable gaffe \u2013 also at a fundraiser among the super-wealthy \u2013 when he condemned not just half of his opponent\u2019s supporters, but half of the population of the United States?</p> <p>\u201cThere are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\u201d he said, \u201cwho are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims. These are people who pay no income tax \u2026 and so my job is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Why did the Romney gaffe stick? Because it played into months of multi-million-dollar advertising and messaging from the Obama campaign about Romney\u2019s lack of compassion for the middle class. After all those attacks, the gaffe seemed like Romney\u2019s confession of the truth.</p> <p>So where is the comparable anti-Clinton narrative, bolstered by huge ad spends and a consistent communications strategy? (And no, tweets don\u2019t count.) The Trump campaign, such as it is, has no major ad spending, and nothing that resembles a strategy in communications, policy or politics. It is singularly ill equipped to profit from this gift of a gaffe.</p> <p>If any candidate plays into this gaffe-fest, it\u2019s Trump himself. Because the real power of a gaffe is that it exposes some unspeakable truth. And the truth is that many Trump supporters are indeed attracted by the \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d eruptions of the candidate himself.</p> <p>Trump built his candidacy on questioning the birthplace of the country\u2019s first black president. He went on to suggest that the same president harbored sympathies for Isis. <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/05/gop-quickly-unifies-around-trump-clinton-still-has-modest-lead.html\">Sure enough</a>, two-thirds of Trump supporters believe Obama is Muslim and 59% think he wasn\u2019t born in the United States. It\u2019s unlikely they hold these views in an adorable way.</p> <p>Deplorable, on the other hand, might be a great word to describe a candidate who suggests that gun owners should shoot Hillary Clinton to stop her proposals on gun safety? That would be the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-violent-rhetoric-history-226873\">same candidate</a> whose butler posted that someone should shoot Obama, and whose supporters regularly chant \u201ckill the bitch\u201d when Clinton\u2019s name is mentioned. </p> <p>Clinton isn\u2019t missing the other appeal of Donald Trump: the aspirational side of his policy agenda that his supporters are yearning for. There is no other appeal of Trump and no aspirational agenda. That\u2019s why the Clinton campaign is digging in for a long fight about Trump\u2019s deplorable nature.</p> <p>Was the comment elitist, tone-deaf and self-defeating? Could it \u2013 along with the health scare stories \u2013 narrow the Clinton poll lead by a point or two? As Sarah Palin would say, you betcha.</p> <p>But please spare us the false equivalency. There are worse political crimes than such gaffes. And there are older, unhealthier candidates running for president.</p>",

Roughly an hour and half after Clinton arrived, reporters noticed she had gone. For 90 minutes, the campaign refused to give any details to the press designated to follow Clinton in public, refusing to confirm if she had indeed left the ceremony. </p> <p>Fox News reported that Clinton stumbled as she was helped into a van. After weeks of frenzied speculation about the Democratic nominee\u2019s health, mostly by Republicans and conspiracy theorists, the lack of facts fuelled theories online. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/775109381302157312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing to see here, just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">@Wikileaks</a> actively stoking insane conspiracy theories about Hillary&#39;s pneumonia <a href=\"https://t.co/M18r8KnEcE\">pic.twitter.com/M18r8KnEcE</a></p>&mdash; (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/775109381302157312\">September 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>At about 11am, the press covering Clinton were told she had gone to her daughter Chelsea\u2019s apartment nearby, after feeling \u201coverheated\u201d.

Such footage was unlikely to quell questions about her health and stamina. Her campaign would not then confirm whether Clinton had seen, or was planning to see, a doctor. </p> <p>Hours later, at 5.15pm, the campaign reported that Clinton had been examined by her longtime doctor after returning to her home in Chappaqua.

  "<p>Campaigns, the White House and the public make grueling demands on leaders: amid persistent questions about candidates\u2019 health, symptoms have included pneumonia on the trail, migraines during debates and even vomit in the lap of a prime minister.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">Hillary Clinton has pneumonia, says doctor, after exit from 9/11 ceremony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s diagnosis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">pneumonia</a>, made on Friday but revealed on Sunday after her abrupt and unsteady departure from a 9/11 anniversary event, duly renewed demands for comprehensive health reports from both the Democratic candidate and her opponent, Donald Trump. </p> <p>Last year, Clinton\u2019s doctor <a href=\"https://hillaryclintonspeeches.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/2015-07-28_statement_of_health_-_lbardack.pdf\">released a few pages</a> of vital information about the 68-year-old\u2019s health and history, including a concussion in 2012 and a current prescription of antihistamines. </p> <p>Trump, 70, has released even less information: his doctor released a vague letter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-doctor-letter-health-harold-bornstein\">written in about five minutes</a>, that said the businessman would be the \u201chealthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d.</p> <p>Past candidates have offered more. In 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s doctor offered <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/president-obama-health-107797\">a 276-page report</a> about the senator, then 47, and John McCain, then 71 and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/24/science/sci-melanoma24\">the survivor of several brushes with skin cancer</a>, made almost 1,200 pages of medical history available.</p> <p>Clinton can be expected to recover swiftly \u2013 pneumonia is a common illness that most people get over in about two weeks, though it can become dangerous for older people and infants. The infection typically develops after a cold or flu: Clinton\u2019s doctor said the former secretary of state was suffering from persistent allergies before the diagnosis. </p> <p>Dr Lisa R Bardack, of Mount Kisco Medical Group in New York, prescribed antibiotics and rest and advised Clinton change her schedule, which has sent her traveling almost daily around the US, often to the large fundraisers or rallies. That schedule was under discussion on Sunday.</p> <p>Campaigns can act as petri dishes for the politicians, aides and the reporters who attend them, and recent elections have seen several instances of candidates persevering through or bowing out over illness. </p> <p>The former US representative Michele Bachmann, for example, was an early leader in the 2012 Republican primary but cited <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michele-bachmann-releases-physicians-note-on-migraines/2011/07/20/gIQAcnTiQI_story.html\">debilitating migraines</a> to explain why she suddenly left a debate. She eventually released a doctor\u2019s letter explaining the headaches were so strong they required medication. That same year, former Texas governor Rick Perry campaigned despite recent back surgery, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2012/12/03/rick-perrys-back-problems-worse-than-we-knew/\">reportedly using painkillers </a>to cope.</p> <p>Two decades earlier, Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas ran against Bill Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. His history of cancer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/20/us/paul-tsongas-who-made-presidential-bid-dies-at-55.html\">became a major election issue</a>: Tsongas later <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/blogs/paging.dr.gupta/2007/04/cancer-and-presidency.html\">admitted he had lied </a>about being cancer-free in the years before the race. A subsequent presidential election had its own health scare: Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/15/cheney.hospital/index.html?iref=topnews\">had his fourth heart attack</a> shortly after voters went to the polls in November 2000.</p> <p>Questions of seniority and health followed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 campaign, when the 73-year-old was running for re-election as the oldest president in history. Reagan broached the issue at a debate against his younger opponent, Walter Mondale, joking: \u201cI am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d</p> <p>Only eight presidents have died in office, and four of those were assassinated. Not long after his inauguration in 1841, 68-year-old William Henry Harrison caught a cold that developed into pneumonia, according to his doctor, though he may have actually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/what-really-killed-william-henry-harrison.html\">contracted enteric fever</a>. Despite attempts to medicate Harrison with opium and other toxins, he became the first president to die in service.</p> <p>Less than a decade later, Zachary Taylor died in office, only five days after falling ill, probably from cholera. In 1923, Warren G Harding died from heart disease \u2013 a sudden heart attack while he was visiting San Francisco \u2013 aged 57.</p> <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was diagnosed with polio at 39 and lived with increasing paralysis through his time in office, only <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/health/05docs.html\">allowed voters a partial view</a> of his health through four elections and three and a half terms. He used a wheelchair only in private, relying on crutches and weighted podiums to stand in public, and retreated often to Warm Springs, Georgia, where he owned a rehabilitation clinic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a97fd4b51476d3dbdac23bc18ac384bf5bc7ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a97fd4b51476d3dbdac23bc18ac384bf5bc7ca/0_0_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dick cheney with bust\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Cheney had a heart attack shortly after voting took place in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public knew of his affliction but Roosevelt often portrayed himself as improving, and only rarely would he allow photographs while seated in his wheelchair or comment publicly about his condition. He died aged 63.</p> <p>A wheelchair may have changed the fate of another politician a few decades later. During the 1972 campaign, Alabama governor George Wallace was shot. The politician subsequently blamed the would-be assassin for ending his career. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-terrible-weekend-alternative-worse\">Hillary had a terrible weekend.

Nor are candidates who ascend to office immune from the hazards of illness and injury. In 1865, vice-president-elect Andrew Johnson arrived at his inauguration sick with typhoid fever. He promptly drank several whiskeys before <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Andrew_Johnson.htm\">presenting himself, drunk and hungover, to be sworn in</a> before Congress and Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>More than a century later, George HW Bush suffered a similar embarrassment. The president fell ill during a trip to Japan, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnOnDatqENo\">vomited in the lap of prime minister Miyazawa Kiichi</a>. He recovered, apologized, and fled the banquet. </p> <p>Bush\u2019s son, the 43rd president George W Bush, escaped the ignominy of being caught on film during his own health scare in 2002, when, while watching TV, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/14/news/mn-22490\">he choked on a pretzel and briefly lost consciousness</a>.</p>"
