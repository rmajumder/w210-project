  "<p>Gary Johnson \u2013 the Republican-leaning, marijuana-smoking, Everest-climbing presidential nominee of the Libertarian party \u2013 has a problem: he will be barred from crucial election TV debates this autumn unless he can boost his polling numbers to 15%, from around 10% now.</p> <p>Without the blockbuster ratings that the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, many say it\u2019s hard to see how Johnson, 63, or either of the two other third-party candidates \u2013 Jill Stein of the Green party and Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and policy director for the House Republican Conference \u2013 can ever be anything more than electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But other commentators suggest that the emergence of three independent candidates could still provide an unpredictable twist. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look.</p> <p>In Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian-American and Pacific islander voters to press their case. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico who presents a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs, reasoned at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, one indication of the craziness was that \u201cI might be the next president of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>A just-released <em>Wall Street Journal</em>-NBC poll gives Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. Johnson said he had been asked repeatedly if a vote for him, or any third-party candidate, was a wasted vote. \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said in Vegas. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who also spoke at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she described as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominee in US history. \u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who was also the Green party candidate in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d focused on renewable energy jobs and on completing America\u2019s transition to renewable energy by 2030. She also proposes to cut the military budget by a third and the creation of regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.</p> <p>On the Republican side, McMullin, a beneficiary of the #Never Trump movement, missed getting on the ballot in 26 states before he had even sent out his first campaign release.</p> <p>Despite this, he gives disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee, who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best chance would be if Trump were to drop out of the race for some as-yet-unanticipated reason. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said. \u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles has a third party candidate had any influence: that was in 1992, when Texan businessman Ross Perot took almost 18.9% of the vote and helped to hand the election to Arkansas governor Bill Clinton over what could have been a straightforward re-election for George HW Bush.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he had seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Johnson\u2019s campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has said that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third party candidate could be limited. But given the unpredictability of the race so far, and the probability that Johnson and Stein will pull more voters from Clinton than Trump, all that could change. \u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d says veteran Democratic adviser Hank Sheinkopf. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf believes the election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1/0_62_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Perot in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last third-party candidate to significantly affect a US presidential election was businessman Ross Perot in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, federal judge Rosemary Collyer rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion in debates is set artificially high. Yet there are signs that the ground could be shifting. Former Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, hinted that a third podium might be needed. \u201cSome of our production people may have said: \u2018<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like\u2019</a>,\u2019\u2019 McCurry told Politico. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a non-partisan polling firm, said: \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included, and in an election like this where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <p>But even Johnson and Stein remain somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a political realignment among voters dissatisfied with a two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019, as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarised that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>In Vegas, Stein advanced a similar position: \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganisation in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart, and the Democrats have kind of split, with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d She noted that it was by voting for the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d that the country had inherited many of its problems.</p> <p>When recent polls are expanded to include all four candidates, rather than just the main two, most show a smaller lead for Clinton over Trump and in the others the margins remain similar.</p> <p>Johnson accepted that his polling was thus far insufficient to qualify for the debates and his chances of making an impact were remote unless he could take part in the debates.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that, right now, arguably the two most polarising figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\" title=\"\">Barack Obama was the \u201cfounder of Isis\u201d</a> and its \u201cmost valuable player\u201d. Earlier he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/10/trump-clinton-second-amendment-2016-campaign-live\" title=\"\">hinted</a> that gun activists might want to assassinate Hillary Clinton to prevent her appointing liberal justices to the Supreme Court. In Britain, meanwhile, calls for the moderation of violent political language after the death of Jo Cox have not resulted in much reduction of the gleeful talk of \u201cstabbings\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d, and did not discourage Nigel Farage from exulting that the Brexit vote had been won \u201cwithout a shot being fired\u201d. In what some call an era of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, public discourse seems more abusive and angry, and further from the ideal of reasoned conversation about social goods, than ever before. Is our political language broken?</p> <p>Well, people have been complaining about the corruption of political language since political language existed. Confucius warned that a ruler should use the correct names for things, or social catastrophe would result. <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\" title=\"\">Orwell lamented</a> that political language in his time was \u201cdesigned to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\u201d. And the era of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d gave rise to a whole new constellation of what I call Unspeak: carefully engineered phrases designed to smuggle in a biased point of view and shut down thought and argument \u2013&#xa0;like \u201cwar on terror\u201d itself.</p> <p>Nor is flat-out lying in politics anything new. There is a marvellous 18th-century pamphlet usually attributed to John Arbuthnot, friend of Swift and Pope and founder of the Scriblerus club. It describes a yet-to-be-written book, <em>The Art of Political Lying</em>, in which the author will show \u201cthat the People have a Right to private Truth from their Neighbours ... but that they have no Right at all to Political Truth\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The coinage \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, indeed, implies that there was once a golden age of politics in which its elevated practitioners spoke nothing but perfect truth. The sun never dawned on such a day. But perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie repeatedly debunked. Arbuthnot cautioned that the same lie should not be \u201cobstinately insisted upon\u201d, but he did not live to see this strategy work so brilliantly during the EU referendum, with the Leave campaign\u2019s claim that we sent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\" title=\"\">\u00a3350m a week to the EU</a>.</p> <p>Shameless, too, was the haste with which this lie, having done its work, was disowned on the morning of the referendum result. It was a \u201cmistake\u201d, muttered Nigel Farage, before carefully lowering his snout back into the EU trough that continues to pay his MEP\u2019s salary. This rather called to mind Paul Wolfowitz\u2019s candid admission that the issue of Saddam\u2019s alleged WMD was chosen as the justification for the Iraq war <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2945750.stm\" title=\"\">\u201cfor bureaucratic reasons\u201d</a>. The surprise, perhaps, is that you can show how the magic trick works, and people still believe it next time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35de0fbde6281d92567dd055e117cd8a77b46c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35de0fbde6281d92567dd055e117cd8a77b46c70/0_7_5173_3103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Champion of \u2018free speech\u2019: Donald Trump at a campaign rally last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Champion of \u2018free speech\u2019: Donald Trump at a campaign rally last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not so long ago it was \u201csoundbites\u201d that were thought to be corrupting political debate by reducing complex ideas to slogans. The 1988 US presidential election was called the \u201csoundbite election\u201d by some commentators, the most famous example being George HW Bush\u2019s promise: \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes.\u201d (Two years later Bush agreed to a bipartisan budget that did increase taxes.) It was a mysteriously brilliant piece of verbal engineering. Why would you have to read Bush\u2019s lips when you could hear what he was saying on the TV? But the surprising image and arresting rhythm made it stick.</p> <p>Soundbites and slogans (\u201cTake Back Control\u201d) still work. Trump, too, has a conventional campaign slogan: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. (Great how, exactly? By doing what? Don\u2019t ask.) But he gets most publicity for his antic, apparently off-the-cuff remarks that rhetorically perform an absence of rhetoric. His real genius might be read as a satirical absolutism about the first amendment. If speech is genuinely free, there should be no consequences to speech whatsoever. And, to the mystification of the commenting class, this is what Trump repeatedly finds to be the case.</p> <p>After the media furore surrounding Trump\u2019s claim that Obama founded Isis, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201d Thus he rows back from any outrageous claim dreamed up by a brain that works like a cleverly programmed internet meme-generator. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, all innocence, \u201cthat\u2019s what some people are saying.\u201d (No one was before he did.) Yet the idea Obama is the founder of Isis will stick in at least some voters\u2019 minds come polling day, as will the imaginary Mexican wall (though they will probably have forgotten its \u201cbig beautiful door\u201d) \u2013 just as the \u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d promise did for many Leave voters.</p> <p>Trump is not a perversion of the tradition of political campaigning; he is the logical culmination of it. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say, if it helps you get elected. Trump is not a liar, exactly, but a bullshitter. According to the <a href=\"https://philosophynow.org/issues/53/On_Bullshit_by_Harry_Frankfurt\" title=\"\">canonical definition by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt</a>, a liar still cares about the truth because he wants to conceal it from you. A bullshitter, on the other hand, simply doesn\u2019t care what is true at all.</p> <p>Trump is merely the most energetic current exploiter of a fact that modern politicians have long known: the media is broken, and you can mercilessly exploit its flaws to your own benefit. (That, after all, is what \u201cspin doctors\u201d are for.) If you repeat a lie often enough, then that claim becomes the story, and it\u2019s what most people remember. And a structural confusion between \u201cimpartiality\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d undermines the mission to inform of institutions such as the BBC. To be impartial would be to point out untruths wherever they come from. But to be \u201cbalanced\u201d is to have a three-way between a presenter and two economists on opposite sides of some question. Never mind that one economist represents the views of 95% of the profession and the other is an ideologically blinkered outlier: the structure of the interview itself implies to the audience that the arguments are evenly divided.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of 'happy firing'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the age of social media, moreover, dubious political claims are packed into atomised fragments and attract thousands of enthusiastic retweets, while the people who help to redistribute them are unlikely ever to see a rebuttal that comes later or in someone else\u2019s timeline. We\u2019ve all moved on.</p> <p>Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of \u201chappy firing\u201d (a term for the celebratory shooting of assault rifles into the sky). That lies can go viral more quickly than the truth is another old observation. In 1710 Jonathan Swift wrote: \u201cFalsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.\u201d But what is certain is that Twitter and Facebook now help it fly faster and further than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75adb12b31b1064ef306f24b5dbfd6386d3bde7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75adb12b31b1064ef306f24b5dbfd6386d3bde7d/0_0_3500_2320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage proved the power of powerful slogans and images during the EU referendum campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage proved the power of powerful slogans and images during the EU referendum campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because attention is the currency of social media, public figures are incentivised to use outrage to vie for visibility, which further coarsens the public discourse \u2013 as when the American shock-journo <a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2016-08-10.html\" title=\"\">Ann Coulter lately defended Trump</a> by calling him a \u201cvictim of media rape\u201d who is being blamed for \u201cwearing a short skirt\u201d. Any such outburst these days, along with the wave of overt post-Brexit racism in Britain, may be defended as a healthy refusal to kowtow to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, a term that originally denoted the careful use of language so as not to needlessly upset people, and now just means common decency.</p> <p>What, then, is to be done? The modern bullshitting demagogue succeeds because he says arresting and often amusing things that cut through the anomie of those who feel left behind by politics as usual. Exquisitely reasoned liberal conversation is exactly what turns those voters off. Lately it has been notable that Hillary Clinton, not previously considered the wittiest person in US politics, has used an impressive array of scripted zingers to put down her opponent. What the bullshitters do so well is define the rules of the game, so perhaps their opponents will have to play it at least to this extent, while trying to keep the moral high ground by still caring about what is true and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an edifying thought, but if the insurgent right is to have its Trumps and its Farages, maybe the centre and the left need their own versions too.</p> <p><em>Steven Poole is the author of </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rethink-385383.html\" title=\"\"><em>Rethink: The Surprising History of New Ideas</em></a><em> (Random House Books)</em></p>",

At home, he points to falling living standards for many Americans and the disappearance of well-paid manufacturing jobs. Overseas, he claims the world is laughing at the US and laments that \u201cwe don\u2019t win any more\u201d.</p> <p>Many in Europe are tempted to see Trump as an \u201conly in America\u201d aberration. Yet the fear of economic and geopolitical decline that Trump is capitalising upon is widely visible across the west. The coalition of frustrated working-class voters and nostalgic nationalists that the Republican has put together is uncomfortably reminiscent of the alliance that voted for Brexit in the UK. Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again\u201d mantra has an echo of the Brexit campaign\u2019s winning slogan \u2013 \u201cTake back control\u201d. Nor is this is just an Anglo-American phenomenon.

This erosion of the west\u2019s privileged position in world affairs is creating new economic, geopolitical and even psychological pressures in both the US and the EU.</p> <p>The driving force of this change is the extraordinary economic development of Asia over the past 50 years. In 2014, the IMF reported that, measured in purchasing power, China is now the world\u2019s largest economy. The US had held this title since 1871, when it displaced the UK; now China is number one. The rise of China is just part of a broader shift of economic power towards Asia. The IMF reports that three of the world\u2019s four largest economies are now in Asia. China is first, the US is second, India third and Japan fourth.</p> <p>It is true that if you measure economies at current exchange rates the US is still the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and European nations also rise up the pecking order. But growing Chinese and Asian economic weight is demonstrable in many other ways. China is now the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and the largest exporter. It is also the world\u2019s largest market for vehicles, smartphones and oil \u2013 and the biggest single market for many western companies such as Daimler and KFC. But it is not just Mercedes and fried chicken that are being consumed in Asia. In 2012, for the first time in over a century, Asian countries spent more money on armaments and troops than European nations. The world\u2019s two largest arms importers are now India and Saudi Arabia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/arab-states-almost-double-small-arms-imports-report\">Middle East states almost double small-arms imports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conventional economic theory holds that the growing wealth of Asia should be a boon to the economies of the west, since it offers new markets and sources of investment.

Since then, tensions between the Aussies and the Chinese have risen. A few days ago, the <em>Global Times</em>, a subsidiary of China\u2019s <em>People\u2019s Daily</em>, suggested that if the Australian navy joined the US in patrolling waters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/jul/12/south-china-sea-dispute-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-hague-court-ruling\" title=\"\">claimed by Beijing </a>in the South China Sea, Australia would be \u201can ideal target to warn and strike\u201d.</p> <p>The shrill tone of such Chinese pronouncements underlines the fact that the shift in global economic power has not just altered attitudes in the west, it has also produced an increasingly assertive nationalism in Xi Jinping\u2019s China.

President Xi is a tough-minded nationalist, so a Clinton presidency would increase the chances of a clash in the Pacific between the US and China.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, seems relatively uninterested in America\u2019s strategic role in the Pacific, but his vociferous protectionism has led him to propose swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods. Any such policy would be regarded as an act of economic warfare by Beijing.</p> <p>Either way, the era when globalisation seemed like a process that could create only common interests between China and the west is over. It is now giving way to an epoch that looks altogether darker and more dangerous.</p>",

I have done fundraising events in every part of the country and it strikes me that there is a pleasing diversity of the people that have joined the party in terms of age, gender and ethnic background, ideas. It\u2019s wonderful. I think we should welcome them. I don\u2019t know why people get frightened of lots of new members. I am happy about it.</p> <p><strong>Is there a problem of people joining from other parties, including those who supported the Socialist Workers party?</strong><br></p> <p>I want people to join for good motives. But if they have changed their political views or developed their political views, then surely that is a good thing. We can only win a general election by winning people over from non-voting or voting from another party. If someone has developed their politics to be members of the Labour party even though they were once members of the Lib Dems, or Greens or something, fine. Welcome aboard.</p> <p><strong>Have you got full confidence in Iain McNicol as general secretary?</strong><br></p> <p>We will receive a report from Iain about the process that has gone on over the last few months. And the NEC [national executive council] will no doubt ask him questions and he will give answers on it. But let\u2019s look at that when the new NEC takes over.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the Labour party HQ has been even-handed in its approach to the leadership contest?</strong><br></p> <p>I say this: there will be a report on what has gone on. We\u2019ll have that discussion. As far as I am concerned I am hoping that we can develop as a party where all members are able to take part in activities.</p> <p><strong>Do you have total confidence in Iain McNicol?</strong><br></p> <p>I have been happy to work with Iain McNicol since I became leader.</p> <p><strong>But do you have full confidence in him?</strong><br></p> <p>I have been happy to work with him.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re launching a plan for education in Britain. How will this reshape education?</strong><br></p> <p>The idea is that we have an educational system that is wraparound and gives everyone opportunities. What we have got in Britain is a commodified education system where university and to some extent college education is concerned.</p> <p>We have insufficient access to preschool education for the youngest children. And we have a growing mix-up of secondary education between free schools and academies and local authority maintained schools. What we want is a national education concept that moves towards all children getting access to preschool facilities.</p> <p>We need a guarantee of class sizes of 30 or less in primary schools. There are a considerable number that are over 30, 31, some that are even bigger than that \u2013 up to 38 \u2013 and that is completely wrong. Therefore, we need more teachers, above all we need to retain more teachers. Sadly too many leave the profession very early because they are over-burdened by workloads and pressure on them. In secondary schools we have an increasing number of free schools and academies outside local authority orbit and the pay and conditions of the nationally agreed system. I am keen to re-establish local authorities as the family of education.</p> <p>We have also seen the sad demise of the once great adult education service in Britain, which was fantastic. Where local authorities would spend not very much money but get huge return for it. Adults could return to evening classes, night schools, weekend stuff where they could take degrees, study languages, study skills. Sometimes purely out of the joy of doing it. Sometimes for career development. I want to see a return to the levels of that and an extension of it. Then, of course, there is the question of university funding and the levels of fees. The government has finally ended the grant maintenance scheme altogether, which means that no student now gets any public support to go to university whatsoever. They have got to borrow for it and that means debt levels will rise. We have already seen a reduction in the number of students from working class and poor families going to university. I expect that is going to continue because they are raising the university fee cap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\" data-alt=\"Polling data for Labour and the Conservatives\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\">Polling data for Labour and the Conservatives</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Would you abolish tuition fees?</strong><br></p> <p>That would be the aim, yes. And to bring back maintenance grants for those who need them. It\u2019s going to be expensive, I understand that. But I also understand that as a society it works. A better educated society works for all of us and we will close the productivity gap by doing so. And we can look at countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/04/tuition-fees-germany-higher-education\">that don\u2019t charge university fees such as Germany</a>, which has a much higher standard of university level education for the whole population as a result.</p> <p><strong>How do you fund that level of expenditure?</strong><br></p> <p>It is expensive. We fund it through corporate taxation levels. By not reducing taxation and by chasing down tax avoidance and tax evasion.</p> <p><strong>Tax evasion. That won\u2019t bring in enough to fund it \u2026</strong><br></p> <p>It brings in as much as we can get. But it means we have to deal with the system that encourages it. It\u2019s costing us a lot of money not to have a higher level of higher education. If we invest in it we will benefit from it.</p> <p><strong>The RMT strikes, do you support them?</strong><br></p> <p>I understand why they are doing it. Absolutely. Because in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">Southern</a> the company has not fulfilled its obligations as far as I see it. The people who use Southern on the Brighton line are unbelievably angry about it. I am getting out-lefted by Tory MPs all down the line who want to take back the franchise, take the keys from Southern and give it over to Direct Rail. Direct Rail ran the north-east franchise extremely well. The exchequer got \u00a3600m out of it and instead it is now being handed over to Virgin and we have got overcrowding of mega proportions on the trains and we are not getting the same amount of money back.</p> <p><strong>Do you back the strikes on Southern and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/12/eurostar-strike-suspended-midnight-further-talks-rmt\">Eurostar</a>?</strong><br></p> <p>Yes, because I understand why they are doing it.</p> <p><strong>MPs and other critics have said that your message is too narrow. To get elected you will have to win seats from the SNP in Scotland, from Conservatives in the south and defend seats against Plaid in Wales and Ukip in the north. We are here in Sunderland where you have given a speech to 2,000 supporters which was very well received, and yet one of the local MPs, Sharon Hodgson, in her <a href=\"http://www.sharonhodgson.org/sharon_writes_to_local_labour_party_members_on_her_resignation_and_her_support_for_owen_smith_mp\">letter explaining why she was standing down</a> from the shadow frontbench, said: \u201cTo win a general election, we need to appeal to not only core Labour voters, but the wider electorate. Sadly, my experience on the doorstep across the country is that crucial swing voters will never vote for a labour government led by Jeremy, and I have experienced this on the doorstep in Washington and Sunderland West.\u201d</strong><strong> How are you going to reach out beyond the core to a wider electorate?</strong></p> <p>The appeal of our message has to be if you want real opportunities for everybody you have to invest in our society in a way that doesn\u2019t increase inequality, which is what we have got at the moment. Essentially, the Tories have reduced corporate taxation, the top level of taxation, and cut services at the other end. And frozen public sector wages. Every family in Britain is affected in some way or another by the housing issue. At one end it is being homeless \u2026 At another level it is being unable to buy your first-time flat or home or anything else and having to stay with your parents until you are 30 or 40. We have a system that does not build or supply the houses that are necessary and, indeed, under the housing act forces councils to sell high-value properties in high cost areas. And so the housing issue affects pretty much everybody. Invest in housing that is good for everybody.</p> <p>Secondly, the NHS effects everybody. An NHS that is part-privatised, an NHS that is so underfunded that it ends up rationing expensive medicines and mental health services is so underfunded that many people go untreated. So my message is to those who do not consider themselves to be the poorest and vulnerable in society but relatively well off: you actually will benefit from a good health service.</p> <p><strong>But that messaging is not reflected in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">polling</a> \u2026 no one has ever won an election with polling as poor as yours. The message has not got out to a wide enough number of people.</strong><br></p> <p>We have done our best to get our message out. It hasn\u2019t been helped that prominent people in the Labour party \u2013 Labour MPs \u2013 have spent the last 10 months actively being unsupportive of our policies that have been generally agreed and supported. Now everyone agrees that anti-austerity is the right line to be taking.</p> <p>And since the resignations in July and the leadership contest, then clearly the public mind has become focused on the leadership contest rather than the future. I\u2019m trying to turn this leadership campaign into a campaign of how we would run a general election. How we would win back those areas of Britain that have become disillusioned \u2013 left-behind Britain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b292998b73a47ffe162bfab10e32547ecd62c3ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b292998b73a47ffe162bfab10e32547ecd62c3ff/0_274_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We are all selected and supported by the party.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You mentioned the discord in the party. Let\u2019s talk about those MPs, many of whom are peeling away not for ideological reasons but for reasons of competence. Lilian Greenwood MP, in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/07/lilian-greenwood-mp-jeremy-corbyn-continually-undermined-me-job-i-loved\">explaining why she was resigning</a> from the shadow cabinet, said in a letter that: \u201c[Jeremy] is not a team player let alone a team leader \u2026 he doesn\u2019t understand collective responsibility and he can\u2019t lead a team. This is not about policy or ideology, it is about competence.\u201d She wrote of her frustration and upset that a policy launch on rail fares was undermined by the announcement of a shadow cabinet reshuffle that same day.</strong></p> <p>I am surprised that Lilian has taken this line. She and I sat down in her office with her team and we had a very good discussion about transport policies and we agreed a programme of activities. Why she should feel it necessary to write a letter like that at this moment she alone would know the answer to that.</p> <p><strong>But the reasons are in the letter: you announced a reshuffle on the day that the rail strategy that she had worked on for months was also being announced, and as a result it got buried by the reshuffle.</strong></p> <p>She knew full well that a reshuffle was happening at that time. Listen, choreography of news is not always the easiest thing to achieve. That was actually several months ago and so I have been happy to work with her and others and come the election result I will be happy to work with them again. And I hope that they will recognise that so far over 200 constituency parties have made a nomination for me as a leader of the party. That is far more than nominated me a year ago on a far greater, far higher level of participation by party members by those nominating at meetings. That is surely a sign of something.</p> <p><strong>But doesn\u2019t this get to the heart of the problems in the Labour party in that some of those MPs will say that they get their mandate from their constituents and there are 9.4 million Labour voters. The MPs \u2026 say they don\u2019t see you as an electable PM, so they are privileging loyalty to their constituents, which is a far greater number than the 500,000 or so Labour members.</strong><br></p> <p>We all take our mandate from our constituents. I do as well.</p> <p><strong>So in that case it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for MPs, who are taking soundings from voters, to say they are unwilling to support you as leader because they don\u2019t see you as being electable as a prime minister.</strong></p> <p>Of course it is perfectly reasonable.</p> <p><strong>But why do you keep calling them out for their disloyalty? Especially as someone who was a serial disloyal Labour MP under previous Labour governments. You voted 438 times against Labour. </strong><br></p> <p>No, I was standing for what I thought were very important principles such as on identity cards, such as on terrorism legislation, such as on the Iraq war, student fees. Those were the points of rebellion. I did not ever take any personal abuse or issues with anybody on the frontbench. I have never done that sort of politics, I never have.</p> <p><strong>No, but if these MPs feel as though their constituents will not be served by a Labour party that is not electable then it is a principled position for them to take, isn\u2019t it?</strong><br></p> <p>They can take a position, and they have done. And they are welcome to make the comments that they do. But I just remind them that we are all members of the Labour party. We are all selected and promoted and supported by members of the Labour party. And recruiting 300,000 people in a year has never ever been achieved before. I think some credit should be given where it is due. I would say to them, let\u2019s understand that the mood out there has changed. People don\u2019t want to live in an unequal society any more. There is thirst for real political change \u2026 People have had enough of neo-liberal economics and had enough of the politics of endless inequality.</p> <p><strong>You seem far more energised by this leadership campaign than by the European Union campaign. You have done 19 rallies in the leadership campaign. You did 10 in the EU referendum campaign. You seem to be enjoying this more than you did campaigning to stay in the EU.</strong><br></p> <p>I did more media appearances than the whole of the shadow cabinet put together in the referendum campaign. I made the case for Remain recognising the problems that the EU had on competitive postal services, for example, and there is a debate about a free market direction of Europe and there is a debate about the social Europe \u2013 and I obviously choose the social Europe model and I voted against Maastricht. I strongly supported the social chapter, and I supported the workers\u2019 time directive. Presumably Article 50 [of the Lisbon treaty] will be invoked at some point but we have to protect those advances but also ensure that we continue to gain market access. Here, in Sunderland, it relies very heavily on exports to Europe.</p> <p><strong>What is the right balance between public and private in the economy, do you think?</strong><br></p> <p>What I want to see is properly funded public services and recognise the public services role in helping people in employment. There has to be a much greater public role in industry and development. We don\u2019t shy away from the idea of investing in manufacturing industry. This country is very good at inventing things, discovering things, but very bad at developing things \u2026 linear motors, jet engines to some extent, tilting trains. We end up exporting the technology to somewhere else. If we had an effective national investment strategy we would be able to develop manufacturing process that goes with it.</p> <p>If we are to say to people: you invent something good, develop the manufacturing process as well \u2026 What happens now is that the banks won\u2019t lend to them because they say it\u2019s too risky, so a hedge fund comes along, buys the idea and then sells it somewhere else. And we end up developing the idea and losing the process. Can we not keep the process instead?</p> <p><strong>Do you want to take public ownership?</strong><br></p> <p>No it\u2019s about participation and partnerships \u2026 the straight public ownership we want to look at is the rail system, which these days has universal support in the Labour party.</p> <p><strong>Any others?</strong><br></p> <p>The Royal Mail \u2013 it\u2019s a crucial public service, it\u2019s a natural monopoly. It is ludicrous the idea of competition in postal delivery.</p> <p><strong>This campaign is turning a little nasty. There was a lot of booing at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-debate-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-gateshead-live\">event last night</a>.</strong><br></p> <p>People should treat other with respect.

Why has it happened over the last 10 months?</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately there has always been nastiness in politics, There has always been abuse in politics. I regret it and I deplore it. And I deplore it if it has increased. It\u2019s wrong.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it has increased?</strong><br></p> <p>No. I am not sure it has. I know that I have received more abuse than I ever use to. But then maybe I\u2019m better known these days. But I receive more abuse than anybody else. The best way of dealing with abuse is: ignore it.</p> <p>But MPs are saying they are on the receiving end of abuse and they can\u2019t ignore it.<br></p> <p>When there is racist abuse, misogynist abuse, threats against people \u2013 that is utterly, totally, completely wrong.</p> <p><strong>One of the reasons that the Labour party didn\u2019t perform better last time around is that they were marked down on economic competence, and a lot of what you outlined today is seemingly of appeal to a lot of people \u2026 better childcare, a better funded NHS, more social housing. But a lot of people will ask, \u201cWhere is the money coming from?\u201d How do you win the argument about economic competence?</strong><br></p> <p>I think one of the problems that we had was that none of us did enough to explain why the economic crisis came about in 2008-09 and so we allowed the narrative to develop that the crash of 2008-09 was caused by alleged high levels of spending by that Labour government. It was absolutely nothing to do with it. It was much more to do with the subprime mortgage crisis in the USA, over-exposed banks and the lack of banking regulations.</p> <p>I think now everyone would agree with that but we allowed that narrative to develop that Labour crashed the economy, that it spent too much. The economy crashed because it wasn\u2019t regulated enough.</p> <p>The other issue about competence is about how you deal with public investment. You either deal with it through very expensive PFI [private finance initiative] type funding \u2013 which ends up with a lack of public control and greater costs to the public \u2013 or you do it through traditional public investment through a public works loan board or a national investment bank, which gives better services for all.</p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?</strong><br></p> <p>Well I can\u2019t be with Trump, can I? I can\u2019t be with Trump so obviously with Hillary.</p>",

Yet on that summer\u2019s day in 2015, when given the chance, Clinton went after Jeb Bush. Trump was a celebrity sideshow.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucus-results-live-county-by-county-interactive-map\">would lose Iowa</a>, an embarrassing defeat for a man who despises losers. Clinton would declare herself the winner of the caucuses well before it was clear she\u2019d won. (The Associated Press called it the next morning: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucus-results-live-county-by-county-interactive-map\">she won by a fraction of a point</a>.)</p> <p>Now the candidates are back in Iowa, steadying for a bruising battle for the state\u2019s six electoral votes. </p> <p>\u201cIowa is the center of the political universe during the caucus period and then the morning after, we fall off the face of the Earth,\u201d said Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University. \u201cNormally our electoral votes don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>But this year is different, as Trump\u2019s path to the White House may depend on winning the state. And with less than 90 days before the election,<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton-5597.html\"> opinion polls show</a> voters here are evenly divided between and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">almost equally displeased with</a><strong><br></strong><strong> </strong>both candidates. </p> <p>\u201cIowa is the swingiest swing state,\u201d said Tim Albrecht, GOP strategist in Iowa. \u201cBut ultimately I think it\u2019s Trump\u2019s to lose.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and his vice-presidential candidate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, have visited the state a number of times in past weeks.

She added that her family felt discriminated against by some of Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexicans and immigrants. </p> <p>And a vital minority, still pursued by these un-Iowan politicians a year later, could again sway an election: the men and women who are undecided between the Washington fixture and the tabloid star of reality TV.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to vote for yet,\u201d Collins, the grandstand worker, said. \u201cI may go third party.

  "<p>And so ends the great populist uprising of our time, fizzling out pathetically in the mud and the bigotry stirred up by a third-rate would-be caudillo named Donald J Trump. So closes an era of populist outrage that began back in 2008, when the Davos dream of a world run by benevolent bankers first started to crack. The unrest has taken many forms in these eight years \u2013 from idealistic to cynical, from Occupy Wall Street to the Tea Party \u2013 but they all failed to change much of anything.<br></p> <p>And now the last, ugliest, most fraudulent manifestation is failing so spectacularly that it may discredit populism itself for years to come.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-voters-republicans-democrats\">I wrote</a> in this space about how the Trump phenomenon had reconfigured the conventional geometry of the two-party system. Trump was riding high in the polls at that moment, and there was reason to believe that his criticism of trade deals \u2013 one of several Trumpian causes long associated with the populist left \u2013 might play havoc with the Democrats\u2019 happy centrist plans.</p> <p>Now let us ponder the opposite scenario. In the intervening two weeks, Trump has destroyed himself more efficiently than any opposition campaign could ever have done. First, he heaped mounds of insults on the family of a US soldier killed in Iraq, then <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-week-they-decided-he-was-crazy-1470354031\">prominent journalists</a> raised doubts about his <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2016/08/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-trump-acting\">mental state</a>, and then (as if to confirm his doubters) he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">dropped a strong hint</a> that gun enthusiasts might take action against Hillary Clinton should she appoint supreme court justices not to his liking. </p> <p>His chances, <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#now\">as measured in the polls</a>, went almost overnight from fairly decent to utter crap. For much of this year, populism had the gilded class really worried. There was Bernie Sanders and the unthinkable threat of a socialist president. There was the terrifying Brexit vote. Just a short while ago the American national newspapers were running <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-trump-some-obama-backers-see-a-new-champion-of-hope-and-change/2016/08/05/6ba433b8-5986-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">page-one stories</a> telling readers it was time to take seriously Trump\u2019s followers, if not Trump himself. And on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/opinion/how-clinton-could-knock-trump-out.html?_r=0\">3 August</a>, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman actually typed the following: \u201cIt scares me that people are so fed up with elites, so hate and mistrust [Hillary] Clinton and are so worried about the future \u2013 jobs, globalization and terrorism\u201d that they might actually vote for Trump.</p> <p>Yes, it scared Friedman that the American people didn\u2019t like their masters any longer.

And within that one party, the political process bears a striking resemblance to dynastic succession. Party office-holders selected Clinton as their candidate long ago, apparently determined to elevate her despite every possible objection, every potential legal problem. The Democratic National Committee <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/dnc-wikileaks-emails/\">helped out, too</a>, as WikiLeaks tells us. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/2016-barack-obama-hillary-clinton-democratic-establishment-campaign-primary-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-214023#ixzz4Gfn7HFZ1\">So did President Barack Obama</a>, that former paladin for openness, who in the past several years did nearly everything in his power to suppress challenges to Clinton and thus ensure she would continue his legacy of tepid, bank-friendly neoliberalism.</p> <p>My leftist friends persuaded themselves that this stuff didn\u2019t really matter, that Clinton\u2019s many concessions to Sanders\u2019 supporters were permanent concessions. But with the convention over and the struggle with Sanders behind her, headlines show Clinton triangulating to the right, scooping up the dollars and the endorsement, and the elites shaken loose in the great Republican wreck.</p> <p>She is reaching out to the foreign policy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-republican-outreach-a-step-too-far-for-already-suspicious-liberals/2016/08/10/df58b3b2-5f0b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html\">establishment</a> and the neocons.

In her big <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-infrastructure-economy-jobs-trade-deals\">speech in Michigan</a> on Thursday she cast herself as the candidate who could bring bickering groups together and win policy victories through really comprehensive convenings.</p> <p>Things will change between now and November, of course. But what seems most plausible from the current standpoint is a landslide for Clinton, and with it the triumph of complacent neoliberal orthodoxy. She will have won her great victory, not as a champion of working people\u2019s concerns, but as the greatest moderate of them all, as the leader of a stately campaign of sanity and national unity. The populist challenge of the past eight years, whether led by Trump or by Sanders, will have been beaten back resoundingly. Centrism will reign triumphant over the Democratic party for years to come. This will be her great accomplishment. The bells will ring all over Washington DC.</p> <p>In this ironic and roundabout way, Trump may prove to be a disaster for the reform politics he has never really believed in. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a leader who could discredit populism more thoroughly than this compassion-free billionaire. For Friedman\u2019s beloved \u201celites\u201d, I predict that Trump will come to serve an important symbolic purpose. Trump loves to boast that he is immune to the scourge of money in politics, that he\u2019s nobody\u2019s puppet, and from his coming ruin and disgrace we will no doubt be told to draw many lessons about how money in politics actually helps prevent the rise of people like Trump and makes the system more stable. </p> <p>For decades, the Davos set have told us that doubt about \u201cglobalization\u201d was a species of racism, and soon Trump, as a landslide loser, will confirm this for them in overwhelming terms.</p> <p>My friends and I like to wonder about who will be the \u201cnext Bernie Sanders\u201d, but what I am suggesting here is that whoever emerges to lead the populist left will simply be depicted as the next Trump. The billionaire\u2019s scowling country-club face will become the image of populist reform, whether genuine populists had anything to do with him or not. This is the real potential disaster of 2016: That legitimate economic discontent is going to be dismissed as bigotry and xenophobia for years to come.</p>",
  "<p>A glance at the headlines would have you believe Fox News is on the ropes. Its former chairman, CEO and spiritual leader, Roger Ailes, has not only been ousted but buried under a pile of sexual abuse allegations.

On Friday, with a certain Spartan vibe, Rupert Murdoch created a new Fox News co-presidency shared by longtime Ailes lieutenant Bill Shine, who may yet be implicated in enabling Fox\u2019s epidemic of sexual abuse, and local TV chief Jack Abernethy. It was a symbolic double-promotion, but both are under daddy\u2019s supervision.<br></p> <p>The true successor to Ailes \u2013 who is still fighting the abuse allegations and vehemently denies wrongdoing \u2013 will be the next CEO and chairman. Candidates range from insiders such as executive editor John Moody and head of news Jay Wallace to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5fc2d4e4-4e98-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc.html\">superstar outsiders</a> such as CBS president David Rhodes. But whoever shows up won\u2019t have anything close to the control of \u201cthe Chairman\u201d, whose influence at Fox operates on a genetic level.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-tv-producer\">Roger Ailes accused in new harassment claim of proposing 'sexual alliance'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ailes has been banished, but the creature he electrified to life two decades ago now roams free on its own.<br></p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t expect them to make a big change in their coverage,\u201d said Jane Hall, former Fox contributor and professor of media studies at American University. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly successful formula.\u201d<br></p> <p>Fox is a money monster, pumping out over $1bn in <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-fox-9648c86a-5a4c-11e6-8b48-0cb344221131-20160804-story.html\">profits</a> a year. It rakes in about 20% of 21st Century Fox\u2019s earnings, the most profitable unit in the empire. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Murdoch brothers, Lachlan and James, heirs to News Corp patriarch Rupert and no fans of Ailes, told investors last week that they had no intention of tinkering with the \u201cunique and important voice\u201d of their moneymaker.<br></p> <p>Despite all the drama, former employees say that Fox is a money machine that can run the way it always has \u2013 and make the profits it always has \u2013 in a post-Ailes era.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe network can coast for years just on the institutional memory,\u201d said Joe Muto, who worked as a producer for Fox star Bill O\u2019Reilly for eight years before eventually going out in a blaze of glory after dishing the dirt on his employer to Gawker.<br></p> <p>\u201cAiles wanted to be successful, powerful and, yes, wanted to push his ideology,\u201d Muto said. \u201cMurdoch, I think, is less ideological, but he will default to whatever makes him money. And Fox has been a piggy bank. You look at their balance sheet and Fox underwrites other losses.\u201d<br></p> <p>The idea that a new CEO could steer Fox into something closer to CNN, or the smaller, friendlier conservative outlet Newsmax, presupposes that the profit motive is not driving one of the biggest media conglomerates on the planet. Not only does it continue to dominate ratings, it\u2019s such an essential part of America\u2019s media diet that most of its money comes from \u201ccarriage\u201d fees paid by the cable companies.<br></p> <p>And then there\u2019s the very good chance that this fall, voters will gift Fox another Clinton in the White House. Not only would it keep the network in the simple, righteous role of loyal opposition to liberal tyranny, it would also be a great return to the climate of Clinton-bashing that put Fox on the map back in the 90s.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think a Hillary presidency would guarantee the network maintains its rightwing bent for a few more years, even with the Murdoch brothers in control,\u201d said one ex-producer. Muto had a colorful metaphor at the ready: \u201cI would compare it to Batman and the Joker. Batman is a much more interesting character when he has the Joker as a foil. And Hillary Clinton is the Joker to Fox\u2019s Batman.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"389f6a6411284c4c40d953a974bc1bc25d26986c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/389f6a6411284c4c40d953a974bc1bc25d26986c/0_103_3336_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stronger together?

For one thing, Fox generally does better under a Democratic reign. It\u2019s true that the network became No 1 under Bush\u2019s first term, but that was no doubt fuelled by the nonstop drama of 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan, a climate of paranoia, and the culmination of the Iraq war \u2013 which, of course, Fox helped sell skillfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it would have played out without 9/11 and the Iraq war,\u201d Hall said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But eventually, Bush proved to be thin gruel, ratings-wise. \u201cI think Bush winning in \u201904 was a triumph for the network, but it went downhill quickly from there,\u201d Muto said. \u201cThe war started going badly. Hurricane Katrina happened. There was this sense that the network was having trouble carrying water for Bush any more. There was an overall sense of doom at Fox between Katrina and when the 2008 primaries began heating up.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ratings tell that story: from 2006 to 2007, Fox dropped to 1.4 million average viewers, down from 1.7 million a year before, according to Nielsen. By the end of 2008, they had shot up to 2 million.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt felt like the network was licking its chops for Hillary in 2008,\u201d said Muto. \u201c\u2018Our old nemesis is back.\u2019 Then when Obama showed up, it was even better.\u201d By 2009, the numbers were up to almost 2.2 million. Ratings have dipped in the latter half of Obama\u2019s second term, but a Clinton regime could be just the thing to reignite the base.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey can continue to attack the flaws of Bill Clinton through her,\u201d said Hall. \u201cShe\u2019s also, obviously, a woman. I\u2019m sure that if she wins they\u2019ll go after her as a \u2018socialist\u2019, go after her in every way, personally. She\u2019s much better for them.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump, on the other hand, would probably continue to fracture any sense of unity on the right, which is no good for Fox\u2019s narratives of right v wrong, secular liberals v decent Americans.

Hannity will obviously give it a shot, Fox and Friends will try as hard as they can. But when you have him attacking the parents of war heroes, Fox is not gonna defend that for that long.\u201d<br></p> <p>Politics aside, Fox has a more concrete problem. The generational scare is real: the 25-54 demographic is only 17% of its audience and younger conservatives are generally <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/01/5-facts-about-abortion/\">far less interested</a> in enlisting to fight against the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d.

If they want to attract a younger audience and eyeballs on digital, they need to recruit some new talent who knows how to do that.\u201d<br></p> <p>An ex-producer agrees: \u201cOne of the more puzzling things about Fox News is that they actually do have some legitimately talented field reporters \u2013 people who could conceivably get a scoop, break it on Twitter, and post an article that goes viral. But they don\u2019t really do that ever.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cCNN has become the model for this, and part of me thinks Roger long wanted to resist copying them lest he admit they did something better,\u201d the onetime employee said.<br></p> <p>Perhaps now with Ailes gone, and President Hillary Clinton possibly on the way, Fox can get started on catching up.<br></p> <p>Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.<br></p>",

That doesn\u2019t make any sense. And I don\u2019t think anybody would take that seriously.</p> <p>The president added: \u201cThis will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a schoolyard or a sandbox. And sometimes folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated.

So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election. </p> <p>\u201cIf Mr Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>During the rally in Altoona, Trump also claimed that the National Security Agency has Clinton\u2019s missing emails and called on the agency to release them publicly.

  "<p>It seems increasingly obvious to me that the only sensible way to look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US election</a> is through the prism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks And Recreation</a>. This American sitcom, which sadly came to the end of its six-year run last year, starred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler\">Amy Poehler</a> as local government official Leslie Knope, and once you start seeing the parallels between the lovely fictional show and the horrible reality shitshow, it makes the latter feel more bearable. Obviously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> is Leslie, the blond politico, ambitious to her bones, who, whatever you think of her politics, is undeniably devoted to public service. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is an amalgam of Leslie\u2019s two worst male rivals: first, <a href=\"http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Bobby_Newport\">Bobby Newport</a>, the spoilt manboy as rich in money as he is poor in self-awareness; second, the proudly offensive Jeremy Jamm, with a fondness for saying things like, \u201cI love Chinese crap. Lucy Liu, Gangnam Style, sushi, etcetera etcetera.\u201d That could so easily be a Trump quote, given that he semi-apologised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">referring to Mexicans as drug dealers and rapists</a> by tweeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">a photo of himself eating a taco bowl</a>, that I honestly had to check he hadn\u2019t said it in a CNN interview.</p> <p>It also seems increasingly obvious to me that the Clinton campaign needs to start screening Parks And Recreation at their events to solve what&#xa0;the media calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/jun/08/hillary-clinton-wardrobe-matters-but-not-fashion-perspective\">Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability problem\u201d</a>. This doesn\u2019t refer to whether the electorate likes Clinton\u2019s policies, but how they imagine her to be as a person. For the past three decades the answer to that has been, by and large, no, they don\u2019t like her, with people hating her in the 1990s for being (if I remember correctly) an overly moralistic feminist who spat in housewives\u2019 cookie dough, and people hating her now because they think she\u2019s not moral enough, and that she will say anything to get elected. Clinton has generally seemed not to care about her personal unpopularity, which only made me like her more. But now she is running for the presidency against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">a tiny-handed Voldemort</a> and so she is gritting her teeth and dealing with the issue. Last week she was asked, for the 10 billionth time, about her \u201clikability issues\u201d. Clinton replied that people like her once she\u2019s allowed to get on with the job, which is true, given her popularity when she was secretary of state and New York senator. It was a more dignified statement than the one she gave at the Democratic national convention last month: \u201cThrough all my years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part,\u201d she said, as though she were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/14/fiction-charlesdickens\">Boo Radley</a>, who could help people only under the cover of night and then scurry into the shadows, so as not to offend anyone with her antisocial weirdness.</p> <p>Yes, male politicians have to pass the \u201cWould you have a beer with me?\u201d test. But given that Clinton has been a successful politician for 15 years, the issue of her likability is clearly about more than mere appeal. The real problem is that, while she needs to be ambitious to get as far as she has, ambitious women are seen, still, as inherently unlikable. She\u2019s supposed to pretend that she doesn\u2019t actually want to be commander in chief, in the way female celebrities are supposed to pretend they don\u2019t have to starve themselves to be thin. Such things are passively attained without any unfeminine effort. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/hillary-clinton-tracy-flick-and-the-reclaiming-of-ambition/486389/\">As Megan Garber recently wrote</a>, the female presidents now seen in US TV shows (Selina Meyer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>, <a href=\"http://scandal.wikia.com/wiki/Sally_Langston\">Sally Langston in Scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/29/usnews.broadcasting\">Mackenzie Allen in Commander In Chief</a>) attain their powerful positions by fluke, not conscious ambition. In fact, when Veep\u2019s Selina Meyer had to campaign for the presidency in the last season, she became absurd and duly lost the election. Women who strive for political power are evil, summed up by the character of Tracy Flick in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/24/4\">the 1999 film Election</a>, still cited as the embodiment of monstrous female ambition, even though Tracy never does much wrong besides tear down some banners in frustration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2016/jul/23/theresa-may-margaret-thatcher-spot-the-difference-uk-politics-hadley-freeman\">Theresa May, Margaret Thatcher: spot the difference \u2013 and the sexism | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one glorious exception to this rule is Leslie Knope, a woman who fights like hell for political promotion, and is applauded for it. There is no contradiction between her political drive and her&#xa0;personal appeal. Through the plotlines involving Knope, Newport and Jamm, the show\u2019s point is that likability is nothing compared with capability. While sitcoms with cynical male characters are the cutting edge of current cool (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\">Louie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/21/bojack-horseman-season-three-netflix\">BoJack Horseman</a>), I\u2019m hoping that Parks And Rec will be the one that foresaw the zeitgeist. Because given the number of female politicians currently in high positions, its depiction of political women should not be an outlier, but the harbinger of a sea change.</p>",
  "<p>The hacker Guccifer 2.0 posted phone numbers, email addresses and passwords for nearly 200 sitting and former Democratic lawmakers on Friday, including current members of intelligence and armed services committees.</p> <p>The files were posted to a blog used by the hacker, which at least one cybersecurity firm has labeled<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/26/dnc-email-leak-russian-hack-guccifer-2\"> an operation of Russian security services</a>. Intelligence officials, other firms and Democrats have also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html\">accused operatives</a> supported by the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee this year.</p> <p>The files include contact information for 193 current and former members of Congress, including House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, and dozens of details for members of their staffs. The hacker also posted mundane campaign documents with summaries of various candidates supported and opposed by the party. </p> <p>The documents came from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-hack\"> a hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a>, the hacker said, including a claim that they showed how \u201cthe US presidential elections are becoming a farce, a big political performance where the voters are far from playing the leading role\u201d.</p> <p>Spokespeople for the Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hacker-reveals-personal-information-for-almost-200-democrats-1471048195\">verified</a> the contact information for Representative Steny Hoyer, whom it called on his cellphone. \u201cThis is sensitive information and it could be used in a very detrimental way by a foreign government,\u201d Hoyer told the paper.</p> <p>He suggested \u201coffensive measures\u201d in response to the hack, echoing a letter by Representative Adam Schiff and Senator Dianne Feinstein last month. \u201cIf Russia made the material available,\u201d they wrote to the White House, \u201cthen the episode would represent an unprecedented attempt to meddle in American domestic politics \u2013 one that would demand a response by the United States.\u201d</p> <p>The publication of documents from the Democratic party is the second this year and another jarring new precedent in an election year, following the release of 20,000 emails by Wikileaks last month. </p> <p>Those emails <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/clinton-campaign-blames-russia-wikileaks-sanders-dnc-emails\">suggested bias </a>by some members of the Democratic party against Senator Bernie Sanders and in support of Hillary Clinton, and their release led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders\">the resignation of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s chairwoman</a>, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p>"
