  "<p>Donald Trump attempted to combat widespread criticism of his sketchy economic policies by setting out what he presented as a new vision for the country that he audaciously claimed would create 25m new jobs in a decade and put the American worker first.<br></p> <p>Addressing one of the country\u2019s most august economic debating societies, the Economic Club of New York, the Republican presidential nominee sought to dispel the criticism that has dogged his campaign that his mathematics do not add up in balancing tax cuts and new spending. Sticking closely to a pre-prepared script \u2013 despite an initial malfunctioning of his teleprompter - he delivered a speech that was billed in advance by his senior advisers as the culmination of his thinking on how to get America back to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">Donald Trump to Dr Oz: I feel 'as good today as I did at 30'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmerican cars will travel the roads,\u201d he said, \u201cAmerican planes will soar the skies, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, American hands will rebuild this nation, and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the unapologetically populist tone, Trump tried to puncture criticisms that his plan lacked substance by putting figures to his ambitions. He projected 25m new jobs would be created broadly within the timeframe of a two-term Trump presidency, as a result of an average annual growth rate that would rise from current projections of about 2% to 3.5% through his tax-cutting and trade policies.</p> <p>The audaciousness of that boast is underlined by comparison with previous presidents. It would bring American job creation levels back to the golden days enjoyed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s when the dotcom boom and an expanding global economy saw 21m jobs created under his watch.</p> <p>By contrast, Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in the White House have seen almost 10m jobs created within a sluggish recovery from the 2008 collapse.</p> <p>Even more audaciously, Trump said he could achieve such a boon to employment while keeping the national budget deficit neutral. \u201cIf we achieve 4% growth it will reduce the deficit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Buoyed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">new polls</a> showing him in effect tied nationally with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the real estate billionaire said he could pull off such a turnaround in the US economy through a combination of traditional conservative tax cutting and by tearing up trade deals and bringing jobs back to America from Mexico and China. His words were given added poignancy, though he did not make overt reference to the fact, by the setting of his speech in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue, a legendary hotel bought by a Chinese insurance company in 2014.</p> <p>On taxes, Trump proposed to simplify the tax code into three brackets down from seven, and to take poor earners out of tax altogether with individuals with an income under $25,000 (\u00a319,000) and married couples under $50,000 paying no tax. </p> <p>However, with his tax cuts applying to all earners, no matter how wealthy, they would have a regressive effect. The Tax Policy Center has calculated the richest 0.1% would on average see tax cuts under his plan of $1.3m in 2017 compared with just $5,100 for everybody else.</p> <p>Trump tried to counter that criticism that he was putting forward policies that would benefit the 1% by modelling how average families would fare under his vision. A married couple earning $5m a year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses would only get a 3% reduction in their tax bill, he said, compared with a 35% reduction for a similar couple earning $50,000 and with $8,000 in child care.</p> <p>\u201cPeople earning $5m will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all,\u201d he said. </p> <p>But in other parts of his address, he underlined reforms that would be to the advantage of wealthy Americans, including his proposed abolition of the estate tax that is only paid on inheritances valued at over $5m. He also repeated his promise to slash the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, earning a robust cheer from the many corporate leaders eating lunch on the ballroom floor in front of him.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been widely criticized by analysts. This week the global firm <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-economy-idUSKCN11J25M\">Oxford Economics</a> predicted that the US economy could shrink by $1tn by the end of a single term Trump presidency as a result of his proposed tax cuts, barriers to trade and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>That would be the equivalent of 5% of US GDP, with knock-on effects for growth around the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/trump-clinton-health-medical-records-ohio-rally\">Donald Trump questions Clinton\u2019s health at rally in Ohio: \u2018You think this is easy?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the specific sticking points with the Trump plan highlighted by experts has been how the sums add up. On the one hand, he wants to see massive tax cuts, greater he said than any time since President Reagan; but on the other he also wants to pump more money into the US military and to preserve spending on social security and medicare. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">Independent analysis</a> has calculated that his tax cuts would bring down federal revenues by almost $10tn (trillion) over a decade, leaving even less fat in the system to cover his other ambitions.</p> <p>The point was raised in a question to Trump after his speech from Martin Feldstein, an economics professor from Harvard, who asked the Republican nominee what assets he would deploy to offset the sharp reduction in federal revenue from tax cuts. The candidate replied that he believed \u201ceventually, over time it will work out. The big thing over neutrality is the amount of business we will generate, and how we will stop companies take jobs out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the new figures that he peppered through his talk, the policy he outlined remained posited on faith that his strong leadership would bring about levels of growth and job creation that have eluded recent incumbents of the Oval Office. \u201cThis is what our new future will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to lower your taxes, I\u2019m going to get rid of regulation, I\u2019m going to unleash American energy.

He\u2019s played by Woody Harrelson, an odd choice for anyone who\u2019s ever seen a picture of Johnson, but with heavy prosthetics, distracting at first and also strangely useless given that he ends up looking more like Nixon. </p> <p>The film focuses on Johnson\u2019s rivalry with John F Kennedy as the pair go up against each other as the democratic candidate and once Johnson loses, we see him deal with life as an over-experienced vice-president and, after tragedy strikes, president. Overwhelmed with responsibility and disrespected by Kennedy\u2019s aides, he finds himself stuck in a difficult situation.</p> <p>From the first notes of worthy presidential music, it\u2019s clear that LBJ is not going to worry itself with reinventing the political biopic. Reiner\u2019s take on the Kennedy years of Johnson\u2019s life is strictly conventional, even down to the oft-used marching drums in the background, but it\u2019s solidly entertaining nonetheless, its adherence to formula never dulling its drama.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg3k23ixGqQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dg3k23ixGqQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The dialogue might often resort to painfully clunky exposition but it never resorts to a simplistic portrayal of Johnson and his politics. As an older southern democrat, he\u2019s torn between his heritage and Kennedy\u2019s progressive views and, in particular, his strong belief in the importance of civil rights. He\u2019s painted as a man playing both sides but also learning, his pragmatism and values ultimately ushering him towards equality. It\u2019s refreshing in a rigid, and often cliched, film as this to see such a flawed protagonist.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a pleasing focus on political minutiae, detailed enough but accessibly conveyed and the film weaves in the growing issue of aesthetics (Johnson is deeply aware of his position as workhorse compared to JFK\u2019s showhorse) at a time when media representation was starting to have a profound effect on voters. There\u2019s also a nicely played scene where Johnson discusses the importance of civil rights with a bigioted southern senator (a believably foul Richard Jenkins) as his black maid serves them dinner.</p> <p>Harrelson overcomes the heavy layer of prosthetics to deliver a commanding and layered take on the president. He easily flips from confidence (bragging about the size of his penis to a busy room) to embarrassment (a Dallas crowd eager for JFK has no interest in him) and it\u2019s a pleasure to see him play something other than wisecracking support. Yet Jennifer Jason Leigh has precious little to do in the thankless role of his wife and, at a tight 98 minutes, the film feels somewhat short on their relationship.</p> <p>It\u2019s a well-worn road but Reiner steers with skill, delivering his best film since 1995\u2019s The American President, hinting that he might have more political tales in him yet. It might not go all the way but it\u2019s a biopic that\u2019s just about worth your vote.</p>",

  "<p>Many years ago, the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-cumming\">Alan Cumming</a> happened to attend a birthday party at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/carrie-fisher-in-telluride-im-just-getting-bigger-and-older-thats-not-good\">Carrie Fisher</a>\u2019s house. He arrived early. He was so early, in fact, that he was the first guest to arrive. The second was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\">Elizabeth Taylor</a>. </p> <p>Rather than drum up small talk with one of the great Hollywood stars of the 20th century, Cumming told a crowd at the New York Public Library on Wednesday night, he chose to slip into another room and get a drink at the bar. Fisher, he said, then approached him and hissed, in a sort of stage whisper: \u201cWhat are you doing? Do you know how many homosexuals would like to be in your position?\u201d Cumming returned to the living room and promptly he and \u201cLiz\u201d fell into an enjoyable conversation.</p> <p>This is the sort of anecdote Cumming tells in his new book, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093006-you-gotta-get-bigger-dreams\">You Gotta Get Bigger Dreams: My Life in Stories and Pictures</a>, out this week in the US from Rizzoli. \u201cI wanted to give people literal and figurative snapshots,\u201d Cumming told the NYPL\u2019s<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holdengraber?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"> Paul Holdengraber</a> last night at the first event of the library\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/events/live-nypl\">Live at the NYPL</a> series. Probably the most touching of these is a shot of himself with his grandmother. On the day the photograph was taken, Cumming said, his grandmother defended him from relatives who wanted to tease him about his newly bleached blond hair. \u201cIf I was young,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d be a freak like Alan too.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhNUIdzhnm4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PL9931C4D7C227ADAA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>On the stage last night Cumming was not much like the characters he plays. He was restrained, spoke slowly and carefully and sometimes even sadly. He was wearing a T-shirt that earnestly proclaimed him a \u201cLibrary All Star\u201d and implored, \u201cGet in the game, read!\u201d And at least at one point, he was visibly annoyed with Holdengraber\u2019s questions. This was when Holdengraber tried to draw a parallel between Cumming\u2019s troubled relationship to his father, and his troubled relationship with the writer and critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/14/gore-vidal-gripped-a-nation\">Gore Vidal</a>.</p> <p>Vidal befriended Cumming in the early 2000s, he told the audience, and he ended up having \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the relationship. He was flattered, at first, that Vidal liked him, but the more he got to know the famously caustic critic the more he was \u201csaddened\u201d by Vidal\u2019s lack of joy. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was a very nice person,\u201d he told Holdengraber. He recalled a visit with Vidal and Vidal\u2019s partner, Howard Austen. The pair had been together for 50 years. But Cumming said he was shocked to hear Vidal say in front of Austen, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never loved, of course.\u201d This seemed a cruel thing to say.</p> <p>Still, Vidal had obviously profoundly affected Cumming. He said he had wanted to title his book, I Wrote This Book Because Gore Vidal Told Me To, but his publishers hadn\u2019t let him. (That title was instead used for the one chapter in the book where he discusses the relationship.)</p> <p>Another of Cumming\u2019s disagreements with Vidal, he said, was over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/16/monica-lewinsky-shame-sticks-like-tar-jon-ronson\">Monica Lewinsky affair</a>. Vidal was unsympathetic to Lewinsky and particularly defended Bill Clinton\u2019s famous statement that he \u201cdid not have sex with that woman\u201d. Cumming is a good friend of Lewinsky\u2019s and grew very serious talking about it. </p> <p>\u201cThe way that, you know, the most powerful man in the world and this 23-year-old girl who was in love with him, this thing happened, this unfortunate thing happened, yet she was the one, the weak one \u2026\u201d he said, reaching for the words to describe his feelings. \u201cHe was the one who abused his power, and she was the one who was chastised, and denigrated, and whose life was made a misery.\u201d</p> <p>Cumming also had opinions to share about Donald Trump. \u201cIf Donald Trump is the president of this country, we are fucked, ladies and gentlemen, seriously,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In the book he writes about the way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/cabaret\">Cabaret</a>, the musical whose 1993 London revival was Cumming\u2019s big breakout role, gradually immerses the reader in the prospect of Nazism. Holdengraber called this passage \u201cprescient\u201d as to the present trend of politics. Cumming blanched at the thought. \u201cSix, seven, eight months ago, it was funny, now it\u2019s not funny at all,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that he has been a candidate of a major party,\u201d Cumming continued, \u201cit\u2019s a triumph of the lack of value this country puts on education. We have allowed a generation of people to be uneducated, to not be able to analyze, to not care about what is happening in the world, to also be in a place where if they are told the same thing again and again and again, propaganda basically, they believe it to be true.\u201d He cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/north-poor-brexit-myths\">Brexit </a>as another example of the same phenomenon. </p> <p>\u201cThe demographics of this country have changed so radically in the last generation, and I\u2019m hoping that rich, white, entitled men like Donald Trump, their days of being able to say contentious, racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic things, are over,\u201d Cumming said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not certain. And that fills me with such horror.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There are very few victims of Russian hackers who emerge with their reputations enhanced. Colin Powell may be unique for that alone, judging from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/14/hacked-colin-powell-emails-jolt-presidential-race\">bluntness of his leaked emails</a> about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>To be clear: hacking personal emails is reprehensible, and those behind the hack are scumbags who are trying to manipulate American voters.</p> <p>To be doubly clear: the news media (including this column) have no principles and no shame in exploiting the ill-gotten product of those scumbags. Guilty, as charged.<br></p> <p>And yet the Powell emails are so insightful and direct, it seems a shame \u2013 even if we have no sense of shame to let them pass by without comment.<br></p> <p>First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/colin-powell-emails-trump-disgrace-but-no-clinton-vote\">the emails</a> are as scathing as they are fresh from his outbox. One, dating from June, describes Donald Trump as \u201ca national disgrace\u201d and \u201can international pariah\u201d. Powell said Democrats had no need to attack Trump because he was \u201cin the process of destroying himself\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Another, from just last month, describes Trump\u2019s pursuit of Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate as racist. \u201cYup, the whole birther movement was racist,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn\u2019t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim\u2026 As I have said before, \u2018What if he was?\u2019 Muslims are born as Americans everyday.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>You might say he considered Trump and his supporters deplorable.</p> <p>As Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/colin-powell-calls-trump-national-disgrace-in-personal-email?utm_term=.pjyzxWePJ#.esPQg45BK\">reports</a>, the emails were obtained by <a href=\"http://dcleaks.com/\">DCLeaks.com</a>, a site with reported links to Russian intelligence. If such reports are true, the Russians may have finally misread the impact of their leaks. Far from making Powell look foolish, the emails only savage the candidate who so admires Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Powell was astonished, for instance, that Trump would hire Roger Ailes, the disgraced former head of Fox News, who now sits in a cesspool of sexual harassment claims. \u201cAiles as an advisor won\u2019t heal women, don\u2019t you think,\u201d wrote Powell.</p> <p>Powell was already a national treasure. Not just as a former general, national security adviser, chairman of the joint chiefs and secretary of state. But as the best qualified and most charismatic man never to have run for president.</p> <p>There was a good reason why Bill Clinton\u2019s team was so worried Powell might run for election as the Republican nominee in 1996: because he could have won, and reshaped the political landscape for a generation.</p> <p>Instead he served another president who spent his first term siding with Powell\u2019s haters. Like Tony Blair, Powell was na\u00efve to think he could talk sense into George W Bush, or outflank his arch enemies, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.</p> <p>They set him up as the fall guy for their half-baked case for war, cashing in on his credibility. They filled the first draft of his UN speech with bogus reports linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11, leaving Powell\u2019s team no time and no room to weed out all their fabrications. Still he later called the speech a painful and devastating moment: a permanent blot on his record, as he put it.</p> <p>That directness is what shines through the emails, along with a sharp sense of political and media analysis.</p> <p>Quite rightly, Powell is uncomfortable about condemning every Trump eruption because the response merely adds fuel to the fire. \u201cYou guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,\u201d he wrote to one would-be interviewer. \u201cI will watch and pick the timing, not respond to the latest outrage.\u201d</p> <p>He put it more succinctly in another email: \u201cTo go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him.\u201d</p> <p>Powell is also blunt about Hillary Clinton\u2019s failings, especially the effort to excuse her use of a private email server by pointing to his email use in the state department.</p> <p>\u201cHRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,\u201d he wrote late last month. \u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini-tantrum at a Hamptons party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these \u2018character\u2019 minefields.\u201d</p> <p>There is surely the opening of a whole book chapter in that Hamptons party. Obama likes to say that the smallness of our politics doesn\u2019t match the magnitude of our challenges. You don\u2019t get much smaller than a mini-tantrum about an email server.</p> <p>\u201cI would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect,\u201d Powell <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/colin-powell-emails-hack-donald-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">wrote</a> in another email, that described her \u201cunbridled ambition\u201d and her husband\u2019s unbridled libido.</p> <p>Naturally, Trump has shown none of Powell\u2019s self-control or strategic thinking in responding to the hacked emails.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/776269061823074304\">tweeted</a> on Thursday morning. \u201cWe can do much better!\u201d</p> <p>This from a real estate developer who supported the invasion of Iraq and has repeatedly lied about it throughout the course of the campaign. But as Powell says, calling him an idiot just emboldens him. So we will just have to settle with deplorable.</p> <p>Powell likes to tell the story of a post-Soviet meeting of security officials in Europe. There he was confronted by an old Russian general who chastised him for wanting to keep Nato alive when the Warsaw Pact had died. Powell grinned as he recounted his reply: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to close a club that people still want to join. I can\u2019t help it if my club is more popular than yours.\u201d</p> <p>Powell\u2019s personal club remains more popular than anybody else\u2019s. Not least because he never ran for president, never suffering the kind of reputational damage that is strewn across that battlefield.</p> <p>As the Russian hackers have unwittingly revealed, Powell remains a sharp observer of presidential politics, no matter whose club you belong to.</p>",

But what about the rest of us? | Carmel Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ivanka in particular has all her father\u2019s \u201cpros\u201d and almost none of his incredibly off-putting cons. She has balanced motherhood with owning her own company. She has been successful in practically every area of business, including <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/07/ivanka-trump-book-working-women/\">her work</a> as an author, all while keeping a certain amount of traditional femininity that Republicans still praise. She came into the political spotlight as an outsider but has proven she has plenty of acumen on the campaign trail, at the same level or even beyond that of her father. She has access to the Trump family\u2019s self-funding resources. She would even have Donald Trump himself at her disposal as a fiercely loyal supporter unafraid to speak his mind on camera.</p> <p>In addition to bringing a sharp sense of business management and outside perspective, Ivanka doesn\u2019t carry the same downsides as Donald. She has managed to stay above her father\u2019s controversial statements about birth certificates, immigration and war heroes. She doesn\u2019t have a combative relationship with the press or drive away young and Hispanic voters. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Ivanka has remained poised, well-spoken and relatable.</p> <p>Bonus: Ivanka Trump cancels out Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cwoman\u201d card.</p> <p>There are many incredible Republican women, both elected and in leadership, but the GOP has yet to secure a serious female presidential contender. This perpetuates the stereotype that the party consists of mostly old white men, especially since the presidential race gets more news coverage than any other campaign. While the stereotype doesn\u2019t hold true down-ballot, the past few Republican presidential candidates haven\u2019t helped the GOP image problem regardless of the broad choices at the start of the primary.</p> <p>The Trumps intimately understand the importance of image. Ivanka\u2019s image includes her own lovely features and her picture-perfect all-American family. If she ran on a Republican ticket, she\u2019d be hard to ignore.</p> <p>In addition to her non-political qualities, we have already seen the kind of policies Ivanka would want to focus on in a hypothetical run for office. Her convention speech touched on some controversial ideas among conservatives, such as the role of the government in paid maternity leave and childcare (she was instrumental in crafting her father\u2019s policy in that area). </p> <p>How the federal government should approach these issues is still up for debate among both parties, but Ivanka\u2019s raising the issue shows how in touch she is with the real-world problems facing Americans. Ivanka showed both an awareness of these challenges and a certain sensitivity that her father lacks. Her openness about her own family, including adorable pictures of her new baby, probably doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p> <p>She also focused on the importance of equal opportunity for all. Both Trumps have hired and promoted women for leadership positions, but Ivanka doesn\u2019t have any on-the-record sexist comments to accompany hers. In fact, when she <a href=\"http://time.com/4417579/republican-convention-ivanka-trump-transcript/\">talked</a> about her father hiring the best person for the for the job, it became quite clear that Donald\u2019s faith in his daughter was not misplaced. She offered a far more convincing profile of her father as a smart and caring businessman than anything Trump has said on his own.</p> <p>Many Trump supporters argue that their candidate is a real person, unlike the \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians in Washington. But the Trump brand \u2013 plastered across casinos, hotels and televisions shows \u2013 has made Donald larger than real life. </p> <p>Ivanka, on the other hand, posts Instagram photos without makeup, is frank about her motherhood and retains a down-to-earth persona effortlessly exuded during her meetings with voters. A strong woman who has managed to balance her family and success seems like a no-brainer.</p> <p>Even though Ivanka turns 35 next month, making her eligible for the office of commander-in-chief, she sadly won\u2019t be on the ballot in place of her dad. But since family dynasties have been in political fashion for the past 15 years in the US, she might consider what she could bring to the GOP in future races.</p>",

The current system meant \u201cpoverty pay, zero-hours contracts and lives ruined by a shortage of affordable homes\u201d. Corbyn said that people could no longer rely on free trade and free markets alone to deliver prosperity.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our heavily-indebted societies are more vulnerable to financial shocks than they were.</p> <p>All of this presents a deep challenge to the social democratic and socialist tradition that Labour, New or Old, has always been a part of.<br></p> <p>It punctures the old belief that it was possible simply to redistribute the proceeds a growing economy to pay for public services.</p> <p>It can no longer credibly be argued, for the majority of people, that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn said that governments all over the world were becoming more interventionist and he said it was \u201cunpardonable folly\u201d for the Tories to press ahead with cuts. Giving several examples of how this might happen, he said Labour would focus on investment. This would involve a new approach to enforcing free market rules, he went on, singling out EU state aid rules as a particular issue.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any deal with the EU must recognise that the old state aid rules are no longer valid.</p> <p>When governments across the world are intervening, it makes no sense to tie a government\u2019s hands here.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, in response to a question, Corbyn said that he was not saying Britain should reject a trade deal with the EU after Brexit if it involved accepting state aid rules; he just wanted Britain to be able to adopt a flexible approach to state aid, as Germany, France and Italy seem to be allowed to do, he said.

That release came from the campaign. It didn\u2019t come from Jeremy. And we\u2019ve apologised. It was just inappropriate. One of our researchers saw a bit of incoming flak and then did a list of all the statements that have been made by other MPs, some of which were not particularly kind, let\u2019s put it that way.

He says almost the whole PLP (parliamentary Labour party) backed Corbyn\u2019s stance in PMQs yesterday on grammar schools.

I won a seat back for Labour last year after 30 years. I should be out this morning with the CWU in my constituency campaigning to keep a post office.

He claimed that a third of members have yet to vote.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The release of this list, and the victim culture it is trying to perpetuate, is an example of how nervous [Corbyn] is, and his team are, about the result. I think a third of members are yet to even vote in this. And Jeremy and his team know they have put a lot of people off through their incompetence over the last year who do not want to vote for them again this time around.</p> <p>For those members who have not voted yet, this is another demonstration of the kind of lack of leadership, the kind of division, that Jeremy and John McDonnell want to perpetuate if they win again. And look at the permissive culture they have created of abuse against Labour MPs, and especially women MPs.</p> <p>Jess Phillips has had months and months of abuse, a torrent of abuse, from Corbynistas and the like. And she has been put on this list again. That is a dereliction of duty. That is not leadership. That is Jeremy telling his trolls online to carry on. He is giving them a green light to continue their abuse. If Labour members don\u2019t want that abuse to continue, they really need to choose Owen [Smith] while they\u2019ve still got a chance in this leadership election.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would be talking to a lawyer about possible legal action.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve already asked for an explanation from Jeremy, I\u2019ve already been in touch with the chief whip\u2019s office, I have already been in touch with the party chair and the general secretary of the party. I do want an answer and I will be speaking to a lawyer tomorrow.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for a written apology from Corbyn. That would help resolve the matter, he said.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly rejected the claim that he had been abusive towards Corbyn</strong>.

China is a minority investor in Hinkley Point, but it is investing as part of a deal that will also see it play a minority role in building a new nuclear power station at Sizewell, in Suffolk, and that will also see it take the lead in building a new nuclear plant at Bradwell, in Essex. For the Chinese Bradwell is the real prize because they believe that establishing successful Chinese-designed nuclear power station in the UK will lead to them breaking into many other markets in the West.</p> <p>May was concerned about giving control of a nuclear power station to a potentially hostile foreign power.

  "<p>It is mid-afternoon and the Venice Lido is a ghost town baking in the sun. The film festival wound down the previous evening, and now the thoroughfare between the beach and the cinemas is deserted except for construction workers in threes and fours dismantling the decorations. The glitz has faded. The stars are gone.</p> <p>Well, most of them. Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are the last men standing in this tumbleweed town. In the street, their faces loom menacingly out of the posters for the remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington-chris-pratt-antoine-fuqua-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">The Magnificent Seven</a>, in which an ethnically diverse cast of outlaws and miscreants defend oppressed townsfolk from a brutal tyrant. Seated at a table in a hotel room, the actors appear somewhat less than magnificent. Washington is slumped in his seat. He is 61, heavy-set, tired-looking. He may be dressed in a baggy, grey T-shirt and jogging bottoms but his magnetism is undimmed. When he peers straight at you, there\u2019s a crackle of electricity in the air. Those aren\u2019t ordinary eyes: they\u2019re the eyes of all the indomitable men he\u2019s played, from Steve Biko to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/malcolm-x-spike-lee-biopic-black-cinema-selma-the-butler\">Malcolm X</a>, the boxer Ruben Carter in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/the-hurricane-rubin-carter-denzel-washington\">The Hurricane</a> to the drug lord Frank Lucas in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/16/russellcrowe.denzelwashington\">American Gangster</a>. He sweats gravitas.</p> <p>His 37-year-old co-star \u2013 who is wearing jeans and a thin suede jacket, and sporting a sketchy beard \u2013 carries his fame more lightly. Pratt made his name as a deliriously dopey member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks and Recreation</a> ensemble. Superstardom only descended, though, once his loosey-goosey charms were transposed to a blockbuster setting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world\">Jurassic World</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apo12sMt-rY\">second Guardians movie</a> is due next May.</p> <p>For now, it\u2019s all about The Magnificent Seven. Except neither Washington nor Pratt seems especially keen to go on the record about any resonance the film might have in the wider world. With a cast list that offers a rebuke to conventional Hollywood casting (there\u2019s even a woman among the seven heroes) and a conflict that pits poor against rich, the movie is in the tradition of westerns that comment on our times, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjAHAmY-DU\">Soldier Blue</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/wild-bunch-peckinpah-action\">The Wild Bunch</a>. The film\u2019s director, Antoine Fuqua, who coaxed Washington toward an Oscar-winning performance as a corrupt cop in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/01/culture.peterbradshaw\">Training Day</a>, has said westerns \u201creflect where we are in the world\u201d.

Why make the film now? \u201cYou\u2019re putting too much on it, man!\u201d Washington hoots. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie. Antoine was excited about westerns. He grew up watching them with his grandma. He wanted to see me and Chris riding on horses. Next thing I know \u2026\u201d He mimes trotting along on horseback, invisible reins in his hands. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, like: \u2018How are we going to reflect society?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Point taken. As Washington <a href=\"http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/new-again-denzel-washington/\">pointed out in 1990</a>, \u201cGuys won\u2019t spend $15 on Friday night to take their girls to see [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/cry-freedom-richard-attenborough-reel-history\">Cry Freedom</a>, in which he played Steve Biko]. Making movies like that shows that we\u2019re committed to doing something about the issues, but people can see issues on the news for free.\u201d But doesn\u2019t The Magnificent Seven fall into the category of entertainment that carries a thoughtful, progressive message? \u201cThat\u2019s for the audience to decide. We\u2019ll see. No hidden baggage over here!\u201d He raises his arms, as though inviting me to frisk him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not deep enough for you. I\u2019m trying!

Pratt leans in. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a conversation that\u2019s happening around the world and the movie seems to have become part of that. But that wasn\u2019t our intention. I\u2019m not the most articulate guy. I wish I were. So I\u2019m not gonna be the one to express it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s two hours of kickass entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>I try another tack. The villain, played by Peter Sarsgaard, is a greedy industrialist whose only love is for land and power. Any current presidential candidates spring to mind?

You gonna pay to see the movie?\u201d I\u2019ve already seen it. \u201cAre you gonna pay? Answer the question.\u201d I tell him I would do had I not seen it. I start to explain that I paid to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/26/safe-house-review-denzel-washington\">Safe House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/28/unstoppable-denzel-washington-review\">Unstoppable</a> and many of his other films. But it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already laughing and braying (\u201cA-ha! See? Right?\u201d) and wagging his finger triumphantly.</p> <p>\u201cThe average person who\u2019s paying to see it is just looking for a good time. When I did Cry Freedom, a doctor friend told me: \u2018Denzel, I have life and death in my hands every single day. I go to the movies to escape.\u2019 What I got from that was that just because it\u2019s important to me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s important to the everyday person. We just try to give them enough to get the monkey off their back so they can feel like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Chris Pratt up there,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m Denzel.\u2019 It ain\u2019t that deep.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f5d085a555697ebe074e1f3a43325d2dadd27ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5d085a555697ebe074e1f3a43325d2dadd27ae/79_0_1675_1005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I point out that films can easily contain both action and ideas. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive. He has starred in plenty of examples \u2013 Malcolm X, Crimson Tide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/26/philipfrench1\">Inside Man</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/31/flight-review\">Flight</a>. \u201cSure,\u201d he concedes. The pressing issue now is why neither actor will offer even the most superficial interpretation of the new picture. Is there a danger that if they describe it as one thing \u2013 the \u201cdiversity western\u201d, say, or the \u201canti-Trump allegory\u201d \u2013 then it will become fixed as that forever? \u201cNo, there\u2019s a danger if <em>you</em> do,\u201d Washington tells me. \u201cHow many readers you got?\u201d I tell him what I can remember about circulation figures and online traffic. \u201cWhat an opportunity you have.\u201d He sits back in his seat in the manner of a statesman who has settled a complex debate decisively, rather than an actor who has avoided a question. He stares at me for a moment, then his face breaks into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just messing witchoo,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Once again, Pratt steps in with a placatory aside. \u201cIt\u2019s tough these days. I\u2019m expecting people to talk about this movie and form their own opinions. I want theirs to be as valuable as mine. I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m not in the business of trying to shape people\u2019s opinions. I\u2019m an entertainer. I know there\u2019s a giant industry now of talking about stuff and saying stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Washington lunges forward, palms downwards on the table. \u201cToday\u2019s subject: phones,\u201d he says in the mock-authoritative voice of a news anchor. \u201cAre phones safe for you? We have three experts on the left. And three experts on the right. We\u2019ll be right back after this.\u201d Pratt launches into an advertising jingle \u2013 \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Maybelline!\u201d \u2013 and the two men rock back and forth, laughing raucously. I laugh too, although I\u2019m confused. Pratt\u2019s objection, as far as I can make out, is that people are prone to discussion. He sets me straight: \u201cI find myself kind of withdrawing a bit. Look, no one pays me for my opinion. If I say something stupid and it becomes a headline, it\u2019s, like: \u2018Guess what Chris said!\u2019 Then everyone clicks on this stupid thing I said.\u201d He looks into his lap. \u201cThis is going really well,\u201d he says quietly.</p> <p>I ask if they\u2019ve both simply resolved to keep personal and political opinions private. \u201cWould you?\u201d Washington shoots back. I tell him that if he asked me a question, I\u2019d answer it straight. \u201cWho would you vote for if you could vote in the US election?\u201d Easy. Hillary Clinton. And him? \u201cThat\u2019s private.\u201d Pratt perks up: \u201cI\u2019m writing \u2018Denzel\u2019 on the ballot,\u201d he says. More laughter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jan/30/denzel-washington-robert-zemeckis-kelly-reilly-flight-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3de55\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1860548\"            data-video-name=\"Denzel Washington, Robert Zemeckis and Kelly Reilly on Flight: 'Superman really can't fly' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-403247498\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/1/30/130130Flight2-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/1/30/130130Flight2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/1/30/130130Flight2-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130130Flight2/130130Flight2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/1/30/130130Flight2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jan/30/denzel-washington-robert-zemeckis-kelly-reilly-flight-video\">Denzel Washington, Robert Zemeckis and Kelly Reilly on Flight: \u2018Superman really can\u2019t fly\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 1992, when Bill Clinton was elected, Washington <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/denzel-washington-puts-power-behind-oratory\">said</a> he felt \u201ca little hope\u201d. I ask how he feels now and for a moment he looks like a man sick to death of having things he said more than 20 years ago read back to him. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he admits finally. Then it\u2019s back to entertainment. \u201cWhatever I\u2019m thinking doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the people who go see the movie to have fun. I never saw any movie because I read an article about it.\u201d Ah. Now the unspoken question hanging in the air is: why are we doing this interview?</p> <p>Instead, I steer it back to him. As a young actor, Washington was a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-earl-jones\">James Earl Jones</a>. Wouldn\u2019t he have been interested in Jones\u2019s opinions? He swivels round in his chair to address Pratt: \u201cI saw James Earl Jones do Oedipus the King. He was magnificent. I went backstage and he let me try on his rings in the dressing room. They were huge! And he had this big, booming voice.\u201d He turns back to me. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was. Not: \u2018Mr Jones, what are your political opinions?\u2019 Who cares?\u201d So wouldn\u2019t he have been curious to read about what Jones thought? \u201cThat assumes I was reading.\u201d</p> <p>Pratt jumps in. \u201cThey didn\u2019t market that kind of thing,\u201d he says. On the contrary, I tell him, whenever I research actors from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, they are invariably more forthcoming in their interviews. They offer opinions. They risk controversy. They don\u2019t always play it safe. He asks me why that is and I suggest to him that information spreads so quickly now, and in so many different directions, that self-censorship and rigid PR management are the only ways to exert control. \u201cYou\u2019re in the fortunate position of being able to research and take your time,\u201d Washington tells me. \u201cBut, with clickbait, it doesn\u2019t even need to be true. It just has to be first. \u2018Oh, it was all lies? Who cares?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8900206e7f841ee2c5514558c9d070189fd1c0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8900206e7f841ee2c5514558c9d070189fd1c0f6/800_0_2261_1357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt at The Magnificent Seven premiere in Venice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt at The Magnificent Seven premiere in Venice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/denzel-washington-flight-movie-star\">last time the Guardian interviewed Washington</a>, the paper was upbraided by his publicists, who claimed that a quote about him not having made friends with his white counterparts in Hollywood had been taken out of context. The furore spread in an instant. Websites inveighed against this newspaper for printing falsehoods. Only after a few days did it transpire that Washington\u2019s representatives had made no such objection. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/feb/28/fake-denzel-washington-spokesman\">The complaint itself was a hoax</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington-chris-pratt-antoine-fuqua-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">The Magnificent Seven review: moderate remake opens 41st Toronto film festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such misunderstandings perhaps help to explain all the pussyfooting. Even so, Washington and Pratt have managed not to deliver a single tangible opinion \u2013 unless you count their views on the risks of giving opinions. It\u2019s a tonic, then, to speak to Fuqua, who tells me that, yes, his version of The Magnificent Seven is unequivocally a portrait of the modern world. \u201cEverything\u2019s a little chaotic. We\u2019re a bit divided. We\u2019re fighting enemies we can\u2019t see and who don\u2019t play by our rules. There is tyranny. But the best part is we have a choice. In the film, we have black, white, Asian, Mexican, Native American, a white woman, all coming together to fight injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Fuqua has no issue with the movie being seen as an emblem of diversity. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. We did something about it. And here\u2019s the beauty part: MGM and Sony backed it. No one said: \u2018A black man? A Native American?\u2019\u201d He is even happy for the villain to be regarded as a Trump surrogate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say not to. He represents that type. When I said tyranny, I meant raping the land, stealing people\u2019s money. I made the movie because I wanted to say that.\u201d I breathe an internal sigh of relief at his directness. That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? Nothing like getting blood out of stones or opinions out of A-list actors.</p> <p>\u2022 The Magnificent Seven opens in the UK on 23 September.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t half as important as you think you are.\u201d That was the implicit message for Britain in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/junckers-speech-was-all-about-concrete-ideas-to-heal-a-divided-eu\" title=\"\">state of the European Union address</a> by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. It was a welcome signal for European citizens and politicians exasperated by British indecision and outright incompetence post-referendum. But it was a message unlikely to even register with all those pundits and politicians in Britain still convinced that the EU needs the UK more than vice versa.</p> <p>Modelled on the rather more showily delivered American version, the state of the European Union speech marks the beginning of the political season in Brussels. With the Brexit vote less than three months ago, it naturally contained a number of allusions to British politics. Juncker stated that Europeans face \u201cthe unhappy prospect of a member leaving our ranks\u201d. This he \u201crespected\u201d and \u201cregretted\u201d, as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\" title=\"\">highlighted the rise in hate crimes</a> against Europeans in Britain since the Brexit vote. Since the penny does not seem to have dropped yet, Juncker reiterated that there is no way the UK can end up with a better deal post-Brexit than it enjoyed as a member.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53xen\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2717384\"            data-video-name=\"Juncker: Europe cannot accept violence against Polish workers \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d91795e4b067ad30087916\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914Juncker1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914Juncker1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872695&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\">Juncker: Europe cannot accept violence against Polish workers</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But these were a handful of remarks scattered around a 6,000-word speech that took a good 50 minutes to deliver. Juncker wanted to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">concerns that actually exercise Europeans</a>: refugees, terrorism, economic stagnation, a dysfunctional eurozone architecture and Russian expansionism. Add to that the real possibility of chaos in Turkey, of EU-phobe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/francois-hollande-would-be-swept-aside-in-presidential-election-poll-shows\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen winning the French presidential election</a> and of a Trump presidency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-nato-isolationist\" title=\"\">blowing up Nato</a> and it should be clear that Brexit is somewhere on page two or three of the EU priority list. In fact, the prospect of Brexit seems to have helped the EU at least in the short term, with a number of countries seeing an unexpected surge in support for the EU. In the words of prominent German member of the European parliament Manfred Weber: \u201cMany people are now in favour of the EU [after the Brexit vote]. In Germany we have not had these results since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile in the Netherlands, the country often held up by Brexiteers as the next to leave, all major parties say they want to reform rather than leave the EU. It is only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/dutch-far-right-leader-geert-wilders-goeson-trial-for-inciting-hatred\" title=\"\">Geert Wilders</a>\u2019 PVV party that actually wants an exit. He currently polls at just under 20%.</p> <p>Medical science uses the word \u201ccrisis\u201d for the point where a patient either irrevocably collapses or turns the corner towards recovery. On the basis of Juncker\u2019s speech, this is the stage where the commission now feels the EU and the eurozone find itself. Following the speech, Vivien Pertusot from the French Institute for International Relations called them the polycrises: urgent and potentially devastating crises occurring simultaneously and often amplifying or feeding on one another while driving member states apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/restricted-travel-british-people-nigerian-visa-passports\">Welcome to the world of restricted travel, British people | Chibundu Onuzo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNever before have I seen so little common ground between our member states,\u201d said Juncker, himself an EU veteran like few others. The EU is in greater danger than ever before, he continued, with greater levels of selfishness, nationalism and parochialism.</p> <p>Yet Juncker also slipped in good news of the sort that somehow rarely reaches the mainstream British press. There had been one million jobs created in Spain over the past three years, and seven million more elsewhere. Public deficits are, on average, now below 2% across the eurozone, down from a terrifying 6.3% in 2009. Juncker might have added the eurozone\u2019s healthy current account surplus, meaning it continues to export more than it imports. This is a stark contrast to the US and Britain, two nations that are becoming ever more indebted because they buy more from foreign countries than they sell.</p> <p>Easily the most refreshing element in the speech, at least for those who have had to endure the Brexit \u201cdebate\u201d, was Juncker\u2019s emphasis on realism. Where Brexiteers continue to indulge in narcissistic fantasies about getting the best of all worlds from the EU while making Britain a world power again, Juncker struck a very different tone. Insisting that \u201csolidarity is the glue that holds the union together\u201d he pointed out that Europeans today make up 8% of the world population. In 2050 that will be down to 5%. \u201cBy then you would not see a single EU country among the top world economies,\u201d Juncker went on. \u201cBut the EU together? We would still be topping the charts.\u201d</p> <p>To which he might have added: \u201cAnd that is true with or without Britain.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain and the EU are unlikely to get started in earnest on the \u201cpolitical amputation\u201d of Brexit until the end of next year, after federal elections in Germany, Herman Van Rompuy, a former president of the European council has said.</p> <p>Van Rompuy told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that, while initial negotiations on the broad outline of a deal could begin as soon as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court\">British government triggered article 50</a>, the more difficult negotiation phase would have to wait until late 2017.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the German elections and before there is a new German government no serious negotiations will take place,\u201d said Van Rompuy, who was Belgium\u2019s prime minister from 2008-09. \u201cYou can always start with more technical matters, but the hardcore, the difficult topics, will be tackled after the constitution of the new German government. That will be October-November.\u201d</p> <p>France is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/hollande-sets-out-stall-for-french-elections-with-attack-on-identity-politics\">vote for a new president</a> in April 2017, while the German elections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">are expected to take place</a> in September the same year. In Germany\u2019s case, the process for forming a coalition government could add another few months to the timetable. In 2013, the German government was not sworn in for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/germany-grand-coalition-angela-merkel\">three months after the election</a>.</p> <p>Van Rompuy, who described the Brexit vote as a \u201cpolitical amputation of the first degree,\u201d said the UK had \u201cnot many friends\u201d among the other 27 member states and the negotiation would be difficult. </p> <p>\u201cThere is not a feeling that we have to punish, but, on the other hand, most leaders don\u2019t want to encourage other exits,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain has not many friends any more. I saw this clearly when I was in office, when we had to vote on candidacy of Jean-Claude Juncker for the presidency of the [European] commission. Britain was isolated.\u201d<br></p> <p>Maintaining free movement of labour would remain a \u201cred line\u201d if Britain wanted to remain part of the single market, Van Rompuy said. \u201cOf course, we want an agreement that represents some sort of mutual benefit. There are huge economic interests, but there are also red lines. It is very well known that freedom of movement is one of those red lines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very difficult for the EU to do something else vis-a-vis Britain, compared to what we agreed upon with Norway and Switzerland.\u201d</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, officials in Brussels and leading politicians across Europe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/eu-emergency-talks-brexit-berlin\">called on the British government</a> to avoid turning the formal process of leaving the union into a waiting game.</p> <p>But since Theresa May replaced David Cameron as prime minister and internal rifts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">over the UK\u2019s negotiating positions</a> within her cabinet have become apparent, the deadline has continued to slip and politicians on the continent have begrudgingly accepted that they will have to wait for Britain to declare its position.</p> <p>J\u00fcrgen Hardt, the foreign policy spokesman for Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, told the Guardian that it was \u201cup to the UK\u2019s government and parliament alone\u201d to decide when article 50 would be triggered, but there would be no negotiations up until that point.</p> <p>\u201cTime pressure would have negative consequences for the quality of the negotiation result,\u201d Hardt said, adding that many politicians shared his personal wish for Britain to indefinitely postpone triggering article 50.</p> <p>Some British government insiders expect the UK to declare its timetable at a European council summit in December. If Britain were to trigger article 50 in January or February 2017, it would allow up to nine months to create a basic outline for an agreement before the German elections, with the bulk of negotiations starting in 2018 and potentially concluding by the end of that year. </p> <p>However, several unknowable factors, such as Merkel failing to declare her candidacy for the 2017 elections, could encourage the UK government to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/who-will-dare-pull-trigger-article-50-eu\">further delay the start of negotiations</a>.</p>",

Both health issues were rarely covered in the media.<br></p> <p>\u201cYet Hillary Clinton had pneumonia, didn\u2019t share it for two days and it was the biggest crime of the century.

  "<p>After decades of dismissing issues impacting working families, Donald Trump is scrambling to win over women voters with a child care plan announced on Tuesday. While Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her child care proposal months ago, Trump has put a new coat of paint on the same tired policies that prioritize wealthy people like himself at the expense of working families. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s plan is mainly a tax deduction, which would allow parents to deduct the average price of child care from their taxes. Even with the other new bells and whistles included in Trump\u2019s plan \u2013 such as income caps, rebates and savings accounts \u2013 Trump\u2019s proposal will innately benefit the people who need the least help covering child care expenses, while lower income and middle class families are left behind.</p> <p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-child-care-proposal-35620a7bbfcd#.oqh44j9vh\">As many have pointed out</a>, the value of a tax deduction is directly linked to the tax rate you pay. Under Trump\u2019s plan, wealthy families making $500,000 would get a child care tax break of about $40 for every $100 they pay for child care. Meanwhile, families making $60,000 would only get $15 for every $100 spent on child care. Even if a middle-class family spends the same amount as a wealthy family for child care, the wealthy family\u2019s tax cut is much larger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-childcare-proposal-paid-maternity-leave\">Donald Trump calls for paid maternity leave in childcare plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s plan completely fails to address the day-to-day realities of America\u2019s working families, because it fails to address the underlying problem: it does nothing to make child care affordable. In the United States, the average cost of center-based child care for the typical working family with an infant and preschooler is about $18,000, a steep price for families to cover. If a family cannot afford child care, a tax deduction is irrelevant \u2013 a family can\u2019t deduct something that they can\u2019t pay for to begin with. </p> <p>The same flaw applies to the $1,200 rebate aimed at low-income families under Trump\u2019s plan. In response to criticism that his plan is a windfall for the wealthiest families, Trump is looking to appeal to struggling Americans, but this just won\u2019t cut it. A credit of $1,200 would be perfect if the goal was to help families afford childcare for a month, not a year.</p> <p>We need a major new plan for childcare in America, particularly as 65% of children under six in the United States who have both parents in the workforce. But by failing to address the issue of childcare affordability, many parents, and especially mothers, will be forced to make impossible choices between their paycheck and their child\u2019s care under Trump\u2019s plan.</p> <p>In stark contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s childcare plan is that put forth by his opponent Hillary Clinton, which zeros in on the issue of affordability. Clinton\u2019s plan aims to ease the financial strain of childcare for all families by capping costs at 10% of household income, while also increasing wages for childcare providers. Her plan \u2013 which has been publicly available for a year and was formally announced at a campaign event in May \u2013 prioritizes families that need the most help and would in fact make childcare more affordable. Clinton also prioritizes improving childcare quality with a plan to address chronically low wages and training for childcare providers.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s failure to adequately address childcare costs will only perpetuate the increasingly common occurrence of parents leaving the workforce to become full time caregivers, since many workers realize that it doesn\u2019t make economic sense to spend so much of their income on childcare. For parents who are forced to drop out of the workforce because they simply cannot afford childcare, the economic costs follow them throughout their lifetimes. In fact, the Center for American Progress found that this leads to the domino effect of parents losing out on <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/report/2016/06/21/139731/calculating-the-hidden-cost-of-interrupting-a-career-for-child-care/\">roughly 20</a>% of their lifetime earnings.</p> <p>While it\u2019s far past time that childcare took center stage in our national political and policy debate, American families and our economy need better than Trump\u2019s regressive and haphazard plan. The country needs a serious and major national solution to put high-quality affordable childcare and early education within reach for working families. Trump\u2019s plan completely misses the mark.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d is usually a simple question to answer. For Columbia University transfer student Barry, it means a deep breath followed by a lot of explaining. Mostly Honolulu, he\u2019ll say, but also some years in Indonesia, where his white mother from Kansas still lives while the black father he barely knows is over in Kenya. New to New York, Barry (the film) is about Barry the man figuring out just who exactly he wants to be.</p> <p>There\u2019s the commonly cited cinematic theory from Alfred Hitchcock, which differentiates surprise from suspense. An unseen bomb under a table explodes brings surprise, but if the audience knows it is there and watches it tick, it creates the setting for suspense. We in the audience know this good natured and clearly intelligent kid will get out of his funk. He\u2019ll drop the nickname and revert back to Barack. And we also know that the budding romance between Barry (played with striking depth by Australian newcomer Devon Terrell) and Charlotte (the charming Anya Taylor-Joy) won\u2019t last. It\u2019s one of the weirdest examples of Hitchcock\u2019s bomb theory, made even stranger with the recent release of that <em>other</em> Young Obama movie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/southside-with-you-review-obamas-first-date-is-before-sunset-sans-subtlety\">Southside With You</a>. When will the self-doubt end and the devotion to public service begin? It makes for oddly compelling viewing.</p> <p>However, much to director Vikram Gandhi and writer Adam Mansbach\u2019s triumph, Barry would still work if this were a piece of fiction and not about the future two-term president of the United States. The movie is rich on its own as a character piece about the difficulties of being bi-racial, especially at the very specific location of Columbia University. This remarkable campus, with a list of important graduates a mile long, is just a few minutes\u2019 walk from Harlem, the historically African American community that, in 1981, had far worse issues with crime and poverty than it does today.</p> <p>Barry is usually the only black kid in his class, and while he is rarely confronted by outright bigotry, the micro-aggressions are everywhere. When not reading Ralph Ellison and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois\">WEB Du Bois</a> he plays pickup basketball, and he doesn\u2019t exactly fit in with that crowd either. His girlfriend Charlotte, certainly more mature than he, seems unfazed by any of the usual pitfalls of mixed race, but Barry still lacks the self-confidence to deal with the perceived stares from both the black or white community. When he visits with Charlotte\u2019s Connecticut family he puts on a bit of an act, like proudly listing his father\u2019s accomplishments, while privately resents his absence. A visit to the nearby projects begins like an anthropological excursion and ends in humiliation.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much in terms of actual plot in Barry, but each of its scenes are quite well-observed, given room to breathe and are hesitant to hammer their message over your head. The love story is sincere, and there\u2019s also a great deal of humour. If nothing else, Barry saddened me that \u201cwe\u201d never got to know Obama\u2019s mother, Ann Dunham, in real life. In the few short scenes she\u2019s got, Ashley Judd plays her as a vibrant old hippie with a sharp tongue and little interest in self-censorship. Had she lived she would have been 66 when Obama was elected president, and, if nothing else, one hell of a Barbara Walters interview guest.</p> <p>Barry\u2019s first roommate at school is played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/06/richard-linklater-ellar-coltrane-boyhood-interview-dear-process\">Ellar Coltrane</a> who, at least at this stage in his career, is still the kid from Boyhood to me. Vikram Gandhi (whose previous feature, the manipulative quasi-documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g9iB0jljBM\">Kumar\u00e9</a>, is awful) shares a bit of Richard Linklater\u2019s light touch. Whereas the inferior Southside With You ultimately becomes an exercise in deifying our young Chicago community organiser by projecting our aspirations about him onto a blank character, Barry is a real movie about real problems, that just happens to be about a real person. Its final scene, one of the more perfect in a film this year, settles on something Barry-soon-to-be-Barack will be very familiar with: hope.</p>",

The Democratic nominee had to be helped into a van while leaving. Afterward, Clinton cancelled all public events for three days.</p> <p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/hillary-clinton-doctor-letter-pneumonia\">since released</a> more detailed medical information from her doctor describing her as \u201chealthy and fit to serve as president\u201d.

Trump was visiting a church that serves as a water distribution center for residents when he started critiquing Clinton. The pastor, Faith Green Timmons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-visit-water-plant-tour\">interrupted and made clear</a>: \u201cMr Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we\u2019ve done in Flint, not give a political speech.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-speech-pastor-interruption-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/533yt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2719026\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump chastised by pastor during Flint speech \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d9cebde4b05caf65ecd45f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914Trumppastor_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914Trumppastor.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/14/160914Trumppastor_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-speech-pastor-interruption-video\">Donald Trump chastised by pastor during Flint speech</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Later in Ohio, Trump, buoyed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/trump-ohio-poll-leads-hillary-clinton\">recent polls</a> that showed him taking the lead in that crucial swing state, was in high spirits in front of a cheering crowd.

The Republican nominee added of the proposal: \u201cIt\u2019s bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just a single year, and we have no idea where they come from, it\u2019s a great Trojan horse.\u201d Looking ahead to history\u2019s judgment, Trump noted, \u201cI don\u2019t want be known in 200 years for having created a Trojan horse by a different name.\u201d</p> <p>The uncharacteristic return to his unscripted rally style comes the day before the Republican nominee is scheduled to make a major economic policy speech at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. There, the Republican nominee will introduce a tax reform proposal. </p> <p>Trump has previously introduced two other tax reform plans. First, in 2015, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/28/donald-trump-unveils-tax-plan\">emphasized that half of Americans</a> in lieu of paying taxes would simply mail a card to the IRS saying \u201cI win\u201d, and more recently in August where he proposed to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">reduce the number of tax brackets</a> to three while drastically cutting rates.

  "<p>The European Union\u2019s trade negotiators are due to meet their US counterparts on Thursday amid growing speculation that talks over the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> have ground to a halt.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s trade chief, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, will meet US trade ambassador Michael Froman in a bid to rescue the TTIP talks at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday described as a \u201cstocktake\u201d of the negotiations so far.</p> <p>The two sides are understood to be preparing to put the talks on the back burner while policymakers consider complaints about a similar and equally controversial EU trade deal with Canada.</p> <p>The comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) deal with Canada is due to be ratified by the council of ministers next month prior to being debated by the Strasbourg parliament. But protests in Germany, France and Finland could wreck the agreement and with it the prospects for the TTIP talks.</p> <p>A gathering in Germany of SPD members next week at a special congress could force the left-of-centre party\u2019s leadership to reverse its support for CETA, and trigger widespread revolt across the continent against the deal and its cousin TTIP. </p> <p>Last month Sigmar Gabriel, the SPD leader and economy minister in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/29/eu-trade-negotiator-talks-down-ttip-failure-report-sigmar-gabriel\">\u201cin my opinion, the negotiations with the US have de facto failed</a>, even though nobody is really admitting it\u201d, though he remains a supporter of the CETA deal.</p> <p>EU officials believe the ailing European economy can only recover with the help of trade deals that harmonise rules and regulations, making it easier to sell goods and services abroad.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A spokesman for the commission said it was aiming to strike a comprehensive deal with the US. </p> <p>He said: \u201cSince the beginning of this year there has been a intensification of contact between negotiators, both at technical and political level.\u201d</p> <p>He denied that negotiators were shedding controversial elements of the talks to secure a deal before the US president, Barack Obama, leaves office at the end of the year.</p> <p>\u201cA quick deal would likely be a scaled down deal that would not include meaningful outcomes for most of the EU\u2019s interests. That would mean far fewer benefits for EU citizens. It is in the EU\u2019s interest that substance prevails over deadlines,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Jude Kirton-Darling, Labour MEP for north-east England and a member of the European parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the political arm-twisting needed to secure the CETA deal could spell the end for TTIP.</p> <p>\u201cTTIP has been stalled for months, and [Thursday\u2019s] meeting is merely a face-saving exercise for both the US and the EU. Political attention in Europe is now really focused on the finalised EU-Canada CETA deal, due to be ratified in the coming months, which up to now has been subject to less public scrutiny but raises many of the same concerns around standards, public services and the rule of law,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLoud public declarations from EU leaders and their opposition to TTIP in recent weeks can only be understood in the context of growing public discontent over the CETA deal. TTIP\u2019s life support machine will be turned off if doing so helps to secure a majority in favour of CETA.\u201d</p> <p>TTIP has become the focus of anti-globalisation protests in the US and Europe with both presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, accusing the Obama administration of promoting a trade deal that would cost jobs and drive down wages.<br></p> <p>The European commission has come under intense pressure to abandon the talks following protests across Europe against provisions that campaigners argue will allow US companies to demand access to public sector contracts. Opponents have also complained that a separate courts system to resolve trade disputes will allow corporations to sue governments when new laws restrict their ability to make profits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Malmstr\u00f6m has overhauled the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system used in most trade deals, which anti-TTIP campaigners have described as a secretive courts process for the sole benefit of multinational corporations. She has proposed a more transparent version, which has retrospectively been inserted into the CETA agreement.</p> <p>The anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now has described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\">TTIP</a> as having \u201clittle to do with selling more products\u201d and being \u201cmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/david-cameron-support-ttip\">a charter for deregulation</a>, which threatens to change the way we make decisions about laws\u201d.</p> <p>This week Alfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, called for all future trade agreements to \u201cstipulate the primacy of human rights\u201d in a clear reference to the private courts systems included in TTIP and CETA deals. </p> <p>He said existing treaties should be revised to ensure that they did not conflict with the duty of government to fulfil binding human rights treaties and meet environmental and health goals. <br> </p>",

Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by five points among likely voters in Ohio in a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-14/ohio-poll\">new poll</a> put out by the highly reputable Ann Selzer firm for Bloomberg. </p> <p>Trump has a rally in Canton, Ohio, scheduled today, and he planned to visit Flint, Michigan. Clinton remains at home recuperating from pneumonia but was to return to the trail Thursday with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. </p> <p>Trump led Clinton 48-43 in a two-way race <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-14/ohio-poll\">in the poll</a>, which surveyed 802 likely voters from 8-12 September. Clinton placed half of Trump supporters in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d on 9 September and stumbled upon leaving the World Trade Center on 11 September. Trump led Clinton 44-39 in a four-way race in the poll, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson scoring an impressive 10 points.</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, which has picked the winner in every presidential election since 1964. HuffPost pollster\u2019s <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-ohio-president-trump-vs-clinton\">average</a> has Clinton two points ahead of Trump in the state.</p> <p>In the Ohio Senate race, where Democrats once hoped to pick up a seat, incumbent Republican Rob Portman was ahead of former Democratic governor Ted Strickland by 17 points in the poll, 53-36%. </p> <h2>Trump tweets Crimea</h2> <p>Trump raised eyebrows Tuesday night with a strange tweet about Crimea and a disconnected riff on the Lincoln-Douglas debates.
