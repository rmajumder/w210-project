  "<p>Robert De Niro and his business partners, BD Hotels, are to open a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/robert-de-niro-gets-go-ahead-to-open-london-hotel\" title=\"\">\u201cluxury boutique\u201d </a>hotel in London\u2019s Covent Garden. Currently, the average price for a room in the capital is \u00a3135 and rising because today\u2019s hotel stay, with more than 80% occupancy, is, as the jargon goes, an experiential luxury. \u201cBD\u201d is Richard Born and Ira Drukier, formerly in engineering and medicine; they are now billionaires and the biggest owners of boutique hotels in New York. \u201cThe aesthetic nature of the hotel business has evolved slowly,\u201d Drukier said in an interview last year. \u201cThey have become stylised\u2026 hotels are more than just a bed and water.\u201d And then some. Possibly Drukier was referring to the swimming pool that De Niro \u201chelped to implement\u201d in the BD Greenwich Hotel framed with beams from a centuries-old Japanese farmhouse.</p> <p>One of the many follies of uber-affluence is that people will pay hugely to grope their way around the black-painted lobby of a dimly lit designer hotel, manned by undertaker-suited staff, sphinx-like, snooty and clothed to be indistinguishable from the decor. Inevitably, too, the lavatories are marked by obscure post-modern hieroglyphics and the cost of a glass of water is heading to the hourly rate of the London living wage (\u00a39.40 and in the dreams of many of the abysmally paid hotel staff who carry the cases, clean rooms, stock the bars, cook and work as below-stairs porters.)</p> <p>In the classic 1995 Martin Scorsese film <em>Casino</em>, Robert De Niro plays Sam \u201cAce\u201d Rothstein, a mafia associate, sent in to run a crooked Las Vegas gambling joint. At one point, he says: \u201cThere are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way and the way I do it.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, at the Ludlow in New York, , a non-unionised BD hotel (where De Niro is not involved), the management showed the way it prefers to do it. It allegedly engaged in tactics to persuade its staff not to vote in favour of joining the strong New York union, the Hotel Trades Council (HTC). Hints were made that staff would be sacked if they defied management\u2019s wishes. Nevertheless, the staff voted 97% in favour.</p> <p>In New York, a large number of hotels are unionised. HTC has 32,000 members including those working in other BD hotels. Ludlow staff, pre-HTC, earned around $14 (\u00a311) an hour. In contrast, staff in HTC hotels can earn up to $27 an hour plus free family medical insurance, pensions, proper holiday pay and a guaranteed working week. In London, is that going to be the way? Possibly not. A report published on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hotelworkersunite\" title=\"\">Unethical London, drawn up by the Unite Hotel Workers branch</a>, rightly charges that, in London, global hotel chains harass, block and intimidate to stop collective union action, contrary to global employment agreements. In a predominantly non-unionised climate, tips \u2013 12% to 15% of bills \u2013 are \u201creallocated\u201d and pay is poor.</p> <p>Employees are pressured to work extra time without pay and complaints or any sign of union interest are too often dealt with by a cut in shifts on zero-hours contracts or by awarding the complainer with extra rooms to clean. Staff are, in many cases, disrespected and disregarded; ill, depressed and broke. All of which, the report says,&#xa0;makes, \u201cLondon one of the most unethical tourist destinations in the world\u201d \u2013 a highly profitable one.</p> <p>Hotel and tourism is the fourth largest employer in the country. By 2025, tourism is predicted to be a \u00a3257.4bn industry. It is shameful that collective action and the right to join a trade union are blocked, allowing exploitation and fear to flourish. Over the past several decades, what has happened in hospitality and tourism offers in miniature a picture of general developments in employment. In the 1940s, Conrad Hilton may have had his flaws but it was clear who was accountable. His name was on the business. Now, hedge funds and financiers are the obscure investors and, as the Unite report points out, hotel buildings are sold, brands are franchised and major hotels are atomised with different services outsourced, each new contract driving wages and conditions down further. A process, which, without collective action, kills the spirit of the hardest workers.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of UK hotel employees are immigrants. Post Brexit, if they go, who will replace them? The Unite report makes demands that are modest \u2013 a wage on which you can live; safe, secure work; guaranteed hours every week; training opportunities and a collective voice and union representation. That these rights are still denied demonstrates how successive governments, Labour included, have accepted that, in the words of social historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/selina-todd\" title=\"\">Selina Todd</a>, \u201cprofit making and the people\u2019s welfare [are] ultimately irreconcilable\u201d.</p> <p>In New York, in addition to trade unionism, collectivism has channelled into consumer clout. A kitemark operates so that you know that the hotel you choose has a fair policy on wages and conditions; not too difficult for TripAdvisor et al to add to its criteria? It works for fair trade, so why not for many of the millions labouring in hotel and tourism? Or don\u2019t we care enough?</p> <p>Today, perhaps, we are all travellers, nomads not just geographically but politically, too. In a recent column in the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/column/david-brooks\" title=\"\"><em> New York Times</em>, David Brooks</a> suggested that young people, reared on individualism, privacy and the power of the dollar, preferred the community and class solidarity of the Bernie Sanders campaign to the \u201cboomer autonomy\u201d of Hillary Clinton. Brooks quotes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/26/tribe-homecoming-belonging-review-sebastian-junger-joanna-bourke\" title=\"\">Sebastian Junger\u2019s book, <em>Tribe</em></a>, in which he describes how 18th-century colonials, captured by Native Americans, when freed, often chose to return to the materially poorer life for a society of communal living. Junger writes: \u201cThey would have practised extremely close and involved childcare. They would have done almost everything in the company of others.\u201d</p> <p>Money talks, but what also has a powerful eloquence is empathy and the determination to look out for each other. Paradoxically, individual choice can add up to a collective message. And with a kitemark system in operation, this could inform your next choice of hotel.</p>",
  "<p>A federal judge has ordered Hillary Clinton to answer written questions about her use of a private email server while at the state department in response to a lawsuit by a conservative watchdog group, though he declined to make her submit to a sworn deposition.</p> <p>District court judge Emmet Sullivan said Clinton must reply in writing to questions posed by the group, Judicial Watch, about why she set up a system to conduct state department business, a decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">led to an FBI investigation</a> and has haunted the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign for over a year.</p> <p>The judge said the group failed to demonstrate that an hours-long deposition was necessary to clarify why Clinton set up the private server, as opposed to seeking the information \u201cthrough other, less burdensome or intrusive means such as interrogatories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJudicial Watch\u2019s argument that a deposition is preferable in this case because of the ability to ask follow-up questions is not persuasive,\u201d Sullivan wrote. \u201cGiven the extensive public record related to the clintonemail.com system, a record which Judicial Watch has acknowledged, Judicial Watch will be able to anticipate many follow-up questions.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-fact-check\">'What I did was allowed': fact-checking Clinton's statements on email inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Judicial Watch made a name for itself by dogging former president Bill Clinton, and has now filed a number of lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) seeking records from the state department about Hillary Clinton\u2019s time spent as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. </p> <p>Judicial Watch\u2019s president, Tom Fitton, praised the judge\u2019s decision in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased that this federal court ordered Hillary Clinton to provide written answers under oath to some key questions about her email scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will move quickly to get these answers. The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.\u201d</p> <p>The decision means Clinton will probably not have to step away from the campaign trail to sit for an interview with some of her fiercest critics, but ensures that the controversy will continue to follower her throughout the final weeks of the presidential campaign. </p> <p>Judicial Watch has until 14 October to submit questions to Clinton, who must respond within 30 days, according to the decision. </p> <p>Separately, Sullivan approved Judicial Watch\u2019s request to depose John Bentel, a senior state department aide who has since retired, due to \u201ccontradictory evidence\u201d about the extent of his knowledge of Clinton\u2019s server and email practices. However, he declined the group\u2019s request to depose Clarence Finney, a state department official handling Foia requests. </p> <p>In July, the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">closed its investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server</a> after she sat for a three-hour interview. Director James Comey said that while she and her staff had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of emails, a handful of which contained classified information at the time, the FBI would not recommend prosecutors seek charges in the case.</p> <p>The judge also ordered the federal government to begin releasing the \u201cthousands of work-related emails\u201d that the FBI said it had recovered in its investigation.</p> <p>Clinton has apologized for setting up the server, maintaining that the decision was a \u201cmistake\u201d and not an attempt to obfuscate her actions or skirt reporting laws. She also noted that this was the practice of her predecessors, though the law was tightened by the Obama administration.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-advised-her-to-use-private-email.html?ref=politics\">reported</a> that former secretary of state Colin Powell was said to have advised Clinton to use a personal email account. The report was based on notes from the FBI handed over to Congress. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-clinton-fbi-idUKKCN10U0FO\">statement</a>, Powell\u2019s office said he wrote Clinton an \u201cemail memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department\u201d while also noting that \u201cat the time there was no equivalent system with the department\u201d. </p>",

Throughout my entire career, I\u2019ve always tried to fix that issue of underrepresentation, so I\u2019m proud of the work that we\u2019ve done thus far.\u201d</p> <p>Wilmore said that one of his biggest accomplishments with The Nightly Show<em> </em>was the diverse group that worked both in front of and behind the camera. </p> <p>His other proudest accomplishment, he said, was his unfailing commitment to \u201ckeeping it 100\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany times when you do what I do, or work in journalism, in general, people try to not explicitly present their opinions on topics,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the term \u2018fair reporting\u2019 is overused when it comes to journalism. I think saying they want to report evenly is more accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Though Wilmore said he thought \u201ceven reporting\u201d was an admirable approach, it was far from his goal: he wanted to be 100% honest, all of the time.</p> <p>\u201cTo keep it 100, I couldn\u2019t always be even,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to drop that pretense and if I thought a certain side was wrong, I had to call it that way. I couldn\u2019t be concerned with what side that was.\u201d</p> <p>As an example, Wilmore said he has criticized Hillary Clinton almost as much as he has criticized Donald Trump. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had people mad at me for doing that, but what can I do if I want to keep it 100?\u201d he said. \u201cDo they want me to act like I don\u2019t think the things I\u2019m saying? It wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p> <p>This approach has earned Wilmore many fans and more critics. </p> <p>\u201cIn my career, I\u2019m always trying to do something different,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m successful and sometimes I\u2019m not, but I don\u2019t mind going down trying.\u201d</p> <p>Wilmore acknowledged his disappointment with Comedy Central\u2019s decision, but reflected that his time on The Night Show and The Daily Show helped develop his voice. </p> <p>Though he\u2019s always been interested in using satire and humor to comment on race and politics, Wilmore said The Daily Show<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>gave him the first chance to project his own voice rather than write for other people.</p> <p>\u201cThat was my first chance to work on something that was really coming out of my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019d say The Daily Show really started my awareness of my socio- political voice, and The Nightly Show<em> </em>took it to the next level.\u201d</p> <p>It was on The Nightly Show<em> </em>that he realized his political voice was not what even he expected.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re writing for different people all the time, it\u2019s easier to bury yourself in someone else\u2019s voice,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though you\u2019re writing for them, you\u2019re still expressing your opinions and point of view, but you\u2019re doing it while being able to hide in their voice.\u201d</p> <p>He said he frequently surprised himself when he was required to take a public stand on the show. </p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">\u201c</span><span tabindex=\"-1\">I had never thought that much about the Confederate flag because I grew up in California,\u201d he said, alluding to a segment on persistent controversy around the symbol. \u201cI\u2019d seen those types of things, but not like in the south where it is in your face all the time.\u201d</span></p> <p>Reporting on the flag, he said, forced him to confront a reality that he hand never had to see before, and which drew out emotions that surprised him. </p> <p>Wilmore also tried to reassure fans about the quality of satire still running, saying that Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah and John Oliver immediately came to mind.</p> <p>\u201cPlus, there\u2019s so much incredible written press, and so many great shows on YouTube, and, you know, hopefully I\u2019ll be back soon to do my thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe show just ended last night, so I haven\u2019t had a chance to breathe, but during the next week I\u2019ll definitely be thinking about how to best get back out there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Enemies in politics and opposed on nearly all fronts, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have found themselves united together against Barack Obama and a tradition that has kept America in charge of the world economy\u2019s rules for more than 70 years.

There\u2019s no margins for anything, it\u2019s like \u2013 basically you\u2019re lucky to make 10% on stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The competitive nature of business under free trade still rattles his father and grandfather, who launched the company over five decades ago. \u201cThey still don\u2019t understand,\u201d Semple said. \u201cHow could they do this or this? We used to write on a bar napkin the price, and whoever the highest was, we\u2019d submit it and get the work.\u201d</p> <p>The trade debate has particularly resonated in Michigan\u2019s Macomb County, which produced the band of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d who helped propel the former Republican president to victory, and whom Trump has promised to reinvigorate. </p> <p>Kurt Larson, 66, a retired auto worker who lives in Macomb County\u2019s seat, Mount Clemens, recalled living in Arizona and how his father used to work for Motorola and witnessed first-hand the effect of jobs moving out of the US. \u201cHe would go to other countries,\u201d Larson said, \u201cthey would build factories and get people to assemble semiconductors for 30 cents an hour.\u201d And as trade deals came into place, the trend continued. </p> <p>\u201cI never want to see jobs that Americans do go overseas or abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s counterproductive to our country.\u201d</p> <p>Walking along the quiet streets of downtown Mount Clemens, Dwayne Johnson, a construction worker who lives in the city of Dearborn, said he believes re-negotiating new trade deals is a \u201cgreat idea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on whether we\u2019re making money or how good the trade [agreement] is for the United States,\u201d said the 57-year-old. \u201cWhat I mean by that is, they\u2019re taking all the jobs from over here and they\u2019re putting them in other countries,\u201d he added. \u201cIt don\u2019t seem like we\u2019re making money off it.\u201d </p> <p>Though Johnson said he supports Clinton over Trump \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t see myself voting for him\u201d \u2013 he said the Republican nominee\u2019s relentless anti-trade rhetoric, elevating it to a major issue in the race, is the \u201conly thing I see in him that makes any sense\u201d. \u201cIf he [does] lose the election, he did offer something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawrence, the chief administrative officer at AlphaUSA, agreed there was some truth to the feeling that trade deals had contributed to the decline in the quality of life in the US, particularly for the middle class.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these workers have seen jobs leave this country and go to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve certainly seen that in the automotive marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>But trade has its advantages, Lawrence said, and no deal should be viewed as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d alone.</p> <p>\u201cTrade agreements happen not just so we can find the lowest cost to produce our products,\u201d he said, noting that deals also create customers for American companies and open access to foreign resources.</p> <p>To Lawrence, deals are made in the details: \u201cIt\u2019s how we write them \u2013 and how do we come to the table with those other countries, take a leadership position, and make something that works for everyone. And that\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d</p> <p>For politicians back in Washington, the trick will be to convince voters that deals can be in their interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that over the years the interest of American corporations and the interests of Americans have diverged,\u201d Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. \u201cOne of the mistakes is that corporate American has just said: \u2018If it\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for America,\u2019 and the approach needs to be more sophisticated than that.

Bannon has no experience running a campaign, but a number of employees who left Breitbart under his stewardship had warnings for campaign staff: expect expletive-laced phone calls at all hours of the night.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be screaming matches between Steve and every other person in the office,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, a former editor at Breitbart News. </p> <p>\u201cBut there will be no screaming matches between Steve and Trump. Steve knows where his bread is buttered.\u201d</p> <p>A steady stream of emails leaked in the days following Trump\u2019s hiring of Bannon paint a picture of a shrewd businessman with a scorched-earth approach to the Republican establishment. Former Breitbart staffers interviewed by the Guardian recall a man driven less by an ideological crusade than the desire to emerge on top \u2013 not unlike the candidate who now employs him.</p> <p>To some, the Trump-Bannon partnership simply marks the consummation of a long, happy rapport. During his tenure as the executive chairman of Breitbart, Bannon spent the greater part of the last year promoting Trump\u2019s candidacy: where others fled or scolded Trump\u2019s declaration that Mexican immigrants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">\u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d</a>, Breitbart News echoed the call.</p> <p>Bannon was a presence in the newsroom, often hopping on daily editorial calls and making his views clear. Staff present for the discussions, including Shapiro and Kurt Bardella, who previously served as a media consultant to Breitbart, said Bannon aggressively pushed stories against immigrants, and supported linking minorities to terrorism and crime. </p> <p>It was catnip for the site\u2019s growing audience of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d, a far-right group that merges race and nationalism and has largely embraced Trump. For all his antagonism toward the media, the Republican nominee has publicly lavished praise on Breitbart, even though his former campaign manager Corey Lewandoski was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\">charged with battery</a> against one of the website\u2019s reporters, Michelle Fields, when she tried to ask Trump a question.</p> <p>Bannon, rather than defend Fields, used Breitbart as a vehicle to discredit her story and her character. Fields resigned, as did Shapiro and Bardella.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really a crystallization of how his pursuit of a relationship with Trump superseded the welfare of his reporters,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cIt was that moment of clarity where they\u2019re so in for Trump that they\u2019re willing to throw one of their own overboard even when that person is the victim of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro soon rebranded Breitbart as \u201cTrump Pravda\u201d, and said that many staffers were increasingly concerned about their future. The site was spinning away from its crusade to hold liberal media and establishment Republicans to account, they felt. They worried about instead turning into shills for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>It was not just the obvious support for Trump that troubled employees, but also the clear objective of Bannon to diminish the former reality TV star\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary. The website ran overwhelmingly unfavorable coverage of Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, both established Florida politicians, especially with articles about the bilingual candidates\u2019 support for immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole mindset in general was: \u2018We need to go after Rubio, we need to go after Bush,\u2019\u201d said Bardella.</p> <p>The focus on Rubio was particularly relentless, as the Florida senator emerged as one of the final candidates in the race. Stories ran near daily with headlines asserting that, if Rubio were elected president, immigrants and terrorists would stream across the US border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f/0_0_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe hates Marco,\u201d said one former employee, who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cThere was definitely a decision to promote the work of writers with an extreme anti-Rubio bent.\u201d</p> <p>Similar treatment has been directed toward House speaker Paul Ryan in recent months, with Bannon working behind the scenes to push his long-shot primary challenger, Paul Nehlen. One story criticized Ryan for having a fence around his home in Wisconsin, with the implication that the speaker was willing to wall off his own house but not the US border. </p> <p>Bannon was \u201cabsolutely fuelling the energy\u201d behind Nehlen, a former staffer said. </p> <p>Spokespeople for Ryan and Rubio declined to comment.</p> <p>Even Ted Cruz, an ultraconservative senator once covered favorably by Breitbart, was not spared the site\u2019s acidic treatment of Trump\u2019s opponents. A report published by the Hill <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292028-how-breitbart-turned-on-ted-cruz\">detailed</a> how Bannon slowly turned against the Texas senator. In particular, Breitbart seized on Trump\u2019s attacks on Cruz\u2019s citizenship \u2013 the senator was born to an American mother in Canada \u2013 much in the way it spread false \u201cbirther\u201d ideas against Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was a remarkable turnaround, given that just under a year prior, Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle had been invited to observe Cruz\u2019s bedtime ritual with his children \u2013 and subsequently produced <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/23/exclusive-photos-potential-first-family-gets-ready-for-bed-before-sen-cruzs-presidential-campaign-announcement/\">a report</a> portraying the senator in a glowing light.</p> <p>Although they criticized his methods, those who worked under Bannon acknowledged a tireless devotion to creating an empire too influential to ignore, and his success so far.</p> <p>Given its popularity among grassroots conservatives and Bannon\u2019s \u201ctake-no prisoners\u201d approach, few Republican candidates or lawmakers are brazen enough to pick a fight with the website.</p> <p>Both Rubio and Bush continued to engage with Breitbart during the Republican primary, for example, even as they were targeted by much of its coverage. </p> <p>At the height of the primary, a visibly frustrated Rubio mocked Breitbart\u2019s credibility on Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/20/rubio-slams-breitbart-after-publishing-scathing-remarks-by-immigration-union-president-theyre-basically-conspiracy-theories/\">accusing them</a> of publishing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d. He has nonetheless continued to provide at least some of their reporters with interviews dubbed exclusives.</p> <p>Bannon \u201chas taken where the Breitbart brand essentially was before the election \u2013 considered by many as outliers \u2013 and made it a sheer force of will\u201d, Bardella said. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to advance an agenda.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s the right-hand person to a would-be president.\u201d</p> <p>Though Bannon has only had a few days in charge of Trump\u2019s campaign, his former employees said he would stand in stark contrast to former chairman Paul Manafort, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">who resigned on Friday</a>. While Manafort tried to steer Trump toward a more moderate general election strategy, little will be off limits for Bannon, they said.</p> <p>His motto, as Shapiro put it, will be simple: \u201cLet Trump be Trump.\u201d</p>",

Communities dependent on coal or fracking would be assured that jobs would be replaced before they were laid off. </p> <p>Stein estimates the costs of the transition would be completely offset by the money saved by not using fossil fuels. The savings, she suggested, would include billions of dollars related to healthcare costs from asthma, emphysema, heart attacks, strokes and cancers related to exposure to fossil fuels. </p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">The party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee, Ajamu Baraka, also appeared at the event.

The party\u2019s message on climate has been repeatedly overshadowed by Stein\u2019s controversial comments on the government\u2019s regulatory oversight of vaccines, drawing accusations that she has associated herself with the discredited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/30/jill-stein-green-party-vaccinations-anti-vaxxers\">\u201canti-vaxxer\u201d movement. </a></p> <p>Stein, a Harvard-educated physician, has both cited the proven importance of vaccines, noting that they save lives and have eliminated devastating diseases, and suggested that Americans cannot trust the people who recommend widespread vaccination. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/jill-stein-anti-vaccination-green-party-ridiculous\">Jill Stein dismisses perception she is anti-vaccines as 'ridiculous'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Responding to criticisms last month, she said her concerns were about the influence of corporations on government, but they also seemed to echo the concerns of anti-vaccination campaigners that compromised or influenced regulators could open the door for dangerous medicine. </p> <p>\u201cAs a medical doctor, of course I support vaccinations,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI have a problem with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] being controlled by drug companies.\u201d <br></p> <p>But on the campaign trail, Stein largely limited her remarks to concerns over climate change. She proposed introducing a carbon tax of $60 a ton that would yield around $360bn annually and increasing the estate tax to its level during the Reagan administration. Her proposals, she argued, were now a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cEach month now, we\u2019re seeing records set for climate change and global warming.

  "<p>In his 1987 Village Voice essay <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/music/from-the-voice-archives-greg-tate-on-michael-jackson-in-1987-6631218\">I\u2019m White!

The searing critique was not just about the music, but about Jackson\u2019s new appearance, unveiled on the album\u2019s cover and in the Martin Scorsese-directed video. There was Jackson with a narrow pointy nose and pale skin, a look Tate unforgettably described as \u201cdecolorized flesh \u2013 a buppy version of Dorian Gray, a blaxploitation nightmare that offers this moral: stop, the face you save may be your own\u201d.</p> <p>Still, as much as he disliked Bad for being \u201cas songless as Thriller is songful\u201d, Tate\u2019s essay is also a backhanded love letter to what is still the <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6812781/michael-jackson-thriller-30x-multi-platinum-album\">bestselling album of all time</a>. \u201cNo amount of disgust for Jackson\u2019s even newer face (cleft in the chin) takes anything away from Thriller,\u201d Tate wrote. \u201cThriller is a record that doesn\u2019t even know how to stop giving pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Tate and Jackson were the same age, and in 1987 the critic \u2013 as adept at exploring the black experience in America in an essay as Jackson was at exploring it in a song \u2013 had recently been hired as a staff writer for the Voice by legendary rock critic <a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/\">Robert Christgau</a> after contributing for a few years. \u201cDigging into our black nationalist bag,\u201d as he put it, Tate wrote angrily about Jackson, but not without the sympathy of context: \u201cJackson emerges a casualty of America\u2019s ongoing race war \u2013 another Negro gone mad because his mirror reports that his face does not conform to the Nordic ideal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8c5a4b545b90b19aadf85e8f5dc5a6c57334bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c5a4b545b90b19aadf85e8f5dc5a6c57334bb4/0_428_3432_2059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jackson in his Bad years: \u201ca buppy version of Dorian Gray\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jackson in his Bad years: \u2018A buppy version of Dorian Gray.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two decades later, a few years after leaving the Voice as a staff writer, Tate returned to write <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/michael-jackson-the-man-in-our-mirror-6394480\">The Man in Our Mirror</a>, the definitive Michael Jackson obituary. \u201cThe absolute irony of all the jokes and speculation about Michael trying to turn into a European woman is that after James Brown, his music (and his dancing) represent the epitome \u2013 one of the mightiest peaks \u2013 of what we call black music,\u201d Tate declared. \u201cAnyone whose racial-litmus-test challenge to Michael came with a rhythm-and-blues battle royale event would have gotten their ass royally waxed.\u201d</p> <p>This masterful essay is anthologized in Tate\u2019s new book <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/flyboy-2\">Flyboy 2: The Greg Tate Reader</a>, a collection of Tate\u2019s writings on black artists from John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix to Spike Lee and Kara Walker.

His first cover was about Nigerian singer <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-sunny-ade-mn0000771297\">King Sunny Ad\u00e9</a>. Right from the start his prose was entirely free of cliches. Even now, Tate is constantly forming new idiomatic expressions which are perplexing in their ability to be simultaneously original and yet feel as familiar as something your auntie might have told you as a child. </p> <p>For instance, Tate writes of Outkast that \u201chip-hop is now the Kmart of the American id, where our dark and unconscious shit turns into shinola [and] we need its democratic ideals to be messy\u201d. He described Andre 3000 as \u201clatest link in a lengthy chain of supersoulful African American eccentrics stretching from Charley Patton and Jelly Roll Morton to Andre\u2019s guiding light in eclectic negritude, Prince.

These figures, Tate says, helped to foster \u201cthe whole notion of being a black artist as being a person without boundaries, being a person who was making these connections between politics and metaphysics.\u201d</p> <p>Interviewed in the 1992 essay <a href=\"https://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/Black%20to%20the%20Future%20(Dery)_0.pdf\">Black to the Future</a> in which Mark Dery coins the term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/07/afrofuturism-black-identity-future-science-technology\">Afrofuturism</a> (a way of thinking about race as a technology in relation to culture, science and metaphysics), Tate is seen as a godfather of that school of black thought. But while he is deeply interested in how Afrofuturism and its converse, Afropessimism, \u201creveal the precarious position of blackness within western society and the recurring sense of danger mediated by a will to progress,\u201d he finds the term Afrofuturism a little \u201ccorny\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3f71063cfe6776d5083660ef39843729737d6fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3f71063cfe6776d5083660ef39843729737d6fd/0_257_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The choreographer Bill T Jones, another artist Tate examines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The choreographer Bill T Jones, another artist Tate examines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy comrade in arms, [<a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2015/08/blackstar-2015-arthur-jafa-elissa-blount-moorhead-talk-tneg-their-recently-launched-production-studio-235023/\">cinematographer</a>] Arthur Jafa, we always thought of \u2018black science fiction\u2019,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe thing was, when we said it, it didn\u2019t just reference literature or films.

Black writers who flow between these subjects owe a debt to \u201coldhead\u201d Tate, who has been making black prose philosophically portable between different spheres long before black Twitter did. </p> <p>Indeed, from his early music reviews in the 80s to his essay <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/top-10-reasons-why-so-few-black-folk-appear-down-to-occupy-wall-street-6433290\">Top 10 Reasons Why So Few Black Folk Were Down to Occupy Wall Street Plus Four More</a>, Tate has helped foster a shift in how blackness is seen in the world.

His linguistic phrasing is relentlessly his own, delightfully challenging readers to think in new ways. And his language choices are inclined, as he puts it, to \u201cincite a riot among those copydesks and style-book fetishists who pretend that lowercasing Black is sensible and not white-power jockeying taken to the grammatical level.\u201d</p> <p>But though he is associated with jazz, soul and all things Black, there is nothing remotely limited in the scope of his new book. \u201cRace, generally equated with politics, is really in the American context a branch of metaphysics, aesthetics, and anthropology,\u201d he writes in his introduction, \u201crepresenting a far broader body of concerns where you can readily leapfrog between sex, death, religion, criminality, linguistics, music, genetics, athletics, fashion, medicine, you name it, in the name of African liberation and self- determination.\u201d Whether you are new to his work or a longtime reader, the universe of Black magic lovingly curated in Flyboy 2 will do your soul good.</p>",
  "<p>Of all the various indignities laden upon Bridget Jones \u2013 the unfaithful fuckwit boyfriends, the nosy Smug Marrieds, the blue soup \u2013 none has been as frustrating to witness as the trajectory of her reputation. Leaving aside the film franchise, each proving the rule of diminishing returns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/helenfielding\">Helen Fielding\u2019s</a> perfect novel, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this week, has, in its afterlife, suffered a double-pronged attack more demeaning than Bridget being harangued about her lovelife over a turkey curry buffet.</p> <p>It is as true as it is a truism to say that books written by women about women are generally seen as niche fluff while those written by men about men are big manly literature. So <a href=\"http://www.jaymcinerney.com/\">Jay McInerney</a>, say, can write about obnoxious Manhattan people and his books will be celebrated as literary events. But Fielding, at least McInerney\u2019s equal as a social satirist, writes a book about an English woman and it is treated by critics as an indulgence for the ladies, one they can\u2019t ignore due to its enormous success, but not something that needs to be taken seriously. This isn\u2019t limited to books, of course. As <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women\">Emily Nussbaum wrote</a> on Bridget\u2019s contemporary, Sex And The City, \u201cwhile The Sopranos has ascended to TV\u2019s Mt Olympus, the reputation of Sex And The City has shrunk and faded... The assumption that anything stylised (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.\u201d Emphasis on the feminine, I\u2019d argue.</p> <p>But critical disdain is no surprise. Far more disheartening for me is to hear young women dismiss the book. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bridget-jones-s-diary.html\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary</a> is probably my favourite book, equalled only by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Heartburn-VMC-Nora-Ephron/dp/1844085171\">Nora Ephron\u2019s novel</a> about divorce, Heartburn, which has been similarly dismissed over the years as semi-autobiographical froth (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview33\">Ephron wrote in 2004</a>, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that over the years the words \u2018thinly disguised\u2019 are applied mostly to books written by women... I managed to convert an event that seemed to me hideously tragic at the time to a comedy \u2013 and if that\u2019s not fiction I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d) Yet when I recommend it to women in their teens and 20s the response is generally a look that says, \u201cYeah, alright, grandma, welcome to the 21st century.\u201d The reason why has been articulated in thousands of blogs and columns by young female writers, expressing bewilderment at Bridget\u2019s repeated desire for marriage and her calorie counting. \u201cI don\u2019t think like this and therefore I don\u2019t like this,\u201d is the general conclusion.</p> <p>It is true that Bridget and her neuroses are out of step with today. No one would accuse her of being woke. But the idea that you have to think like the heroine in order to enjoy the novel is a tad limiting. Most women today don\u2019t think like Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, but I\u2019d still recommend giving that book a spin. It feels faintly akin to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Must_Fall\">Rhodes Must Fall</a> hoo-ha from last year and other similar protests which argue, essentially, that if an artist or piece of art does not accord with modern values it has no value at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/13/hillary-clinton-parks-and-recreation-hadley-freeman\">Don't like Hillary Clinton? You need to watch Parks And Recreation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If young women feel they need to be like Bridget to get the book, it is most likely because older women have told them precisely that. \u201cI literally was Bridget!\u201d, they cry, just as they once were literally <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0018417/\">Carrie Bradshaw</a>, or Lizzy Bennet, or whatever self-infantilising humblebrag of a literary comparison they find. Sure, it\u2019s nice to feel you have a literary alter ego. But the idea that you need to find one in order to enjoy a piece of art is one I only ever hear in relation to women. After all, not a man on this earth has ever said, \u201cGod, I am sooooo not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_Wooster\">Bertie Wooster</a>. He presents a really terrible view of men. Bog off, Wodehouse!\u201d</p> <p>People always rebel against the generation immediately before, which is why Bridget Jones is considered embarrassingly retro but Jane Austen is apparently totally relatable. When I bought the book when I was 18 I didn\u2019t relate to Bridget at all. But I immediately loved it because it took me out of the anxious, virginal, generally terrified of everything teenager I was and made me laugh. It took me out of myself, in other words, and it still does. Because when I read a novel, I want a story, not a mirror. To paraphrase Ephron, if that isn\u2019t proof of a good book, I don\u2019t know what is.</p>",

She\u2019s not really interested, and believes the existing evidence for Donald Trump\u2019s stupidity is ample.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t sarcasm!\u201d I say.</p> <p>My wife\u2019s silence carries the tacit implication that perhaps the most outrageous part of the story is not that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t understand how sarcasm works.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebff569110eebfc280d62078aa395e636d1188a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebff569110eebfc280d62078aa395e636d1188a4/942_142_1015_610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Benoit Jacques\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That night, I can\u2019t sleep because of the heat. Just before dawn, I get up and sit by the pool with my phone, but nothing is happening. I spend the morning waiting for Donald Trump to wake up and say stupid things. I look up sarcasm online, so I can be certain I know what it means. After lunch, exhausted, I fall asleep with a book on my face, not rising until the cocktail hour. \u201cI\u2019m so relaxed,\u201d I say. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s Wednesday already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Thursday,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cIs it?\u201d I say. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>Later that evening, the middle one texts to say that he\u2019s run out of money in Amsterdam, fully four days before his scheduled return. I spend an hour trying to transfer funds into his account while sitting at a beach restaurant, but it\u2019s dark and I haven\u2019t got my glasses, and I end up locking myself out of my online banking. Later still, when I cannot sleep again, I read about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-clinton-mental-stamina-florida-rally\">Donald Trump telling a Florida crowd how excited he was to be in Miami on a Friday night</a>. The crowd shouted back that it was Thursday, but he took no notice. I think: idiot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc4209fbaf3262f448c249258bea075e2b8a57c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc4209fbaf3262f448c249258bea075e2b8a57c9/16_25_885_1196/740.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Benoit Jacques\" width=\"740\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Over breakfast the next morning, while waiting for my bank\u2019s helpline to open, I review the previous day\u2019s stupidity. \u201cDonald Trump now says he was also being sarcastic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\">when he claimed that Obama literally founded Isis</a>,\u201d I say. No one at the table comments.</p> <p>\u201cAny more gold medals?\u201d my wife asks. Her question starts a lively conversation about the Olympics that leaves me behind.</p> <p>My wife\u2019s phone rings. I can tell from her bright hello that it\u2019s the youngest one calling from Italy. As she holds the phone to her ear, her smile fades and her eyes narrow. She seems to be focusing on the distant horizon. \u201cYou missed your flight?!\u201d she says. \u201cHow did you miss your flight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cDid he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d my wife says. \u201cGo back to the check-in desk and do your big eyes. You might have to cry a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love going on holiday without my children,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s so stress-free.\u201d</p> <p>Now that, I tell myself, is textbook sarcasm.</p>",
  "<p>There are a number of TV shows I\u2019ve fallen in \u2013 and then just as swiftly out of \u2013 love with over the years. I&#xa0;often make arbitrary lists (titles such as \u201cmost awful lead character\u201d or \u201cservices to eyewear\u201d, for example). One series that never budges from my \u201cbest titular character\u201d list is Channel 4\u2019s Ugly Betty. And that\u2019s almost entirely down to its star, played by Honduran-American actor America Ferrera. She\u2019s a ray of sunshine.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get straight to it: her name is not a big act of patriotism \u2013<a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/06/ugly-betty-america-ferrera\"> her due date fell on a Latin American holiday called the Day of the Americas</a> \u2013 and Ferrera, 32, didn\u2019t love it (she went by her middle name Georgine for years). I first saw her in her breakout role as Betty Suarez, the (\u201cTV-ugly\u201d) braces-and-spectacle-wearing outsider working at a fashion magazine. Betty was a star in the sitcom of her life and, in Ferrera, she shone. She made Betty into a wholesome rebel, the type of girl to root for, even in a garish technicolour soap world. For four seasons her face was the canvas on which the show painted an easy warmth, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/21/ugly-betty-the-beauty\">an intense sort of human kindness</a>.&#xa0;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/13/why-i-love-snoh-aalegra-band-bim-adewunmi\">Why I love... Snoh Aalegra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YuPO9EhEDI\">Natalie Flores in The Good Wife</a>, she showed even more depth, and a quiet strength. Ferrera\u2019s aura is thoughtful, and she has described herself as \u201cearnest\u201d \u2013 her brow furrows like a cliche school nerd, and her smile is disarmingly open. It makes me seek her out every time she\u2019s on screen. She\u2019s&#xa0;luminous.</p> <p>These days she\u2019s in the OK sitcom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZXnTZbF3g\">Superstore</a> but is excelling as a champion for Hillary Clinton and her presidential campaign (<a href=\"http://www.latina.com/entertainment/celebrity/america-ferrera-campaigns-hillary-clinton\">as she did back in 2008</a>). \u201cNot everybody looks at [the children of immigrants] and sees an investment,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8cFLME2Qw\">said at the Democratic national convention last month</a>. Ah, but luckily, some of us do.</p>"
