For the past 35 years, L\u00f3pez Rivera has been unable to fly, his wings clipped. He has been held in federal institutions, for 12 of those years totally alone inside a 6ft-by-9ft concrete box from which he had no view of the sky. The last time he saw a live butterfly, let alone a monarch, was in 1981.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera is one of the US\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, longest-serving political prisoners. Aged 73, he has spent more than half his life behind bars. He is convicted of killing no one, of hurting no one. His crime was \u201cseditious conspiracy\u201d \u2013 plotting against the US state in the furtherance of Puerto Rican independence. He still believes in what he calls that \u201cnoble cause\u201d: full sovereignty for his Caribbean birthplace that is classified as a US \u201cterritory\u201d.</p> <p>But his views on how to attain that goal have changed. Two decades ago he and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/cuba-us-thaw-fugitives-william-morales\">fellow Puerto Rican independence fighters</a> renounced violence and embraced peaceful political reform. The last year in which the militant group to which he belonged committed a violent act was 1983.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"758cc3c530694009b898016db0df5c89e43b96ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/758cc3c530694009b898016db0df5c89e43b96ca/262_0_3603_5391/668.jpg\" alt=\"The US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age ...

It is as though he is stuck in a time-warp, trapped for ever in the headstrong 1970s, a white-haired septuagenarian forced to dress up in floral shirt, flares and platform shoes dancing to Chic. The world, and L\u00f3pez Rivera with it, has moved on, but the US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age. </p> <p>Unless someone intervenes to release him, he will remain in captivity until 26 June 2023, five months after his 80th birthday. Fortunately for L\u00f3pez Rivera, there is such a person who holds the power of clemency: Barack Obama. As the US president prepares to quit the White House, he is drawing up his final pardon list, presenting the prisoner with a slender hope.</p> <p>Many prominent supporters are lobbying hard for the pardon. They make for an impressive list: Archbishop Desmond Tutu; the governor of Puerto Rico, <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/opinion/columnas/terrehauteindiana-columna-1868644/\">Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla</a>; the Hispanic caucus of the US Congress; former US president Jimmy Carter; Democratic presidential runner-up <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/05/18/bernie-sanders-vows-pardon-faln-terrorist/\">Bernie Sanders</a>; and the creator of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/Interstitial/?oasSitePage=elnuevodia.com/interstitial&amp;oasReturnPage=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/obamaatiendepedidodelinmanuelsobreoscarlopez-2175040/\">confronted Obama</a> about L\u00f3pez Rivera face to face during a recent White House visit. On 9 October thousands of supporters gathered outside the White House bearing placards of the prisoner and calling on Obama to set him free, their voices projected across the mansion\u2019s South Lawn in the hope that the president at work in the Oval Office might hear them and act accordingly.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With friends like that, isn\u2019t L\u00f3pez Rivera a shoo-in for release? Not according to the man himself, who remains cautious about his chances. \u201cI do not practise wishful thinking,\u201d he begins in perfect English, delivered with a strong Puerto Rican accent. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to read President Obama. The way he has been treated, the obstacles he has faced in the White House, makes him a little skittish about decisions.\u201d</p> <p>What a carefully weighted remark about something as visceral as his freedom. In the course of a two-hour phone conversation (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Penitentiary,_Terre_Haute\">federal prison in Terre Haute</a>, Indiana, having refused to allow the Guardian to visit him in person) it becomes clear that this is not artifice: the professorial tone is true to the man.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera says he draws some optimism from Obama\u2019s frequent expressions of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25250278\">admiration for Nelson Mandela</a>. \u201cHe embraced Mandela as a great man, he saw that what Mandela did was important throughout the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ddc06d448b2de372dd5ee68c69649d344063f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ddc06d448b2de372dd5ee68c69649d344063f7/0_73_801_802/499.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is no regret inside my heart\u2019 ...

Mandela served 27 years in South African prisons for leading an anti-colonialist liberation struggle that deployed selective violence as a political tool; L\u00f3pez Rivera has already served eight years longer, arguably for doing the same thing. Mandela <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/mandela-and-the-question-of-violence/282255/\">refused to renounce violence</a> from his prison cell; but L\u00f3pez Rivera did so, some 20 years ago.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera was born in 1943 in San Sebasti\u00e1n in the north-west of Puerto Rico. His childhood was spent living in the constitutional limbo that has defined the island since it was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Neither a sovereign country, nor the 51st state of the union, Puerto Rico is caught betwixt and between. Its people are US citizens, hold US passports, and can be drafted into the US military as L\u00f3pez Rivera would soon discover. Yet when it comes to voting for the US president or a representative in the US Congress, a Puerto Rican is persona non grata. Quite rich, you might think, coming from a nation such as the US, which was founded upon the anti-colonial principle of no taxation without representation.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing we are good for is to be cannon fodder,\u201d L\u00f3pez Rivera says in a rare display of chagrin. </p> <p>Not that he had a clue about any of that when he was growing up in San Sebasti\u00e1n and Chicago, where his family moved when he was 14. He was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of self-determination or shrugging off the Yankee yoke were as alien as nuclear physics. \u201cBefore I got drafted I was a happy-go-lucky Puerto Rican. I enjoyed life. I wasn\u2019t paying attention to anything other than me.\u201d</p> <p>Then along came Vietnam. \u201cI arrived thinking we were bringing freedom to Vietnamese people but as soon as I hit the ground I realised that wasn\u2019t happening. We did sweeping operations lasting 30 days, getting villagers out of their homes, moving them off the rice paddies, body-searching them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6ee2197aacaa84df8412c45c149fb2e11ca3af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6ee2197aacaa84df8412c45c149fb2e11ca3af/68_0_551_331/500.jpg\" alt=\"In solitary he would spend all but two hours a week in his cell with no sight of the sky ... a mural dedicated to L\u00f3pez Rivera in Puerto Rico\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In solitary he would spend all but two hours a week in his cell with no sight of the sky \u2026 a mural dedicated to L\u00f3pez Rivera in Puerto Rico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time he returned to Chicago a year later, sporting a Bronze Star for meritorious achievement, he says he had undergone a transformation. \u201cI felt an obligation to change, to look at life from a totally different perspective. Now I could see what colonialism did to people.\u201d</p> <p>He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago. That brought him into contact with the families of imprisoned nationalists and, without ever suspecting that he would one day join their ranks, he was sucked into the movement and eventually became a member of the clandestine <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/FALN\">Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional</a>.</p> <p>As the name suggested, the FALN believed armed force was justified as a means to an end. Between its foundation in 1974 and its effective demise in 1983 as a result of mass arrests, the FALN was said by prosecutors to have carried out about 140 bombings on military bases, government offices and financial buildings across the US, especially in Chicago and New York. Targets were chosen for being symbols of \u201cYankee imperialism\u201d, such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera insists that the focus was always on bricks and mortar, not people. \u201cFor me human life is sacred. We called it \u2018armed propaganda\u2019 \u2013 using targets to draw attention to our struggle.\u201d</p> <p>That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent. In 1975 the group claimed responsibility for a <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/puerto-rican-terrorists-plant-bomb-tavern-1975-article-1.2484977\">bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern</a> in Lower Manhattan, the scene of George Washington\u2019s farewell to troops after the American revolution. The attack killed four people and injured more than 50. Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera has denied involvement with these fatal attacks. But when I asked him if he ever committed acts of armed force such as planting a bomb, he replied: \u201cI cannot comment on that.\u201d Interestingly, he still claims justification for violence under international law, using the present tense: \u201cI believe we were adhering to international law that says that colonialism is a crime against humanity and that colonial people have a right to achieve self-determination by any means, including force. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f4e4c3ef846b0e78866da991667e19dc4ac2be4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f4e4c3ef846b0e78866da991667e19dc4ac2be4/7_0_3249_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene after the FALN bomb exploded at the Fraunces Tavernin Lower Manhattan, on 24 January 1975.

By 1990, the movement was already changing with the times. \u201cWe realised other tactics to armed force could be more effective, mobilising people through peaceful campaigning. Morally, also, we came to see that we had to lead by example, that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do. You cannot get a better world by being unjust yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask him if he would pose a threat to the public were Obama to set him free, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could be a threat. We have transcended violence \u2013 it\u2019s crucial for people to understand, we\u2019re not advocating anything that would be a threat to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He was picked up in 1981 at a traffic stop in Chicago and charged with seditious conspiracy \u2013 a very rare count of plotting against the US state that was first used after the civil war against southern refuseniks and then applied to anarchists and socialists before being turned against Puerto Rican <em>independistas </em>like himself. </p> <p>At trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that tied him to any deaths or injuries, or even specific attacks. For his part, he and his comrades refused to recognise the judicial process, calling himself a prisoner of war, offering no defence and declining even to attend the trial. He still describes seditious conspiracy as an \u201cimpossible crime\u201d. He told me: \u201cHow can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the US state when we never had any part in electing a US government?\u201d</p> <p>He was sentenced to 55 years. By contrast, as his lawyer Jan Susler has pointed out, the average federal sentence for murder in 1981 was 10.3 years. Later, his sentence was extended to 70 years when, he insists, he was framed by agents provocateurs planted in his cell who cooked up a plot to escape and then implicated him in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a24b14cc9a0a6848842f2825916138513ef5872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a24b14cc9a0a6848842f2825916138513ef5872/34_0_1980_1188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00f3pez Rivera was one of two dozen independistas in prison.

Not for L\u00f3pez Rivera. He recounts his time in prison with verve bordering on enthusiasm. Yes, he has faced \u201cterrible times\u201d, been labelled a terrorist by prison guards, called a \u201cspic\u201d and worse. But he has always made use of his life of incarceration, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first got to prison I made myself a promise: they can lock me up, but the time I spend in prison is my time. I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals. From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active.\u201d</p> <p>That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching, pull- and push-ups, sidewinders and upper body routines. He reads a lot. Currently, he\u2019s reading Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism, and before that he devoured the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer\u2019s book on billionaire rightwing donors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/dark-money-review-nazi-oil-the-koch-brothers-and-a-rightwing-revolution\">Dark Money</a>.</p> <p>He teaches other inmates to read and write or speak Spanish. He also likes to paint as a way of \u201ctaking myself out of prison into the outside world\u201d. He uses as his template photographs of landscapes or seascapes that he tears from magazines, making up for his lack of access to the natural world.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/cuba-us-thaw-fugitives-william-morales\">Cuba-US thaw brings fate of cold war-era fugitives on the island into focus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He caught the painting bug after the alleged escape plot when he was put into solitary confinement in two of the toughest supermax prisons in the US: Marion, Illinois, and Florence, Colorado. He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky. \u201cLittle by little, colours start to fade. Your eyes begin to change how you see things. You see less colour; everything blurs into the yellow-grey of the cell walls.\u201d</p> <p>So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life. That\u2019s when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration. \u201cI had to be strong. I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation. At its peak, he was one of two dozen <em>independistas </em>in federal prisons; now he is the last one. Over the years, he has seen his comrades walk free, their ranks gradually depleted, until in 2010 he became the only one left. He is sanguine about that. \u201cI have never felt abandoned or lonely. There is no regret inside my heart.\u201d</p> <p>To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009. In August 1999, Bill Clinton did what L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s supporters are now urging Obama to do: he used his final days in office to grant <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces2000/stories/faln091199.htm\">a presidential pardon to 11 Puerto Rican independence fighters</a>. L\u00f3pez Rivera was offered a lesser deal that would have seen him released after a decade, but he turned it down, because he says he had no faith in the US government sticking to its side of the bargain and he was unhappy about a couple of his fellow fighters being offered no commutation at all. \u201cWhen I was in Vietnam I never left anyone behind. That\u2019s not my practice, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de084da1ab7a5db52da7ffe9313f7db6f9f2e26d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de084da1ab7a5db52da7ffe9313f7db6f9f2e26d/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018How can an insect so small go so far?\u2019 ... a monarch butterfly.

I believe in principles. For me, the decision was the one I had to make.\u201d</p> <p>So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton\u2019s footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors? One factor in Obama\u2019s calculation might be that Clinton\u2019s round of pardons sparked a fireball of opposition in Congress and the media. The \u201cClinton terror pardons\u201d remain a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120277819085260827\">bugbear</a> <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/06/04/still-blocking-the-truth/\">for the right</a> to this day, even though the vitriol overlooks one awkward fact about the releases: that not a single criminal act has been committed by any of the 11 former FALN militants in the 16 years that they have been out.</p> <p>The Clinton backlash perhaps explains Obama\u2019s apparent ambivalence on the matter. He is reported to have told Lin-Manuel Miranda that L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s clemency petition was <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/obamaatiendepedidodelinmanuelsobreoscarlopez-2175040/\">\u201con his desk\u201d.</a> But Congress member Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and has been a leading proponent of a pardon, has said that when he asked Obama about the account the president firmly <a href=\"http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/09/05/why-obama-lied-to-lin-manuel-miranda-an-interview-with-puerto-rican-congressman-luis-gutierrez-calling-to-demonstrate/\">disputed it</a> and gave a bland statement that \u201cprocedures must be followed\u201d.</p> <p>That sounds less than promising for the Mandela of Puerto Rico. But L\u00f3pez Rivera responds to the mixed messages emanating from the White House with trademark composure. \u201cI have no choice but to be optimistic,\u201d he says, as the Terre Haute guards call time on our conversation. \u201cHope, that is one thing we can never lose.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On 7 October, as the political world convulsed from the revelation that Trump had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragged about kissing and groping women</a> without their consent, Cathy Heller, 63, was sitting in her New York home fielding incredulous emails from a friend.</p> <p>\u201cI keep thinking about how he treated you,\u201d her friend wrote, hours after showing Heller the tape. \u201cObviously not an isolated incident.\u201d</p> <p>It was a story Heller had told many friends and family members over the years, but is only now telling in public.

But in speaking out about her experience, Heller joins <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/trump-women-accusers/\">eight other women</a> who have publicly accused Trump of inappropriate come-ons, touching, or kissing over the past several decades. The allegations have opened a chasm within the Republican party as the presidential campaign enters the crucial final weeks, and have inspired Trump to issue a series of fulminating denials. This week, Trump called some of the women who have accused him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/13/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-election-clinton-obama\">horrible, horrible liars</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Heller does not believe Trump\u2019s many accusers are lying. </p> <p>Their alleged encounter took place almost two decades ago \u2013 Heller believes the year was 1997 and she was at a Mother\u2019s Day brunch \u2013 at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. Heller, her husband, her three children and her in-laws were among dozens of families seated at big round tables in what she and a relative who spoke to the Guardian recall was an open lobby.</p> <p>Trump made the rounds greeting members of his club. When he stopped at their table, Heller recalled, and her mother-in-law introduced her, she stood and extended her hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,\u201d she claimed. </p> <p>Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Oh, come on.\u2019 He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.\u201d She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. \u201cHe kept me there for a little too long,\u201d Heller said. \u201cAnd then he just walked away.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI was angry and shaken,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe was pissed. He couldn\u2019t believe a woman would pass up the opportunity.\u201d She added that he seemed to feel \u201centitled\u201d to kiss her. </p> <p>The Guardian heard accounts that matched Heller\u2019s from two other people: Susan Klein, the friend who was emailing with Heller, and a relative seated at the table with Heller that day. The relative, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, recalled that Heller sat back down with a stunned look on her face.</p> <p>\u201cI remember she was really freaked out,\u201d said the relative. The relative didn\u2019t see Heller\u2019s entire interaction with Trump, but saw him get \u201cin her face\u201d and saw Heller pull away. \u201cHe was very forceful \u2026 She really was definitely affected by this man who was very aggressive toward her.\u201d</p> <p>Heller and the relative both recalled that no one at the table quite knew how to react. \u201cI was shook up,\u201d said Heller.

Heller met Clinton briefly at a March fundraiser, and in January she donated the individual maximum of $2,700 to Clinton\u2019s campaign. She believes she has also attended a party where the Clintons were present.</p> <p>In addition, her husband\u2019s family is involved in a years-long effort to recover initiation fees that her late in-laws paid to join Mar-A-Lago. The club\u2019s rules state that the fees are refundable under certain circumstances when an individual is no longer a member, and Heller has placed at least one phone call to a club manager attempting to recover the money, totaling several thousand dollars.</p> <p>But Heller says her encounter with Trump predates that effort.</p> <p>\u201cMy motivations for speaking,\u201d she said, are to show \u201cit\u2019s not \u2018just talk\u2019\u201d, as Trump has claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s action.\u201d</p> <p>Klein, Heller\u2019s friend and neighbor, told the Guardian that she had heard the story long before the tape surfaced.</p> <p>Klein said she learned about Heller\u2019s alleged brush with Trump in the summer of 2015. It was shortly after Trump launched his run for the presidency, and Heller confided her story to the ladies\u2019 Mahjong group the women both belong to near their homes in New York. Klein recounted Heller\u2019s telling of story to the Guardian in similar detail.<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd when this tape came out, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because it was exactly what he said he did and had done to Cathy,\u201d Klein said.</p> <p>Klein forwarded a breaking news alert to Heller on 7 October, the day news of the tape broke. \u201cYou were one of Trump\u2019s victims,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe said when he sees a pretty woman, he just kisses her, he doesn\u2019t even wait.\u201d</p> <p>Later that night, Heller replied: \u201cThe stories coming out go so well with how he treated me!\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Trump campaign denied the accusation. \u201cThere is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother\u2019s Day at Mr Trump\u2019s resort,\u201d spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. \u201cIt would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is this: for the media to wheel out a politically motivated Democratic activist with a legal dispute against this same resort owned by Mr Trump does a disservice to the public, and anyone covering this story should be embarrassed for elevating this bogus claim.\u201d</p> <p>Heller said that besides her January donation to Clinton, she had \u201calso bought a woman\u2019s card from Hillary,\u201d alluding to <a href=\"https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/the-woman-card\">a $5 card</a> sold by the campaign after Trump accused his rival of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-woman-card-middle-east\">constantly playing the woman card</a>\u201d. </p> <p>She added that although she supports Clinton, she is not an activist \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve never done any work for the Democratic Party\u201d \u2013 and that she is not pursuing any legal action against Mar-A-Lago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787359730465329152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing ever happened with any of these women.

For many, the tipping point came the Sunday night after the tape\u2019s release, in Trump\u2019s second presidential debate with Clinton. Pressed by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper to say whether he touched women without their consent, Trump denied that he had.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I did not,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understood what was said.

But she declined to tell her story on the record.</p> <p>What ultimately swayed Heller to tell her story publicly, she said, were Trump\u2019s own denials. Hearing the tape, she said, made her feel \u201cvalidated and vindicated\u201d. But it was Trump\u2019s denials at Sunday night\u2019s debate that convinced her to speak up.</p> <p>\u201cHe said this is just talk, but it\u2019s not just talk,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThis was him.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has formed an axis with the French government and the US secretary of state to consider the longer-term viability of imposing a no-bombing zone in Syria.</p> <p>The proposition, which is still thought to lack significant support within the White House and Downing Street, is to be discussed along with plans for tougher economic sanctions against Russia at a meeting on Sunday in London attended by John Kerry, Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, and leading Gulf states backing the Syrian opposition.</p> <p>The idea has gained traction with advisers to Hillary Clinton and been discussed in the national security council, but there is little enthusiasm in the Obama administration to take military measures. It is not clear the extent to which Johnson is advocating a no-bombing zone or merely pre-emptively canvassing the proposal before a change of US administration.</p> <p>Kerry will at Sunday\u2019s talks give a report back from an inconclusive meeting on Syria in Lausanne he held with Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan and some Gulf states, including Qatar. European Union foreign ministers did not attend the talks, partly due to Russian pressure, even though they have military assets fighting Islamic State in Syria.</p> <p>Kerry claimed fresh ideas had been discussed at the Lausanne meeting, which was also attended by the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura. Little substantive conclusions emerged to suggest any progress towards a new ceasefire or humanitarian access to the besieged city of eastern Aleppo.</p> <p>The Russian foreign ministry said: \u201cThe Russian side stressed that the guarantee for the restoration and successful implementation of the ceasefire regime and ensuring humanitarian access to all those in need is the separation of moderate opposition\u2019s units from the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (al-Nusra) militants and other affiliated terrorist groups.\u201d</p> <p>The west, the Syrian government and the Russians regard al-Nusra as a terrorist group linked to al-Qaida, but many among Syrian opposition forces battling to keep the rebellion alive do not make the same distinction. De Mistura has claimed as few as 800 of the fighters in eastern Aleppo are al-Nusra, but the basis for this estimate is unclear.</p> <p>Johnson, speaking in the House of Commons this week, supported separation but said it was not realistic to expect eastern Aleppo fighters to disentangle themselves from al-Nusra in advance of a ceasefire. Turkey, which is currently enjoying warmer relations with Russia, has indicated it also wants the moderates to distance themselves from al-Nusra.</p> <p>Despite the talks, the Russian-backed Syrian government has continued to bombard Aleppo, and Iranian government news agencies claimed hundreds of Syrian fighters were now willing to give up their weapons in exchange for a safe passage out of the city. The Syrian government is determined to crush the rebellion in Aleppo, the second city of Syria, and then move on to other military targets.</p> <p>Johnson is being pressed by the Syrian opposition to realise that the west will make no diplomatic, let alone military, progress against Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, unless it puts the the credible threat of military leverage behind its diplomacy. It argues the ceaseless round of fruitless diplomatic discussions is being used by Russia and the Syrians to move towards outright military victory.</p> <p>A no-bombing zone would cover the whole of Syria and would prohibit bombing from all aircraft. Monitoring would be conducted by existing western assets in the region, with any breach of the ceasefire leading to a reprisal on Syrian, not Russian targets, such as air runways or regime installations.</p> <p>Monitoring would not require overflights or any pre-emptive military strikes against Syrian air defence systems, it is claimed. The Syrian moderates claim the proposal would ensure delivery of humanitarian aid to stem the loss of 200 lives a week, the implementation of UN security council resolutions and the combatting of extremism by removing radicalising factors, including the lack of civilian protection by the west.</p> <p>Syrian opposition forces, faced by the claim that such a measure would inevitably provoke a Russian military response, argue Russia itself would not be attacked, and previous threatened military strikes by the west against the Syrian government led to a political, not military response by Russia.</p> <p>The Syrian opposition, still excluded from both Saturday and Sunday\u2019s talks, claim the measure would be legal since there is an overwhelming humanitarian need, a lack of alternatives and the action would be deemed both necessary and proportionate.</p>",

Frey said that although Romney won both constituencies in 2012, President Obama held a slight edge among college-educated white women.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s path to the White House relies heavily on maximizing turnout among non-college-educated white men to deliver wins in the Rust Belt states. </p> <p>He has firmly embraced this constituency, stoking the fires of a working-class revolt with his populist appeal. \u201cWe won with poorly educated,\u201d the Wharton School of business graduate <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0\">bragged at a rally</a> after winning the Nevada caucuses. \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>But in the process of appealing to this demographic group, Trump has pushed away white voters with a college degree who are more likely to view immigration and global trade \u2013 issues that have animated his campaign \u2013 as positive forces, said Michelle Diggles, a senior policy analyst at Third Way, a liberal thinktank that examined the splintering of white voters.</p> <p>\u201cWhite people with a college degree are much more likely to be optimistic about their own lives,\u201d Diggles said. \u201cThey tend to think they have efficacy, that they\u2019re in control of their own life and that they can successfully or relatively successfully navigate the forces that are transforming our society and economy much better.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.thirdway.org/publishing/attachments/files/000/000/935/December_2015_National_Poll_of_Registered_Voters.pdf?1453831785\">survey</a> conducted by Third Way found that more than half of white voters without a college education believed the economy was rigged. By contrast, nearly half of college-educated white voters said they believed it was not. Similarly, 45% of non-college-educated whites said the deck was stacked against people like them, while only 29% of college-educated white voters agreed with the sentiment.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Diggles added: \u201cWhite people without a college degree are much more likely to see a rigged system, to see the forces of globalization acting against them and they don\u2019t feel like they have control over their own destiny.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory Rosenthal, a retina surgeon and a member of <a href=\"http://www.r4c16.org/\">Republicans for Clinton</a>, is deeply disdainful of Trump\u2019s anti-intellectual appeal to uneducated voters\u2019 fears and anxieties and equally critical of the GOP nominee\u2019s apparent want for complex ideas and speech. <br></p> <p>\u201cTrump is an imbecile like the fictitious Chauncey Gardiner, supported by a rogues\u2019 gallery of cynics hoping to control him,\u201d Rosenthal wrote in an emailed response, making reference to the lead character in the 1979 movie Being There.</p> <p>Rosenthal described his gradual split with the Republican party over its nominee as a \u201cslow motion spiral into a dark hole\u201d and that nothing Trump does at this point could win back his vote.</p> <p> This isn\u2019t the first time he has supported a Democratic nominee, however.

  "<p>The longer an American has stayed in school, the more likely he or she is to register to vote and to cast a ballot on election day. </p> <p>At one extreme, in the 2012 presidential election just 21.6% of adults who left school before ninth grade voted. At the other, according to statistics from the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2012/tables.html\">Census Bureau</a>, 74.7% of adults who had an advanced degree voted.

In terms of shaping outcomes in 2016, though, it\u2019s not just turnout that matters \u2013 the way educational status tends to align with party inclination counts too.</p> <p>Again, the results are pretty clear. The Democratic party is preferred by college graduates, even though as recently as 2002 that was not the case. That\u2019s partly because non-white Americans now make up a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/05/09/hispanic-high-school-graduates-pass-whites-in-rate-of-college-enrollment/\">larger share</a> of the college population, and those voters are less likely to be Republican.</p> <p>This election has been dominated by headlines about the non-college educated white Americans who form Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s support base. In 2012, about 55% of that demographic group showed up to vote, and 60% voted Republican.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3ca6ab1b6d8bc3b3501b67f0cfd863924c7f119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3ca6ab1b6d8bc3b3501b67f0cfd863924c7f119/0_0_420_714/294.jpg\" alt=\"Educational status and voting\" width=\"294\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To understand how those people might affect this election, consider a few different hypothetical scenarios:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Non-college educated whites are no less likely to be Republican in 2016 and 100% of them show up to vote \u2013 which, let\u2019s face it, would never happen. According to polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-swing-the-election/\">calculations</a>, Hillary Clinton would still narrowly win, by two percentage points. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Non-college educated white people are no more likely to vote, but 98% of those who do vote, vote for Trump \u2013 which, again, is never going to happen. Trump would win by a landslide of 27%. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Now consider a more realistic final hypothesis. Non-college educated white people become a little more Republican and a little more likely to vote \u2013 let\u2019s suggest that turnout rises to 65% from 55% and Republican vote share rises to 70% from 60%. Trump would win the White House with 52% of the national vote.</p> <p>All of these scenarios, however, assume that nothing else has changed since 2012 \u2013 that other educational groups like college graduates and other racial groups show up in the same numbers, with the same voting intentions, as they did four years ago.

Absolutely the worst human being.\u201d Kelly, however, was one of the few non-Republicans. He was there, with a union jack T-shirt, as part of the evening\u2019s entertainment, playing in a Beatles tribute band, Liverpool Legends. </p> <p>From humble roots in Yorba Linda, Nixon rose to become Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s vice-president. He narrowly lost the presidency to John Kennedy in 1960, and then lost a bid to be California\u2019s governor, but bounced back in 1968 to win the White House. He escalated, then ended, the war in Vietnam and opened relations with Mao\u2019s China. A landslide re-election in 1972 gave way to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\"> Watergate</a>, when spying on political foes, and covering it up, forced his resignation. In his final years, he clawed back respect as an \u00e9minence grise, but never escaped the shadow of disgrace.</p> <p>The library opened in 1990 with fanfare and controversy.

In 1962, after losing California\u2019s gubernatorial election, Nixon waxed petulant: \u201cYou don\u2019t have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference.\u201d</p> <p>And in 1974, upon leaving the White House, he pledged greatness despite defeat. \u201cWe think that when we lose an election, we think that when we suffer a defeat, that all is ended,\u201d he said. \u201cNot true.

  "<p>America\u2019s most likely next first family are retracing familiar steps. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, the road to the White House has taken her to a masonic shrine in Pennsylvania where she spoke during her 2008 primary campaign. Some 250 miles west, husband Bill begins a bus tour for her through Ohio by following the route of a trip in his 1992 presidential campaign. Two hours east, their daughter has just done her bit at a rally in the suburbs of Philadelphia where she brought her mother-in-law and breastfeeding son along to watch.</p> <p>Chelsea was 12 years old when the family last moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and there is a mounting sense of excitement that \u2013 if recent polling is to be believed \u2013 her parents could soon be back, with roles reversed. After a disastrous week of mishaps for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, the Clintons are campaigning hard in his blue-collar heartland in the hope of blocking off their opponent\u2019s path to the grandest of Washington addresses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99dbb722982c2277e6edb99379490f261dbda552\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99dbb722982c2277e6edb99379490f261dbda552/673_88_2510_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somebody\u2019s daughter: Chelsea Clinton campaigning at Haverford, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somebody\u2019s daughter: Chelsea Clinton campaigning at Haverford, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie-James Medina/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a complicated domestic routine. Bill will spend the night on his own at Youngstown\u2019s Courtyard Marriott, watching the vice-presidential debate and then reading until late to finish a book on the American civil war. Though they both travel with a vast retinue of advisers, reporters and guards, it doesn\u2019t stop Bill\u2019s bus getting a puncture and Hillary\u2019s convoy getting lost as they both hurry to make it home together the following evening. Hillary, who only finished a course of antibiotics for pneumonia three weeks ago, won\u2019t make it back to their house in the leafy New York commuter village of Chappaqua until midnight.</p> <p>But this is what they do. Even Chelsea is being groomed into the family business. Before speaking outside Philly, she was introduced by her mother as \u201can expert on healthcare\u201d, the same subject that established Hillary\u2019s reputation as a fearsome public policy wonk. Bill interjects rather more clumsily on the issue now, and has to spend the week modifying some overly blunt criticism of Obamacare that embarrasses his wife\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>Blending the personal and the political works well for mother and daughter, though. They next take a question from <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161009_Sen__Leach_s_daughter__Not_a_Clinton__plant__at_Haverford_event.html\">Brennan Leach</a>, a 15-year-old child actor in the audience who just happens to be the daughter of a local senator.

The 42nd president makes clear he already feels like he\u2019s slipping back into a warm bath. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in my very own TV show, or maybe a movie,\u201d says Bill Clinton as he strolls past a phalanx of cameras into a barbershop in Youngstown during the second day of the bus tour.</p> <p>Later that afternoon at an organising office in Warren, he meets a volunteer for his wife\u2019s campaign.

Clinton also ducks a question about a recent Donald Trump allegation that Hillary has been cheating on Bill. \u201cHe should run his campaign, and she\u2019ll run hers,\u201d he tells a reporter who brings it up on the first day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need answers not anger, says Bill as a Trump supporter is led out of the meeting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harder to ignore are the angry placards along the roadside in this struggling manufacturing region. \u201cWhere are all the jobs Bill?\u201d reads one, a question to which he has long, prepared answers to prove he feels their pain.</p> <p>During a stop at an Italian restaurant, he diverts to the kitchen to quiz staff on how much they earn.

Soon there were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/notokay?src=hash\">millions of women telling stories</a>, often stories they\u2019d never told anyone before, often involving walking home from school, or dancing at music festivals, or the kinds of men you were meant to call \u201cUncle\u201d. Oxford said she was receiving two replies a second. \u201cAnyone denying rape culture,\u201d she wrote, \u201cplease look at my timeline now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Men are oblivious to the Jaws theme each woman hears when travelling alone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is the woman who was 10 when a man with a coat over his arm groped her at a museum. The woman who was 14 when an optician dropped a contact lens down her blouse and stroked her breast. The woman who remembers a man cupping her arse when she was in the queue for ice cream at Disneyland. The effect of reading all of these tiny stories one by one is cumulative. You stand up, eventually. You get off the bus with eyes glassy and an ache behind your ribs and you walk through a group of commuters carrying your phone in one hand and in the other despair. And then you order coffee, tell the guy your name, and smile, without teeth.</p> <p>While Oxford\u2019s feed isn\u2019t shocking to a single woman, it is clearly different for men, some of whom seem to have been oblivious to the <em>Jaws</em> theme each woman hears when travelling alone. Most came open-armed, including the Republicans denouncing Trump because they have daughters, granddaughters. Which, with respect, misses the point slightly. While feminist awakenings (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Jeb Bush</a> may not have identified his as such) must be welcomed, doesn\u2019t a sentiment like that expose the lack of empathy they must have had before; their inability to recognise a woman unless in relation to a man? A meme circulated a couple of years ago, shortening \u201cShe\u2019s someone\u2019s daughter\u201d to \u201cShe\u2019s someone\u201d. It seems crucial that in order for anything to change, these fathers and grandfathers need to realise that earlier.</p> <p>As so often happens when I read women\u2019s personal stories of abuse, I\u2019m shocked at how unshocked I am. There is nothing new here. We\u2019ve smelled this gas for years, but every so often somebody like Oxford strikes a match, and fires start. You realise something, if you carry on reading, ignoring the feeling of having cycled into a bin lorry and then having rubbish dumped on your scuffed and moaning body. You realise how many stories you have told yourself throughout your life to pretend everything is OK. How much you have been expected to ignore, and how much you have glossed over, or laughed at, or pretended was totally, completely fine. \u201cMy fifth assault,\u201d continued Oxford, some time later, \u201cAge 15, at hospital for anxiety &amp; heart palpitations. shirt is off for ekg, 2 Drs, not my Drs, stop &amp; stare. 1 winks at me.\u201d</p> <p>Things in the cold light of adulthood reveal themselves as, if not technically assault, then certainly a cousin. But they\u2019ve been refiled as sassy anecdotes, or stories about the oddness of men. I had and have a beautiful life, and yet, like all women to different degrees, it\u2019s been lived to a muted soundtrack of powerlessness. Reading Oxford\u2019s feed, I remembered the ice-cream van outside school, the man who would give us broken lollies if we climbed inside and sat on his knee. I remembered walking home through the woods, and my friend shouting \u201cRUN\u201d when she saw a man with his coat open standing beside a tree. When we were called out of our French lesson to talk to the police, we told the other girls about it with pride \u2013 the story had been spun in our heads so there was something affirming about the fact that a hooded man had chosen us. Us! It wasn\u2019t fear we learned, it was something worse \u2013 we learned to laugh at the men who snuck their fingers up your top on a busy train, or shouted comments about your school uniform from cars. As adults, an accumulation of expectations of what a woman is for led to many anecdotes between friends about \u201cbad dates\u201d, \u201cbad sex\u201d, being playfully strangled, ejaculated on, left behind.</p> <p>Women walk into relationships now with virtual keys clenched in their fists, as if forever walking home on a dark night.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

  "<p>Three episodes into the new season of Saturday Night Live, and the show, like many media outlets, is learning to navigate this most unusual political season. Historically, what made SNL\u2019s campaign coverage so necessary was its ability to highlight the subtle absurdities of the election and exaggerate the ridiculous. Needless to say, the 2016 presidential election could never be accused of subtlety, forcing<em> </em>SNL to take a page from some of its fellow late-night shows and move into more blatant commentary.</p> <p>In its obligatory debate cold open, a weary Anderson Cooper (Alex Moffat) and Martha Raddatz (Cecily Strong) did shots as they introduced the \u201cthe worst ever presidential debate\u201d. Alec Baldwin returned as Donald Trump, and Kate McKinnon was introduced by the moderators as: \u201cCan we say this yet?\u201d \u201cProbably fine.\u201d \u201cPresident Hillary Clinton.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/no-groping-for-laughs-as-alec-baldwin-nails-trump-on-saturday-night-live\">No groping for laughs as Baldwin nails Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baldwin\u2019s Trump is still mostly facial expressions and excruciating pauses \u2013 more mimicry then genuine impression \u2013 while McKinnon\u2019s Clinton feels lived-in and comfortable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf_BGqEfMs0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pf_BGqEfMs0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The sketch included some classic SNL elements, imitating the candidates\u2019 awkward staging during the town hall debate, and brilliantly turning their decision not to shake hands into an awkward dance. But when McKinnon\u2019s Clinton mocked the idea she would be intimidated by women like Paula Jones in the audience, the joke felt more like a Samantha Bee quip than an SNL<em> </em>line. It was a little jarring, but ultimately this shift could be a good thing; SNL has many funny people at its disposal with many varied strengths, and it will help them immensely to shake up even something as traditional as a debate satire.</p> <p>Emily Blunt was a strong host, an immensely talented actor who was down for anything and flitted easily between melodramatic, goofy, sexy, and sweet. Unfortunately, her monologue was another musical number, this time a take on \u201cGet Happy!\u201d to cheer things up in the face of a grim news cycle. There were puppies and cookies, and while it was cute and chipper, it was immediately forgettable.</p> <p>The first post-monologue sketch was, dispiritingly, about two hookers; the joke (helpfully summarized at the end of the sketch) was the duo\u2019s long list of rules and requirements.

It is against the party rules for ordinary members to speak about party matters.</p> <p>But Walter Villatora, president of Abbott\u2019s Warringah federal electorate conference who organised the convention, told the audience that arguments against reform on the grounds it would allow factions to exert more control were nonsense.</p> <p>\u201cCan someone explain to me how the opponents of democratic reform can think that it is easier to exert control over 8,000 members across the entire state than 165 members that have been appointed over many years?\u201d Villatora said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to get real and apply primary school maths.

  "<p>Top BBC executives past and present naturally think well of the BBC. So Roger Mosey, who might have been Tony Hall\u2019s number two if he hadn\u2019t chosen Selwyn College, Cambridge, instead, holds corporation custom and practice high as the final Trump crunch nears.</p> <p>\u201cPeople like me who spent decades in the BBC are used to ideas of impartiality and balance. When there\u2019s a general election in the UK, the stopwatch comes out and \u2026 each party is given an arithmetical allocation of airtime. You will hear equally from the Conservatives and Labour, and a specified amount less for the smaller parties,\u201d he tells readers of <em>Varsity</em>. \u201cIn the US, this kind of regulation disappeared decades ago; but even so there has traditionally been an attempt at \u2018fair\u2019 coverage\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Not any longer, Mosey fears. Trump, \u201ca brazen creator of news\u201d, has blown all that apart. \u201cI have, in my time as a journalist, sometimes been dismissive of regulators and what may appear to be a \u2018nanny state\u2019 approach to broadcasting in a time of unlimited digital choice. But what has happened in the US this year makes a formidable case for the kind of public broadcasting that remains strong in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Up to a point, Master Mosey. It\u2019s undeniable that, on TV especially, Trump has got away with policy murder, and that Fox News has become a macabre joke. But two events in the past few days seem to have decided this whole campaign.</p> <p>One is the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\" title=\"\">New York Times\u2019s publication of a Trump tax return</a> that reveals why and how he may have paid no federal taxes for 18 years. According to some, the decision to print this return broke American law \u2013 straightforwardly, deliberately, but for good purpose. Would the BBC, in the last reaches of an election or referendum campaign, have challenged its own legal advice quite so boldly?</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the foul tape of locker-room-bantering Trumpism that came out of NBC\u2019s <em>Access Hollywood </em>archive. Who found it? A producer rummaging in cupboards? What did they do with it? Handed it up the corporate chain to top TV execs and their legal eagles. What did they do? They havered and pondered until someone sent a copy to the <em>Washington Post</em>, which promptly put the whole stinking package on its website.</p> <p>Full marks to the <em>Times</em> and <em>Post</em>. They did what journalists are there for. They reported the news. They changed this election. But TV and its learned friends behaved like huge corporations with something to lose. They sat on their hands too long.</p> <p>And what \u2013 just one more time \u2013 would the BBC have done, with fairness, balance and licence-fee retribution lowering large? Was its treatment of the Brexit referendum \u2013 in facts or disclosure \u2013 anything to write piously home about? The <em>Mail</em> and <em>Express</em> are taking an axe to Broadcasting House these days for noticing that the pound has gone pop. If we are doomed to spend the next two-and-a-half years arguing about what the vote meant, how does that reflect on the sharp focus of the coverage of the time? Fair or just fairly useless?</p>",

We are the losers in a modern game in which only \u201csmart people\u201d, as Trump indelicately put it, know the rules. In fact, the rich and powerful quietly exited from the business of paying tax a long time ago.</p> <p>The evidence is all around. A new study of America\u2019s leading <a href=\"http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2016/10/offshore_shell_games_2016.php#.V_-1OzYrKrM\">Fortune 500 companies</a> reveals that 367 of them \u2013 some 73% \u2013 have at least one or more subsidiaries in tax havens. Some have hundreds. This allows them to legally ship profits offshore.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, it emerged that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/08/ebay-pays-11m-uk-tax-on-revenues-it-told-us-investors-were-11bn\"> eBay paid just \u00a31.1m in tax</a> last year, despite telling US investors that the UK was its second largest market, generating revenues of \u00a31.1bn. The cash originating in the UK flows to a parent company in Switzerland.</p> <p>The mind-boggling scale of the problem is laid bare in a slew of books and reports that reveal the way in which multinational companies have excused themselves from paying vast amounts of tax.</p> <p>The companies are a who\u2019s who of global brands: Apple, Nike, Google, Pepsi, Pfizer, Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and practically every other multinational in business.</p> <p>The detail can be complicated, but the method is simple \u2013 and legal. Companies set up subsidiaries in low or no-tax jurisdictions. These subsidiaries then charge the onshore parent for services or intellectual property or whatever, with the profits then funnelled legally offshore. US companies are only obliged to pay tax when they bring the money back. Which they don\u2019t.</p> <p>The study of America\u2019s Fortune 500 companies shows that they collectively avoid an estimated $100bn in federal taxes each year. The most popular tax haven is the Netherlands. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are not far behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7a11df662e9190a57b6d4912145bda139423d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7a11df662e9190a57b6d4912145bda139423d35/0_122_2327_1396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook said the EU ruling that Apple had to pay $14.5bn in back taxes to Ireland was  \u2018political crap\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook said the EU ruling that Apple had to pay $14.5bn in back taxes to Ireland was \u2018political crap\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toru Hanai/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst offender is Apple. It has booked $214.9bn offshore, a sum greater than any other company\u2019s offshore cash pile. If these profits were held in the US they would incur $65.4bn in tax. The European Commission recently ordered Apple to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">pay Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes</a>; its Irish subsidiaries were paying an effective tax rate of 0.005%. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed the ruling as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d.</p> <p>As a result it is ordinary taxpayers who have to pick up the tab. Last year George Osborne introduced a \u201cdiverted profit tax\u201d aimed at large companies that shift income artificially offshore. It\u2019s unclear if the former chancellor\u2019s initiative will work. Last weekend the <em>Observer</em> reported that Facebook had ended up with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/09/facebook-uk-ends-up-11m-in-tax-credit-despite-global-profits-of-5bn\">\u00a311.3m tax credit on its UK business</a>. This is a company that made a global profit last year of $6.19bn.</p> <p>The new books include a page-turning account of the investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>. And an enterprising account of the wealth management industry by a writer who spent two years undercover as a trainee.</p> <p>Published last April, the Panama Papers were the fruits of a thrilling journalistic investigation. The papers \u2013 some 11.5m leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca \u2013 give an unprecedented insight into the offshore world. They expose something obvious, previously hidden in plain sight. Namely that the global offshore industry \u2013 centred in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands \u2013 was not, as had been thought, a shadowy but minor part of our economic system. Rather it was the system. It is this system that has allowed the burden of taxation to move inexorably from multinational corporations and the well-off to the \u201cunsmart\u201d: the dupes; you and me.</p> <p>The journalists who unearthed this bitter truth were Bastian Obermayer and Frederik Obermaier of Germany\u2019s <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</em>. (They are not related, but their German and international colleagues fondly nickname them the \u201cbrothers Obermay/ier\u201d.) The paper, based in Munich, has an excellent track record of working on difficult and important investigations.</p> <p>Reporters often get offered information, stuff. I know from previous investigations that this often turns out to be disappointing. As Obermayer recounts, in early 2015, late one evening, he received an anonymous message. It said: \u201cHello. John Doe here. Interested in secret data?\u201d Obermayer replied: \u201cAlways interested in secret data. What is it?\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cit\u201d turned out to be bigger than anyone might have imagined. The source \u2013 his or her identity remains unknown \u2013 had got hold of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s entire internal database. The legal practice was founded in 1977 by an ambitious Panamanian lawyer and the son of a Waffen SS officer. It specialised in setting up anonymous offshore shell companies.</p> <p>The source\u2019s motivation was simple. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, who lifted the lid on mass electronic surveillance, John Doe was a whistleblower. He/she wanted to expose the scale of injustice of the offshore tax system. Mossack Fonseca denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The leak was an act of bravery and amounted to the biggest data dump ever, delivered in real-time instalments. We got a whopping 2.6 terabytes. This was far larger than the top-secret Snowden files or the diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 by an unhappy US army private, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning\">Chelsea Manning</a>, which revealed Washington\u2019s frank views of its global friends and enemies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80e2012fc53e6224282b6f563ec3b6b96256b854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e2012fc53e6224282b6f563ec3b6b96256b854/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Panama Papers include records of 214,000 offshore companies, names of real or \u201cbeneficial\u201d owners, and passport scans. There are bank statements, electricity bills and email chains. Often these are between Mossack Fonseca\u2019s head office in Panama and \u201cintermediaries\u201d, typically other lawyers, accountants and banks.</p> <p>Behind them were a large and diverse group of affluent individuals. We looked, naturally enough, for politicians and those holding public office. But the majority of names in the database belonged to what you might call the non-famous international rich. There were French dentists, Spanish lawyers and Swiss aristocrats, all seeking to minimise their taxes.</p> <p>The leak led to a year-long international collaboration in 80 countries. <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung </em>shared its material with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which is based in Washington.</p> <p>The ICIJ in turn gave access to the data to 100 media organisations and nearly 400 reporters. In Britain that was my newspaper the <em>Guardian</em> and the BBC.</p> <p>The journalists gave the leaked files a name. The Panama Papers was a conscious echo of the Pentagon Papers: volumes of secret documents leaked in 1971 by Daniel Ellsberg which revealed the true US war in Vietnam. Ellsberg swiped a mere 7,000 pages. We had enough reading material to last us about 25 years.</p> <p>I found myself back in the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s investigations \u201cbunker\u201d. (Actually, it had a bucolic view of Regent\u2019s canal in London: houseboats, joggers, coots.) In 2013 I\u2019d been part of a small group which had studied the Snowden files here. We speculated at the time that MI6 had taken up residence in the flats opposite.</p> <p>This project was different. By means of a secure platform, called the iHub, journalists were encouraged not to compete with each other but to share information and to swap leads and tips. We did, in a flurry of encrypted emails. There were clandestine reporter meetings in Washington, Munich, and London.</p> <p>Early on we looked for Trump. Perhaps the database would point us towards his alleged secret fortune? It didn\u2019t. I did dig up a Russian businessman escaping from Moscow who wanted to buy an apartment in the Trump Ocean Club tower in Panama City. (The agent knocked off $200,000, offering the Trump penthouse for a bargain price of $2.31m.)</p> <p>Other themes gradually became clear. Britain, it turned out, didn\u2019t just feature via UK Crown dependencies like Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Rather, it was the heart of the Mossack Fonseca multiverse. True, many of those diverting funds offshore were located in far-away kleptocracies: Russian oligarchs, African despots, and bagmen for Syria\u2019s murderer-president Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>But it was British lawyers, banks and company formation agents that were facilitating this global tax avoidance. Often, the enablers were top London law firms. Their websites look eminently respectable: a view of Georgian stucco, offices in exclusive postcodes, a smart Farrow and Ball front door with neatly topiaried trees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain didn\u2019t just feature via UK Crown dependencies. Rather, it was the heart of the rotten Mossack Fonseca multiverse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The leaked documents told a different story. Sometimes, the lawyers would lie about their clients\u2019 identities and connections. Under banking regulations firms were meant to declare if a client was a politically exposed person or \u201cPEP\u201d. This would lead to stricter checks. The solution was to say nothing in the paperwork about a client\u2019s PEP status. In return, big fees.</p> <p>There may not have been bodies on the streets of Belgravia or Knightsbridge. But it was hard to escape the dispiriting sense that the British were the biggest crooks on the planet. Behind the facade of legal piety we were enabling an orgy of transnational theft, and the looting of entire continents such as Africa.</p> <p>The California-based French economist Gabriel Zucman estimates that 8% of the world\u2019s wealth \u2013 $7.6tn (\u00a35.3tn) \u2013 is currently stashed in tax havens. Zucman puts the loss to global tax revenues at $200bn per year. That includes $35bn in the US and $78bn in Europe. What might we do instead with this money?</p> <p>As President Obama noted tax avoidance was a huge global problem, made worse by the fact that offshore structures are perfectly legal. Many of these havens operate under British jurisdiction. More than half of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s companies are registered in the British Virgin Islands, a territory administered from London. The BVI has stubbornly rejected calls for greater transparency. Successive British governments have failed to act.</p> <p>We spent most of our bunker hours working the big names. They included David Cameron, who features indirectly, as well as a host of other colourful figures including Iceland\u2019s prime minister and Vladimir Putin\u2019s KGB-turned-oligarch pals.</p> <p>The database revealed that the offshore fund run by Cameron\u2019s late father Ian had paid no British tax. For three decades. The fund, Blairmore Holdings Inc, had gone to absurd lengths to pretend that it was based in the Bahamas, another major tax haven.</p> <p>It hired a small army of Bahamas residents to sign paperwork. One of them was a part-time bishop. All of this was legal \u2013 but a pantomime designed to keep Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs at bay.</p> <p>In the run up to publication, slotted for 3 April, we had two worries. One, that our investigation might itself leak. Journalists are a gossipy bunch. Two, that nobody would care. After all, when the <em>Guardian</em> published Snowden\u2019s revelations of state spying in 2013 most people in Britain \u2013 the land of James Bond \u2013 reacted with a weary shrug.</p> <p>In the end we needn\u2019t have worried. In Iceland the prime minister resigned. In Argentina there were protests. In Azerbaijan a small war suddenly initiated \u2013 so some believed \u2013 to distract from revelations featuring the president and his daughters. In China censors blocked the words \u201cPanama Papers\u201d and jammed the website of the <em>Guardian.</em> In Russia officials fumed about a western \u201cspy\u201d conspiracy.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to answer questions about Cameron\u2019s tax affairs, saying that they were a \u201cprivate matter\u201d. Eventually Cameron came clean: he\u2019d owned shares in his father\u2019s tax haven fund. He sold them for \u00a331,500 just before becoming prime minister in 2010.</p> <p>Cameron was reluctant to acknowledge what was obvious: that part of his family\u2019s fortune came from privileged offshore wealth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe4e015edf23411e0a502442aff3595bdc000770\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe4e015edf23411e0a502442aff3595bdc000770/0_403_6706_4025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewed in retrospect, this was the beginning of the end of Cameron. Weeks later he hosted a global anti-corruption summit in London. He announced a clampdown on offshore havens. The UK would introduce a new register that would compel foreign companies owning British property to declare their owner, thereby cleaning up London as a centre for international money-laundering.</p> <p>It was a start. But Cameron stopped short of compelling British overseas territories from outing the real owners of offshore firms. Without a public register the offshore industry \u2013 with its satellites of lawyers and banks \u2013 was free to carry on as before. The BVI, meanwhile, boycotted the London summit and stayed at home.</p> <p>The picture, then, is a lousy one. But the Panama Papers offer a few rays of hope. In recent years the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and western governments have tried to clamp down on tax evasion, mindful of the billions being lost during a time of austerity. Pressure has been growing on offshore centres to swap information. Increasingly, the Swiss and others are complying.</p> <p>All this has induced a degree of paranoia among Mossack Fonseca\u2019s well-heeled clients. Emails show that the super-rich have adopted various protective strategies to stop the tax man from knocking. Some of them use fake names. We found Harry Potter, Winnie Pooh and Daniel Radcliffe. (Not the real one.) Plus Isaac Azimov, who turned out to be a tax lawyer from Barcelona.</p> <p>Offshore agents report that their Italian clients are going to desperate lengths to avoid being caught. When visiting Switzerland they leave the Ferrari behind and take a less conspicuous car. They also seek to cover their trail by \u201clayering\u201d: using a chain of offshore companies, rather than just one, to bury an asset.</p> <p>Still, the past six months have seen a victory of sorts for those of us, the little people, who do pay our taxes. From now on, the super-rich and other characters who use exotic offshore structures will be a nervous bunch. How long, they must be wondering, before the next leak?</p>"
