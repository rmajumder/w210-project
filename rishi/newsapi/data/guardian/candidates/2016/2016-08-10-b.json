But while the speech clarified some details of his plans, it also showcased their many faults and their favoring, for this supposedly populist candidate, of the 1%.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stated objectives range from the outright protectionist (tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) to the business friendly goals of putting a moratorium on new regulations and introducing an energy policy that pays no heed to concerns about climate change or global warming.<br></p> <p>Then there are the measures that are downright tricky to evaluate on the surface. It sounds great when a presidential candidate promises to simplify the tax code, cutting the number of tax brackets from seven to three and reducing the tax owed by those in the top tier to 33% from 39.6%.</p> <p>It\u2019s a plan that enables Trump to claim that everyone will be paying less, since individuals earning less than $25,000, and couples making less than $50,000, wouldn\u2019t owe any federal tax. The problem, of course, is that while all the attention is focused on the absolute rates, less is devoted to unravelling the complicated question of just how the taxes would be levied.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/aug/10/donald-trump-economic-policy-wealthy-tax-breaks\">How Trump's 'populist' economic policy hides a payday for the wealthy</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ab846ae4b0f231200d9a35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lauren-gambino\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T19:46:59.427Z\">8.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US Secret Service agents rushed onto the stage as Hillary Clinton spoke in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday to prevent an activist from reaching the stage.</p> <p>The individual was taken down by agents before reaching the steps to the stage.

  "<p>When Donald Trump pitched an economic policy platform nakedly contrived to benefit other multi-millionaires to an assembled crowd in Detroit this Monday, it was quite a spectacle. If there was ever any doubt about the absurdity of the signifier of populism in American politics, it should have been dashed there and then.<br></p> <p>What\u2019s clear by now is that Donald Trump\u2019s populist appeal is limited to a very specific populace, by design. The question of whether Trump\u2019s support is predicated on race versus class isn\u2019t really a question anymore. It\u2019s the kind of thing that can be tested with polls and multivariate regression models. Which is exactly what political scientist <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11833548/donald-trump-support-race-religion-economy\">Philip Klinkner</a> did, and found that, controlling for one another, pessimism about the economy doesn\u2019t predict support for Trump; resentment toward African Americans and Muslims does. </p> <p>It\u2019s the reason why Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/19/this-one-survey-shows-why-trump-wont-win-over-sanders-supporters/\">won\u2019t win over Sanders supporters</a>: however much he invokes Nafta and the decline of manufacturing in the Midwest, as he did in his Detroit speech, trade just isn\u2019t as politically salient as he thinks. Most voters don\u2019t rank trade as a top issue. And most of Trump\u2019s supporters care far more about immigration and terrorism, which makes his frequent racist and Islamophobic dog whistles far more effective at shoring up his base.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/aug/10/donald-trump-economic-policy-wealthy-tax-breaks\">How Trump's 'populist' economic policy hides a payday for the wealthy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, of course, many on the left who wish trade was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">more of a salient issue</a>, just as many wish the US had stronger unions and an honest-to-God populist party. But given our history as a country founded on white supremacy, the dream of a kind of pure populism, unadulterated by racism and xenophobia, has always been elusive. Trump\u2019s platform and rhetoric neatly dovetail with those of earlier American populist parties, the Know Nothings (for whom their alien scourge was Catholics) and the People\u2019s Party (who called for restricting immigration in their founding document).</p> <p>Which is why it doesn\u2019t really matter that Trump gets so much wrong on economics. Just in this one speech, he asserted, without evidence, that the Department of Labor is misreporting unemployment figures, apparently confusing their U3 and U6 rates. He conflated retirees with people out of work. He used out-of-date census data to say that household income dropped $4,000 in 16 years, which is not true. He claimed a Congressional Budget Office report says \u201cObamacare will cost the economy two million full-time jobs,\u201d when the report says no such thing. He flat out made things up about Clinton\u2019s tax plan. He called for repealing an estate tax that affects only him and a handful of his richest peers, a display of self interest that\u2019s so unabashed it\u2019s impressive. Make me president and I\u2019ll end the tax on private jets and orange hair weaves. </p> <p>He can get all this wrong and it won\u2019t matter. Just as it doesn\u2019t matter that a man who appears to use bankruptcy as a business model can claim to be a jobs candidate. Just as it didn\u2019t matter that the last movement to be called populist, the Tea Party, had average incomes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=0\">well above the US median</a>. It\u2019s not about jobs and it\u2019s not about income. Even if it should be. <br></p> <p>To be sure, the Democrats\u2019 allergy to anything resembling class-based politics does much to enable Trump, and the continuation of a racialized populism largely divorced from economics. When Democrats say \u201cmiddle class\u201d, they mean \u201cworking class\u201d, and when Republicans say \u201cworking class\u201d, they mean \u201cwhite people\u201d. To be called working class in America means being an evangelical, being a gun owner, living in a rural area, not being black or Latino or Asian \u2013 being, in other words, a typical Republican.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So when Democrats flip flop on trade, and cozy up to Wall Street while keeping unions at arms length, who can blame Republicans for seizing an opportunity to fill the void? And the more Trump\u2019s racialized populism alienates establishment Republicans, the more Clinton embraces them, trumpeting an elite Washington consensus that she is the only responsible candidate in the race. Which may be true. </p> <p>But if there\u2019s anything that feeds the Trump phenomenon more than racial resentment, it\u2019s suspicion of an elite Washington consensus. When class disappears, being declared wrong by the whole of the establishment is enough to qualify you as a populist.<br></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">situation in Crimea</a> looks ominous. Russia\u2019s FSB spy agency said on Wednesday that it had foiled a series of attacks by armed Ukrainians on the peninsula. Minutes later, Vladimir Putin accused Kiev\u2019s pro-western government of choosing terror over peace. Meanwhile, largely unnoticed by the outside world, Russia has been stealthily shipping military vehicles to Crimea, which Putin annexed in the spring of 2014.</p> <p>What is going on? As ever in the opaque world of neo-Kremlinology, nobody quite knows.

Crimea\u2019s \u201cparliament\u201d said Ukraine had already launched an undeclared war. Ukraine says the supposed plot is FSB fiction.</p> <p>The new Crimea crisis has come from nowhere. Over in the east there have been daily clashes between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian government forces in Donestk and Luhansk, with a spike in recent weeks. But the Perekop isthmus, the rustic sliver of territory between Crimea and Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson province, has been quiet. There was no fighting here even in 2014, when Putin staged his land grab.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Putin raises stakes over alleged Ukrainian terror plot in Crimea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of this leads to the suspicion, voiced by Carl Bildt, Sweden\u2019s former prime minister and others, that Russia may be about to invade again. </p> <p>When it comes to the month of August, Putin has form.

The presidential election is paralysing the US, and the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has hinted that as president he might recognise Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. He seems uncertain as to where Ukraine actually is. Europe meanwhile is in disarray in the wake of the Brexit vote and an ongoing migration crisis.</p> <p>Seizing Crimea seemed a good idea in 2014, and it was achieved with remarkable ease. As the Russian writer Leonid Kaganov put it, however, it was a bit like stealing an expensive phone without its charger. Once a peninsula, the region is now effectively an island. Putin has announced plans to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait, connecting it to the Russian mainland, but he has entrusted the job to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore\">a childhood friend</a>, Arkady Rotenberg, and it is unlikely to be finished any time soon.</p> <p>In the meantime, Crimeans, most of whom still support Russia, have suffered a series of electricity blackouts and other indignities. Last November Ukrainian activists blew up energy pipelines to Crimea, plunging homes into darkness. People ate dinner by candlelight, factories shut down and for the first few days even traffic lights stopped working. The peninsula\u2019s water supply is also vulnerable. It gets all of its water via the north Crimean canal, currently in Ukraine.</p> <p>At this point there seem to be three possible scenarios. One is that Putin will try to leverage this latest crisis to persuade EU countries to drop the sanctions imposed over the Ukraine conflict. Another is that he is preparing a limited military incursion, possibly to set up a security corridor, which doubtless would include the electricity station in the nearby Ukrainian city of Kherson. A third is that he is planning something bigger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/yuilia-efimova-olympics-critics-cold-war-swimming-lilly-king-rio\">Yulia Efimova hits back at critics: \u2018I thought cold war was long in the past\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In spring 2014 there was speculation that he would seek to carve out a land corridor connecting separatist Donetsk and Luhansk with Crimea.

There would be political dividends too. From the Kremlin\u2019s point of view, a further Ukraine adventure would conclusively demonstrate the west\u2019s weakness and incapacity. </p> <p>At a time when US swimmers are openly taunting their Russian rivals in the pool, it would also be payback for the doping scandal and international attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/russian-athletes-banned-paralympic-games-rio\">ban Russian athletes from the Olympics</a>.

  "<p>Donald Trump does have an economic policy, it seems. But if you\u2019re trying to find any hint of ideological coherence in the odd mish-mash of positions that the GOP presidential candidate laid out in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">nearly hour-long speech in Detroit on Monday</a>, your quest will be in vain.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech was meant to put his campaign back on track and it did \u2013 briefly, before he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">derailed it again</a> with his suggestion that gun-supporters might take aim at Hillary Clinton, so to speak. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">Trump's economic plan: no 'death tax', less business tax, and fewer regulations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To many voters, he is stronger on the economy than rival Hillary Clinton, who will speak on the issue Thursday. But while the speech clarified some details of his plans, it also showcased their many faults and their favoring, for this supposedly populist candidate, of the 1%.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stated objectives range from the outright protectionist (tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) to the business friendly goals of putting a moratorium on new regulations and introducing an energy policy that pays no heed to concerns about climate change or global warming.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Then there are the measures that are downright tricky to evaluate on the surface. It sounds great when a presidential candidate promises to simplify the tax code, cutting the number of tax brackets from seven to three and reducing the tax owed by those in the top tier to 33% from 39.6%. </p> <p>It\u2019s a plan that enables Trump to claim that everyone will be paying less, since individuals earning less than $25,000, and couples making less than $50,000, wouldn\u2019t owe any federal tax. The problem, of course, is that while all the attention is focused on the absolute rates, less is devoted to unravelling the complicated question of just how the taxes would be levied. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s new plan includes a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/09/tax-loophole-in-trumps-plan-would-create-windfall-for-the-rich.html\">big windfall for his fellow billionaires</a>, in the form of the rate at which \u201cpass through\u201d income will be taxed. This income \u2013 which earns its moniker by flowing through a separate business, partnership or limited liability company before reaching an individual \u2013 is now taxed at the individual rate. Trump proposes to tax it at a new, much lower rate of 15%, giving the wealthy individuals who establish these structures a big, big payday.</p> <p>While camouflaging that payday for the wealthy, Trump trumpeted his populist credentials with two other parts of his economic game plan. The problem? Neither offer the benefits to ordinary Americans of the kind that the candidate suggests they might.</p> <p>Let\u2019s consider the (in)famous \u201cdeath tax\u201d.</p> <p>If you listened to Trump\u2019s speech, you might imagine that this is something that the typical American family is up in arms about \u2013 that we stay up at night worrying about the IRS showing up to take away Grandma\u2019s collection of silver and china or Grandpa\u2019s woodworking equipment to satisfy the \u201cdeath tax\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo family will have to pay the death tax,\u201d Trump proclaimed. \u201cAmerican workers have paid taxes their whole lives. It\u2019s just plain wrong and most people agree with that. We will repeal it.\u201d</p> <p> Well, families like Donald Trump\u2019s may have worried about, and paid, estate taxes. But the rest of us? Not so much, unless, that is, our parents and grandparents bequeath us an estate worth north of $5.4m. That\u2019s the current threshold at which the IRS starts to get a share of the proceeds \u2013 so Grandma\u2019s silver is safe. You can probably sell some of her stocks and bonds to satisfy the taxman before you have to worry about family heirlooms.</p> <p> The estate tax, which affects about 2% of Americans, or about one in every 700 deaths annually, does generate about $25bn a year in revenue for the country\u2019s coffers. I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s a case to be made for waiving or cutting it when a small business owner\u2019s death might force his heirs to close or sell that business: that surely isn\u2019t the intent of the tax. </p> <p>On the other hand, repealing it so that wealthy families can simply pass on all their wealth to their heirs, while governments struggle to deliver basic services to families who themselves are struggling in a country where the wealth gap has become a wealth gulf? That idea becomes even more unpalatable when promoted by a billionaire-turned-politician who, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trump-lays-out-tax-plan-that-would-benefit-his-family-w433267\">along with his family, so clearly will benefit personally</a> from the policies he\u2019s promoting. </p> <p>It becomes even more odd when you consider the fact that many of the country\u2019s wealthiest families are now so rich that they are signing on to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/01/giving-pledge-new-members-2016/\">the Giving Pledge.</a> Joining an effort launched by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, its signatories promise to give away at least half of their net worth to philanthropic causes. Obviously, they\u2019d prefer to choose where their money goes rather than have Uncle Sam decide it belongs to the US treasury, but the fact remains that the country\u2019s wealthiest citizens \u2013 those most likely to be hit by the \u201cdeath tax\u201d \u2013 are spending down their billions already rather than fretting about turning their heirs into next-gen billionaires. The rhetoric about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d is squarely aimed at those middle-class Americans who feel financially squeezed and over-taxed and oppressed by government red-tape of all kinds, but who never will have to pay a dime in \u201cdeath taxes\u201d in their lives.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give Trump the benefit of assuming that his goal in proposing a childcare initiative was benign; it at least means that he finally is acknowledging that it\u2019s a topic that he needs to take seriously. In the run-up to his Monday speech, the rumor was that he was about to suggest a \u201cnew way\u201d for families to deduct childcare costs from their taxes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the \u201cnew way\u201d wasn\u2019t really that new after all. Trump simply proposed that households be able to \u201cfully deduct\u201d their childcare expenses against their taxes. That\u2019s revolutionary rhetoric for a Republican candidate, admittedly, but it ignores the fact that about 45% of Americans don\u2019t pay federal income taxes, and so wouldn\u2019t benefit from that deduction. </p> <p>For them \u2013 and for that matter, for all working parents \u2013 the key issue is affordability. For a low-income family, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/rising-cost-of-child-care-may-help-explain-increase-in-stay-at-home-moms/\">childcare costs can chew up 40% of household income</a>, according to a Pew Research Center report. That means many women are kept out of the workforce altogether by a lack of affordable, accessible childcare options.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s focus on the narrowest part of the childcare conundrum, and the most self-evident solution (the one that benefits the middle class and more affluent families who have already found and can pay for childcare) shows just how oblivious he remains to the real problems that beset his constituency, and how tissue-thin his populism is. It\u2019s a solution that he thinks should fit the problem, rather than one that addresses the real issues.</p> <p>For the GOP candidate to Make America Great Again for those on the wrong side of the wealth gap, he\u2019s going to have to try a lot harder than this.</p>",

We want required training. We want common sense laws to keep us all safe.</p> <p>When I was in the US navy, I served for a time as the work center supervisor and leading petty officer for two divisions of weapons systems maintainers and operators aboard the USS Thach. The requirements for our military members to use firearms include, but are not limited to: annual live-fire training, regular background checks and a \u201csanity check\u201d each time they check out weapons and ammunition from the armory.<br></p> <p>We do these things because they work. They keep us safe and professional \u2013 and handling weapons responsibly is part of our job that we\u2019re repeatedly trained to do. Why expect less from our citizenry?</p> <p>Trump repeatedly claims that Clinton wants to \u201cabolish\u201d the Second Amendment. But what she, and Barack Obama, have proposed doesn\u2019t even strengthen our laws to mirror the rigors of the military. In fact, all they\u2019ve asked for is a universal background check system for anyone purchasing a gun \u2013 something that as many as 83% of gun owners also support.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to think of any national security or firearms professionals who think that what Trump said is acceptable. Hell, I don\u2019t know many humans who think what he said is acceptable \u2013 aside from a few folks who are trying to change what Trump said or make excuses for him. </p> <p>House speaker Paul Ryan called his remarks \u201ca joke gone bad.\u201d And Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, said he was simply referring to \u201ctremendously unified\u201d voting block with \u201cgreat political power\u201d.

Hinting at \u2013 or even joking about \u2013 the prospect of one\u2019s political opponents being assassinated is a signal of being temperamentally unfit for the presidency.

In insecure working conditions, everyone is scared of making a fuss \u2013 but women are scared of their own co-workers, as well as their bosses.</p> <p>I read this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/half-of-women-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-at-work-tuc-study-everyday-sexism\" title=\"\">TUC survey about harassment in the workplace, which polled 1,553&#xa0;women and found 52% of them had been sexually harrassed at work</a>. This is not anecdotal; it has happened to half of all women. Among women and girls aged&#xa0;16-24, the proportion reporting sexual harassment rose to 63%. It includes jokes, banter, being touched and being threatened: all the things that men do to women because they can.&#xa0;It is about power.</p> <p>Who&#xa0;wants to make a fuss? In a world of zero-hours contracts, you cannot ask the union for support. Sexual harassment in the workplace may be dismissed as trivial. But it is significant not only because it undermines women, but also because it shows how we are going backwards. Low-paid workers have few rights \u2013 and who is there to defend them? We may have a female prime minister, but you wouldn\u2019t know it, as the great men of the left scream, warrior-like, to each other about betrayals. Yet the most important betrayal is becoming more and more clear. If a party founded for the workers (the clue is in the name: \u201cLabour\u201d) cannot promote women in its own workplace, then how can it look after the lowest-paid and most harassed workers of all?</p> <p>Sure, I know there is the great new social movement of Momentum, but look at Labour\u2019s jobs for the boys. All the new city mayors will, amazingly, be blokes! I am sure there is nothing wrong with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham</a>, <a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/who-sion-simon-labour-candidate-11725914\" title=\"\">Si\u00f4n Simon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/23/bristol-mayor-marvin-rees-racism-inequality\" title=\"\">Marvin Rees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/corbyn-ally-steve-rotheram-named-as-candidate-for-liverpool-city-region-mayor\" title=\"\">Steve Rotheram</a>. I am sure no women were up to it. There never are. I&#xa0;merely note that Ukip is more likely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-hopefuls-golliwog-fan-putin-admirer-wrestler\" title=\"\">to have a female leader before the Labour</a> party.</p> <p>Of course, the increase in sexual harassment is not the fault of the dregs of the left. But are we not concerned that women cannot be what they cannot see in public life? In politics, in film, girls need to see that they have possibilities. Power. Westminster is a hostile workplace. We know that. To create an extra-parliamentary social movement, one would assume this was one place where women could be valued equally. I don\u2019t expect Corbyn\u2019s crew to do this. They are a type. They pay lip-service to feminism, but they never create the conditions for it to thrive. It\u2019s just not an organising principle for them.</p> <p>This does not mean that young, bright women are not attracted by the idea of doing things differently. But where are they going to find their&#xa0;place in this party that seeks not exactly winning, not exactly government, but some greater, unfathomable goal?</p> <p>Good activists have already touched every feminist base. Who needs actual women? They believe in equality, they are beyond gender, they can\u2019t possibly be misogynists because they are not rightwing. The absence of women is probably something to do with neoliberalism. Or Mercury in retrograde. Who knows?</p> <p>The dynamics of power, the recognition and&#xa0;promotion of men by other men, remain invisible to those who enact them. Empowerment is one&#xa0;part of this. Disempowerment is another. That is what sexual harassment is. That is why it&#xa0;is serious. That is why I look to the left and feel&#xa0;empty.</p> <p>This is a very conservative time. At the top of the tree, Donald Trump can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\" title=\"\">hint that he thinks Hillary Clinton should be assassinated</a>. Meanwhile, some young girl gets pushed up against the stockroom wall and groped.</p> <p>The absence of women in power has to be tackled directly and politically. The harassment of&#xa0;women without it, depends on it. If Labour won\u2019t do it, others will. This is only the province of the left if you make it so. The party of the workers is choosing not to.</p>",
  "<p>In the midst of a political season in which all eyes are on the US presidential election, one of America\u2019s largest political advocacy groups devoted to women\u2019s rights is turning its attention to a new mission: state legislative races.</p> <p>Emily\u2019s List, a group that traditionally focuses on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/new-hampshire-female-governor-maggie-hassan-emilys-list\">electing individual pro-choice women to office</a>, announced a new plan to target seven vulnerable states where organizers believe they can flip the some of legislatures from red to blue \u2013 and then, perhaps more permanently, do the same for the US Congress.</p> <p>The idea is that if the group can help elect enough Democratic women in state legislatures by the 2021 congressional redistricting cycle, it will be able to swing both many state houses and the House of Representatives in favor of Democrats, and make them more likely to pass legislation in favor of reproductive rights and women\u2019s equality.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently, Republicans control 68 of 98 legislative chambers in the United States,\u201d said Emily\u2019s List president Stephanie Schriock. \u201cThat\u2019s a result of the 2010 elections, when the Democrats lost so many state legislatures.\u201d</p> <p>Once there, she said, \u201cRepublicans gerrymandered a huge number of Congressional seats,\u201d a reference to the constitutionally protected redistricting process, leading to the Republican takeover in the US House. They also pushed what she termed \u201can extreme anti-choice legislative movement\u201d on the state and federal level, while blocking any progress on equal pay legislation, childcare assistance, paid sick time and family leave.</p> <p>The women of Emily\u2019s List want that to stop. To that end, on Tuesday the organization launched Focus 2020, vowing to help elect enough pro-choice Democratic women in 2016, 2018, 2020 and beyond that they will be able to build Democratic legislative majorities in 14 states in time to affect the partisan makeup of the US Congress.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to end this process of gerrymandering by Republicans,\u201d Schriock added. \u201cWe have to make sure that we have fair districts in this country, so that we can fight over ideas, not process.\u201d</p> <p>First up in 2016, Emily\u2019s List is pushing candidates in Michigan, Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada, Minnesota, New Mexico and Colorado \u2013 all states that have passed or nearly passed anti-abortion legislation over the last few years.</p> <p>In Colorado, widely seen at the original home of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/colorado-personhood-fails-signatures-ballot\">so-called \u201cpersonhood\u201d movement</a> \u2013 which attempts to define fetuses as people under the law and thereby classify abortion and even some methods of birth control as murder \u2013 the senate went from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/08/colorado-state-senate-majority/115049/\">blue to red in 2014</a>, after a razor-slim Democratic majority created by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/gun-lobby-democrats-colorado-connecticut\">recall</a> of two pro-gun-control senators in 2013 failed to hold.</p> <p>To change that, Emily\u2019s List has endorsed three pro-choice women in state senate races there, though Democrats only need to pick up two seats. Rachel Zenzinger, who is challenging a Republican incumbent, Laura Woods, to retake the seat she she lost to Woods by 663 votes in 2014 is one of them.</p> <p>Zenzinger described her race as taking place in \u201ca swing district in a swing country in a swing state\u201d where \u201cyou would think [Woods] would be trying to defend and protect women and women\u2019s issues, but she\u2019s done the exact opposite\u201d.</p> <p>Woods supported a variety of anti-abortion bills in the last session, including ones that Zenzinger said \u201cranged from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2016/04/22/forced-waiting-period-mandated-ultrasound-measures-go-down/\">mandatory, invasive ultrasounds</a> to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://coloradopols.com/diary/82515/woods-we-are-concerned-about-the-abortions-behind-the-tissue#sthash.LgsodMzP.dpbs\">defunding a local university because it used fetal tissue for research</a>\u201d, in addition to one that would have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.lambornforcongress.org/index.php/articles/it-is-time-to-defund-planned-parenthood\">defunded Planned Parenthood</a>.</p> <p>Given the anti-abortion movement\u2019s history of unsuccessfully putting \u201c<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-perfect-storm-may-be-brewing-in-colorado-to-pass-a-personhood-law-aeb2903308ae#.7n58rx9m9\">personhood</a>\u201d legislation on the ballot, Zenzinger believes that many Republicans \u201cwill try to seek action legislatively, where they have the opportunity to control the agenda if they are able to maintain the Republican majority\u201d in the state senate.</p> <p>But beyond the immediate concerns for reproductive rights in the state, Zenzinger said that if her party fails to regain a majority presence in the state senate by 2020, her constituents will see a \u201csignificant rolling back of the clock, just trying to go back and undo some of the good, progressive work that has been done over the past few years that really benefited everybody in Colorado\u201d \u2013 let alone anything that might be on a Democratic president\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Last April, the <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/04/michigan_house_passes_379_bill.html\">Michigan state House of Representatives passed a budget defunding Planned Parenthood</a>. It\u2019s another state where Emily\u2019s List is backing candidates under the Focus 2020 initiative in an attempt to bring that state\u2019s house of representatives back under a Democratic majority. One of these candidates is Collene Lamonte. Like Zenzinger in Colorado, Lamonte also lost a seat she held during the 2014 midterm elections. She\u2019s running to regain the seat she lost to a Republican opponent.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of issues in Michigan, things are not able to move forward because of a lack of women in our political system right now. <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/life/family/kristen-jordan-shamus/2015/03/22/gender-wage-gap-michigan/25200671/\">Pay equity in our state is a huge issue</a> \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.aauw.org/files/2014/09/Michigan-Pay-Gap-2014.pdf\">Michigan is lower than the national average</a> when it comes to pay equity for women. And we haven\u2019t been able to get that addressed with our current legislature,\u201d Lamonte said. \u201cAnd we continue to see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.eclectablog.com/2016/03/michigan-legislators-use-womens-health-as-a-bargaining-chip-ahead-of-primary-deadline.html\">bills that restrict women\u2019s access to proper healthcare in the state</a>. We need to ensure that women receive proper access to healthcare when they need it, without facing barriers.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Emily\u2019s List plans to expand its focus to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2013 many of which have legislatures that are notoriously hostile to women\u2019s reproductive rights, and some of which have voted for national Democrats even while their Congressional delegations skew Republican.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we have three full election cycles ahead of us,\u201d said Schriock. But if Republicans are able to gerrymander as many districts in 2021 as they did in 2011, \u201cwomen for generations are going to be left behind in this country.\u201d</p>",

His children should be ashamed of him. </p> <p>I only pray that he is not simply defeated, but that he loses all 50 states so that the message goes out across the land \u2014 unambiguously, loud and clear: The likes of you should never come this way again.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>That message was certainly to the fore in other American newspapers, from the Washington Post (\u201cTrump decried for gun remark\u201d) to the Denver Post (\u201cShooting off his mouth\u201d), and from the Chicago Tribune (\u201cTrump\u2019s comments stir up new firestorm\u201d) to the Wisconsin State Journal (\u201cTrump seen as pushing violence\u201d).</p> <p>Online outlets were similarly critical. Politico carried the line \u201cTrump\u2019s loaded words fuel campaign freefall\u201d while the Huffington Post simply said \u201cNo more.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump still appears to have some support. In an interview after his controversial speech with Fox News (prop: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp), Sean Hannity didn\u2019t so much let Trump off the hook as give him a lifeline.</p> <p>After playing a clip of Trump\u2019s comments, Hannity said to him: \u201cSo, obviously you are saying that there\u2019s a strong political movement within the second amendment, and if people mobilise and vote they can stop Hillary from having this impact on the court. But that\u2019s not how the media is spinning it.\u201d<br></p> <p>In other words, here\u2019s the answer I want you to give.

Matsumoto\u2019s oeuvre goes beyond the traditional dogs and flowers: he produces snails and stingrays, turkeys and toucans, testing the limits of his medium and exploring its playful, childish nature.</p> <p>Of course, he isn\u2019t the first artist, nor will he be the last, to partake in this trend. Jeff Koons made himself a household name with his gargantuan steel sculpture series <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/jeff-koons-balloon-dog-sells-for-record-58m-along-with-francis-bacons-freud-portraits-8936712.html\">Balloon Dog</a>, which broke records in 2013 when one of his five supersized hounds became the most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction, going for a staggering $58.4m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72d94bd3f4efdc3845727a709fcefec80fcad375\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72d94bd3f4efdc3845727a709fcefec80fcad375/0_0_2912_2216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Koons with his Balloon Dog, on display at Chicago\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Koons with his Balloon Dog, on display at Chicago\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last summer, Charles P\u00e9tillon installed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/18/covent-garden-market-hall-balloons-charles-petillon\">a huge collection of glowing, white balloons</a> in Covent Garden, drawing crowds to the South Hall of the market building.

The humble <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jun/14/partys-over-the-end-of-helium-balloons\">helium balloon</a> is set to become an endangered species as more and more cities ban them on environmental grounds.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never forget the amazement I felt as an infant party guest watching an artist create something out of nothing \u2013 an animal, a sword, or a dodgy hat transformed in a matter of seconds and with a few calculated twists and turns. To be honest, I still go goggle-eyed \u2013 and I\u2019m in company.

Is it a product of the human subconscious, a desire to return to the carefree state of childhood? Freud would be pleased.

The transience of the medium is refreshing \u2013 there is no way to preserve the finished piece. This is something I found out the hard way, as a disappointed child wondering why their new balloon pet had withered away into a wrinkled, latex heap a few days after it was acquired. Life is tough, kids.</p> <p>The fleeting beauty of these works would drive most people, never mind artists, mad \u2013 but Matsumoto seemingly thrives on it. Each balloon animal takes him about two hours to complete, with the larger, more complex creatures taking about six. After he completes them, he photographs them for his website \u2013 then pops them.</p> <p>Over the course of his artistic life, Matsumoto must have punctured hundreds of hours of hard work \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes him different from the Jeff Koons\u2019 of the world. He doesn\u2019t care for consumerism. He doesn\u2019t accept commissions, nor does he sell his talent. His art is created to be enjoyed, then disposed of. </p> <p>Deflated, but not deflating.</p> <p>In a society so concerned with appearances and perfection, it must be liberating to create art that is here one second, gone the next. Maybe we should all strive to be a little more like Matsumoto, appreciating the beauty of things, rather than obsessing over their materiality or value. Let\u2019s learn to accept that something as banal a balloon animal can be wonderful, but also worthless \u2013 and that\u2019s OK.</p>",

The outcome is exactly what we were hoping for and what we were expecting. Desperate candidates do desperate things for attention and I think that\u2019s what we saw here.\u201d</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cCongratulations to my friend Paul Ryan on a well-earned victory.

The presidential nominee stirred party tensions further when he initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-paul-ryan-john-mccain-re-election-endorsements\">declined to endorse</a> 46-year-old Ryan.</p> <p>But Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">finally gave in to pressure</a> and gave his endorsement last Friday at a rally from which Nehlen was barred.</p> <p>In reality Nehlen was always a long shot trying to pull off one of the biggest upsets of the century. Indeed Trump himself struggled to make an impact in Wisconsin, where he was soundly beaten by Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries. He lost the 1st congressional district by 19 percentage points.</p> <p>But Nehlen, 47, did win the backing of some prominent conservative figures including former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Rightwing commentator Ann Coulter campaigned for him.</p> <p>Nehlen was likened to Trump as he shared or took further some of the nominee\u2019s controversial positions. He called for the building of a wall along the Mexican border and suggested the deportation of \u201csharia-compliant\u201d Muslims. He criticised Ryan over trade, branding him a \u201csoulless globalist\u201d and promising to \u201crepatriate\u201d jobs to America.</p> <p>Nehlen, an executive at a water filtration company, made a web video of himself riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, showing his tattooed arms. He challenged Ryan to an arm-wrestling match if he refused to debate him. He also had the backing of veterans of the Tea Party movement.</p> <p>But all this proved futile against Ryan\u2019s strong local base and to local commentators the result was never in doubt. Ryan was first elected in 1998 and this is his first re-election win since becoming speaker in 2015. He out-raised the unknown Nehlen by a 17-to-1 ratio through the latest finance reporting period and shored up his position with TV ads, radio interviews and campaign stops.</p> <p>Ryan hosted a low-key, 10-minute press conference without a balloon or champagne bottle in sight at an events venue called The Armory.<br></p> <p>Across the street, the ornately decorated Monterey Hotel \u2013 which opened in 1929 and hosted John F Kennedy, Eleanor Roosevelt and Louis Armstrong \u2013 stands abandoned and boarded up. Janesville and other cities in the district have suffered decades of industrial decline and manufacturing job losses which, in theory, should have been fertile territory for a Trump disciple railing against global trade.<br></p> <p>But Nehlen failed to gain traction, with Ryan on course to gain about three-quarters of the votes cast. Asked if the broader lesson of Nehlen\u2019s thrashing is that Trump himself is doomed in the presidential election, Ryan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it means he\u2019s doomed in November. I think it means right here in Wisconsin people know me very, very well.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a local guy. People know who I am, they know what I believe in and they know I mean what I say and I say what I mean and I don\u2019t do it in a mean way, and I think that\u2019s the kind of politics, that the kind of policies that Wisconsite Republicans reward. That\u2019s why I think I won; I wouldn\u2019t ascribe anything other to it than that.\u201d</p> <p>Other prominent Wisconsinites include Priebus, the Republican National Committee chair, and Governor Scott Walker. All three are likely to play a leading role in rebuilding the party if Trump suffers an electoral meltdown.</p> <p>Stephan Thompson, a Republican strategist and ally of Walker, said on Monday that Nehlen was a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cbig joke\u201d who wanted his \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d. He described Ryan\u2019s balancing act \u2013 defending his seat, protecting the congressional majority and dealing with Trump \u2013 as \u201carguably the hardest job in politics right now\u201d.</p> <p>The speaker is officially backing Trump, although privately he is said to be tormented by the nominee\u2019s wayward antics. Yet another example reared its head on Tuesday. Ryan said he had a busy day and did not hear Trump\u2019s comment about the second amendment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">interpreted by some as an assassination threat</a> against Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt sounds like just a joke gone bad,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope he clears it up very quickly. You should never joke about something like that.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan refused to answer a question about whether he would consider running for president in future.</p> <p>As the primary result became clear, Nehlen, who was endorsed by a Super Pac affiliated with conservative activists known as the Tea Party Patriots, insisted he had a won a victory of sorts. \u201cWe very likely stopped TPP [the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal] and damaged Paul Ryan\u2019s ability to continue growing government,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of a fight we\u2019re ready to get started.\u201d</p> <p>Coulter posted a sarcastic tweet about the coverage of Ryan\u2019s win, comparing it with his Democratic counterpart Nancy Pelosi. \u201cCan you imagine a breaking news story: \u201cNANCY PELOSI WINS HER PRIMARY!\u201d she wrote.</p>",

They understand that the Second Amendment is on the ballot.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign went on the record in May saying that she believes the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller decision, a key victory for gun rights, was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">wrongly decided</a>.\u201d </p> <p>The 5-4 Heller decision struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban as unconstitutional, ruling that Americans have an individual right to own guns for self-defense in their homes. </p> <p>\u201cIf Heller is overturned, that paves the way for extreme gun control for decades,\u201d Baker said. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763158125721497600\">official NRA Twitter feed</a> compared Trump\u2019s remarks to a 2008 comment from then-Senator Joseph Biden, who said \u201cIf [Obama] tries to fool with my Beretta, he\u2019s got a problem,\u201d and asked \u201cWas Joe Biden\u2026suggesting violence here?\u201d</p> <p>Katie Pavlich, a prominent conservative writer who spoke at this year\u2019s NRA annual meeting, also slammed the media\u2019s coverage of Trump\u2019s remarks, tweeting: \u201cMedia totally exposed itself (again) today by assuming Second Amendment supporters are assassins instead of voters.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatiePavlich/status/763134167794135040\">she added</a>: \u201cThat said Trump is reason Trump has no credibility/isn\u2019t given the benefit of the doubt when actually misunderstood.\u201d She was referencing Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters\">remark in January</a> that \u201cI could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d </p> <p>Pavlich wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not defending Trump or his comments, I\u2019m defending Second Amendment supporters.\u201d </p> <p>The supreme court has become a central election issue since the death earlier this year of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative who has not yet been replaced. Trump claims that liberal judges could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/17/trump-texas-rally-second-amendment-guns-orlando-shooting-video\">threaten the second amendment.</a></p> <p>Progressive pressure groups that have been watching the process closely joined the condemnation of Trump on Tuesday. Michael Keegan, president of <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/\">People for the American Way</a>, said: \u201cThere has been no shortage of inexcusable rhetoric from Trump, but suggesting gun violence is truly abhorrent. There is no place in our public discourse for this kind of statement, especially from someone seeking the nation\u2019s highest office.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Sroka, communications director of <a href=\"https://www.democracyforamerica.com/\">Democracy for America</a>, added: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a little unclear whether Donald Trump was calling for his supporters to assassinate a Clinton court pick or take up an armed insurrection against a government that allowed her to appoint one. Either way, the only thing more insane than electing someone president who blows this kind of violent dog whistle would be buying the furious spin coming out of his campaign trying to explain it away.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has produced a shortlist of conservative justices that he hopes will appeal to the Republican base and deter those considering defecting to Clinton, who could set the court on a liberal trajectory for years to come.</p> <p>He told supporters on Tuesday: \u201cI guess there\u2019s a scenario in which this president could pick five supreme court justices, and if you pick two that are left, left, left, it\u2019s going to be a disaster for our country.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/nra-endorses-donald-trump-convention\">NRA had endorsed him early</a>, he added. \u201cWe want to replace with justices very much like Justice Scalia and that\u2019s going to happen, that\u2019s so important. One of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also told the rally that Clinton is \u201cdangerous\u201d and could destroy the country from within because of her immigration policies.</p> <p>Trump was introduced by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who brought up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/iran-executes-nuclear-scientist-shahram-amiri-returned-country-from-us\">the case of Shahram Amiri</a>, an Iranian nuclear scientist executed for spying for the US. Clinton received emails mentioning him on her controversial personal server when she was secretary of state.</p> <p>Giuliani said: \u201cRemember Hillary told us there was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">top secret information on her emails</a>? Remember she told us that. Well, she lied! And I don\u2019t know the connection between that and the death of Mr Amiri, but what I do know is it put a lot more attention on him when they found those emails. It certainly put him at great risk, even if they didn\u2019t find them, and it shows you that when the director of the FBI said she was extremely careless, he was being kind.\u201d</p> <p>But Giuliani repeatedly waved away chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p><em>Lois Beckett contributed reporting.</em></p>",

Windows shattered and flying glass left two people with minor lacerations. <br>\u201cWe were shot at. I mean we could hear the report of the gun,\u201d said Sherryl \u201cLee\u201d Michaelson, a retired US air force captain who is working for a basketball publication in Rio. <br>Brazilian police were not immediately available for comment. <br>Violent street crime in Rio has left its mark on South America\u2019s first Olympic Games. On Saturday, a bullet hit the equestrian centre, missing journalists there by just a few feet. That bullet was suspected to have been fired by a gang member trying to shoot down a police blimp or drone, officials said. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa7067e4b033cb0795e986\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T00:10:06.199Z\">1.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nadal and L\u00f3pez have taken the first set 6-3 against Austria\u2019s Oliver Marach and Alexander Peya in the men\u2019s doubles quarter-finals.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa6fd9e4b0f5d064841fd1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T00:07:28.125Z\">1.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In a thrilling weightlifting competition China\u2019s Shi Zhiyong edged out Turkey\u2019s Daniyar Ismaylov to win gold in the men\u2019s 69kg class, but just failed in his attempt to set a new world record of 198kg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e64435374e6cad2647c0f5244ed5863868b32e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e64435374e6cad2647c0f5244ed5863868b32e5/0_0_3500_2237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shi Zhiyong of China collapses to the floor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shi Zhiyong of China collapses to the floor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T00:24:08.876Z\">at 1.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa6d50e4b0f5d064841fc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T23:55:32.461Z\">12.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>France beat New Zealand 3-0.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/09/olympic-womens-football-colombia-usa-live\">Olympic women's football: Colombia 2-2 USA \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa6ce4e4b0f5d064841fc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T23:54:20.883Z\">12.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Colombia scored a dramatic late equaliser with another free-kick to draw 2-2 with the USA.

He\u2019s quite happy to stay in the background.\u201d Goodfellow, 19, achieved the success at the 10-metre synchro event with Daley, 22, on day three of the Rio Olympics. Speaking on TV show This Morning, Ms Goodfellow said she was still \u201cquite in shock\u201d. She watched the competition unfold from the family home near Cambridge. </p> <p>\u201cI was going to just watch the first two dives but then I thought if they have a bad dive I will switch off,\u201d she said. While there were \u201cone or two that weren\u2019t up to his usual success\u201d the pair clinched bronze on the final dive. His Olympic honour follows more than a year battling back from a shoulder injury which left him unable to raise his arm fully. </p> <p>The former Cambridge Dive Team member had suffered an elbow injury in the build-up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow before sustaining a separate injury to the long thoracic nerve, which affected his shoulder.

  "<p>A neat, if alarming, explanation for the astonishing rise of political outsiders across the western world is the idea that we live in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\" title=\"\">\u201cpost-truth era\u201d: one in which support for outsiders soars</a> when they make preposterous claims that are obviously not true. In contrast, when those who are seen to be on the inside \u2013 elected politicians and policy experts \u2013 counter with informed assessments, their popularity slumps.</p> <p>There is something in this. Uncontaminated by the complexities of power, the outsiders\u2019 propositions are untested. They utter words to euphoric audiences, and do not implement policies that can fuel intense disillusionment and cries of betrayal. Yet the concept of the post-truth era is also dangerously untruthful in its implicit evocation of a recent past that was a glorious age of candour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">Post-truth politicians such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are no joke | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The implication is untrue partly because it cannot be true. Truth in politics is always partly subjective, and&#xa0;rightly so. One person\u2019s noble public&#xa0;spending commitment will be another\u2019s reckless waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. More importantly, the concept of the post-truth era obscures the main&#xa0;reason why mainstream parties have become so fragile.</p> <p>In the new, traumatically constraining&#xa0;context of the globalised economy, mainstream parties on the left&#xa0;and the right have failed calamitously to find ways of telling the truth about what they can do, they want&#xa0;to do and they should do. Their failure to frame arguments based on an essence of truth gives space for the outsiders to flourish mendaciously.</p> <p>Only a year ago in Britain a general election was contested on a scandalous untruth. George Osborne framed the election around his plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/30/george-osborne-freeze-fuel-duty-2015-budget-surplus\" title=\"\">wipe out the deficit in this parliament</a>, a framing as tenuous in its relationship with the truth as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-wall-plan-texas-central-america-migrants\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico</a>.</p> <p>In the drama of post-Brexit events the chancellor announced almost casually that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\" title=\"\">dropped the target</a> he was&#xa0;never going to meet. Yet 12 months&#xa0;earlier the election was dominated by the deficit mistruth. Ed Miliband was forced, or felt he was forced, to make arguments he did not believe in order to appear \u201cresponsible\u201d on spending. Miliband had to propose Osborne-like cuts or face accusations of&#xa0;tax bombshells. In order to appear even more \u201cresponsible\u201d than Osborne in relation to the untruthful deficit target, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-labour-to-reject-pressure-to-match-tory-nhs-spending-plans-10182796.html\" title=\"\">Labour refused to commit even to the modest increases in NHS spending</a> that the Conservatives had proposed. Privately, Labour\u2019s leaders knew that they would have to spend much more, but they could not speak openly because they would be accused of spending recklessly rather than focusing on the deficit.</p> <p>When Miliband did speak the truth&#xa0;on&#xa0;BBC\u2019s pre-election Question Time, insisting that he did not accept that the spending of the last Labour government had caused the financial crash, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/30/ed-miliband-snp-opposition-question-time-election\" title=\"\">honesty was viewed widely as a fatal gaffe</a>. He should have lied and&#xa0;played the untruthful game in which the profligacy of the past would be replaced by an Osborne-like stringency, even though Osborne had no idea how he would be so stringent without wrecking lives and the economy&#xa0;\u2013 and would later drop the&#xa0;whole objective. The entire election&#xa0;was based on a fantasy.</p> <p>The false framing was obviously a disaster for the Labour party. It lost an election trying too hard to be like Osborne, even though the chancellor was not speaking the truth. The failure to frame a coherent pre-election left-of-centre argument in part explains the rise&#xa0;of Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Thanks to the ineptitude of his internal opponents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\" title=\"\">Corbyn has been granted a second leadership contest</a> to show that he could not dissemble if he tried \u2013 conveying to some a grizzled integrity, in contrast to those trapped into not being able to tell the truth. His platform is more solid than it was before the official start of the second contest now that a court has ruled that recently signed-up party members will be allowed to vote and more of Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been elected to the party\u2019s ruling national executive.</p> <p>But the false framing of the fundamental economic argument has not proven to be a great triumph for Osborne. He is now on the backbenches, his deficit game-playing a device consigned to history as Theresa May gives the early impression at least of seeking a more balanced approach.</p> <p>The biggest victim is the entire electorate, which has been unable to benefit from a grown-up debate about how we pay for public services, or to reach more nuanced conclusions about&#xa0;the priority that should be given to wiping out a deficit.</p> <p>There is a mountain of other depressing examples that show the UK&#xa0;suffers when mainstream leaders are&#xa0;trapped in the pre-post-truth era that was also untruthful. Why was there&#xa0;so little preparation in Whitehall on the detailed implications of Brexit? Part of the answer is that the prime minister and&#xa0;others could not admit in public the&#xa0;obvious: that there was a possibility they might lose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\">George Osborne scraps 2020 budget surplus plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be fair, if there had been evidence of extensive Brexit preparations the media would have gone for Cameron. I can hear the Today programme interviewer in such circumstances: \u201cYou insist you are going to win the referendum, and yet you are preparing for defeat!!!\u201d The media make it much harder for mainstream leaders to&#xa0;stumble towards candour, especially for those on the left, but also to some extent for those on the right.</p> <p>Yet it cannot be beyond the wit of a big political leader to move a little closer towards the truth, while accepting that guile and a capacity to dissemble expediently are also required skills for successful leadership.</p> <p>Is it really impossible for a leader to state that if we want decent public services, we have to find ways of paying for them, and that cutting the deficit is not the only way of measuring the success of economy policy? Is it not possible for such questions to be framed in a way that hails an ideological divide between left and right, showing that there is more to mainstream politics than a technocratic battle between those who claim competence in contrast to their opponents\u2019 incompetence?</p> <p>If mainstream leaders do not find a way of expressing themselves and explaining why they act as they do, they will leave the stage to the outsiders who propose their post-truth absurdities before a more truthful era can be given a chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Steve Richards presents Rock N Roll Politics at the Edinburgh Festival from 16 August</p>"
