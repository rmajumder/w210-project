  "<p>Voters could face more stringent identity checks and police cordons around polling stations, as part of a crackdown on electoral fraud recommended by Eric Pickles in a government-commissioned report.</p> <p>The former communities secretary was asked by David Cameron last year to examine how safeguards could be toughened up, after revelations of electoral malpractice in Tower Hamlets, east London, led to the removal of the mayor, Lutfur Rahman.</p> <p>In his report, presented to Theresa May, who has retained him as \u201canti-corruption champion\u201d, Pickles warns that unless the government makes it harder to fiddle the system, Britain\u2019s reputation for democracy could be undermined.</p> <p>\u201cOur nation has a proud heritage as the \u2018mother of parliaments\u2019, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation. It is time to take action to take on the electoral crooks and defend Britain\u2019s free and fair elections.\u201d</p> <p>As communities secretary, Pickles sent commissioners into Tower Hamlets when the allegations of fraud emerged. His report makes 50 recommendations, including calling for pilot schemes under which voters would be asked to bring identification with them to polling stations.</p> <p>\u201cA driving licence, passport or utility bills would not seem unreasonable to establish identity. The government may wish to pilot different methods. But the present system is unsatisfactory; perfection must not get in the way of a practical solution,\u201d it says.</p> <p>With intimidation of the public on their way to cast their votes one of the issues identified in Tower Hamlets, Pickles also says returning officers, who oversee elections, and the police, should be given powers to establish <em tabindex=\"-1\">cordons sanitaires</em> around polling stations where particular problems are identified.</p> <p>He argues that rules on the use of postal votes, which have previously been identified as ripe for fraud, should be toughened up \u2013 with party activists no longer allowed to handle them, for example, and an end to the possibility of applying for a permanent postal vote.</p> <p>Rahman was found guilty of multiple charges of corruption and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/23/tower-hamlets-mayor-lutfur-rahman-found-guilty-of-electoral\">kicked out of office last year</a>. He and his allies were found to have used vote-rigging and religious intimidation through local imams to return him to power.</p> <p>Backers of the Bangladeshi-born Rahman initially dismissed the claims against him as racism; and Pickles says in future, concerns about damaging community relations must not be an excuse for failing to investigate allegations of fraud.</p> <p>\u201cThere are sometimes challenging issues over divisive community politics, but this is no excuse for failing to enforce British law and protect the integrity of our democratic process. The law must be applied equally and fairly to everyone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The report cites evidence that pressure was put on vulnerable members of some minority ethnic communities to vote in accordance with the will of elders. \u201cThere were concerns that influence and intimidation within households may not be reported, and that state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of \u2018politically correct\u2019 over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Pickles would like to see the National Crime Agency, which looks at organised crime, be given a remit to examine complex cases of electoral fraud.<br></p> <p>The report also condemns the Electoral Commission, the government-backed body that scrutinises polls, for straying beyond its remit. \u201cThe Electoral Commission continues to act as a commentator and lobbyist on both policy and law. Yet government should not be lobbying government. It would be clearer for electoral law and electoral policy to be determined by the Cabinet Office, subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump laid out their competing visions for the US economy in the past week, with varying degrees of detail and some surprising overlap. But the bulk of each speech was spent on the differences: Trump embraced more tenets of Republican orthodoxy and Clinton made pledges that progressives would be comforted to hear.<br></p> <h2>Tax cuts v the \u2018 Buffett rule\u2019</h2> <p>Trump proposed tax cuts for all Americans, though the terms would disproportionately benefit wealthy people. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that tax revenue would fall by $2.4 tn over the first decade, and <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-2016-house-republican-tax-reform-plan\">the top 1% of Americans would make 5.3% more money </a>under the Republican plan, which would consolidate seven tax brackets into three, of 12%, 25% and 33%. Trump\u2019s new plan accepts more common Republican proposals; his <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform\">old plan </a> would have cut the top rate to 25%. The Tax Policy Center <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-of-trumps-tax-plan-shows-big-cuts-in-taxes-federal-revenue-1450807194\">estimated</a> his plan would reduce revenue by $9.5tn over a decade and increase the deficit by 80% by 2036.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-infrastructure-economy-jobs-trade-deals\">Clinton: Trump's economic plan will benefit rich, mine will create 10m jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton, in contrast, has backed an expanded version of a proposal by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to tax the ultrarich. She proposed a \u201cfair share surcharge\u201d that would place an extra tax on people who make more than $5m a year, in an effort to close loopholes that often mean millionaires pay lower effective rates than middle-class families.</p> <h2>Corporate tax cuts v a carrot and stick</h2> <p>Corporate profits have by and large<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/05/business/economy/corporate-profits-grow-ever-larger-as-slice-of-economy-as-wages-slide.html\"> increased over the past 15 years </a>while <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/\">wages have stagnated</a>. Trump\u2019s plan entails a cut to the corporate tax rate, to 15% from 35%, which he argues will entice companies to return to or stay in the United States to invest and create jobs. He has also often told crowds that he will threaten companies who want to move overseas with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/01/ted-cruz/donald-trumps-economic-agenda-imposing-massive-tax/\">extremely high tariffs</a>.</p> <p>Clinton offered both benefits and threats. She said she would simplify taxes for small businesses and offer tax credits to companies that share profits with employees. Her campaign has laid out <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/h/2016-02-12-hillary-clintons-breaking-every-barrier-agenda-revitalizing-the-economy-in-communities-left-behind/\">similar benefits </a>for companies that invest in the US. But Clinton also threatened an \u201cexit tax\u201d for companies that want to move overseas, close the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-carried-interest-and-how-should-it-be-taxed\">carried-interest loophole</a> and strengthen financial regulators, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p> <h2>Repealing regulations v clean energy funds</h2> <p>In another nod toward conventional Republican ideas, Trump said he would place a moratorium on any new regulations, and he has frequently blamed environmental safety rules on the decline of the coal industry, whose market has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/08/study-the-coal-industry-is-in-far-more-trouble-than-anyone-realizes/\">hugely taken over by natural gas companies</a>.</p> <p>Clinton took the common Democratic path and proposed new investment in clean energy and research. She gave no real specifics in her speech but her campaign has proposed a \u201cclean energy challenge\u201d that would \u201cpartner\u201d the federal government with local counterparts to reduce pollution and invest in clean energy infrastructure.</p> <h2>Infrastructure funding</h2> <p>Clinton promised $250bn in federal infrastructure funding and a $25bn \u201cnational infrastructure bank\u201d to create jobs and rehabilitate things such as the country\u2019s roads, airports, water and electrical grids . Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/us/obama-urges-funding-for-infrastructure-projects.html\">struggled for years</a> to pass major infrastructure funding through Congress, until he finally managed to convince lawmakers to back <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/a-major-infrastructure-bill-clears-congress/418827/\">a five-year, $305bn plan</a> last December. Clinton has said that higher taxes on the richest and corporations would offset the spending, and gave a few specifics about her plans, including expanded broadband internet around the US.</p> <p>Trump spoke at length about deteriorating conditions of American infrastructure in his speech, and has said at many rallies that he wants to reinvest in utilities and transportation at home. But in his speech in Detroit he only spoke of infrastructure vaguely, saying: \u201cWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports that our country deserves.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-obama-founder-isis-most-valuable-player\">Trump reiterates he literally believes Barack Obama is the 'founder of Isis'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Trade deals and tariffs</h2> <p>Both Clinton and Trump said they would renegotiate trade deals they deem unfavorable to the US. But while the Republican has said he would start from scratch on deals, and possibly impose tariffs as high as 45% on imports from foreign companies, the Democrat said she would specifically stop \u201cany trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans Pacific Partnership\u201d.</p> <p>She also said she would appoint \u201ca chief trade prosecutor, triple the number of enforcement officers, and when countries break the rules we won\u2019t hesitate to impose targeted tariffs\u201d \u2013 a less protectionist stance than Trump, yet sharing some of his philosophy about penalties directed at foreign corporations.</p> <h2>The \u2018death tax\u2019</h2> <p>Trump called for the repeal of the estate tax, a fine levied on wealthy inheritors that <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/research/ten-facts-you-should-know-about-the-federal-estate-tax\">affects about 0.2% of all Americans</a>, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, as the tax exempts the first $5.45m a person inherits. Clinton would leave the estate tax as law.</p> <h2>Families and childcare</h2> <p>Trump called for \u201callowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes\u201d, which would benefit most families with moderate to significant childcare costs but not low-income families, who would have the least to deduct, and who by definition, pay less in federal income taxes. His campaign has said he also supports a \u201ccredit to stay-at-home caregivers\u201d and an exemption on childcare expenses from half of payroll taxes.</p> <p>Clinton has proposed tax credits, subsidized childcare and increased pay for childcare workers \u2013 expensive proposals that she says will be offset by increased taxes and closed loopholes. She said she wants to limit the cost of childcare to 10% of family income, and to expand social security.</p> <h2>Higher education</h2> <p>Trump has largely ignored the issue of higher education, though he has bemoaned the high debts that many young Americans shoulder. In his speech, he merely said: \u201clikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice,\u201d an allusion to supporting the repeal of federal education standards at the grade and high school levels. His party\u2019s official platform supports privatizing student loans, saying: \u201cthe federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton said she would \u201cliberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and pay what you owe as a portion of your income\u201d. She also advocated for federal support for trade schools and \u201chigh-quality union training programs\u201d, and tax credits to companies that offer paid apprenticeships.</p> <p>Earlier this summer her campaign<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/06/hillary-clinton-college-tuition-sanders/86745342/\"> compromised with Bernie Sanders</a>, and agreed to support a plan that would eliminate tuition costs for four-year state colleges, for families who make less than $125,000 a year.</p>",

  "<p>It wasn\u2019t until my young daughter asked why Sam Newman was calling me and the rest of The Outer Sanctum\u2019s podcasters \u201cexcrement\u201d on national television that the full impact of our role in the Eddie McGuire\u2013Caroline Wilson controversy struck me. This followed the drowning \u201cjoke\u201d made by McGuire during the Triple M coverage of the MND Big Freeze. </p> <p>As one sixth of the all-female podcast (comprising Kate Seear, Felicity Race, Lucy Race, Emma Race, and Alicia Sometimes and myself) that broke the story the weekend before The Footy Show aired, I\u2019d been largely bemused by the furore that followed. There were six of us, for a start, and we\u2019d become fast friends over the months that led to the formation of The Outer Sanctum, cemented more recently by the almost out-of-body experience of being part of a viral media storm. We had each other\u2019s back. We checked in and supported each other throughout the ensuing chaos, sharing the media responsibilities and personal missives that flooded in \u2013 the interviews, the Twitter feed, the barrage of emails and Facebook messages \u2013 divvying them up according to whose work and family commitments at that moment were manageable, and whose were not. It had been a team effort from start to finish and reminded me, again, how resilient and rewarding this collaboration had been.<br></p> <p>But seeing Sam Newman\u2019s comments through the eyes of my 12-year-old daughter was confronting and unexpectedly upsetting. My daughter was horrified, but also confused. In her world, adults don\u2019t speak like that about other people \u2013 but here was a man, a total stranger, calling her mother a piece of shit. On national television. </p> <p>I quickly turned Sam Newman and his \u201cperfumed excrement\u201d monologue off. But it shook me. It shook us all.</p> <p>I will not pretend that The Outer Sanctum team were ever fans of The Footy Show. As a podcast that focuses on AFL, we feel an obligation to be across the mainstream and independent footy media, and although the ratings have slumped over the years, The Footy Show still attracts big-name players and has a prominent place on prime-time TV \u2013 albeit an unwarranted one, considering the ratings and the casual disregard for football content. (Particularly when you consider the long-running, thoughtful and entertaining Marngrook Footy Show<em> </em>broadcast on NITV.)</p> <p>We view The Footy Show as a necessary evil, and so we take turns watching it. Whoever performs this task generally suffers for the first 20 or 30 minutes, before they are free to turn it off. Duty performed, job done. </p> <p>That was how we felt about the show <em>before</em> Sam Newman called us \u201csecond-tier\u201d media, and perfumed excrement. For the record, this is what he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If you search for a cause to fit a narrative that you are peddling, eventually you will convince yourself that you have stumbled onto something, as most of the cowardly excrement have.</p> <p> Those excrement who have weighed into this, I would like to mention their names but as no one reads, watches or listens to them because they are in second-tier media outlets I won\u2019t bother.</p> <p> But if you spray a piece of excrement with perfume or put aftershave on a piece of excrement, at the end of the day it is still a piece of excrement.</p> </blockquote> <p> That night, as the team became aware of his comments, we turned to our phones, checking in with each other, registering our shock and disbelief \u2013 and also the predictability. We were treading on privileged and typically all-male turf, and the incumbents were unlikely to roll over without a fight. So we SMSed and DMed a flurry of reassurances, missives and, thankfully, jokes, because that was what had brought us together in the first place. The thing that had forged this powerful bond: laughter. Even in the height of the madness we could make each other laugh \u2013 and I remember thinking, thank God there are six of us. </p> <p>But I also worried that Erin Riley, <a href=\"http://erinriley.com.au/archives/2912\">whose blog about our podcast</a> had sent the social media world into overdrive, was operating under her own name. This made her a wider, more vulnerable target for the indolent trolls who wouldn\u2019t deign to investigate who The Outer Sanctum members actually were. As it turned out, ever the professional, Erin refused to kowtow to the abuse, conducting interviews on mainstream and independent media, and delving deeper into the issue in follow-up articles despite an onslaught of personalised attacks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2580fb63eff382b3498e79a19cdcdc2b601179fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2580fb63eff382b3498e79a19cdcdc2b601179fd/0_172_4394_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broadcaster Eddie McGuire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie McGuire participates in the Freeze MND slide at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 13 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Trafford/AFL Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week earlier, when we recorded the now infamous Episode 14, the prospect of coming under the belligerent gaze of an angry Sam Newman wasn\u2019t even on our radar. The week had been unlike any other for The Outer Sanctum \u2013 for all women, I\u2019d wager, but for entirely different reasons. That Wednesday, the AFL launched the inaugural women\u2019s league, an event we\u2019d watched live with genuine excitement and anticipation. Finally, <em>finally</em>, we were seeing the AFL acknowledge the importance of women\u2019s footy \u2013 not just to the women who play, the girls who want to, or even those never allowed to, but also, significantly, its importance for the future of the AFL (I\u2019d argue, for the future of sport in this nation).</p> <p>It was long overdue, but it was happening \u2013 and the momentum was building. The AFL community seemed genuinely pumped about this development, which was why we\u2019d deemed it the focus of this episode. That is, until our planning meeting that morning. </p> <p>Every week, half an hour before we record the show, we gather at Lucy Race\u2019s house to discuss the issues we want to include in the day\u2019s episode. On this day, Kate Seear, our sixth member, had work commitments, and we were joking about how the show would be shorter without (the ever thoughtful and articulate) Dr Seear around. Then Lucy showed us the MSN article criticising the comments about Caroline Wilson made by Eddie McGuire, Danny Frawley and James Brayshaw, and there was a decided shift in the room.</p> <p>In case you haven\u2019t seen or heard them yet:</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> In fact I reckon we should start the campaign for a one-person slide next year. Caroline Wilson. And I\u2019ll put in 10 grand straight away \u2013 make it 20. [laughter] And if she stays under, 50. [laughter] What do you reckon guys? Who else is up there? I know you\u2019re in JB?</p> <p><strong> James Brayshaw:</strong> No, yep. Straight in.</p> <p><strong> Danny Frawley:</strong> I\u2019ll be in amongst it Ed.</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> Is Duck there?</p> <p><strong> Wayne Carey:</strong> Yes, I\u2019m here mate.</p> <p><strong> McGuire: </strong>Duck\u2019s in. Danny\u2019s in \u2013 already spoken up.</p> <p><strong> Frawley:</strong> Yeah I\u2019m in Ed.</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> I could do an auction here today.</p> <p><strong> Frawley:</strong> I\u2019ll actually jump in and make sure she doesn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ll hold her under, Ed.</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> I reckon we could charge ten thousand for everyone to stand around the outside and bomb her.</p> <p><strong> Damien Barrett:</strong> I\u2019m on Caro\u2019s side now, Ed. I\u2019m on Caro\u2019s side these days, Ed.</p> <p> [indecipherable]</p> <p><strong> McGuire: </strong>She\u2019ll burn you like everyone else, mate. She\u2019s like the black widow. She just sucks you in and gets you and you start talking to her and then <em>bang</em>! She gets you.</p> <p><strong> Brayshaw:</strong> If you ran that auction from down there, I reckon you\u2019d start grabbing some bids out of the seats too. There\u2019d be money piling in everywhere</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> It\u2019ll be magnificent. I think we should do that next year. It\u2019s all good for footy.</p> <p><strong> Brayshaw: </strong>Bloody oath.</p> <p>We decided, unanimously, that we\u2019d talk about McGuire\u2019s comments on the show. This was exactly the kind of issue that The Outer Sanctum team cared about most deeply \u2013 our <em>raison d\u2019\u00eatre</em>. The only question that arose, the only hesitation in covering it, was whether it had actually happened, because we could find no other coverage of the comments anywhere else. It seemed impossible that such provocative and controversial language from high-profile personalities \u2013 commentators of the game, but also two club presidents \u2013 could slip by the mainstream media unreported. But we investigated, established their veracity, and included it in our run sheet.</p> <p>Importantly, we didn\u2019t open with this story. We were reluctant to dampen the excitement we all felt around the women\u2019s league announcement, the glow of seeing women in AFL guernseys featured in an AFL broadcast still warm on our cheeks. But we also understood the Triple M incident could not pass unchecked.</p> <p>We went into some detail about which clubs secured teams, the surprises, the disappointments, as well as the individuals involved in the process, which led, quite naturally, to the comments Eddie McGuire had made about Caroline Wilson. If you <a href=\"http://www.outersanctum.com.au/#!Podcast-14/zzlhx/576242f70cf235a69b2369e6\">listen to our podcast, you can hear a slight tremor in Lucy\u2019s voice</a> as she describes the language he used. We all felt shaken by it. Confronted and offended, but also hurt. </p> <p> It is worth listening all the way through the Triple M segment. Too often ignored is that, after the commentary team leaves McGuire, you can hear Wayne Carey quickly remove himself from the \u201cteam bid\u201d, the moment he understood what had just transpired: \u201cJust to clarify, when he [Eddie] said, \u2018Duck, are you in?\u2019 I thought he meant would I go down the slide\u2026 [I\u2019m] not in on the bid on Caroline.\u201d</p> <p> If Carey, a former footballer who has previously been accused of violence against women, and has on one occasion been convicted of indecent assault, could identify the toxicity of the \u201cbanter\u201d, then surely it should have been obvious to a media-savvy, highly influential broadcasting professional like McGuire.</p> <p>In our discussion, each of us had concerns with the content, the tone and the generally ugly stacks-on mentality of the segment. We expressed surprise and disappointment that the commentary \u201cwas disrespectful to\u201d a very worthy event \u2013 a Motor Neurone Disease awareness campaign \u2013 as well as at the hypocrisy that McGuire and company would \u201cfall over themselves\u201d to help Geelong footballer Jimmy Bartel raise awareness around family violence in his excellent #FaceUpToDV campaign, and yet joke about drowning a female colleague. </p> <p>We were particularly concerned that it had the potential to ruin what was a momentous week for women\u2019s footy. We finished the episode with an interview with Bridget Barker, who had headed North Melbourne\u2019s (unsuccessful) bid for a women\u2019s team. The podcast went live the next day, Friday. On Saturday night, Erin Riley, a listener of The Outer Sanctum, contacted us about the McGuire comments and our take on it, then put together her article headlined <a href=\"http://erinriley.com.au/archives/2912\">Eddie McGuire, Caroline Wilson, and violence against women: the AFL must act</a>, which promptly went viral. Social media backed the blog and the podcast via Twitter and, with the support of fellow podcasters at The Footy Gospel, as well as encouragement and advice from Fairfax journalist and excellent human Andrew Stafford, by Monday it was front-page news and the central conversation point for mainstream and social media around the country. There were reports as far flung as the United Kingdom, and as it was only a couple of weeks out from the federal election, questions about McGuire\u2019s comments even permeated the prime minister\u2019s campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"734ae95ca5a1c5587f62a2f5bcb19a0364dcc3dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/734ae95ca5a1c5587f62a2f5bcb19a0364dcc3dc/0_77_2469_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie McGuire leaves Collingwood football club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie McGuire leaves the Collingwood\u2019s headquarters on Tuesday, 20 June, having been backed to continue as the club\u2019s president.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> For the most part, commentators recognised that the comments were out of order, and understood they represented a larger, more complex social issue surrounding casual sexism and the evidential correlation between misogynistic language and violence against women. However, there was also a significant proportion of the community who criticised Caroline Wilson for \u201cbringing it on herself\u201d, due to the robustness of her particular style of journalism. Journalism, it must be noted, that has won awards and broken stories that have changed the sport, arguably forever. </p> <p>When you unpack this criticism \u2013 the scale of it, the language employed and the vitriol underlying it \u2013 it provides yet another example of the consistently gendered response saved for female journalists. This point has played out in many forums over the years, but most recently, and most relevant to the Australian media landscape, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments\">was the research carried out by The<em> </em>Guardian into the nature of its own comments thread</a>, which demonstrated, categorically, \u201cthat articles written by women attract more abuse and dismissive trolling than those written by men, regardless of what the article is about\u201d.</p> <p>In an even clearer demonstration of how to miss the point, much of the attention, when it finally came, focused on the personalities involved. That Eddie McGuire and, to a lesser degree, <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/its-time-for-eddie-mcguire-to-go/news-story/a411fb1c4dc5a2ca2b48dced8af5ae4a\">Danny Frawley</a>, had form in using divisive and problematic language in the past only aggravated the situation, as too many claimed the problem lies with McGuire, Frawley, and Brayshaw, or even Triple M, rather than the system and society itself. At one point, the entire debate seemed stuck on whether these men should be removed from their posts \u2013 as if that would present some kind of solution \u2013 rather than acknowledging that the issue is bigger than any of these individuals, and more complex. Indeed, that it reaches beyond footy, beyond sport, extending well into the reaches of broader society \u2013 including the media itself.</p> <p>This point was exemplified by the ever predictable Murdoch columnist Andrew Bolt, who demonstrated the pervasiveness of the very issue at play when he <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/andrew-bolt/andrew-bolt-lets-call-out-the-real-sexists-in-eddie-mcguire-drowning-scandal-emirates/news-story/dff7780d16e045e1720caaf0ccda7a55\">referred to the women of The Outer Sanctum and Erin Riley as \u201cmummy bloggers\u201d</a>, opining that <em>our</em> commentary was sexist itself: \u201cthe outrage machine \u2013 the likes of Rosie Batty, the huffpuffing <em>Age</em> and the mummy bloggers \u2013 are making far too much of McGuire\u2019s joke\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMummy blogger\u201d is itself a deeply problematic and loaded term, reflecting a sexist view that carries with it an accusation of amateurism and inferiority due to gender and the (incorrect) presumption that women of a certain age are invariably mothers and therefore <em>not</em> professional. Moreover, though, his comments indicate a total lack of research \u2013 the very foundation of quality journalism. Rather than uncovering whom \u201cthe outrage machine\u201d might comprise, he simply writes us off as aspirants and amateurs, gendering this dismissiveness to boot. What is the likelihood that Bolt would refer to six men producing a podcast about AFL as \u201cdaddy bloggers\u201d? Further, it echoes the implication underlying Sam Newman\u2019s \u201csecond-tier media\u201d and \u201cexcrement\u201d attack, that only certain people are entitled to speak (first-tier media?) and that those people already control the microphone.</p> <p>For the record, the \u201cmummy bloggers\u201d Bolt refused to rate include award-winning broadcaster, producer and entrepreneur <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emsyanna?lang=en\">Emma Race</a>, who has more than 15 years\u2019 experience in commercial and community radio and TV. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aliciasometimes?lang=en\">Alicia Sometimes</a> is a poet, writer and broadcaster who has produced and presented media across commercial and community networks for almost two decades, most recently co-editing an anthology of footy stories featuring some of Australia\u2019s most highly regarded writers and thinkers. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FelicityCG?lang=en\">Felicity Race</a> and Lucy Race jointly run a business and each have more than a decade\u2019s experience in marketing and communications, respectively. Academic and practising lawyer Dr Kate Seear\u2019s curriculum vitae would fill pages \u2013 suffice to say, she is an expert in the intersections between drug and alcohol use, gender, family violence and the law, and had (incidentally) spent the days before the podcast broadcast reading the Royal Commission on Family Violence\u2019s 1,900-page report for an academic paper she was co-authoring on the subject.</p> <p>Guests of The Outer Sanctum have included, among others, award-winning sports journalist Sam Lane; first out (male) AFL footballer and LGBTIQ activist Jason Ball; federal sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins; Marngrook Footy Show panellist and Indigenous activist Shelley Ware; the first female AFL club president, Peggy O\u2019Neal; Bulldogs vice-president Dr Susan Alberti; the AFL\u2019s first female goal umpire to officiate a grand final, Chelsea Roffey; and, as a direct result of this controversy, an extended conversation with Caroline Wilson, which we included in the follow-up episode.</p> <p>Also, none of us blog. </p> <p><a href=\"http://erinriley.com.au/home\">Erin Riley</a>, whose post about the issue went viral, is a highly regarded journalist who has written for Guardian Australia, The Age<em>,</em> Sydney Morning Herald, and The Drum, among others, and has written widely about sport, politics and gender. At least she could, in fairness, be referred to as a blogger, given she also writes a blog. But based on that definition, so too could Andrew Bolt. (The circularity and hypocrisy of Bolt\u2019s argument is truly dizzying.)</p> <p>While none of us had the slightest notion of the scale of controversy our podcast would engender, when we first formed The Outer Sanctum we knew it would give voice to stories not ordinarily heard. The point was to have fun while creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone; but mostly, we wanted to discuss the issues that matter to us, as women, as parents, as people \u2013 though always, ultimately, as fans of the game. </p> <p>This was our position prior to that first episode, and remains our position today.</p> <p>Incredibly, the effect of the episode and the ensuing fallout seems to be lasting. In the immediate aftermath of the story, the Victoria Police released a memo reminding members of the power of language and the role it plays in enabling a culture of violence. Holden reconsidered its sponsorship of the Collingwood Football Club, deciding in the end to redirect a significant portion of the funds to support women\u2019s football at Collingwood. In response to Newman\u2019s comments, there are reports that Nissan\u2019s sponsorship of The Footy Show is in doubt, and the AFL has invited anti-violence advocates Our Watch to present at the next AFL presidents and CEOs\u2019 meeting on the prevention of violence against women and children. The invitation referred directly to the McGuire comments, which, according to commissioner Mike Fitzpatrick, \u201cshow how much more work there is to be done\u201d. The Richmond Football Club players took it upon themselves to boycott Triple M\u2019s coverage that week and McGuire publicly apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d, and to Caroline Wilson privately (albeit after some delay and on a third attempt), before taking an extended leave of absence from the media. As a result, reporter Sarah Jones debuted as anchor for Fox Footy.</p> <p>Perhaps more poignant, though, are the countless anecdotes shared by people we know and people we don\u2019t about how they\u2019re rethinking the way they address each other, and how they use language. People who are asking questions and seeking feedback in the hope of ensuring that what they want to say reflects what is actually heard. This, more than anything, is the measure of how far we\u2019ve come. At the very least, I hope it will mean I never again have to explain to my daughter why a complete stranger would call her mum perfumed excrement on national television.</p> <p><em>This essay was published in partnership with <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/\">Griffith Review</a> to coincide with the <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/editions/our-sporting-life/\">Our sporting life edition</a></em></p>",

The suit demands unspecified compensatory damages.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Phillip \u201cproduced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee cap\u201d during a car trip to check on volunteers in Greenville, South Carolina in February:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Phillip pushed the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee.

  "<p>In a fiery speech that sharply criticized her opponent\u2019s economic vision for the US, Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump\u2019s proposals will only benefit the rich, while destroying the economy in tandem.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Speaking before hundreds of union workers and supporters on Thursday, Clinton positioned her plan as a boon for the middle class, with a pledge to curry support in Congress for the largest investment in \u201cgood-paying jobs\u201d since the second world war by rebuilding infrastructure across the nation.</p> <p>\u201cWe will put Americans to work, building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are way overdue for this, my friends. We are living off the investments that were made by our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">Trump\u2019s plan</a>, by contrast, doesn\u2019t offer any \u201ccredible solutions to the very real economic challenges we face\u201d, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe would give trillions in tax cuts to corporations \u2026 that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare and environmental protection,\u201d Clinton said.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign said her plan would add more than 10m jobs across the US. It would include employment opportunities for outgoing prison inmates and youth, as well as billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. Despite embracing a more upbeat view of the nation\u2019s outlook compared to her opponent, Clinton noted that income inequality has continued to increase in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just too hard to get ahead today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are commonsense things that your government can do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don\u2019t we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s 50-minute speech in south-east Michigan followed an economic policy rollout on Monday by her opponent \u2013 whose remarks in Detroit were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">interrupted more than a dozen times</a> by protesters. Trump\u2019s subdued speech (by his standards) took repeated shots at Clinton, in particular by saying her \u201cfailed\u201d economic agenda is indicative of problems in Detroit, which emerged from municipal bankruptcy just under two years ago. </p> <p>The former secretary of state vehemently pushed back against Trump on Thursday, saying his plan is a rehashed playbook of trickle-down economics, and will only benefit millionaires and billionaires. In particular, she dubbed one aspect of her opponent\u2019s plan as the \u201cTrump loophole\u201d: a proposal to slash income taxes for corporations by more than half.</p> <p>\u201cIt would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate in income for many of his companies,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.\u201d One analyst, she noted, said Trump\u2019s plan would be a \u201creally nice deal \u2013 for Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate the estate tax, which applies to estates larger than $5.45m for individuals, would also shore up his family\u2019s finances, Clinton said.</p> <p>\u201cThat alone would save the Trump family $4bn,\u201d she claimed. \u201cIt would do nothing for 99.8% of Americans. So they\u2019d get a $4bn tax cut, and 99.8% of Americans would get nothing. Just think of what we could do with those four billion.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee\u2019s speech didn\u2019t highlight new significant economic proposals, instead taking aim at Trump\u2019s pledge for immense deregulation, including a temporary moratorium on federal agency rules. She said Trump\u2019s plan would eliminate regulations that \u201cstop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe, and the water we drink\u201d. In Michigan, the city of Flint has been reeling from a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">two-year water contamination crisis</a>, an issue Clinton has repeatedly highlighted on the campaign trail this year.</p> <p>\u201cNow there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, he\u2019s really on the side of the little guy,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe it. Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable.\u201d</p> <p>She also hit back on Trump\u2019s intense criticism to US trade deals supported by Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too often that past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out,\u201d she said. But the answer, she added, isn\u2019t to \u201crant or rave and cut ourselves off from the world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat would end up killing even more jobs; the answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s trade remarks were, perhaps, the latest in a move to appeal to progressives who remain skeptical of her policy stances, following the exit of Senator Bernie Sanders from the Democratic presidential race. In public, Clinton\u2019s support for the TPP has wavered since last fall, when she <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/07/hillary-clinton-opposes-trans-pacific-partnership-tpp\">broke from the Obama administration</a> and came out against the 12-country deal.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a walk-away,\u201d he told the newspaper of the Clinton-Trump race in Macomb County. \u201cBut I think Clinton is doing the right stuff. By coming here, she\u2019s demonstrating that she\u2019s committed.\u201d Clinton opened up a near double-digit lead on Trump <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/03/poll-clinton-leads-trump-michigan/88048440/\">in recent state polls</a>.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s state campaign shouldn\u2019t relax a moment, though, said Michigan\u2019s former Democratic governor James Blanchard.</p> <p>\u201cI once won an election by 70% and I didn\u2019t know I was going to do that until the day after. I once lost an election by a quarter of a point and everyone told me I was going to win by 20. So you really have to be careful on polls,\u201d Blanchard said. </p> <p>The former governor and US congressman said the close primary race in Michigan with Sanders was a \u201cgood wake-up call\u201d for the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t really spend any time here,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cI think the polls, again the polls showed a big lead.

About a dozen Trump supporters gathered outside, carrying signs that read: \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not ready for the next war\u201d.</p> <p>Matt Vanderwest, a 50-year-old operating engineer and lifelong Democrat from western Michigan, said Tuesday\u2019s speech was the first political event he has ever attended.</p> <p>\u201cThis election is a pretty crucial one to be involved in,\u201d he said. In the primary election, Vanderwest said he supported Sanders \u201cfor a while\u201d, but has since transferred over to Clinton.

  "<p>Straight out of college, I dated a guy from Washington DC who had just spent a few years working on the redevelopment of public housing projects in Chicago.

It also strikes me that although he has been frequently criticized for his handling of race and policies regarding the overall inequities experienced by black folks in America, among the most important aspects of his legacy is that he is going to leave that Oval Office as blackity black as he was when he entered. And that means mic drops, an entire absence of fucks, and dope playlists.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGy9i8vvCxk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HGy9i8vvCxk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>From the daytime list, which includes Wale, Jidenna, Nina Simone and Prince, the standout here is Aloe Blacc\u2019s The Man, both because it\u2019s a bonafide black man\u2019s anthem \u2013 \u201cStand up now and face the sun/Won\u2019t hide my tail or turn and run/It\u2019s time to do what must be done/Be a king when kingdom comes\u201d \u2013 and because Blacc is a national treasure.

  "<p>The publication for the first time in Iran of an audio recording from nearly three decades ago has reopened old wounds from the darkest period in the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>In the summer of 1988, thousands of leftists and supporters of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) organisation were executed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/iran-tribunal-investigates-massacre\">massacre of political prisoners</a>. In the pre-internet age, the incident was subject to a media blackout in Iran and received scant attention abroad, unlike other acts of carnage that rank alongside it, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/srebrenica-massacre\">Srebrenica</a>.</p> <p>Only one senior Iranian official dared to speak out at the time: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/dec/20/grand-ayatollah-hossein-ali-montazeri-obituary\">Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri</a>, who was in line to lead the country after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then supreme leader and the leader of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iranian-revolution\">1979 Iranian revolution</a>. </p> <p>Montazeri wrote a number of letters to Khomeini condemning the executions, and the grand ayatollah soon fell out of favour. He was later placed under house arrest and faced huge restrictions until his death in December 2009.</p> <p>This week, on the 28th anniversary of that bleak summer, Montazeri\u2019s official website, run by his family and followers, published an audio file from a meeting he held in 1988 with senior judges and judiciary officials involved in the mass executions. <br></p> <p>In an extraordinarily blunt manner, Montazeri is heard telling his audience, among them the sharia judge and public prosecutors, \u201cIn my view, the biggest crime in the Islamic Republic, for which the history will condemn us, has been committed at your hands, and they\u2019ll write your names as criminals in the history.\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/aug/11/iranian-journalist-jailed-for-insulting-the-supreme-leader\">Iranian journalist jailed for 'insulting the supreme leader'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 1988 mass execution is believed to have started after the MEK forces, which had defected to Iraq and were fighting alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saddam-hussein\">Saddam Hussein</a> against their countrymen, launched an unsuccessful military incursion against Iranian forces. The MEK, which was listed as a terrorist organisation by the US and Europe for many years, is still hugely unpopular in Iran because of its terror campaign after the revolution. It has become a cult-like group, condemned by the UN for its treatment of its own members. <br></p> <p>In the audio recording, Montazeri tells his audience that he believes the authorities had a plan to execute political prisoners for a few years and found a good excuse in the wake of the incursion. Montazeri\u2019s own son, Mohammad, was a \u201cmartyr\u201d of the 1979 revolution, whose assassination the ayatollah blamed on the MEK. Not all the people killed in 1988 were MEK supporters and most were in jail for some time. <br></p> <p>The ayatollah says he felt compelled to speak out because otherwise he would not have an answer on the \u201cjudgment day\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep and every night it occupies my mind for two to three hours \u2026 what do you have to tell to the families?\u201d <br></p> <p>Later in the recording, Montazeri insinuates that the number of people executed since the revolution outnumbered those put to death by the deposed Shah. When an official seeks his consent for the last group of around 200 people to be executed, he is heard saying fiercely: \u201cI don\u2019t give permission at all. I am opposed even to a single person being executed.\u201d</p> <p>Although execution of dissidents was rife in Iran in the 1980s, the 1988 summer executions were on a different scale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international\">Amnesty International</a> estimates the number of people put to death in that summer alone to be about 4,500, although others talk of bigger numbers. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/homa-hoodfar-detention-iran-unjust-unislamic\">The detention of Homa Hoodfar is unjust and unIslamic.

Thousands of prisoners were brought before committees and asked whether they renounced their political affiliation, if they were Muslims, whether they prayed and if they believed in the Islamic Republic. Some were also asked if they were prepared to walk through Iraqi minefields, according to the audio file. <br></p> <p>Those who gave a negative answer in questioning that lasted a few minutes were put to death. Many were buried in a piece of unmarked land in the Khavaran cemetery near Tehran. Every year, as families gather to commemorate the deaths, riot police block their way. <br></p> <p>The emergence of the audio file has revived calls for an inquiry into the executions. Over the past 28 years, survivors and families of the victims have tried to support each other. In January, an Iranian woman who lost five children and one son-in-law in executions in the 1980s \u2013 Nayereh Jalali Mohajer, known as \u201cMother Behkish\u201d \u2013 died. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/iran-tribunal-families-ordeal\"> Sahar Mohammadi, who lost his parents and two uncles</a>, told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s no other way than this massacre to be investigated and perpetrators brought to justice in a fair, real trial.\u201d Mohammadi said she had heard from several families that Montazeri managed to prevent the execution of many prisoners. </p> <p>Mehdi Aslani, a survivor who spent five years in jail, likened the emergence of the audio file to finding the black box of a plane that has crashed: \u201cWe know what has happened but we\u2019re hearing the last words of the pilot.\u201d Aslani said he shared a cell with a dozen others who were put to death, including Jahanbakhsh Sarkhosh, who was executed despite nearing the end of his jail sentence \u2013 \u201conly seven months were left\u201d, he said. Another victim, Jalil Shahbazi, took his own life after coming under a great deal of pressure from the death committee. <br></p> <p>Madyar Samienejad, who monitors the human rights situation in Iran from Norway, said the audio file revealed the tip of an iceberg of buried historical facts. \u201cWe\u2019re in fact hearing a part of history, a history that people of Iran have not been allowed to hear about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe heard a lot during all these years from witnesses and families but this audio tape is a historical evidence.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iran-blog/2016/apr/29/iran-view-donald-trump-ahmadinejad-us-presidential-race-nuclear-deal-hillary-clinton\">Iranian view of Donald Trump: familiar but no atomic challenger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Samienejad criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani\">Hassan Rouhani</a>, the Iranian president, for appointing Mostafa Pourmohammadi, whom Montazeri criticises in the recording, as his minister of justice.

Just hit him up on Facebook.</p> <p>The White House <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/us/politics/obama-facebook.html?_r=0\">unveiled</a> a new feature on Wednesday that allows Facebook users to contact him via Messenger \u2013 just like they would any of their other friends on the site \u2013 using a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatbots\">chatbot</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHi! It\u2019s great to hear from you \u2013 and we\u2019re excited to learn what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d a message from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/\">White House Facebook page</a> reads. It pops up automatically when you click the message button. The bot prompts you to click \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d before asking for your message. It gives you an option to proofread your message before sending, then asks for your mailing address and phone number.</p> <p>Once your information is confirmed, it sends you a smiley face emoji and a clip from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG00mM8QEGk\">2009 video</a> of Obama speaking about letters from the public. The video mentions that the president reads 10 letters from the public every day, which the bot also states in its opening message. \u201cThese letters, I think, do more to keep me in touch with what\u2019s happening around the country than just about anything else,\u201d Obama said in the video.</p> <p>The interaction is fairly straightforward, but doesn\u2019t respond if you try to type an answer to its yes-or-no questions instead of clicking the buttons. When you go off script, the bot prompts you to return with a \u201cWhoops!\u201d or \u201cOops!\u201d or directs your to WhiteHouse.gov for more information.</p> <p>Previously, Americans could leave a message for the president by phone, email or letter. Reading letters from the public dates back to Thomas Jefferson, a White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/10/now-you-can-message-president-obama-facebook\">press release</a> stated; this is the newest, most tech-savvy way to do it.</p> <p>Using Messenger bots is a new and popular way for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/13/facebook-army-chatbots-messenger-news-sports\">news services and other companies</a> to tell users about news, weather and other topics.

Anyone who used AOL Instant Messenger \u2013 better known as AIM \u2013 in its early 2000s heyday probably remembers the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-history-of-smarterchild\">SmarterChild</a> bot. It answered questions in a conversational tone and was widely used as a punching bag for teens testing out cursing.

Under the Twitter handle POTUS, Obama recently dropped his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/763744742072913920\">summer 2016 playlist</a>. The White House has its own Snapchat account.

  "<p>\u201cThis is an American-style hour,\u201d says <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ari-shaffir-ari-s-p-e-c-t\">Ari Shaffir</a> at the top of his Edinburgh festival show. \u201cSo there\u2019s no theme and no crying.\u201d So is that the American style of comedy? (No one seems to have told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/10/chris-gethard-at-edinburgh-festival-review-frank-and-funny-tales-of-depression\">Chris Gethard</a>.) I\u2019ve seen a handful of US acts this first week on the fringe, and it\u2019s interesting to note the features that, to some degree, make them distinctive.</p> <p>The biggest name was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Burr\">Bill Burr</a> \u2013 who is not performing on the fringe, but visiting the Pleasance for two nights as part of a UK tour. His set was rapturously received in some quarters, but mainly left me nonplussed \u2013 that there remains such a large, receptive audience for this brand of alpha-male comedy, and that they give him a free pass for some tawdry and barely substantiated material.</p> <p>No doubt Burr is, technically, a terrific, authoritative comic, even if his shouty style is wearing after 75 minutes. I was happy to go with his anti-fat people material to begin with. Yes, on paper, it\u2019s mean-spirited, but Burr does enough to give the material a provocative point, concerning the currency of victimhood and who gets to spend it. There are also promising if undeveloped opening gags about Islamic State and the US election (he plays down the differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/05/edinburgh-festival-shows-to-see-today\">Edinburgh festival planner: three shows to see today</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he moves on to feminism, it gets harder to enjoy. The pay gap is fine by Burr, it seems, because men have to pay for everything in relationships. But how do you go about finding that funny, when its premise is \u2013 for most of us, surely \u2013 about four decades out of date? And yet, Burr is all swaggering self-assurance as he delivers this tired stuff, loftily dismissing protests from a woman in the front row as he does so. \u201cI know I\u2019m coming off like a fuckin\u2019 caveman,\u201d he keeps saying. And sure enough, this is the brand of standup that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2016/jul/20/zoe-coombs-marr-why-an-angry-lesbian-in-her-30s-should-be-person-of-the-year\">Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr</a> has been mocking in character as Dave at the last two fringe festivals.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine a UK comic \u2013 Dapper Laughs? Jim Davidson? \u2013 delivering a similar set, but it\u2019s presumably common fare in the States, given that Shaffir (whose show I enjoyed more) isn\u2019t wholly dissimilar. Shaffir, too, plays the unapologetic, unreconstructed, high(ish)-status male, talking about anal sex, how much he loves \u201cweed\u201d, how he couldn\u2019t bring himself to have sex with a Thai ladyboy. There\u2019s one extended section on how \u201cchildren are garbage\u201d, which is a hackneyed shock-standup premise, and another on abortions.</p> <p>But while he\u2019s a long way from charming, there is a fraction more self-irony to Shaffir\u2019s act than Burr\u2019s. None of his observations are as hoary as the worst of his compatriot\u2019s, and there are choice gags here, too. I liked his weird Willy Wonka-ish snapshot of the <a href=\"http://www.heineken.com/nl/Heineken-Experience/Heineken-Experience\">Heineken Experience</a> in Amsterdam, and he\u2019s got a neat line about the fate he has in store for people who text-message while walking the streets of New York. I found him funnier, in short, when he wasn\u2019t straining to show how macho he was.</p> <p>Neither Burr nor Shaffir has a theme to their show; the latter scorns to do so. The \u201ctheme\u201d is a vexed topic of comedy conversation. Edinburgh is held to impose a need for meaning, narrative and coherence that is inimical to \u201cpure\u201d standup. Maybe Shaffir\u2019s right that this is less common in the US. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/07/michelle-wolf-at-edinburgh-festival-review\">Michelle Wolf\u2019s show</a>, at the Pleasance Courtyard, backs him up. But <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/24-hours-with-mary-lynn-rajskub\">Mary Lynn Rajskub</a>, at the Assembly George Square, has brought a storytelling comedy show to town, and she\u2019s as American as an apple pie in a Stetson.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes, Mary Lynn Rajskub's show is so slow it almost starts moving backwards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rajskub is selling tickets on the back of her prominent role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/24\">TV show 24</a>. To a small degree, her show draws on it, too. She spins a few tales of her work on the series, then a story of how, after it stopped, she went on the road to reconnect with her standup roots. It is, I must say, a curious hour, rambling in the extreme and in crying need of an editor. Towards the end, it\u2019s just one seemingly arbitrary piece of information after another, as we go to the school fair, her husband fixes up a camping trip and her son is hospitalised for overeating Skittles.</p> <p>The intention seems to be to share a depressive episode Rajskub experienced after a fan of 24 collared her in a backstage toilet in Peoria, Illinois. The raw material for that is here \u2013 lonely nights in faceless hotel rooms; a crush on a yoga teacher, far from home \u2013 but she struggles to corral it into a focused hour. Sometimes the show is so slow it almost starts moving backwards, and notwithstanding Rajskub\u2019s warmth as a host, it supplies far more wan smiles than laughs. We\u2019re a long way from the race-against-time adrenaline rush of 24, in a show that probably isn\u2019t \u201cAmerican-style\u201d, nor really up to the Edinburgh fringe\u2019s high standards, either.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump refused to back down from his false claim that Barack Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Thursday, insisting: \u201cHe was the founder ... The way he got out of Iraq was the founding of Isis.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate was speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who had attempted to reframe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-calls-barack-obama-the-founder-of-isis\">his remark</a>, telling him: \u201cI know what you meant \u2013 you meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.\u201d </p> <p>But Trump disagreed. \u201cNo, I meant that he\u2019s the founder of Isis, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the most valuable player \u2013 I gave him the most valuable player award. I give her too, by the way,\u201d he added of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Trump did acknowledge that the root of his argument was that if Obama \u201chad done things properly, you wouldn\u2019t have had Isis\u201d, but he repeated: \u201cTherefore, he was the founder of Isis.\u201d </p> <p>And he doggedly pursued that line of thought in a later speech to homebuilders in Miami on Thursday, now suggesting it was Clinton who would be given \u201cthe most valuable player award\u201d by Islamic State. \u201cHer only competition is Barack Obama,\u201d he said, adding of Clinton: \u201cOh boy, is Isis hoping for her.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks about Isis came while he is still dealing with backlash from his hint that gun rights supporters might attack Clinton, something that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">seemed to cause genuine shock</a> in a country that has grown used to Trump pushing the boundaries of appropriate political discourse. On Thursday, Patti Davis, the daughter of late Republican former president Ronald Reagan, joined his critics to lambast him for what she called a \u201cglib and horrifying comment\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI am the daughter of a man who was shot by someone who got his inspiration from a movie, someone who believed if he killed the president the actress from that movie would notice him,\u201d she said, referring to the attempted assassination of Reagan by John Hinckley in 1981. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remark about Clinton, she said, \u201cwas heard by the person sitting alone in a room, locked in his own dark fantasies, who sees unbridled violence as a way to make his mark in the world, and is just looking for ideas. Yes, Mr Trump, words matter. But then you know that, which makes this all even more horrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Trump first claimed Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Wednesday night at a rally in Sunrise, Florida.</p> <p>\u201cIsis is honoring President Obama,\u201d Trump said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>. \u201cHe is the founder of Isis.

The Democratic candidate is 7.9 points ahead in the latest polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">compiled by Real Clear Politics</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://time.com/4447527/donald-trump-republican-national-committee/\">Time magazine claimed</a> that Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus had told Trump that if he did not manage to right his campaign, the party might abandon support for his presidential bid and focus instead on Republicans running for Congress elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>Quoting two anonymous party officials familiar with the conversation, Time said Priebus had told Trump that internal polling suggested he was on track to lose the election and that he would have been better off heading to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a break than hitting the trail after the convention.</p> <p>Trump dismissed the story. \u201cReince Priebus is a terrific guy,\u201d he told Time. \u201cHe never said that.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was attempting to shift the focus to the economy on Thursday with a speech in Detroit. She intended to try to make the case that Trump\u2019s policies would benefit him and his wealthy friends, and to characterize his plans as an update of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d. </p> <p>Her speech was in part a response to one given by Trump in the beleaguered Rust Belt city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">on Monday</a>, when he proposed dramatically slashing taxes, reducing income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and eliminating income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. </p> <p>That speech had been intended to reboot his flagging campaign, but was soon overtaken by the controversy over his \u201csecond amendment people\u201d comments, which in turn gave way to Wednesday\u2019s remarks about Obama and Isis. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> have long sought to blame the turmoil in the Middle East on the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, often criticizing the president for underestimating the threat Isis poses. But Trump has routinely gone a step further by stating directly that Obama is sympathetic to terrorists. Immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline\">12 June mass shooting</a> at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead and 53 injured, Trump said cryptically that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands\u201d. </p> <p>In his speech on Wednesday, the former reality TV star pointedly chose several times to repeat the president\u2019s full name, Barack Hussein Obama.</p> <p>The origins of Isis trace back to the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The group has been deemed an offshoot of al-Qaida, which carried out the attacks on 9/11. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group. US army Lt Gen Sean MacFarland said on Wednesday an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">estimated 45,000 fighters</a> linked to Isis had been killed in the two years since the US-led military coalition against the network was launched.</p> <p>Trump has not articulated a clear strategy against Isis, other than to threaten a ruthless bombing campaign and continuously push his proposal to ban Muslim immigration from the US.</p>",

Of three cameras visible in its maintenance compound, one points directly at the access road to the home of David Milne, one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, who lives in a former coastguard station overlooking the course, and his neighbour Susie Munro, another opponent. As of last week, there was no visible sign warning visitors that CCTV was being used.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s critics fear the resort could use its CCTV systems to track their and guests\u2019 movements, even though Scotland\u2019s robust right to roam law entitles the public have a legal right to walk across the resort. Trump\u2019s staff vigorously denied using CCTV covertly. </p> <p>In a statement responding to questions from the Guardian about its use of CCTV cameras and storage of confidential data, Trump International Golf Course Scotland said: \u201cWe take the security of our employees and guests\u2019 personal data very seriously and comply with all aspects of the Data Protection Act. A clerical oversight has just been brought to our attention which is now being rectified.\u201d <br></p> <p>Asked about allegations that CCTV was used to track legitimate activity by the public on or next to the course, the company said: \u201cAs a public facility open to all, Trump International has CCTV cameras located at its entrance and around the public buildings within the estate, for the safety and security of its members, guests and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe company has no need for cameras outwith those areas and has never had any cause to supply CCTV footage in any criminal proceedings. No other CCTV activity has ever taken place in or around the Trump estate and the allegation of intrusive surveillance of neighbouring properties is unfounded and categorically untrue.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"777b91d6dfbc2787049b56cced82ca97e7388eee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/777b91d6dfbc2787049b56cced82ca97e7388eee/636_400_2955_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Milne lives in an old coast guard station near Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire golf course.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Milne lives in an old coast guard station near Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire golf course.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milne and Baxter have demanded that the course release any data it holds on them, and protested about the company\u2019s failure to register, despite buying the Menie estate 10 years ago and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/10/donald-trump-scotland-golf-course\">opening the 18-hole golf course in 2012</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s opponents and neighbours claim security staff or managers have repeatedly challenged them on the course, appearing close to where they are walking or monitoring them visiting neighbours next to the resort by driving close to its boundary.</p> <p>Baxter was arrested with a colleague for breach of the peace next to Trump\u2019s resort after staff accused them of filming without permission while they were making a documentary on the tycoon\u2019s quest to build the resort.

  "<p>Here\u2019s a news flash: if you\u2019re a progressive, you can and should critique Hillary Clinton right now \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t have to mean that you want Donald Trump to be president.</p> <p>It means we are still using our brains, \u201cThat we are not checkmated,\u201d as Michelle Alexander <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/24/black-thinkers-bernie-sanders-studied-clintons-true-cost\">puts it</a>, that engaging in discourse is not just possible, but necessary in a race with less than terrific choices. No matter who you ultimately vote for, don\u2019t stop demanding a candidate endorse policies that benefit you in order to get your support, even if you vote for them.</p> <p>Clinton should be pushed relentlessly by the left on her economic policies and history, for starters. While she made fun of Trump on the stump for <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-jokes-donald-trumps-economic-speech-written/story?id=41214000\">having</a> \u201ca dozen or so economic advisers he just named: hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently,\u201d she is living in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/20/hillary-clinton-goldman-sachs-vampire-squid-wall-street\">glass house funded by Goldman Sachs</a> and should be throwing no stones. We\u2019ll see whether she does in the big economic policy speech she is due to give on Thursday. <br></p> <p>They\u2019re not named Steve, but Clinton\u2019s been courting endorsements from billionaires Meg Whitman, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/16/warren-buffett-endorses-hillary-clinton-and-calls-for-higher-taxes-on-wealthy/?_r=0\">Warren Buffett</a> and Michael Bloomberg. Her own son-in-law is a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/business/dealbook/for-clintons-a-hedge-fund-in-the-family.html\">\u201chedge fund guy\u201d,</a> and the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-money-48-5-million-for-hillary-clinton-19-000-for-donald-trump-1469784601\">reported</a> that \u201chedge fund money has vastly favored Clinton over Trump\u201d to the tidy sum of $122m. Being bothered by what this portends for our economic future this is not a vote for Trump.</p> <p>And though Trump hinting to his supporters that they might want to use the second amendment to possibly assassinate Clinton or justices of the supreme court is disgusting, let\u2019s not forget Clinton saying in May 2008 that she had to stay in that primary <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/us/politics/24clinton.html\">because</a> \u201cBobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California\u201d and, ho hum, you never know what might happen to presumptive nominee Barack Obama.</p> <p>I bring this all up not to draw parallels between Clinton and Trump. She is clearly the more capable person suited to preside over this corrupt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/baltimore-police-department-justice-department-investigation-findings\">perpetually and criminally violent</a> enterprise known as the United States of America. But let\u2019s not act like Clinton is a dove when it comes to matters of life and death.</p> <p>She has <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a47517/hillary-clinton-john-negroponte-endorsement/\">embraced</a> the endorsement of neocon John Negroponte and is even reportedly courting the endorsement of Henry Kissinger. As secretary of state, Clinton controversially supported not designating the 2009 ouster of Honduran president Manuel Zelaya as a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/19/hillary-clintons-dodgy-answers-on-honduras-coup/?utm_term=.594728650351\">coup</a> , even though he was woken up by armed soldiers and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-clinton-honduras-coup-20160501-story.html\">forced</a> onto a plane and out of his country in his pajamas. She has since <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/3/11/before_her_assassination_berta_caceres_singled\">defended</a> her role in that situation, which has led to hell for women, children and environmentalists, including the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/world/americas/berta-caceres-indigenous-activist-is-killed-in-honduras.html\">assassination</a> of indigenous activist Berta C\u00e1ceres. And as senator, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-iraq-war-vote-presidential-campaign\">supported</a> the Iraq war, a vote which helped lead to the death of US army captain Humayun Khan.</p> <p>Captain Khan\u2019s parents have valiantly and admirably taken on Trump and his ugly Islamophobia. But turning a critical lens on the presidential candidate who supported the war that killed their son does not equate supporting her opponent.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re in what can broadly called the left, you a few have choices how to spend the next three months. You can scream \u201cYaaaaaaas, I\u2019m with her!\u201d and do your part to elect Clinton without thought or critique. That\u2019s fine if her positions on war and economics don\u2019t bother you, and there is value in shutting down Trump\u2019s malarkey as quickly as possible.</p> <p>But there is something perhaps more valuable in withholding your support and not giving it away too early, if at all. As James Thindwa <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/19361/the-black-establishments-blank-check-for-hillary\">wrote</a> of the Congressional Black Caucus, the \u201crush by black leadership to endorse Clinton was an unforced strategic blunder\u201d. Instead of \u201crobustly challenging both Clinton and Sanders on racial justice issues [during the primaries] \u2013 as Black Lives Matter activists did,\u201d the CBC \u201ccould have sent a strong message to a party that takes black Americans\u2019 support for granted, fails to deliver real solutions and too often patronizes them\u201d.</p> <p>The CBC would likely have gotten far better economic policies backing Sanders; and, as Trump\u2019s implosion has made clear, Sanders would have been a contender. Instead, the CBC backed Clinton too soon and now has to take whatever crumbs it gets from the Clinton trough as she wields America\u2019s racist id incarnate like a cudgel as the only alternative. (And the CBC will get pushed away as Clinton welcomes Wall Street, warmongers and wealthy Republicans to pay for a place at that trough.)</p> <p>You can critique Clinton and vote for a third party for any reason. American sovereignty lies in the individual, and our votes are never owed to anybody. However, Trump is shaping up as the Republican Walter Mondale, and could lose badly. At the same time, Clinton will still have very safe margins in large states that are not battlegrounds like New York and California. This means 2016 will be an especially safe year to vote dissent, because millions of people unhappy with Clinton in safely blue (or even safely red) states can vote for a third party without increasing Trump\u2019s odds. </p> <p>Finally, you can critique Clinton ... and still vote for Clinton. This is possible! I love my friends and family (and, on a good day, myself), but I am still very critical of all of us. Criticism doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love us. Furthermore, politicians are not even our friends. As citizens, we should keep politicians working for our interests and our respect by critiquing them with a level of scrutiny the power we are entrusting them with demands.</p>",

  "<h2>Protecting the environment </h2> <p>In the village of Mapubi, in the forests of south-west Cameroon, locals have watched as large swaths of their land have been destroyed. </p> <p>Mapubi\u2019s proximity to coastal ports and the increased demand for timber due to population growth in the cities mean the pressure on forests in the area is believed to be at its highest since the colonial period.</p> <p>A similar plight affects many who live in the forests of the Congo basin, whose lands have been depleted by illegal logging, mining, industrial plantations and even by strict conservation activities, which often resulted in large-scale evictions of people from the environments they had populated for generations.</p> <p>In many cases, the problem lies in the fact that these forest lands are largely unmapped, so loggers and farmers can claim they were unoccupied. But another problem lies with reporting \u2013 people who witness illegal activities in the forests might live hundreds of miles from the nearest police station, or even telephone.</p> <p>To address this, the <a href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\">Rainforest Foundation UK</a> is trialling an initiative that equips local communities to report illegal activities in their own forests in real time, using satellite phones and specially designed mapping software.</p> <p>ForestLink, which has funding from the Department for International Development, allows local people who witness illegal behaviour in the forest to report it in a few clicks of a button.

It\u2019s no place for resolving the politics of deep schism, but that\u2019s how it is.

To the uninitiated in the history and chemistry of the party, the split might look puzzling. Smith says he\u2019ll spend \u00a3200bn and build a zillion homes, the Corbyn camp doubles the stake and raises it again to \u00a3500bn and a gazillion homes. Corbyn until this contest had few policies beyond an amorphous \u201canti-austerity\u201d, so when Smith put flesh on the bones with strings of new policies, he jolted Corbyn into producing some too. The great divide is less visible to the uninitiated \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s incompetence in the basics of opposition as the country faces nation-threatening Brexit decisions.</p> <p>Whether or not the entire 515,000-strong Labour membership gets to vote, the practicalities have become near impossible. If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">another 130,000 now have to be vetted in under two weeks before ballot papers go out</a>, that puts intolerable strain on local parties. Local officers are volunteers, expected to vet all new members, maybe 500, by Friday to check they are who they say they are on the electoral register, and not members of rival parties.</p> <p>This election should now be delayed until after the party conference, with speeches there from both candidates. An appalling state of chaos? Yes, but that\u2019s likely to be Labour\u2019s fate for the foreseeable future. If there is indeed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\">chance of the leftwing group Militant being allowed back in</a>, its leader Peter Taaffe a toxic blast from the past, then battle lines are even more clearly drawn between those who see Labour as a rebellion \u2013 where Corbyn has spent his entire political life \u2013 and those who know its mission is to seek power to govern.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019m the underdog,\u201d says Owen Smith candidly. His team thinks the trend is in their direction, cheered by the vote of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/gmb-union-backs-owen-smith-labour-leader\">grassroots GMB union membership</a> in his favour. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">Corbyn\u2019s supporters sweeping the board in the national executive committee elections</a> is not as bad it looks, they say, as Eddie Izzard siphoned off some of the votes and they say phone-bank calls to members are more encouraging. But this feels like whistling in the dark.</p> <p>The bitter truth is that in the current climate, the case for social democracy sounds dull, compared with great far-leftist rallies. The Corbyn believers have the best of it, buoyed by pure conviction. Faced with the roiling upsurge of left- and rightwing passions, social democrats across Europe and the US fail to inspire. Like Hillary Clinton, the 172 Labour MPs refusing to back Corbyn are accused of being boring, mediocre, weak material for the 140-character blast of politics now.</p> <p>What a miserable role to be the realist pricking the balloons of those free spirits. To argue for the necessity of winning is to be a cynical compromiser. Those Labour MPs are seen as greedy power-grubbers hanging on to their seats at all costs, as current polling suggests some 90 will lose theirs. That\u2019s not their personal tragedy: it means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/labour-heading-for-catastrophic-defeat-says-former-corbyn-aide-neale-coleman\">Labour in parliament will be so depleted</a> that it can never pass a single amendment to whatever an untrammelled Tory government wants to do. Nothing will matter more to the country\u2019s future than the Brexit decisions ahead. Theresa May would be mad not to seize her honeymoon moment to sweep those seats from Labour before those bitter decisions must be taken.</p> <p>How much easier to go with the romance of the impossible, in the warm embrace of like-minded dreamers. Those I most admire are those on the left, who started out with Corbyn, who have now seen the disaster ahead. Those who know that abandoning all hope of power is to abandon those who benefit most from a Labour government that the party exists to champion. The bookies give Corbyn an 18% chance of being the next prime minister. That matches the pollsters\u2019 finding that only <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-says-labour-leadership-campaign-responsible-for-partys-poor-poll-rating_uk_57a3227ee4b02c0180841f89\">18% think he would make the better prime minister</a>, against 52% for Theresa May, as 2.5 million of the too few who voted Labour last year now <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-comres-poll-labour-tories-prime-minister-who-would-be-better-voters-a7141171.html\">say May would be the better leader</a>.</p> <p>However much this Labour self-slaughter feels like a reprise of the 1980s, there will be no split, learning from that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/26/labour-party-split-sdp-candidate\">failed SDP attempt</a>. The electoral system that binds Ken Clarke in the same grip as Liam Fox must force Labour\u2019s irreconcilables to stick together. Until our monstrous electoral system is reformed to free people to form parties that better reflect voters\u2019 wishes, the two old parties must remain as bitterly dysfunctional factions locked in a deadly electoral embrace by first-past-the-post.</p> <p>Labour realists talk of the long haul. How long? Another three or four elections? If Corbyn crashes in a general election, he may stay, or another only slightly more electable may take his place. There is no point is looking for silver linings, and lights at the end of this tunnel look far away. A pall of gloom hangs over the party\u2019s MPs as they watch the whoops and thrills of Corbyn rallies, signifying nothing. Labour\u2019s apparently \u201chuge\u201d new membership is only a homeopathic drop in the ocean of the great electorate out there.</p> <p>A new stoicism has descended on them: they will stay resolutely on the back benches, fighting their hardest against every damned Tory act of meanness to the poor, gifts to the rich and shrinking of the public realm, knowing they themselves may not be the ones that see their party back to power. But they know democracy always rights itself in the end. And there is still just a chance that Owen Smith could win, an outside chance.</p>",

  "<p>Will Theresa May try to call an early general election? With Labour in <a href=\"http:// http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-vote-dispute-appeal-court\">such obvious disarray</a> and her own Commons majority consisting of just 12 possibly disloyal MPs, the temptation must be obvious. It\u2019s an open goal, as Tim Montgomerie puts it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/may-has-an-open-goal-if-she-calls-an-election-7j9kg9js8\">in the Times</a><sup tabindex=\"-1\">(\u00a3)</sup>. He\u2019s not the only one.</p> <p>My hunch is that the new prime minister will resist that temptation and be right to do so. Contrary to what political activists believe (at least they do for a while), most voters don\u2019t want to be dragged to the polls more than is strictly necessary. They elect other people to worry for them, and the 23 June referendum was quite enough excitement for most.</p> <p>One survey this week suggested that only one in five voters favour a snap election this autumn or next spring, and I suspect that even the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration \">starry-eyed or ardent supporters of Jeremy Corbyn</a> are not among them. Why bother to seek real power to improve your supporters everyday lives when you can concentrate on capturing Labour\u2019s party <em>machine</em>, eh?</p> <p>In case you\u2019ve forgotten, May has already ruled out an election. It was part of the straight-talking, new broom shtick that followed her accelerated rise to power after David Cameron\u2019s resignation, the most constructive move towards some semblance of post-Brexit stability we have yet seen.</p> <p>Until she gives us reason not to, we should take May\u2019s word for it. But that word is no guarantee she won\u2019t change her mind or have it changed by circumstances. As recently as 2007, when Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair ( also via \u201ccoronation\u201d, not election by either party or country), there was serious talk of him seeking his own mandate. </p> <p>It drifted for months until George Osborne\u2019s irresponsible inheritance tax (IHT) pledge frightened Brown off the idea that October. As Brown\u2019s consigliere Damian McBride <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://damianpmcbride.tumblr.com/post/32931120073/5-years-on-the-election-that-never-was\">later conceded</a>, I had warned against letting speculation run on so damagingly, because I\u2019d seen it all before when Jim Callaghan made the same mistake and pulled back (\u201cThere was I waiting at the church,\u201d he sang at the TUC) only when he realised he\u2019d lose. </p> <p>But unforeseen controversy over policy \u2013 the Brexit strategy and hard versus soft exit is the obvious one \u2013 might justify a showdown with May\u2019s perpetual rebels. Grammar schools might be another, since the Tory left know they are a tribal error. A \u201cwho governs Britain?\u201d election over much-exaggerated trade union militancy is old-fashioned, and voters gave Ted Heath a raspberry when he tried in 1974.</p> <p>My sense is that May has seen how Cameron\u2019s appeasement policies don\u2019t work and will be prepared to face the boys down. Good, because someone has to be in charge. Her or the editor of the Daily Mail. </p> <p>Andrew Rawnsley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election \">suspects she might be forced</a> to call an early election. I doubt if any showdown will have to come to such a dramatic head. But it\u2019s risky. There is a Boundary Commission shakeup in the works, one aborted after most of the detail had been done because of a Lib Dem row with Cameron during the coalition. Its proposals, which revive the coalition plan to cut MP numbers from 650 to 600, are due next month.</p> <p>With rare exceptions, such exercises naturally favour the Tories because their votes pile up inefficiently as people move out of cities to suburbs and small towns, leaving Labour\u2019s concentrated in places such as London. Boundary reviews periodically adjust the consequences with the help of party lawyers and officials seeking tactical advantage. Neglect the process at your peril, leaders learn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSmithsonPB?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Most polls</a> since May\u2019s succession put the Tories comfortably ahead of Labour, though the Corbyn army insists polls get it wrong, without showing much enthusiasm to test the theory. MPs who oppose Corbyn and do not occupy safe inner-city seats think otherwise.</p> <p>Combine those polls with favourable boundary changes and the Tory lead could shift from 12 seats overall to 48, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/big-majority-if-may-waits-for-new-boundary-change-jzkg727lb\">according to studies</a><sup>(\u00a3)</sup> by Electoral Calculus. It may take up two more years before the details are finalised \u2013 another reason for delaying any rush to the voting booths.</p> <p>Politics aside, there\u2019s another hurdle even to staging a 2018 election, which just might suit May in terms of the Brexit negotiations and the fateful triggering of article 50, the Lisbon provision that sets the clock ticking for a two-year withdrawal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/03/britain-general-election-before-article-50\">Nick Clegg thinks it would</a>. But we just don\u2019t know, no one does, only that straight-talker May says \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>The hurdle that still remains hasn\u2019t yet sunk into everyone\u2019s consciousness because it\u2019s anorak stuff. When the coalition partners feared the other might pull the plug, they passed the Fixed-Term Parliament Act (2011) as a mutual insurance policy. That took away the prime minister\u2019s discretion to drive to the palace and seek a dissolution from his Queen. It gave the power to MPs.</p> <p>So there are now two routes whereby the election, now due in May 2020, can be held sooner. One is a vote of no confidence in the current government followed by a two-week interval in which someone else tries and fails to form a government that can win such a vote.</p> <p>In a multi-party parliament such as PR voting might elect, we can see how that option might arise and actually work, though the devolved Celtic parliaments elected by a form of PR have not yet shown such dexterity. But Westminster still votes under first past the post. Perhaps a Tory successor to a Brexit-defeated May might pull it off in unforeseen circumstances. It\u2019s hard to imagine Corbyn mustering the necessary votes.</p> <p>The second route is a vote by two-thirds of MPs to back an early election. That\u2019s hard to imagine too \u2013 turkeys voting for Christmas, as the old joke goes. Perhaps Tory Brexiteers might try to thwart May\u2019s \u201csoft Brexit\u201d approach by joining forces with Corbyn, who\u2019s only nominally pro-EU. Even an ardently pro-EU Labour leader, John Smith (1992-94), joined forces with such people to thwart John Major. Does Labour now have such tactical skill and cohesion? I doubt it.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie blithely suggests that a small amendment to the 2011 act would clear May\u2019s way to a 2017 election if she wants one. Easier said than done. But who knows, the economy may tank and take her poll lead with it. Owen Smith may defeat Jeremy Corbyn and prove a brilliant leader. The EU or Putin\u2019s Russia may get stroppy. President Trump could do anything. Martians may land to remove Trump.</p> <p>In dangerous times, nobody really knows. So if May values her emerging reputation as Mrs Solid-but-Boring, an English vicar\u2019s daughter to match Germany\u2019s pastor\u2019s daughter Angela Merkel, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll jeopardise that reputation unless she is forced to risk annoying a slumbering electorate. </p> <p>Once lost, power is not easily reacquired. Ask Dave.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s something medieval about Trump\u2019s uneasy partnership with his running mate Mike Pence \u2013 and I\u2019m not just talking about Pence\u2019s retrograde politics.</p> <p>Partnering with the embattled governor of Indiana was a strategic marriage a feudal dynast could be proud of.

  "<p>The US\u2019s slow recovery from the 2008 recession is due to Republican policies on the local, state and federal level, according to a new study published by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI). </p> <p>The new report comes as the slow pace of recovery has emerged as a key battleground between Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who will set out her economic policy on Thursday.</p> <p>The EPI report blames the lackluster pace of recovery on Republican-led budget cuts in 2011 following the row over the US debt ceiling, the unwillingness of local officials to spend money when Republicans in Congress were advocating cuts in spending, and the refusal to expand Medicaid in 19 states.</p> <p>The report comes as the Republican party once again calls for the reining in of government spending and reductions in the deficit. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the degree of damage inflicted by the Great Recession and the restricted ability of monetary policy to aid recovery, historically expansionary fiscal policy was required to return the US economy to full health,\u201d writes Josh Bivens, research and policy director at EPI. </p> <p>\u201cBut this government spending not only failed to rise fast enough to spur a rapid recovery, it outright contracted, and this policy choice fully explains why the economy is only partially recovered from the Great Recession a full seven years after its official end.\u201d</p> <p>This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months.</p> <p>The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit \u2013 something Republicans in Congress are opposed to \u2013 it would also have led to \u201cseveral years of full employment\u201d and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates. </p> <p>There are few ways the government can help speed up economic recovery after a recession. One way is to cut interest rates to help increase borrowing, which should lead to increased spending. Similarly, to increase spending by consumers, the US government would typically cut taxes, essentially putting more money in people\u2019s pockets.</p> <p>The ability of the US government has been slightly limited this time around \u2013 especially when it comes to cutting the federal interest rates, which have been historically low.</p> <h2>Interest rates<br></h2> <p>At the time of the 1980s recession the federal fund interest rate was at 9.3%, whereas in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.18%.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that there was much more room to move down the federal funds rates following the 1982 trough compared to the 2009 trough,\u201d Bivens wrote.</p> <p>Low interest rates combined with the potential of another recession are a concern for the US Federal Reserve. Fed chair Janet Yellen had previously said that the central bank has few tools to deal with another recession if it were to occur. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"Interest rates chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">Interest rates chart</a> </figure>  <p>Bivens argues that the federal government should have increased aid to state and local governments following the recession and that the Obama administration should have been more outspoken about its opposition to the fiscal austerity pushed by Republicans. </p> <p>The Obama administration \u201ccould have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,\u201d Bivens wrote. \u201cHad the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><br>The EPI report was published hours before Clinton was scheduled to deliver her speech on the economy in Warren, Michigan.

The group has been deemed an offshoot of al-Qaida, which carried out the attacks on 9/11. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group.

  "<p>A 20-year-old Virginia man seeking an \u201caudience\u201d with Donald Trump used large suction cups to scale the outside of Trump Tower on Wednesday for three hours, reaching the 21st floor before being hauled through a window by police.</p> <p>The climber \u2013 a young, white male with long brown hair and muttonchops \u2013 wore a backpack and used a harness and rope stirrups to fasten himself to the side of the 58-story Manhattan skyscraper, above Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>The man used four suction cup-like devices, each with ropes attached for him to stand on. The building\u2019s windows were apparently too dirty for the cups to attach to, as he frequently stopped to clean the windows before attempting to attach to them.</p> <p>Police officers smashed windows and broke through a ventilation duct in an attempt to block his progress. Officers also lowered themselves toward him using a window washer\u2019s platform.</p> <p>For a long time, the climber played a slow-motion cat-and-mouse game with officers, eluding them by methodically working his way across the facade and the angled corners of the building. The chase ended dramatically just after 6.30pm.</p> <p>As a crowd gasped on the street below, two officers leaning far out of a window frame where the glass was removed grabbed the climber\u2019s arm and backpack, and in a flash yanked him from his dangling stirrups. He went through the opening head first, his legs pointed skyward.</p> <p>Police had deployed large, inflated crash pads at the scene, but it was unclear whether they were positioned close enough to where the man was climbing to offer any protection if he fell.</p> <p>He was speaking with officers through the holes cut in the side of the building. When would-be rescuers smashed a window above him, he ducked to avoid big shards of glass that fell.</p> <p>They collectively inhaled as he was pulled inside. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed,\u201d a young man said. Others sadly lamented that they missed it.</p> <p>Police blocked off much of 56th Street, the south side of the tower, where the man was climbing. The crowds pressed together in the heat and humidity and spilled onto Madison Avenue. With smartphones and cameras raised, they documented the strange occurrence on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook Live. In offices nearby, some watched from the windows.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta get this shit on camera. This is hilarious,\u201d one man said. Others wondered if the climber \u2013 whom many were calling Steve \u2013 was getting tired. Another yelled \u201cMake America great again\u201d. Others offered their own theories on why the man was doing this. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be a protest,\u201d a man said.</p> <p>Some disagreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a daredevil,\u201d said Carolyn Gatchell, a nurse from New Hampshire. \u201cI think it\u2019s ironic because it\u2019s a Trump building. I\u2019m anxious to see what he has to say about it.\u201d Gatchell and her husband, Bill, in town on vacation, were at the Empire State building when they saw helicopters near Trump Tower so they headed down to check out what was going on. \u201cI think it\u2019s innocent \u2013 not a terrorist or anything,\u201d Bill added of the climbers\u2019 motivation.</p> <p>The day before, police said, the climber posted a video on YouTube entitled: Message to Mr Trump (why I climbed your tower). </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP493LmSJrE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sP493LmSJrE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am an independent researcher seeking a private audience with you to discuss an important matter.

The reason I climbed your tower is to get your attention. If I had sought this via conventional means, I would be much less likely to have success because you are a busy man with many responsibilities.\u201d </p> <p>NYPD assistant chief William Aubrey said the man, who was not named by police, told officers the same thing after he was safely inside the building. </p> <p>\u201cAt no time did he express that he wanted to hurt anybody,\u201d Aubrey added. </p> <p>The tower is headquarters to Trump\u2019s Republican presidential campaign and his business empire. Trump also lives there, though he was in Virginia on Wednesday afternoon and was headed to Florida for an evening event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a0b454b2e40ea59e871d1fdc9c163aae6de7ae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0b454b2e40ea59e871d1fdc9c163aae6de7ae5/0_163_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers from the NYPD watch as a man climbs the outside of Trump Tower in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers from the NYPD watch as a man climbs the outside of Trump Tower in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kathy, a Trump supporter from Sunnyside, was visiting a friend nearby when she saw the crowds.

She was relieved to find out that he was away . \u201cPeople want to be around him,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cThey will glom onto anything like him. Look how much attention this guy is getting.\u201d</p> <p>About 20 police officers funneled curious onlookers out of the street so cars could pass unhindered down Madison Avenue. Those who moved across the street could still see the building where the climber was approaching an open window and police.</p>"
