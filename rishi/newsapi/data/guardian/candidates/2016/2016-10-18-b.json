  "<p>It has become a commonplace to remark on the hyper-sensitivity of the culture; a person saying a vile thing can never be debated, but only no-platformed. A person who once debated another person who went on to say a vile thing thereby shared a platform. Often it\u2019s hard to establish what was vile about the thing, because if you ask, you are giving it a platform. So once an issue has platform status, the platform acquires final authority and all you can talk about is the platform. Taken as a free-speech issue, it is quite two-dimensional (your&#xa0;right to say what you like versus my right not to be offended), and therefore boring.</p> <p>Yet the steady build-up of unsayables has had an effect on humour that you only notice when the jokes are gone.</p> <p>There used to be a place called satire where you could go when politics got really bad.

Or it was 2005, in a post-Iraq and post-hope landscape of rule by press release, endless meaningless gestures to assuage the forces of moral outrage that only became bolder: and there was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgrd/episodes/guide\" title=\"\">The Thick of It</a>. None of these shows was reactive in the classic sense: they were nothing like the US\u2019s Daily Show.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that we never try to do headline-humour (10 O\u2019Clock Live, The 11 O\u2019Clock Show, Tonightly).

You watched him to live in a world where you weren\u2019t alienated by polish and spin, where people were monstrously human, complicated, foul and furious in a way you understood. You watched him, ultimately, to forget Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>Re-watching The Day Today now, its surrealism belongs to another age. In episode five, thieves dressed as cleaners steal the British pound. \u201cThe men escaped, making good with their legs on open ground,\u201d Chris Morris\u2019s newsreader intoned. (Jesse Armstrong, who co-created Peep Show and co-wrote The Thick of It, noted: \u201cThe Day Today was at least as interested in satirising form as content.\u201d At the time, it felt like traditional news might never recover from how ridiculous Morris made its conventions look.) The anchor continued that the Bank of England had issued \u201can emergency currency based on the Queen\u2019s eggs, several thousand of which were removed from her ovaries in 1953 and held in reserve\u201d.</p> <p>There is a lot of trust in the surreal \u2013 Morris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/armandoiannucci\" title=\"\">Armando Iannucci</a> et al trusted the audience to get that jokes, like mercury, told you something you couldn\u2019t guess but slipped through your fingers if you tried to catch them. We trusted them to bring insight with their obliqueness, without which \u201csurreal\u201d is just another word for \u201crandom\u201d.

Followed swiftly by: \u201cAnd aren\u2019t you lefties supposed to be feminists? How would you feel if someone made a joke about your eggs?\u201d From the other side, a feminist outcry, how can the Queen\u2019s eggs function as a joke in this context without the presupposition that shame is indivisible from the condition of being female? You would find yourself having to defend it; and justifying a joke, like pleading your own character, is to have lost before you begin.</p> <p>Two personnel notes. First, there are no women in this piece; political satire is a very male world. Second, as Armstrong said bluntly: \u201cTalking about satire feels like death. If I heard somebody go, \u2018Now I\u2019m going to write some satire\u2019, and I had to think what that person looked like, I\u2019d think, \u2018That person looks like a wanker.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is a magic circle-like code: that the truest of the satirists would never speak of it. More than once, someone said: \u201cI bet Chris Morris would never go near a conversation like this.\u201d And it was true, he wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ian-martin\" title=\"\">Ian Martin</a>, originally hired as a \u201cswearing consultant\u201d by Iannucci for The Thick of It, went on to become one of the main writers. \u201cI still remember one from a few years back,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the characters had demanded of another character that they behave \u2018like a Hutu\u2019, in graphic and unpleasant detail. It was massively \u2018inappropriate\u2019 and precisely the sort of awful thing that character would say.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, I was challenged to explain why I thought genocide was funny. And that\u2019s the tone now, isn\u2019t it? Creepy 1984 vibe. Bumptious, puffed-up little dickheads demanding so-and-so is \u2018sacked by the BBC\u2019. Everyone patrols the boundaries of their own jokes and opinions now. But if they do go over the line, there\u2019s a great mass of outrage starlings ready to swoop down and Hitchcock them.\u201d</p> <p>Iannucci agrees that something has changed. \u201cI\u2019ve found this very worrying, the idea that if anyone says anything that might offend anyone, they mustn\u2019t&#xa0;be given a platform. It\u2019s like when a complaint is made about a satire show, the reply goes out immediately: \u2018The intention was never to offend.\u2019 The intention <em>was</em> to offend. If&#xa0;it hadn\u2019t offended, it wouldn\u2019t be funny. If we have beliefs, religious or political, and they\u2019re not strong enough to stand up to a joke, then they&#xa0;can\u2019t be that good.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this new respect for offence-taking doesn\u2019t touch the people who are actually offensive. Iannucci\u2019s example is: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign manager said this morning, \u2018This thing about locking Hillary up in prison, that was just a quip.\u2019 Trump saying \u2018if I were in charge, you\u2019d be in jail\u2019, doesn\u2019t sound like a joke. There\u2019s nothing to signify that it\u2019s a joke. There\u2019s no set up and no punchline. If it\u2019s a bold statement that then takes 24 hours to clarify that it\u2019s a&#xa0;joke \u2026\u201d \u2013 he has reached a beautiful crescendo, like a Gettysburg Address to&#xa0;the honour of the joke \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s not a joke!\u201d</p> <p>Iannucci believes that in this polarisation \u2013 excessive sensitivity quelling humour on one side, radical insensitivity masquerading as humour on the other \u2013 comedy has come to replicate the new extremes of politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the third way,\u201d he concludes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9122bfd545341da0428bd5ccff1f2d27772581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9122bfd545341da0428bd5ccff1f2d27772581/3_387_4876_2926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spitting Image puppets of Neil Kinnock, Margaret Thatcher, David Owen and David Steele\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Better times to be a satirist: Spitting Image had plenty of targets in the 1980s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone, from John O\u2019Farrell, writer of Spitting Image, onwards, has what Armstrong calls \u201ca wistful respect for the endeavour of being in politics\u201d. \u201cI think politics should be held&#xa0;in higher esteem,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says, and not just because, without it, satire has \u201csort of died, really. There\u2019s no pedestal to pull them off. The public hold them in such contempt.\u201d Armstrong generally resists grand theories about the state of satire, preferring the happenstance explanation that you get&#xa0;little bubbles of great talent \u2013 Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, the Pythons, Iannucci and Morris \u2013 but you don\u2019t get them all the time, any more than you get great pop songs all the time. Some decades don\u2019t&#xa0;have a Beatles. \u201cBut if I&#xa0;thought there was any dip in satirical output, I&#xa0;might put it down to the fact that, usually, satirists are there to prick the pomposity of the establishment. That\u2019s an over-beaten pi\u00f1ata. Everyone\u2019s kicking the shit out of the establishment. Being puckish about the trains not running on time, or cold tea, there\u2019s some fucker sitting there going:&#xa0;\u2018You know why the tea\u2019s cold? Because of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Farrell sees nothing new in the offence-taking: \u201cThe 80s was another time of extreme leftier-than-thou, people trying to catch each other out and trip each other up, outmanoeuvre each other for political purity. It\u2019s related to a lack of confidence.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s because we keep losing. But I keep wondering whether it\u2019s that way round, or whether we keep losing because we have lost our confidence.</p> <p>Contempt for mainstream politics is&#xa0;possibly a global, certainly <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org\" title=\"\">OECD</a> constant nowadays, and makes the work of challenging the establishment difficult everywhere. But \u2013 although perhaps I am suffering a surfeit of national pride \u2013 I think there is something about politics at its extremes that neuters British satire in a specific way. The Americans lampoon their politicians with direct mimicry \u2013 Tina Fey as Sarah Palin, Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump \u2013 and it works, it\u2019s funny. Baldwin <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-17/donald-trump-says-alec-baldwin-%E2%80%99stinks%E2%80%99-on-saturday-night-live/7937516\" title=\"\">riled Trump</a> enough that the latter responded, calling Saturday Night Live \u201cboring and unfunny\u201d (though his narcissist\u2019s rage admits no dignity, so his taking to Twitter is not as unusual as it would be from any other politician). Whereas, here, anything so direct falls flat: \u201cIf we did a joke, now, about Theresa May the individual,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says, \u201cthat she hadn\u2019t told the truth or whatever, people would just say, \u2018We knew that.\u2019 If we did those sketches from the 80s \u2013 Margaret Thatcher is bossy \u2013 it just wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Tracking to further extremes, it is really hard to mock Nigel Farage: he is already a caricature of a little England neo-fascist, defending Trump\u2019s pussy-grabbing one day, attacking Goldman Sachs without quite saying the words \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d the next. He is a mockery already, and he&#xa0;isn\u2019t laughing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66d23fddb248669701ed0585ba4e3e35babd88f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d23fddb248669701ed0585ba4e3e35babd88f2/135_2_3395_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Nigel met Donald: beyond satire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin\u2019s analysis is easily the most depressing. \u201cIt\u2019s the great hate shift of&#xa0;early 21st-century civilisation. Righteous anger has tipped over online into righteous hatred and it\u2019s poisoned everything. Maybe that\u2019s OK, you know? Victimhood is a legitimate response to targeted abuse. And the internet\u2019s full of wankers. And civil society is struggling to redefine itself, and all the guy ropes have snapped and it\u2019s a howling gale, and maybe if the price for some sort of sanity is PC humour, then so be it.\u201d But underneath, everyone hopes that it\u2019s out there, we just have to look in the right place. Satire is a young person\u2019s game, which means a digital platform, which means it probably won\u2019t be in a Soho cabaret or on BBC2.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re due a satire boom,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says optimistically. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a rightwing government doing these appalling things; it\u2019s time for satirists to gather under the flag.\u201d Go on, then. \u201cOh, I\u2019m too old now. I leave that to the&#xa0;younger satirists.\u201d</p> <p>But what if satire isn\u2019t firing? How much does that matter? When it is at its height, does it pack any political punch? As Peter Cook said when he opened The Establishment in Soho, he was modelling it on \u201cthose wonderful Berlin cabarets \u2026 which did so much to&#xa0;stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the second world war\u201d. O\u2019Farrell concludes mournfully \u2013 but also quite jauntily, with that dualism made possible by being funny to your bones: \u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned over the&#xa0;30 years of doing it is that satire doesn\u2019t work. It has the opposite effect. Our outrage turns into elation and a joke. It\u2019s a release valve. I could never bear Christine and Neil Hamilton, but then you look at them, and they are funny, and you\u2019re going, \u2018Neil \u2026 he\u2019s a&#xa0;ledge.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cGeorge Orwell said that every joke is a tiny revolution, which I like as a soundbite. But I think every joke is instead of a tiny revolution\u201d. He pauses for a minute, to consider whether any of the Spitting Image sketches had had any destabilising effect on Thatcher\u2019s government. All he can remember was&#xa0;one Tory MP who had changed his&#xa0;mind to vote in Thatcher\u2019s favour, after&#xa0;her Spitting Image puppet looked so sad.</p> <p>Armstrong says Orwell was also wrong in thinking \u201cwe couldn\u2019t have fascism here, because people would laugh at the goose-stepping. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s true. Some people would have been sniggering behind their hands, but a couple of labour camps would solve that problem. It has&#xa0;no objective truth. Comedy is not good for anything, really. Apart from being one of the only things that makes&#xa0;life worth living.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The 2016 campaign has not been kind to Melania Trump, and this week is no exception. </p> <p>In two new interviews, she was sent in to defend her husband\u2019s alleged mistreatment of women despite not knowing him when most of the accusers did. And she did so in front of a media that has not treated her kindly, to say the least, throughout Donald Trump\u2019s run for president.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/melania-trump-billy-bush-groping-tape-cnn-interview\">Melania Trump says husband Donald was 'led on' by Billy Bush in leaked tape</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Poised under pressure, Melania did as good a job as her husband could have hoped, and a better job than he has of staying on message. The trouble is, 11 days after the leak of the Access Hollywood recording, there isn\u2019t much she can plausibly say to defend him. She wasn\u2019t present for any of the alleged incidents. How can she possibly purport to know whether charges against her husband are true? Especially now that there\u2019s video of Trump admitting every single one of the alleged behaviors, if not the specific incidents?</p> <p>Accordingly, her excuses didn\u2019t add up.<br></p> <p>There was the attempt to explain away Trump\u2019s boast about grabbing women by the genitals as \u201cboy talk\u201d. \u201cI know how some men talk, and that\u2019s how I saw it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s a funny way to feel about a man born just five years after your own father. Over the course of Melania\u2019s interview, age would emerge as an even more salient point.</p> <p>The year that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0\">Jessica Leeds claims</a> Trump stuck his hand up her skirt uninvited while sitting beside her on a flight to New York was 1980.

Melania wasn\u2019t present in the room where the alleged assault occurred during a \u201ctour\u201d of Mar-a-Lago, but she was able to take issue with one of Stoynoff\u2019s subsidiary claims \u2013 that she later ran into her much later on the street in New York \u2013 using that as evidence to discredit the entire story. \u201cI would not recognize her,\u201d she told CNN. We\u2019re talking about the relatively rare case in which Melania has any relevant history to offer at all; and even here, People has <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/former-people-writer-speaks-out-after-trump-accusation.html\">pushed back</a>, saying Stoynoff was with a friend who corroborates her story.</p> <p>The meaninglessness of Melania\u2019s denials isn\u2019t lost on accusers like Harth, who in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">my interview with her back in July</a> said it was the insistence of Ivanka Trump that her dad is \u201cnot a groper\u201d that pushed her over the edge. After staying silent on the matter for almost 20 years \u2013 her initial lawsuit was filed in 1997 \u2013 she felt driven to defend her story and herself. \u201cShe was 10 years old at the time,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucia_graves/status/756939157084123136\">she told me of Ivanka</a>. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what her father was about, what he was doing, how he was acting.\u201d (In response to Melania\u2019s insistence Monday night that the Trump described by accusers is \u201cnot the man I know\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jillharth/status/788373090963193856\">Harth tweeted</a>: \u201cDream on, Melania.\u201d)<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/first-thiel-now-the-trumps-how-billionaires-threaten-free-speech\">First Thiel, now the Trumps: how billionaires threaten free speech | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mostly, though, Melania Trump\u2019s appearances involved impugning the integrity of the accusers \u2013 and, of course, the media. \u201cI believe my husband \u2013 it was all organized from the opposition,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThey can never check the background of these women. They don\u2019t have any facts.\u201d In doing so, she was merely borrowing a line from her husband\u2019s playbook.</p> <p>Blindly accusing the free press of a vast conspiracies isn\u2019t a good look in a democratic society. But if anyone can be forgiven for such behavior, perhaps it should be her.</p> <p>That she\u2019s not running for president didn\u2019t stop the New York Post from running nude photos of her on the cover; or the Daily Mail from questioning the legitimacy of her immigration status; or practically everyone in media from taking a good long laugh at her expense after parts of her RNC speech were found to be lifted from a Michelle Obama script. Never mind that it wasn\u2019t her fault, that some inept speechwriter or campaign operative was almost certainly to blame. She was the one in the crosshairs.</p> <p>While all that does not a pack of liars or a media conspiracy make, it does help explain why she would use her moment on center stage to lash out at reporters and the women who have accused her husband. It does not make her right, but it does make her sympathetic. As a Vanity Fair piece, The Quiet Tragedy of Melania Trump, concluded <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/quiet-tragedy-of-melania-trump\">earlier this week</a>: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be seen as petty. It should be seen as profoundly sad.\u201d</p> <p>Melania insisted on CNN that she didn\u2019t want our pity, but in the next breath, unwittingly, she elicited it again. Asked what she\u2019d do if her husband, a man whose Twitter account frequently functions as a textbook example of online trolling, ascends to the presidency, she said, without irony, that she\u2019d work to end cyberbullying: \u201cThe social media, it\u2019s very damaging for the children.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe she\u2019s making the brilliantly subtle suggestion she\u2019d undo the model of political bullying her husband stands for. More likely, she\u2019s revealed she lacks even the most rudimentary understanding of his faults.</p>",

  "<p>In three crucial states \u2013 Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump remains incredibly close, according to polling data <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/battleground-polls-2016-elections/\">released</a> by CNN/ORC today. </p> <p>Voters were asked between 10 and 15 October which presidential candidate they support (the polls were conducted after the release of a video which showed Trump bragging about sexual assault). In Nevada, 46% of likely voters said they planned to back Clinton while 44% said they would support Trump. In North Carolina voters were split 48-47 in favor of Clinton, while in Ohio Clinton attracted only 44% of likely voters compared with Trump\u2019s 48%.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign seems to be well aware that they have work to do if they want to secure these three states, which together are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">worth</a> 39 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House.

Arizona, for example, which has consistently voted Republican in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.270towin.com/states/Arizona\">all but one</a> of the past 10 presidential elections, is currently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_clinton-5832.html\">looking</a> like an incredibly tight race. Polling averages show that less than one percentage point separates the two candidates here \u2013 no surprise then that Clinton campaign also plans to spend $2m on advertising in this traditionally red state too. </p> <p>Although an overall Clinton win is looking increasingly likely, according to the current polls, complacency could cost her the election.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/battleground-states-table/\" data-alt=\"Battleground 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/battleground-states-table/\">Battleground 2016</a> </figure>",
  "<p>For a campaign that started with a promise to round up and deport 11 million people, Trump\u2019s bid for the White House has taken a still darker turn in recent days.

That said, he is tapping \u2013 uncomfortably \u2013 into something more than his supporters\u2019 most racist and violent urges: American democracy isn\u2019t working for most Americans, and Trump voters\u2019 threats are an ugly reminder that we need to fix it.</p> <p>Nearly 90% of Trump supporters agreed with a Rand Corporation <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/blog/2016/01/rand-kicks-off-2016-presidential-election-panel-survey.html\">survey</a> statement that \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say about what the government does.\u201d The irony here is that Trump voters are historically some of the <em>most</em> enfranchised, with some of his strongest support coming from white protestant men. A study done during the primaries also found that Trump backers make an average of $72,000 per year, compared with a $61,000 average among likely Clinton voters. </p> <p>Most election rigging, of course, is done by Republicans through gerrymandering and restrictive voter ID laws, aimed at making it harder for poor people and people of color to get to the polls. On the whole, then, Trump voters are some of the least likely to find their ballots fall victim to foul play. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean the threat posed by his fear-mongering is any less real, or that his supporters aren\u2019t responding to legitimate flaws in American politics.</p> <p>Corporate citizens \u2013 as defined by Citizens United<em> \u2013 </em>now have an easier time getting a hold of their elected representative than just about any other American. In other words, money talks in Washington, and Super Pacs have spend just under <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?chrt=V&amp;type=S\">$795m </a>this election cycle.

And unlike in systems based on proportional representation, our winner-take-all electoral model creates some of the highest barriers to entry for political outsiders of any democracy on earth.</p> <p>Americans\u2019 distrust of politics is about more than just elections, though. Congressional approval ratings have declined steadily <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/190598/congress-approval-remains-low.aspx\">since 2009</a>, and now sit at just 20% \u2013 a high in the last few years. Unions \u2013 which used to cudgel Democrats into representing working people\u2019s interests \u2013 are at their weakest point in decades, and lack the sway they once held at the highest levels of government. </p> <p>Declines in organized labor have been paired with the disappearance of steady and well-paid work, either succumbed to automation or shipped overseas by free trade agreements. A jobless recovery from the financial crisis has left many adrift in the economy, while executives from the firms that drove it got golden parachutes courtesy of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve.<br></p> <p>On the table now are to very different responses to these crises. Using an apocryphal quote from Frederich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg once <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm\">wrote</a>: \u201cBourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.\u201d </p> <p>The path Trump has chosen is clear: scapegoating immigrants and people of color for white political and economic woes \u2013 a script that sounds eerily similar to both 1930s Germany and the far-right\u2019s European resurgence today. Another path, though \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 Democratic Socialism \u2013 garnered 12 million votes in the primaries, and continues to find voice in the social movements that helped make his campaign possible. Railing against the 1% in Washington and on Wall Street, Sanders offered an egalitarian populism to those who felt left out of the political system, not a reactionary one.</p> <p>The fight over vote rigging in 2016 is a proxy war for a much deeper crisis of legitimacy in American democracy, pitting the country\u2019s political elite against just about everyone else who lives here. Our democracy is in sore need a revolution, one that \u2013 with any luck \u2013 will be a far cry from the violent and xenophobic coup Trump\u2019s supporters are promising to bring about. </p>",

  "<p>The red mini dress has long gone, but at 83 Nichelle Nichols looks every bit as glamorous as she did on the Starship Enterprise in the 60s. And every bit as imposing. When Lieutenant Uhura (promoted to lieutenant commander, then commander) spoke, fellow crew members listened. Uhura, the communications officer who specialised in linguistics, cryptography and philology, just needed to say one word (\u201cCaptain!\u201d) for everybody to pay attention.</p> <p>Today, the black hair has morphed into a mane of golden white, complemented by a white-furred cardigan. Apart from that, she is a vision in black \u2013 trousers, sequinned top, shoes. She is in Britain to celebrate 50 years of Star Trek, and celebrating it she certainly is. Nichols is tucking into honeyed peanuts and crisps after a hard morning\u2019s work \u2013 first Good Morning Britain, then a round table with journalists hanging on to her every interplanetary morsel. \u201cI think the whole world is celebrating 50 years of Star Trek,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The legendary sci-fi TV series promised to seek out new life and new civilisations, and to boldly go where no man had gone before. Which it did. As well as exploring new planets, it entered virgin territory as far as casting went. The Star Trek franchise (it later became a cartoon and series of films), devised by the brilliant Gene Roddenberry, reflected its creator\u2019s optimism, with different nationalities, races and species happily co-existing. In a way it was Roddenberry\u2019s idealistic response to the racial ferment of the 60s \u2013 so Lt Sulu was a Japanese helmsman, Lt Uhura was African-American and Mr Spock was half-Vulcan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa58fc4dc4fd7cdde186bc4d11c45421798d532c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa58fc4dc4fd7cdde186bc4d11c45421798d532c/0_5_1860_3102/600.jpg\" alt=\"Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in 1966.\" width=\"600\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Insight Editions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casting of Nichols was groundbreaking. Not only was it a rarity to see a black woman on primetime TV, it was even rarer to see a black woman (or woman full stop) cast in a high-powered role. Nichols was decades ahead of her time.</p> <p>Even before Star Trek, she had an astonishing life. Nichols was born Grace Dell Nichols, but she didn\u2019t care for her name. \u201cI wasn\u2019t satisfied with it, so I went to my mother and father and told them, and they changed it.\u201d They offered her Nichelle (meaning Victorious Maiden) and she was happy with that. Nichols has always been strongly opinionated \u2013 not a girl or woman who would stand for nonsense.</p> <p>By the age of 15, she was singing with Duke Ellington. \u201cI was an accidental singer,\u201d she says. How did she start singing with him? \u201cI don\u2019t even remember, it was so long ago, but it was a wonderful experience. Duke Ellington and his band were so kind to me and they treated me like a daughter. They had to pay somebody from my family to escort me because I was so young!\u201d</p> <p>Nichols\u2019s memory is not what it once was. Nor is her hearing. Many questions are greeted with: \u201cSay what?\u201d I repeat my question slower and louder. She then gives me a look that says no need to shout. It feels as if we\u2019re caught up in a 40s screwball comedy. Nichols is still sharp and quick-witted, with a fabulously raucous laugh.</p> <p>She was born in Robbins, Illinois, near Chicago. Her father, Samuel Earl Nichols, was a factory worker who became mayor of Robbins and chief magistrate. Her mother had her hands full bringing up their six children. As a little girl, she remembers standing by the french doors that separated the living room from the dining room,painstakingly eavesdropping on grownup conversations. She learned so much, she says, listening in to adult conversations about politics, work and love. Did she ever get told off for it? \u201cNo. I later discovered they knew I was there behind that door, and they thought: \u2018She\u2019s going to find out anyway, let her listen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nichols had dreams of singing and dancing on Broadway when she signed up to Star Trek. She had worked for Roddenberry in an earlier TV series and had a relationship with him \u2013 though this was over by the time her cast her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"023b10a7363595a48b5b93f7b2b53036fc2e00df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023b10a7363595a48b5b93f7b2b53036fc2e00df/0_247_2484_1490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The original Star Trek crew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The original Star Trek crew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the secret of the show\u2019s success was that it appealed equally to sci-fi nerds and those who didn\u2019t normally like science fiction. Star Trek was rooted in very human (or Vulcan-human) relationships, humour, memorable characters and late-60s utopianism. Though it was sometimes accused of cultural imperalism (species from outer space were expected to conform to human values), it was radical in its own way.</p> <p>When I say the word \u201cradical\u201d to Nichols, she shakes her head. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t radical.\u201d She laughs. OK, liberal then? \u201cLiberal yeah. Not radical. Hahahaha!\u201d She should know. After all, this is the woman who befriended Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, and became a figurehead of the civil rights movement in her own right.</p> <p>After the first series of Star Trek, she wanted to leave because she felt her role was being diminished, and she fancied her chances on Broadway. That\u2019s when she met King. She was at a formal dinner when she was told somebody wanted to meet her. \u201cI turned, and about 10 or 12 feet away from me, there was Dr Martin Luther King, and my mouth just dropped open.\u201d</p> <p>Was he a Trekky? \u201cSay what? Was he attractive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I ask: \u201cWas he a Trekky? But that\u2019s a good question, now you mention it \u2013 was he attractive?\u201d</p> <p>She grins. \u201cHe was both attractive and a Trekker. He was an attractive Trekker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/08/to-boldly-binge-my-continuing-mission-to-watch-all-700-episodes-of-star-trek\">To boldly binge: my continuing mission to watch all 700 episodes of Star Trek</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nichols told King she was going to miss Star Trek, and he asked what she meant. She said she was leaving for Broadway. That was when King told her Star Trek was the only programme he allowed his children to watch, and ordered her not to leave. \u201cHe told me not only that I shouldn\u2019t but I couldn\u2019t leave.\u201d Blimey, I say, that\u2019s a bit bossy. Why did he say that? She smiles. \u201cHe knew more than I knew. He knew more about me, where I was going to in my life, than I did.\u201d In her autobiography, she writes that he told her she couldn\u2019t leave because she was a role model for millions of young girls and women \u2013 the only African-American on TV in a role worth having.</p> <p>She and King became close friends. \u201cHe was an amazing man.

But her speech is still as strong as her fearsome handshake. When she fails to answer a question, more often than not it seems to be because she doesn\u2019t want to. She never says a word more than she needs \u2013 or wants \u2013 to. Nichols says she has always been tough, that she\u2019s needed to be to get by in her world.</p> <p>There are so many wonderful scenes with her in Star Trek. One of my favourites is when an entranced Spock explains her name (Uhura, adapted from the Swahili <em>uhuru,</em> meaning \u201cfreedom\u201d, was chosen by Nichols herself.) He then quotes Byron at her for good measure: \u201cShe walks in beauty like the night.\u201d Even better is when she serenades the harp-playing Spock with a jazz-infused song (\u201cOn the Starship Enterprise \u2026 his alien love could victimise, and rip your heart from you.\u201d)</p> <p>But the scene she gets asked about most is the kiss she shared with Captain Kirk, played by William Shatner. It is said to be the first interracial kiss in an American TV series. It has also been suggested that she was supposed to kiss Spock, but the producers thought the public would regarded it as a step too far to have an inter-species kiss.</p> <p>The funny thing, she says, is she didn\u2019t regard it as remarkable in ther slightest. It might have been rare in the American media of the 1960s, but there was nothing unusual about it in her family. After all, her grandfather was white and her grandmother black. As far as she was concerned, this was just everyday life.</p> <p>I ask if it is true that Shatner, who became a notorious egomaniac as Star Trek progressed, insisted that he rather than Spock be the beneficiary of the kiss because he was the captain. \u201cHehehehehe! I think that was a joke between them. And they carried it through thick and thin, but it wasn\u2019t so.\u201d Who would she have rather kissed? \u201cHahahha! We\u2019ll never know!\u201d</p> <p>You are too discreet, I say. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell,\u201d she replies, and she giggles coquettishly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ab078c1ea4a7ffd2f8ff57af67bc506b6e08863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab078c1ea4a7ffd2f8ff57af67bc506b6e08863/0_0_3000_2256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in the Star Trek episode Plato\u2019s Stepchildren, 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"752\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in the Star Trek episode Plato\u2019s Stepchildren, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While we\u2019re on the subject, I say, what happened to that red mini dress.

I ask, shocked: she stole it? \u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d</p> <p>You stole the dress? She taps her finger on her nose again. The subject is closed.</p> <p>By 1969 the original television version was done and dusted, and Nichols went on to star as Uhura in the first six Star Trek films up to 1991, by which time she was in her mid-50s. In the 80s she worked for Nasa as an ambassador, with a brief to help recruit minority and women astronauts. She has been up into space herself, flying aboard Nasa\u2019s C-141 Astronomy Observatory, which analysed the atmospheres of Mars and Saturn on an eight-hour, high-altitude mission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/04/star-trek--50-year-mission-best-of-humankind\">Star Trek\u2019s 50-year mission: to shine a light on the best of humankind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, Nichols is still acting \u2013 earlier this year she was praised for her role as the ageing mother of Neil Winters on the longstanding American soap The Young and the Restless.</p> <p>I ask Nichols, who has been married twice, if there is there any work she has made that has meant as much to her as Star Trek. \u201cYes,\u201d she says instantly. \u201cMy son!\u201d That\u2019s lovely, I say \u2013 what does he do? \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him. All I can say is he\u2019s just great.\u201d Nichols is old-school. She doesn\u2019t tell tales or do gossip. What\u2019s private remains private.</p> <p>She\u2019s a little tired now. She suggests it\u2019s time to turn down the questions. Then, rather sweetly, she adds that I\u2019m welcome to stay and share the crisps and nuts. Her assistant takes our photo.

Colbert quipped: \u201c55 \u2013 a tough time to start over for a man.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert then took on the character of \u201cRandy\u201d, who proceeded to interview Obama for an unspecified role. \u201cI don\u2019t see any promotions for the last eight years, not always good,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you explain that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of room for advancement in my last job,\u201d Obama replied. \u201cThe only one with a more powerful position was my wife.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert, or Randy, then asked the president why he\u2019s leaving his current job. After hearing his reply, Colbert said: \u201cOkay, little tip.

The upshot, though, was simply to deter legitimate voters, many of whom left rather than endure what they saw as bullying and humiliation by confident white men in suits.</p> \n<p>When Democratic party poll watchers objected, a scuffle broke out. Eventually, Rehnquist and his colleagues were asked to leave, and the practice of challenging individual voters \u2013 a relic of the Jim Crow-era south \u2013 was soon outlawed in Arizona and many other states.</p> \n<p>With the Trump campaign now predicting the election will be rigged by Hillary Clinton, voting rights activists are once again alarmed by calls from the Republican\u2019s campaign for so-called \u201cvolunteer election observers\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many voting rights activists worry, however, that just calling for a volunteer army of observers may have a chilling effect on turnout, especially among minority voters. They worry, too, about the toxic political atmosphere that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is creating. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no place for harassment of voters in American democracy,\u201d a group of more than 60 activist groups spearheaded by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.866ourvote.org/pages/open-letter-to-political-parties-concerning-voter-intimidation\">open letter</a> to all the major political parties. \u201cUnsubstantiated predictions of voter fraud and rigged elections, coupled with the demagogic rhetoric of the last few months towards minority communities, constitute an unacceptable targeting of those members of our society most vulnerable to disenfranchisement.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/clinton-campaign-democratic-party-sue-arizona-voting-rights\">Clinton campaign and Democratic party sue Arizona over voting rights</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even before Trump launched his presidential campaign, the Republican party had established a track record of controversial challenges to the legitimacy of certain Democratic voters. They have waged a decade-long campaign to introduce voter ID laws and other restrictions that have done little or nothing to prevent fraud . The Brennan Center for Justice has found that voter fraud is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/truth-about-voter-fraud\">less likely than death by lightning strike</a> \u2013 between 2000 and 2014 it found <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">just 31 credible incidents</a> of voter impersonation across the entire US.</p> \n<p>Courts and activists have warned that the principal effect of these laws has been to suppress the voices of legitimate voters who lean Democratic.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Kristen Clarke of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, \u201cthe problem with voting in the United States is not the voting process itself, but the efforts undertaken at the local and state level in recent years to make voting more difficult, most especially for African American and other minority voters.\u201d </p> \n<p>In contrast to Trump\u2019s call for monitors to challenge voters, lawyers and activists have set up elaborate election protection systems across the country so voters suffering harassment can call for help, and groups can dispatch lawyers to defuse problems. They are particularly concerned about Florida and Pennsylvania, where the laws are not as strict as elsewhere.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/582gk\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2816579\" data-video-name=\"US presidential election is rigged, says Donald Trump \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5805e0cfe4b005f21833a984\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/18/161018TrumpRiggedElectionUpdate_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/18/161018TrumpRiggedElectionUpdate.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/18/161018TrumpRiggedElectionUpdate_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video\">US presidential election is rigged, says Donald Trump</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 now including the threat that he may refuse to concede if the election goes against him \u2013 only compounds a political environment that has already been fraught with challenges following the supreme court\u2019s 2013 decision to overturn parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The ruling not only limited the justice department\u2019s power to stop some voting laws that can have a discriminatory effect; the department is also unable, for the first time in more than 50 years, to send <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-voting-observers-exclusi-idUSKCN0ZX0QR\">election observers of its own</a> without a court order. </p> \n<p>Almost 800 federal election observers were deployed around the country in 2012. </p> \n<p>Challenging voters is itself not a new idea. The GOP tried to do it in Ohio in 2004 by sending postcards to Democratic voters at their last known address and then challenging the legitimacy of anyone whose postcard bounced back in the mail \u2013 a notorious practice dating back to the civil rights era known as vote caging. The courts stepped in to stop the maneuver in its tracks.</p> \n<p>Since then, a conservative poll-watching group called True the Vote has vowed to train 1 million activists to challenge and confront anyone they regard as suspect. The organization <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/publication/bullies-ballot-box-protecting-freedom-vote-against-wrongful-challenges-and-intimidation\">said in 2012</a> it wanted to make the experience of voting for those voters \u201clike driving and seeing the police following you\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Trump\u2019s predictions of a rigged election have put him out of step even with many of his <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rubio-toomey-dispute-trump-rigged-elections-claims-debates-n668006\">fellow Republicans</a>, including his own running mate, Indiana governor <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/16/498152787/mike-pence-we-will-absolutely-accept-the-result-of-the-election\">Mike Pence</a>, who said on Sunday: \u201cWe will absolutely accept the results of the election.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even the former senator Kit Bond of Missouri, who was one of the first to advocate voter ID laws, and memorably claimed to have found a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/voter-suppression-kevin-drum\">springer spaniel</a> who voted Democratic, has said that Trump\u2019s evidence-free pre-emptive allegation of vote-rigging <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/republicans-rigged-election-claim-donald-trump-229630\">\u201cisn\u2019t going to cut it\u201d.</a> </p> \n<p>The split with the party may itself be an obstacle to Trump pursuing any kind of post-election challenge, because the top election officials in several swing states, including Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona, are Republicans. If they raise no objection to certifying the results, it is unlikely Trump by himself can do anything to change their minds.</p>",

But by targeting the Olympics as one area in which savings could be made, she risks alienating Games organisers and sports federations that have called for rowing, swimming and volleyball to be kept in Tokyo.</p> \n<p>In a meeting with the IOC president, Thomas Bach, in Tokyo on Tuesday, Koike said the public supported her economy drive. \u201cWhen I won the election two months ago, I swore to the public that the spending for the Olympics and Paralympics needed to be reviewed,\u201d Koike said, according to Kyodo.</p> \n<p>Koike said she would conclude her review of the three Olympic venues by the end of the month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"75a32b56-8b3b-4a0f-baa6-9e803e25b26c\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>The rocky road to Tokyo 2020</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>Japan\u2019s preparations have suffered a series of setbacks:<br></p>\n     <p>\u2022 The original design for the main stadium was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/17/japan-scraps-zaha-hadids-tokyo-olympic-stadium-design\">scrapped</a> after complaints about its size and cost.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p>\u2022 The original logo was also abandoned after the designer was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/tokyo-2020-olympics-logo-scrapped-after-allegations-of-plagiarism\">accused of plagiarism</a>.</p>\n     <p>\u2022 The potential price tag <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/04/tokyo-olympics-soaring-costs-set-up-showdown-ioc\">has soared to 3tn yen (\u00a323bn)</a>, four times the original estimate.</p>\n     <p>\u2022 In May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/tokyo-olympics-payment-diack-2020-games\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the bid committee had paid more than \u00a31.6m to a company linked to the son of the disgraced former world athletics chief, Lamine Diack.

The estimate given to the IOC, however, was 9.8 billion yen.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe IOC pointed out that our expenses were too high, so we gave them an unfounded figure,\u201d the Mainichi quoted a senior Tokyo metropolitan government official as saying.</p> \n<p>The total cost of building the Sea Forest venue, including surrounding parks and other \u201clegacy\u201d infrastructure, has been estimated at 49.1 billion yen.

The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic organising committee said turning the venue, which is 270 miles (440km) from Tokyo, into one capable of hosting the Olympics could exceed 35.1 billion yen.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would like to stress once again that the decision [to build a new canoeing venue in Tokyo] was made unanimously and based on thorough investigations,\u201d Toshiaki Endo, a Tokyo 2020 executive board member, said earlier this month. \u201cWe have conducted careful examinations of all candidate rowing sites.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a result, all parties, including the IOC, the international federations, the national federations, Tokyo 2020 organising committee and the Tokyo metropolitan government came to the conclusion that Sea Forest Waterway was the most promising, and best suited to hosting rowing competitions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Japan\u2019s sports minister, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Tuesday that \u201cvenues for the Olympics should be located inside the host country\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tokyo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/07/tokyo-host-2020-olympic-games\">won the right to host the Games in 2013</a> by promising a compact Games with 28 of the 31 competition venues within a five-mile radius of the Olympic village.

It remains politically expedient to scapegoat our communities. Hatred of immigrants from south of the border provided the bedrock for the Trump campaign, but long before him, there was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Steve King, Lou Dobbs \u2013 the list goes on.</p> <p>To be sure, there is a vigorous, politically engaged sector of our community. But there is also a pervasive sense of helplessness, of lethargy \u2013 there are so many of us, but so little is changing.</p> <p>Under a Democratic president, a man Latinos helped surge into the White House, undocumented immigrants, many of whom are economic and political refugees, are <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-deportation-policy-numbers/story?id=41715661\">being deported</a> en masse. Some are taken in <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-deportation-exclusive-idUSKCN0Y32J1\">raids</a>. Detention centers swell with our people. For detained LGBT refugees, particularly those who are transgender, the conditions are inhumane.</p> <p>Preceding all of this is a history of oppression and marginalization. When the border was <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/guadalupe-hidalgo\">moved south</a>, Mexicans who were already living on the land found themselves labeled as aliens. In the 1930s and 40s, up to 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, regardless of citizenship status, were rounded up <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">and expelled</a> from the country.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/study-finds-republican-voter-suppression-is-even-more-effective-than-you-think-3b2562ae2f52#.za2ibswj9\">an onslaught</a> of voter restrictions that disproportionately harms the Latino community, such as voter ID laws, suppresses the ability for Latinos to express their will in the electoral process. Our turnout isn\u2019t exactly what it could be, and English is a huge barrier for many immigrants to engaging in politics.</p> <p>And yet, despite it all, our ranks are growing. We are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/27-million-potential-hispanic-votes-but-what-will-they-really-add-up-to.html?_r=0\">registering</a> to vote. We are reshaping the electoral map, and politicians who use our existence in this country as a cudgel would do well to take note: the strategy of othering us has an expiration date. We could soon <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/06/its-official-the-us-is-becoming-a-minority-majority-nation\">be the majority</a>.</p> <p>There are plenty of pundits who argue that the prophecy of a powerful Latino voting bloc remains a myth, but I believe we have reason to be optimistic.<br></p> <p>That we have so far failed to activate the sleeping strength of Latino voters is not to suggest that we are not politically active or that we have never succeeded in political protest. I would point to the <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/important-day-us-history-chicano-moratorium\">Chicano Moratorium</a>, the largest anti-Vietnam War protest spearheaded by any minority group. It drew 30,000 demonstrators in East Los Angeles in 1970.</p> <p>I would also point to Cesar Chavez and the National Farm Workers Association. The success of the Modesto march in 1975, which started with just a few hundred people and swelled to 15,000, is a counterpoint to claims that Latinos lack the education and means to engage in political action.</p> <p>To be Latino is to inherit a rich history of resistance. Our people, so often mistreated by both sides, but especially by Republicans, are waking up. I look at young Latinos who are taking to the streets to fight for undocumented people, to <a href=\"http://www.nbclosangeles.com/on-air/as-seen-on/SoCal-Residents-Protest-DACA-Block_Los-Angeles-292210971.html\">protect Daca</a>, to free LGBT refugees <a href=\"https://voiceofoc.org/2016/05/transgender-advocates-launch-hunger-strike-to-protest-santa-ana-ice-contract/\">from detention.</a> It is a reminder that we were never truly silent, and that our voice is growing louder every day.</p> <p>We need to harness this energy and direct it to getting Latinos to the voting booth if we are to make manifest our potential in this country. That includes pushing for more Spanish-language material from campaigns,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/VoterIDLawsSuppressionofMinorityVoters.pdf\">dismantling voter ID laws</a>&#xa0;that target Latinos, and actively engaging with organizations like&#xa0;<a href=\"http://votolatino.org/\">Voto Latino</a>&#xa0;that are working to get more Latinos registered to vote. It includes talking to our family members, especially those of us who speak English and have an understanding of American politics, about why it\u2019s important to vote and why it\u2019s more crucial than ever to be a part of the electoral process.</p> <p>It\u2019s important that we do: Trump wasn\u2019t the first demagogue to use our community as scapegoats, and he won\u2019t be the last. </p>",

In 1982, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/11/middletown-gary-younge-us-election-presidential-muncie-indiana#comment-85280992\">as one of our readers noted</a>, PBS released a six-part documentary on Muncie called Middletown. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36651048\">One episode, set in Southside High School</a>, which has since closed, depicted casual drug use, profanity and sexual banter while focusing considerable attention on an teenage interracial relationship. After tense discussions between local leaders, PBS and the film-makers, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/arts/final-pbs-middletown-segment-is-withdrawn.html\">the episode was withdrawn</a> and the series sponsor, Xerox, withdrew its sponsorship \u2013 but not its funding \u2013 from that particular program, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/movies/homevideo/seventeen-and-cooley-high-no-easy-as-but-powerful-lessons.html?_r=0\">has since been released on DVD</a>. One person involved in the talks at the time told the New York Times that the decision was made to protect the children. \u2018\u2019It\u2019s a very difficult issue of freedom of speech versus what these kids might have been doing to themselves. There\u2019s a possibility that they really could be destroying their lives in saying some of the things they said in the film. In a way, you have to protect them \u2013 they\u2019re minors, after all \u2013 from themselves.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>And like a fairground mirror, Middletown gave America an image of itself that was both familiar and woefully distorted \u2013 an image that the American commentariat preferred to reality. For when the Lynds selected a city they settled on three key characteristics: that it be between 25,000 and 50,000 people, that it was \u201cself-contained\u201d (not a \u201csatellite\u201d or suburb) and finally, that it should \u201chave a small Negro and foreign-born population\u201d. Muncie did not actually fit the bill for the final point. At 5% its black population was proportionally higher at the time than New York, Chicago and Detroit . It did have a small foreign-born population because the local business class imported workers from Tennessee and Kentucky. \u201cThere was a conscious attempt to keep foreign workers out,\u201d says Connolly. \u201cBecause they wanted people to go home during slack times and they were worried foreigners would bring in dangerous ideas.\u201d But once again, this made it atypical compared with other towns of its size.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&amp;label_after=Now&amp;\" data-alt=\"Delaware Courthouse\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&label_after=Now&\">Delaware Courthouse</a> <figcaption>Delaware Courthouse</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Lynds did this consciously because they wanted to concentrate on class and therefore avoid dealing with \u201ctwo major variables\u201d and deal instead with a \u201chomogeonous, native-born population\u201d. \u201cThey understood that they were doing that and they justified it in a social-scientific sense,\u201d says Igo, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThey try to unmask this myth about class.

Bongo has ruled Gabon since 2009 when he succeeded his father Omar, who had been the president since 1967.</p> <p>The parliament building and the national television station were attacked by Ping supporters and there were several days of clashes on the streets between the opposition and police. The government acknowledged three people were killed in the protests but the opposition has said the figure could be as high as 50. There were also several hundred arrests. Social media was suspended and a moratorium imposed on the issuing of visas to foreign journalists. The Confederation of African Football discussed the unrest and sounded out Morocco as a replacement host; it had been supposed to host the 2015 tournament before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/06/morocco-banned-and-fined-africa-cup-of-nations\">withdrawing at the last minute</a> because of fears over Ebola.</p> <p>The Gabonese supreme court<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/gabon-court-rules-president-ali-bongo-rightful-winner-of-september-election\"> investigated the election result</a> and concluded Bongo had won by 11,000 votes. Bongo has sworn in a new cabinet and, for now, everything appears relatively calm, although the state budget for 2017 has been cut by 5% because of the falling oil price. The possibility remains the tournament could be used as a platform for dissent by the opposition, particularly in Oyem and Port Gentil, host cities in areas that strongly backed Ping.</p> <p>The tournament looks fascinatingly open and, as has been the recent way of things, is missing a number of big names. Most strikingly, for the third time in four tournaments, there is no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/nigeria-football-team\">Nigeria</a>. They were perhaps a little unfortunate Chad\u2019s withdrawal denied them the chance to qualify as a best runner-up, but they took only a point from two games with Egypt and could only draw away to Tanzania. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica\">South Africa</a> miss out for the third time in five tournaments after finishing third in their group behind not only Cameroon but also Mauritania.

They lurk ominously in seeding pot three which also comprises Cameroon, Senegal and Morocco and, as such, looks rather more likely to produce a winner than pot two, where Tunisia, Mali, Burkina Faso and DR Congo have benefitted from decent runs at recent tournaments.</p> <p>Another side making a long-awaited comeback are Uganda who have qualified for the first time since being beaten in the final by Ghana in 1978. They are joined in Pot four by Togo, Zimbabwe and the debutants Guinea-Bissau, who finished top of a qualifying group comprising Congo, Zambia and Kenya with a goal difference of zero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/oct/14/desert-fire-the-world-cup-rebels-of-kurdistan-video\">Desert fire: the world cup rebels of Kurdistan \u2013 video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last time they (co-) hosted the tournament, in 2012, Gabon reached the quarter-final where they lost on penalties to Mali. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed the decisive kick, is more experienced and a more rounded player now and it\u2019s not impossible, with home support and a solid midfield, that they could go further.</p> <p>Ghana have a squad based around the side who won the Under-20 World Cup in 2009, Algeria have a fine crop of attacking players but are looking for a coach after Milovan Rajevac walked out after two games in charge and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/08/ivory-coast-ghana-africa-cup-of-nations-final-match-report\">Ivory Coast, the defending champions</a>, have paradoxically blossomed as the so-called golden generation have begun to retire.</p> <p>The first decade of the 21st century witnessed the domination of two great sides, Cameroon and Egypt, but since 2010, no side has been on top. Two of the last three winners have not qualified. It feels as though any of about 10 sides could win in Gabon. Whether that is the result of a general lifting of standards, or whether the absence of a great team is evidence of a general lack of quality is open to debate but what is certain is how competitive and unpredictable the 2017 Cup of Nations will be. We are not even entirely certain where it\u2019s going to be.</p>",

  "<p>In the past 12 months, Jessica Campbell has had her car\u2019s fuel line cut and its wheel nuts loosened. Late last year, she had a GPS tracker surreptitiously attached to her vehicle. She is now accustomed to being tailed by unfamiliar vehicles on Interstate 5 near her home in Cottage Grove, just outside Eugene, Oregon. Strangers have regularly come uninvited onto her property; someone even stripped the barbed wire on her fence \u201cjust to send a message\u201d. Online, she has repeatedly been threatened with rape and death. </p> <p>And last week, when she showed up at the Canyon City community hall in Grant County, she told me that someone shot at her and her entourage. They misread their GPS, took a wrong turn and stopped to get their bearings when a crack rang out with what Campbell thought was a .22 bullet whizzing by their vehicle. </p> <p>Such threats are part of the pushback her work has sparked in rural Oregon. </p> <p>Campbell co-directs the <a href=\"http://www.rop.org/\">Rural Organizing Project</a>, a not-for-profit group that sets out to confront the rightwing insurgency that has been bubbling away in parts of rural Oregon and throughout the west.

She fears this trend will continue long after a Trump defeat. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of paramilitary groups recruiting on the basis of a likely Hillary Clinton win,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m seeing a lot of paramilitary groups recruiting on the basis of a likely Hillary Clinton win</p> <footer> <cite>Jessica Campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Trump started talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/17/donald-trump-rigged-election-hillary-clinton-news-live\">rigged elections</a> and how a Clinton win would show that democracy was broken, \u201cit was just amazing seeing how that resonated with people \u2013 a sense of democracy being broken, feeling like the candidates don\u2019t represent them or anything they want to see happen in this country,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Campbell would vastly prefer that Clinton wins but acknowledges that it may be like it was \u201cafter Obama won, where there was a huge growth in Patriot movement organizing. I\u2019m worried that we are going to see the same thing.\u201d The alleged <a href=\"http://[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/kansas-bomb-plot-arrest-somali.html?\\_r=0\">bomb plot</a> by militia members in Kansas, timed for the day after the election, shows the way in which those fears might be borne out. </p> <p>The Rural Organizing Project is not waiting idly for this tide to roll in. The group has just finished a statewide tour in which they presented a <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/2016/10/03/release-major-investigation-toolkit-to-aid-oregon-communities-facing-militia-movements/\">report</a> on the growth of the Patriot movement, which they collaborated on with <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/#\">Political Research Associates</a>, a thinktank that watches the far right. </p> <p>Instead of inviting people to view it online, Campbell and her colleagues went to eight rural towns and delivered the main points in a series of lectures. The tour finished late last week. </p> <p>Each event followed a pattern developed through long experience confronting those who would prefer that progressive voices aren\u2019t heard. At each stop, after Campbell\u2019s brief Powerpoint summary of Patriot movement organizing in Oregon, they invite written comments that are then read out. In Bend, one question asked about the impact of Patriot movement organizing on tourism; in Canyon City, people wanted to know about the economic roots of the far-right insurgency. Small-group discussions follow. The format is designed to de-escalate the tension that has increasingly riven small-town politics in Oregon, and to minimize opportunities for disruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd1e05f1ad3ea0ba7808e5364adc41e801087ece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1e05f1ad3ea0ba7808e5364adc41e801087ece/0_56_4928_2984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BJ Soper, a militia member, attended an event in Bend, Oregon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BJ Soper, a militia member, attended an event in Bend, Oregon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campbell and her crew also travel with a highly visible security detail, partly made up of Portland members of the <a href=\"http://www.aaprporegon.org/\">All African People\u2019s Revolutionary Party</a>. Earlier this year, attendees of a workshop were harassed in the carpark outside the event, and they decided that positive, protective steps were needed. </p> <p>The events are hosted by local progressive organising groups, and at the largest events, such as the one in Canyon City in Grant County, 50 to 60 people showed up \u2013 a large number in a county of about 7,000 residents. Although many who come represent the active, progressive minority in small towns, resistance to the militia movement has a way of binding people together who may disagree on a range of issues. Campbell says that the Grant County group features people from \u201cacross the political spectrum\u201d who share a concern about who is directing county politics. </p> <p>These numbers underscore something Campbell stresses: while media reports often suggest that patriots and the far right are representative of community opinion, they are frequently no more than a vocal minority. ROP\u2019s presence encourages those who disagree to the far right\u2019s prescriptions to rise above the intimidation they use to silence their opponents. </p> <p>There were clear signs that their strategy \u2013 which for now Campbell calls \u201can experiment\u201d \u2013 is working to empower locals, and even open up a dialogue with those who have been drawn into the orbit of the far right. </p> <p>In Canyon City last January, Judy Schuette heard about the plans of militia members to meet in Grant County and perhaps spread the occupation there. Schuette called for a response and a public meeting on Facebook. On the floorboards of the community hall, she recalls: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how many people would show up, and we wound up with about 70 people.\u201d</p> <p>After being formally organised in February, the group carried out several actions. They visited Harney County to show support for a protest there, and attended meetings of the county court, the local governing council, to protest increasing militia and Patriot disruption of the body. </p> <p>But ROP\u2019s tour doesn\u2019t just let them put on another big public gathering. Activists also get de-escalation training from the security detail and much-needed information about how to fight and win a long-term campaign against the rightwing insurgency in their community. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44de643b4411f16900e15a7e2cc408a0346a6a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44de643b4411f16900e15a7e2cc408a0346a6a0c/0_0_6016_3827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campbell speaks at an event with a security agent alongside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campbell speaks at an event with a security agent alongside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Campbell, local organisers like Schuette are the prime movers for making change in rural Oregon. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re incredibly dedicated and brilliant. They\u2019re mostly women who care about their community. In Grant County and other counties where people are feeling that their lives could be on the line if they don\u2019t act now, that\u2019s where people are doing the best work.\u201d</p> <p>But Campbell is clear-eyed about the roots of the problem, and her diagnosis cuts through a lot of the armchair debate about where the resentment that underpins rightwing insurgency comes from. \u201cIn rural areas the conditions have been ripe for a white nationalist populist movement. Especially in Oregon where we\u2019re facing demographic shifts in a lot of places, and the economy\u2019s hurting so badly, and we\u2019ve had decades of scapegoating of people of colour as the reason why our economies are so bad.\u201d</p> <p>In some Oregon counties, as in other rural areas, libraries are shutting, and sheriff\u2019s departments can\u2019t provide 911 dispatch after dark. Dwindling services lead to a sense of abandonment. The right can easily step in and provide both a clear political narrative to explain this, and a set of simple-seeming solutions. </p> <p>\u201cThe Patriot movement is attracting people who feel disenfranchised. It\u2019s real out here, where people feel like they have not been listened to at the state level, and particularly by Democrats,\u201d Campbell says.</p> <p>The same dynamic has been driving the election. \u201cThe appeal of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders was that they didn\u2019t feel like establishment figureheads. It didn\u2019t feel like they were going to uphold the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats, who hold a rare trifecta of both state houses and the governorship, see no point in outreach to deep red counties in the east and south of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear that rural Oregon has been written off. We\u2019re often the only game in town.\u201d </p> <p>The focus of the tour might be the militia movement, but the real goal is addressing this sense of lost political agency. </p> <p>\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to take down the Patriot movement. It\u2019s to build a rural Oregon where people have some access to democracy and are able to create change and have an impact on their communities.\u201d</p> <p>Helping these communities to demand the resources they need to shut down rightwing insurgencies means having a conversation with them, and not simply dismissing or scapegoating them. It also requires bravery: if you confront the far right on their own turf, you might be threatened, followed or shot at. </p> <p>We haven\u2019t all been given as big a share of courage as Campbell, the rest of the ROP, and local organizers have. But we can at least listen to what they have to say about the origins of America\u2019s rightwing surge. </p>",

Granted, everyone has had a crack at summarising but this is my version.</p> <ul> <li>The Adler shotgun was banned from coming into the country last year because it was a different type of gun and did not fit into a categories in the National Firearms Agreement.<br></li> <li>The feds and states have to decide which category it fits into so until that happens, the import ban is in place.<br></li> <li><strong>David Leyonhjelm</strong> does not believe in gun regulation so he cut a deal under Abbott for a sunset clause on the ban to expire in August this year.<br></li> <li>Just before the use-by date, the Turnbull government chucked out the sunset clause and extended the ban because the states and the feds had yet to agree on a classification.<br></li> <li>Leyonhjelm says the Coalition welched on the deal. Which is true.<br></li> <li>If the government had not welched on the deal, the Adler would have come into the country with the <strong>lowest possible rating</strong>. </li> <li>Leyonhjelm still wants the ban lifted. He believes the Adler should be in the lowest category \u2013 which would make it most accessible.</li> <li>Labor thinks the ban should stay in place but have not committed so far to whether it should be let in by state and feds. </li> <li>I am seeking an answer from the government on which category the Adler should be in. </li> </ul> <p>So there are two issues:</p> <ol> <li>Should the Adler be allowed in at all?</li> <li>If so, what category should it be in?</li> </ol> <p>This has allowed many straw men to flourish.</p> <p>The National Firearms Agreement \u2013 or the Howard gun laws \u2013 will still be in place, no matter what the outcome for the Adler. <strong>Because this is the framework for the gun laws.</strong></p> <p>This means that the government can say rightly they are still committed to the Howard gun laws.</p> <p>But if the Adler is allowed in on the lowest category \u2013 as Leyonhjelm wants \u2013 there will be a more lethal weapon available to ordinary shooters.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T05:47:41.842Z\">at 6.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5805a37de4b0cd26ff71e324\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T04:23:51.656Z\">5.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AHRC president <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong> is being asked about <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18c.html\">complaints made under s18C of the Racial Discrimination Act</a> in Senate estimates.<br></p> <p>Triggs notes that <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html\">s18D provides an exemptions</a> for works that are done reasonably and in good faith.

So that was not designed to weaken or vary John Howard\u2019s gun laws. </p> <p>It was to hold the ring and prevent the lever-action guns of that capacity to be imported at all. That ban had a 12-month duration. When it came up for expiry, it was renewed.

It seemed like a good idea at the time but, after the election, the government benches were whittled back to a one seat majority. </p> <p>The two bills would establish a Australian Building Construction Commission and regulate registered organisations, ie unions. Today the first bill returns to the house, in a neat two-step following <strong>Bill Shorten\u2019s</strong> endorsement of former Health Services Union official <strong>Kimberley Kitching </strong>and an outbreak of factional farnarkling. </p> <p>In an interview with <strong>Fran Kelly</strong>, Turnbull has, on the one hand, attacked union thuggery in the CFMEU and, on the other, endorsed the bills as a great thing for the health of unions. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not anti-union. This is not union busting. If the Labor party were to support this legislation, they would build public confidence in the unions, because the unions would be run in accordance with the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly asks, why not get the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to regulate unions as they do the banks? Why bust unions and not banks? Turnbull says the government is doing lots on the bank front and now they are doing lots on the union front. He is an equal opportunity regulator.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Right across the board, what we\u2019re doing is addressing the issues that have been raised and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the industrial relations field too.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Overnight, you might have seen <strong>David Leyonhjelm</strong> has raised the prospect of horse trading over the ABCC bill. He wants a ban lifted on the importation of the Adler shotgun. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The regulation of firearms is dealt with by Coag in effect, by states and territories and the commonwealth working together and so the importation <strong>ban on the lever-action Adler shotgun, over more than five rounds,</strong> was introduced and has been maintained because of a failure to date of that state and territory group to reach a resolution on it. </p> <p>So it is a collaborative effort. But I want to stress to you ... we have among the most, if not the most rigorous laws on the regulation of firearms in the world. It\u2019s one of the great achievements of <strong>John Howard</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fran: The world\u2019s leading human rights body is accusing your government, our government, of torture. You need to respond to that, don\u2019t you?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I reject that claim totally, it is absolutely false ...

Do we want to continue to ignore the severe problems so many of us face or do we work together to build the decent, fair society we can have?</p> <p>The Conservative party says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\">migrants are the problem</a>. And Labour, so entangled in its own internal struggles, has had difficulty finding any voice as opposition \u2013 let alone a strong one. It has no coherent position on free movement, while the Green party has been the voice standing up for migrants. I am fighting for Cameron\u2019s seat in Witney because I know we can do so much better.</p> <p>I have lived in Oxfordshire since 1969. During many years as a local councillor and campaigner I have seen large numbers of people, who need our mutual support, driven to the wall. Over the last few years Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour county councillors in Oxfordshire have voted for devastating cuts to care for the elderly and disabled, children\u2019s centres, libraries, homeless people, dangerously damaged roads and pavements and lifeline rural bus services. Only the Green councillors voted against them. The cowardice of the other parties in Oxfordshire is visible in doorways as homeless people bed down for another cold night.</p> <p>Of course, such choices are not only being made in Oxfordshire. As health spokesman for the Green party I stood beside doctors as they tried to stop the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tearing apart the delicate structure they had created to do their best with inadequate resources. Theresa May\u2019s government is continuing the process of the largest cut in funding in the history of the NHS. The <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/14714446.Health_leaders_in_Oxfordshire_approve_millions_of_pounds_of_cuts/\">Oxfordshire clinical commissioning group </a>has just announced that it has to strip out 20% of its spending over the next four years. It has opened discussion on <a href=\"http://www.greenoxfordshire.com/all_oxfordshire_community_hospitals_to_go\">closing all nine of the county\u2019s community hospitals</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-36898639\">first GP practice closures</a> have been announced. These cuts cannot be achieved without unnecessary death and suffering. The structures for privatisation created by Labour, the coalition and Conservative governments costs the NHS over <a href=\"http://nhap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WEB-VERSION-NHS-Privatisation-past-present-and-future-Without-Notes.pdf\">\u00a35bn a year</a>.

  "<p>In July President Barack Obama addressed the national convention of the Democratic Party and ended perhaps the last great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/emotional-obama-democratic-convention-speech\">speech of his tenure </a>by returning to the theme of \u201cthe audacity of hope\u201d. </p> <p>Stark dividing lines have been drawn in the US election contest between hope and fear, between a yearning for simpler times and a belief that the best is yet to come. It is not hard to draw a parallel with some of Britain\u2019s own political challenges; the tension between those excited by a more global and connected future and those who fear being left behind in this brave new world. </p> <p>Much has been written about how to make globalisation work for all, and a solution remains elusive. A challenge we can meaningfully wrestle with as an industry is how we make an increasingly connected society work for the many, making technology a source of hope, not a source of anxiety and exclusion. </p> <p>The internet has arguably been one of the most powerful forces for democratisation the world has ever known, giving a voice and opening a market to many who were previously disenfranchised. Platforms from <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/campaigns/smart-communications-txtbks.html\">TXTBKS</a>, which provides old sim cards into condensed text books for underprivileged schoolchildren to crisis-mapping software <a href=\"https://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> show the potential of the simplest technologies to make major differences. Yet within our own society we have been slow to make innovation relevant and accessible to those most apprehensive about or underserved by new technologies, to tackle real, everyday problems such as access to credit, access to a GP within an overloaded NHS, or access to meaningful roles within a fast-changing labour market.</p> <p>The fintech industry for example can often seem preoccupied with wooing millennials with slick data visualisations and effortless mobile transactions. Yet <a href=\"http://www.financialinclusioncommission.org.uk/facts\">1.5 million adults in the UK do not have access to a bank account</a> \u2013 while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/feb/24/payday-lending-will-shrink-but-only-a-complete-ban-will-do\">1.8 million a year</a> access payday loans in the absence of more affordable credit. With high street branches closing at ever faster rates, the digital banking revolution can exclude those most in need of assistance.<br></p> <p>Yet the technology exists to make access to banking services and credit possible without access to a traditional bank account. Services such as Kenya\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/what/m-pesa.html\">MPesa</a> enable any user with access to a mobile phone to deposit and transfer funds, no bank account required. Meanwhile almost half of finance executives surveyed believe blockchain technology will mean <a href=\"http://which-50.com/nearly-half-finance-execs-say-blockchain-herald-end-banking-know-study/\">\u201cthe end of banking as we know it\u201d,</a> creating entirely new models for the transfer of funds. </p> <p>How then can we apply these technologies to providing accessible and affordable credit to those in immediate need, or to ensuring urgent benefit payments are as swiftly available as possible? </p> <p>In the realm of healthcare, private enterprises in the US are applying the Uber model to medicine via apps such as<a href=\"https://getheal.com/\"> Heal</a> and <a href=\"https://pager.com/\">Pager</a> which identify the nearest doctor, their ratings and reputation and their price for a real-time consultation. Could we apply the same principle to clusters of local surgeries within the NHS, enabling patients to identify the nearest available appointment to them, dynamically updated to take account of changes and cancellations? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-gig-economy-time-to-get-serious-about-casual-work\">The Guardian view on the gig economy: time to get serious about casual work | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once hailed as an empowering force for change, the gig economy has come under fire in recent months over working conditions and the status of workers. Perhaps a more equitable and interesting approach is to ask how traditional infrastructure and traditional roles can be re-purposed \u2013 meeting the needs of the on-demand economy in a different way. <a href=\"https://www.passmyparcel.com/\">Pass my Parcel</a>, a venture from distribution firm Smiths News, works with independent local stores to facilitate same day delivery on behalf of Amazon. Retailers receive a small fee for each parcel collected, and increased footfall in store while Amazon receive an increased footprint for same-day delivery services. New technology leveraging traditional infrastructure. </p> <p>In a similar vein, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/02/sugata-mitra-school-in-the-cloud\">The School in the Cloud</a> takes advantage of dormant skills in retirees to facilitate remote learning among some of the world\u2019s most underprivileged children, tapping into a resource that might otherwise be unused and undervalued. Yet there is no reason a similar principle cannot be applied more broadly. Imagine the impact on an over-burdened education system of thousands of retired teachers, craftspeople, scientists or writers signing up to provide even an hour or two of virtual tuition a week. </p> <p>In a nutshell, imagine a world where we stop designing products and services with young, urban and affluent populations at the forefront of our minds. They won\u2019t mind \u2013 they\u2019ve got Pokemon to catch. The opportunity is to design services that are simple, scalable and solve real problems; so how do we make it a reality? </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/09/the-vision-for-gov-uk-is-to-make-government-work-for-users/\">team behind Gov.uk</a> have done an extraordinary job in making it simpler to access government information and services. Is the next phase of that journey to move beyond making existing services accessible and towards developing new service propositions? Or can the private sector lead the way, re-engineering the on-demand economy to be not just egalitarian but genuinely fair for both workers and consumers?</p> <p>Either way, there is a genuine opportunity for the tech community to prove that it is not a \u201cliberal elite\u201d designing for fellow liberal elites but a community committed to making technology a force for hope, not just a force for change.

So naive!\u201d In particular Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/788182394352394240/photo/1\">claimed</a> in an interview with Fox News that voter fraud was rampant in cities including Philadelphia, St Louis and Chicago after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-renews-voter-warning-and-says-clinton-could-be-crazy\">long warning vaguely about</a> fraud in \u201ccertain communities\u201d.</p> <p> Multiple sources have confirmed to the Guardian that Roman, who also previously ran the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/the-koch-brothers-intelligence-agency-215943\">Koch network\u2019s now defunct internal intelligence agency</a>, will oversee the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to monitor polling places for any signs of voter fraud.</p> <p>Roman is best known for his role in promoting a video that showed two members of the New Black Panthers \u2013 a fringe group that claims descent from the 1960s radicals \u2013 standing outside a Philadelphia polling place dressed in uniforms, with one carrying a nightstick. Police are called and the two men leave. </p> <p>A justice department investigation into the incident \u2013 filed in the weeks before George W Bush left office \u2013 became a political football that divided career lawyers within the justice department. The incident was repeatedly cited as evidence of Democrats setting out to harm the election process.</p> <p>The case was eventually dropped but not before it became a conservative cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. As Rick Hasen, a election law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said: \u201cIt was one of the most retold stories on Fox News and the right for years and took on almost mythical status as evidence of thuggery by Democrats to harm the voting process.\u201d</p> <p>Hasen, who viewed the case as a \u201ccomplete tempest in teapot\u201d, said of Roman that he was \u201csomebody who has been more willing to put forth more outrageous statements about voter fraud and election process\u201d. Hasen added: \u201cI don\u2019t consider him a very responsible voice among Republicans on this question and I\u2019m not surprised that Trump would be using him for polling related efforts.\u201d </p> <p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>",

His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New England\u2019s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didn\u2019t want to create extra headlines.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is right now. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of headlines to make, and I\u2019ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. I\u2019ve been in an organization where we\u2019re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we don\u2019t do the trash-talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always thought is I don\u2019t want to be a distraction for the team. That\u2019s what my goal is. Not that there are things I\u2019ve said and done that haven\u2019t been, but you try not to be. It\u2019s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions it\u2019s even harder to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>However, Brady\u2019s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201c[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, \u2018I don\u2019t condone it\u2019 and then walk off the stage. The optics of it weren\u2019t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time he\u2019s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. I\u2019m not responsible for what comes out of my friend\u2019s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good time with him\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/tom-brady-donald-trump-press-conference-distraction\">Tom Brady says he ducked Trump questions to avoid team distractions</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58054a18e4b0cd26ff71e1d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T22:01:59.374Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Juanita Broaddrick, on Donald Trump\u2019s accusers:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If these accounts are true, yeah.

Without the media, she wouldn\u2019t even be in this race.
