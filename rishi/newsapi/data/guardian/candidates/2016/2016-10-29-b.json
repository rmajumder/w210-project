  "<p>The latest furore over Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009-2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying US presidential election into even greater confusion, with little more than a week to go before voting day.</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s unexpected and very public revelation that it is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?emc=edit_th_20161029&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=53657756\" title=\"\">recommencing its investigation </a>into Clinton\u2019s conduct may not be politically motivated, but its timing certainly makes it appear that way. The row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged, principally by the unscrupulous Republican candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>Despite this new firestorm, stoked by Republicans and rightwing media, it remains likely that American voters will deliver a clear, possibly resounding, rejection of Trump on 8 November. Although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes, Clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters \u2013 and she is the sane and reasonable, if uninspiring, choice. A Trump defeat will be richly deserved. As we have noted previously, he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the White House. His behaviour during a long, raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/28/observer-view-donald-trump-ugly-truth\" title=\"\">made that abundantly plain</a>.</p> <p>Yet consigning \u201cthe Donald\u201d to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of Trumpism. This is likely to take a lot longer. Trump\u2019s platform was based not on thought-through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice, grievance, ignorance and fear, spiced with opportunism. His unexpected success in winning the nomination, despite the Republican establishment\u2019s hostility, reflected his close identification with mainly white, working-class and lower-middle-class voters who, like him, feel angry, undervalued and alienated. While public figures such as Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s failed Republican rival Jeb Bush and Clinton appear to this constituency to be remote, out of touch and uncaring, Trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is \u201con their side\u201d. Again and again, in Ohio, Florida and elsewhere, disaffected voters claimed that only Trump could be trusted to tell the \u201ctruth\u201d, only Trump would keep his promises, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/ds-2710-trump-rally\" title=\"\">only Trump</a> could make America great again.</p> <p>Oblivious to paradox, irony, history or facts, Trumpism projects a distorted vision of American greatness. The Trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants, that became the most powerful on Earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\" title=\"\">2,000-mile wall with Mexico</a>. Trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against Muslims to keep itself safe.</p> <p>As general concepts, Trumpism makes an enemy of the \u201cother\u201d, equates nationality with homogeneity, calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten, jail or harm opponents. It says individualism outweighs state authority, as in the unfettered right to bear firearms, but not, perversely, in the case of a woman\u2019s right to choose abortion. Trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners. It believes free trade, international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off Americans. Paranoid Trumpism holds that long-term allies such as Germany and Japan get a free security ride at America\u2019s expense.</p> <p>Trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in Russia and China. Vladimir Putin is a strong leader standing up for his people, national beliefs and way of life. Any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other Trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious, part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens. And don\u2019t forget: Trumpism cannot be fairly defeated. If it loses, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34903577\" title=\"\">it was cheated</a> for sure.</p> <p>Trumpism appeals to the worst in people, cynically exploiting and fanning the anger, grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged, the embittered, uneducated and plain ignorant. It appeals to base instincts, to lowest common denominators. Its is political dumbing down writ large. It is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity, engendered across the west by post-2008 economic injustice and social division, the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent, unfeeling or corrupt governance.</p> <p>Fear is the common enemy, but fear is Trumpism\u2019s friend. This phenomenon is not confined to America. European countries, including Britain, experience variations on the theme. In Germany and France, concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of Syria. In Greece, Poland, Austria and Hungary, rightwing extremists\u2019 evil, dehumanising ideas about refugees, migrants and foreigners in general have become <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2016-06-03/rise-populism-europe\" title=\"\">a commonplace of political discussion</a>. In Britain, Ukip, provides a noisy echo-chamber for some of Trumpism\u2019s most divisive, chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains.</p> <p>If Trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence, it would be wise to look for a common remedy. But first, the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long-term effects should not be exaggerated. Much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in America and Europe is the direct result of continuing, negative economic fallout from the 2008 financial crash. Hard times, austerity cuts, high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root. But as history shows, they sometimes, yet rarely, lead to disaster. When economies improve, generally speaking, so too does the quality of political discourse. Ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics.</p> <p>While protest movements share characteristics and aims, it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other. Trumpism is an infection others can catch, yet it is also unique to America. Before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in Europe, commentators in Britain and elsewhere should remember that, when all is said and done, mainstream politicians such as Angela Merkel, Alain Jupp\u00e9, Mariano Rajoy and yes, Hillary Clinton do, on the whole, get elected or re-elected. Notwithstanding Greece\u2019s epic upheavals, the centre does mostly hold.</p> <p>More than anything else, Trumpism will fade and fail because, ultimately, it is a minority pastime, pandering to bigotry, which runs against the grain and spirit of the times, Brexit notwithstanding. Trumpism decries the impact of globalisation, yet globalisation, for all the dislocation and often unwelcome change it brings, is the inescapable way ahead for a more integrated, more connected and more mutually responsible and caring world.</p> <p>For good or bad, this clock cannot be turned back. Closed borders and closed minds, crude nationalism, trade barriers, xenophobia, religious, racial and sexual discrimination \u2013 these are old mistakes and old hatreds that, while still in evidence everywhere, belong to times past. The world is moving forward, not back. In the end, Trumpism and all its ghastly incarnations, dwelling in fear and darkness, will, like Trump himself, be exorcised.</p>",
  "<p>Democratic party outrage at the FBI\u2019s shock revelation, almost on the eve of the US presidential election, that it is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKCN12S299\" title=\"\">resuming its controversial investigation</a> of Hillary Clinton after declaring in July that the matter was closed, has been fierce.</p> <p>Donna Brazile, chairwoman of the Democratic national committee, was one of many to cry foul. \u201cThe FBI has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters. Even the faintest appearance of using the agency\u2019s power to influence our election is deeply troubling,\u201d she said.</p> <p>John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chief, also hinted at skulduggery: \u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.\u201d Podesta said the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?emc=edit_th_20161029&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=53657756&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">FBI statement</a> left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to investigate.</p> <p>This may well be true. In his letter of notification to Congress, James Comey, the FBI director, said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that Clinton acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from 2009-13.</p> <p>Comey said the new emails \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d, but he and his officials had not yet examined them. In a later statement, he admitted \u201cwe don\u2019t know the significance\u201d of the emails, but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public. It is not even certain that the emails came from Clinton\u2019s private server.</p> <p>Comey\u2019s move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical. FBI investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors. Only when a decision to prosecute has been taken, based on persuasive evidence, is an inquiry made public or suspects named.</p> <p>For a respected, ostensibly independent figure like the FBI director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly political, partisan act. Since it must be assumed that Comey is no fool, it must also be assumed that he knew what he was doing.</p> <p>A less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the FBI (and himself) further criticism from the Republican right, which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a pro-Hillary cover-up. But if that is the case, why did Comey not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight committees? Nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a cover-up. And he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the FBI\u2019s impartiality is again being questioned, and this time from the left.</p> <p>Whatever Comey\u2019s reasons, the damage is done. Clinton must now try to weather the storm until 8 November, having previously believed that she was in the clear. It will be a rough ride. The ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a frenetic, furious and nail-biting finale.</p> <p>Donald Trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in. Speaking on the campaign trail, the Republican nominee revived jibes that Clinton is a corrupt and habitual liar. In typically hyperbolic terms, he said that her conduct was \u201cthe biggest scandal since Watergate\u201d.</p> <p>As usual, Trump\u2019s risible exaggeration undermines his case. But the genuine anger and alarm expressed by Clinton\u2019s surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially be.</p> <p>Although in Trump she faces the least qualified and, for a host of reasons, most objectionable Republican candidate in living memory, Clinton is still only about 5% ahead in the polls, as a national average.</p> <p>This bald figure may be considered misleading. In 14 battleground or \u201cswing\u201d states, where the electoral college will be decided, Clinton is ahead in all but Ohio, Iowa and Georgia. But polls across the nation are tightening. This latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive (or in some cases, to dish her) <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/\" title=\"\">will not help</a>.</p> <p>Despite her advantages in experience, name recognition, political achievement and spending power, Clinton has evidently failed to knock Trump out of the race.</p> <p>Despite a deeply damaging few weeks for Trump, when he was beset by allegations of sexual misconduct, he still appears, amazingly, to be in with a shot.</p> <p>A more skilled and savvy politician than Clinton could and would have buried Trump months ago. A more charismatic, popular or likeable Democratic standard-bearer could now be awaiting electoral coronation. This latest blow may cause some underwhelmed Democrats to abstain. And Clinton\u2019s best pitch to sceptical independent and undecided voters \u2013 that she is the least worst candidate \u2013 leaves her vulnerable to a last-gasp upset.</p>",
  "<p>If it looks and sounds like a scandal, is it really a scandal?</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">latest Clinton email flap</a> has all the trappings of one. With evasive answers, shady characters and FBI investigations, there must be something going on. Right?</p> <p>Rather like Saddam\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, we may not know what\u2019s hidden or where, but it sure looks like the Clintons have been hiding something.</p> <p>Sadly, this reasoning is enough for most Republican voters and a good chunk of independents. It may be enough to depress support among Democrats just at the moment the party needs to drive a high turnout among voters.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not at all clear what the FBI is talking about in terms of Clinton emails. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-fbi-clinton-email-probe-20161028-story.html\">Some reports</a> suggest they are neither to nor from Clinton herself, in which case we have just consumed a giant nothing-burger. After all, we already know that the FBI has no idea whether the emails amount to anything of any significance.</p> <p>This raises the obvious question: what on earth was the FBI director thinking when he dropped his letter on Friday making it crystal clear that he knew nothing? As a rule, law enforcement agencies generally don\u2019t publicize the fact that they are clueless.</p> <p>Beyond James Comey\u2019s extraordinary intervention in the late stages of a presidential election, his letter raises another, more familiar question about the Clintons: why do they attract pseudo-scandals with such alarming ease and frequency?</p> <p>From the Clinton foundation to the private email server, from Benghazi to Weiner, from Whitewater to Monica, the list is as long as it is utterly spurious. Whatever crumbs of wrongdoing there may be, they don\u2019t amount to something worthy of Watergate, or even the myriad gate-suffixed scandals since. Questionable behavior is not the same as criminal or even impeachable conduct.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59nxm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851168\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5814032ae4b0219a00d39cc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\">Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the pseudo-scandals say more about the Clinton haters than they do about the Clintons themselves. But it remains true that there is a remarkable contrast between the clouds that hang over the Clintons and those over the Obamas.</p> <p>Barack Obama has not exactly luxuriated in eight years of hate-free politics. The haters have thrown their best at him: questioning his citizenship and suggesting he secret sympathies for Isis. They even accused him of wanting to pull the plug on <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grassley-warns-of-government-pulling-plug-on-grandma/\">grandma</a>.</p> <p>And yet there have been no pseudo-scandals about his personal life, his friends and donors, or even open microphone moments. As a candidate he was accused of palling around with terrorists, cutting a sweetheart deal for his home, and following the lead of an anti-American preacher. Inside the White House, not so much. The integrity and self-discipline over the last eight years has almost driven the scandal-mongers out of business.</p> <p>All that\u2019s left are the obvious problems posed by a radical Islamist from Kenya looking to foment a socialist revolution from the Oval Office. Given that he has only two months left in the White House, Obama needs to speed up his secret plans or else he\u2019ll turn into an even greater disappointment to the rightwing nuts.</p> <p>The good news for the scandal-mongers is the next Clinton administration appears to be just around the corner. House Republicans are already prepping their subpoenas in case they can launch another <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\">several dozen investigations</a> into the newly elected President Clinton.</p> <p>In that context, it doesn\u2019t much matter whether the FBI\u2019s Clinton emails amount to anything more than political gossip. The Hunting of Hillary has only just begun.</p> <p>What does matter is the impact on voters in these final frenetic days of the 2016 election. Recent polling suggests that most voters have already made up their minds about whether Clinton is honest and trustworthy: they don\u2019t believe her. To be sure, they also think the same about Donald Trump, albeit in slightly lower numbers.</p> <p>But those poll numbers mean that the email pseudo-scandal is unlikely to change anyone\u2019s mind about the candidate. In the same way, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Bill Clinton\u2019s money-making schemes at the Clinton Foundation will affect his wife\u2019s honesty numbers.</p> <p>For many voters, this email story comes too late. More than 12m votes have already been cast across the country in early voting, representing around 10% of the likely total votes in this election.</p> <p>In any case, the polls were already tightening, as Republicans inevitably rally to their candidate, no matter how catastrophically compromised he is with the voting demographic commonly known as \u201cwomen\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-debate highs were unlikely to hold. In fact, numerous studies have shown that elections tend to end where the polls stand <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/11/12426346/trump-polls-today\">two weeks after the conventions</a>, despite all the fluctuations back and forth. That suggests this election will end up as a race in the mid-single digits as a margin of victory for Clinton.</p> <p>Of course we don\u2019t know what the FBI emails may yet uncover, and we certainly don\u2019t know what turnout will look like on election day.</p> <p>But we do know that the closing days of a presidential election are anxious times. Campaign staffers are exhausted and fear failure. The media is desperate for one more fix of adrenaline, one more turn of the story to upend the likely outcome. Supporters on both sides become obsessive consumers of any snippet of information that might tip the balance.</p> <p>Into this gasoline-soaked period, the FBI director just threw a burning match and walked away. But the dumpster fire was already raging in this shocking election, and the voters who find the whole scene disgusting will likely stay away.</p> <p>Never mind the emails. This election was already in flames.</p>",

Comey stood accused of betraying the bureau\u2019s political neutrality, and came under growing pressure to make public everything he knows.</p> <p>The latest twist in a topsy turvy election arrived on Friday afternoon, when Comey said in a letter to Congress the FBI would review whether there was any classified information in new \u201cemails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\u201d. In a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/memo-press-what-comeys-letter-does-and-doesnt-mean\">carefully worded letter</a>, the director said he wanted to \u201csupplement my previous testimony\u201d about the original Clinton email investigation, which he told Congress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">had closed this summer</a>, and said: \u201cThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said: \u201cBy providing selective information, he\u2019s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts. </p> <p>\u201cWhat little Comey has told us makes it hard to understand why this step was warranted at all.\u201d</p> <p>It is \u201centirely possible\u201d that the emails are duplicates of those already studied by the FBI in its earlier investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state, Podesta told reporters on a conference call, adding that Clinton would not be distracted in the final days of the campaign. </p> <p>In July, the FBI closed that investigation. Comey said at the time that Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal with their email practices.</p> <p>\u201cDirector Comey was the one who decided to take this unprecedented step,\u201d Podesta said, \u201cwe now learn, against the advice of senior justice department officials who told him it was against longstanding department policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p> <p>\u201cDirector Comey was the one that wrote a letter that was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, knowing full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now up to him, who owes the public answers to the questions that are now on the table, and we\u2019re calling on him to come forward and give those answers to the American public.\u201d</p> <p>Law enforcement sources speaking anonymously told news outlets the new emails came from devices belonging to Anthony Weiner, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/anthony-weiner-sexually-explicit-messages-teen-daily-mail\"> disgraced former congressman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/huma-abedin-anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton\">estranged husband of Huma Abedin</a>, one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides. Agents uncovered the emails during an investigation into whether Weiner sent sexually explicit text messages to a teenage girl.<br></p> <p>Podesta said Abedin had fully cooperated with the FBI investigation from the start. \u201cShe\u2019s been fully cooperative. We of course stand behind her.\u201d<br></p> <p>Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said: \u201cThe more information that comes out, the more overblown this entire situation seems to be.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat with a history of support for the security agencies, condemned Comey\u2019s conduct. \u201cThe FBI has a history of extreme caution near election day so as not to influence the results,\u201d she said. \u201cToday\u2019s break from that tradition is appalling.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, said Comey\u2019s letter to Congress \u201cwas unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprising\u201d. He too said it created more questions than answers.</p> <p>\u201cCongress and the public deserve more context to properly assess what evidence the FBI has discovered and what it plans to do with it,\u201d Grassley said.</p> <p>Some analysts speculated that Comey felt caught in a bind: if he waited until after the election, or if the new review leaked through back channels, he would have been accused of a cover-up. In an internal email sent to FBI employees, he said he was concerned about balance: the need to inform Congress and the American people versus the danger of a misleading impression about emails.</p> <p>\u201cIn trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Early voting is under way in 37 states, nearly 17m votes have been cast, and Clinton has a healthy lead in most polls. \u201cI think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,\u201d she said at her press conference. \u201cAnd now they are choosing a president.\u201d</p> <p>Though his own campaign has been plagued by one scandal after another, Trump has regularly berated Clinton over the emails, and his supporters at rallies frequently chant: \u201cLock her up!

An election quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, there are several non-legal obstacles that stop millions of Americans from voting. The US <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2012/tables.html\">Census Bureau</a> asks adults why they didn\u2019t vote \u2013 the reasons from November 2012 are diverse. They include illness or disability (14%), registration problems (6%) and transportation problems (3%). </p> <p>A reason given by 19% of non-voters is often <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/17/why-dont-americans-vote-were-too-busy/\">treated</a> with an eye-roll, as if it\u2019s always an excuse: \u201ctoo busy, conflicting schedule\u201d. But for the millions of Americans who can\u2019t arrange childcare or work in jobs where clocking off for a few hours on a Tuesday isn\u2019t an option, that answer is not an excuse, it\u2019s a reality. </p> <p>The overall effect of all these barriers is that minorities and poorer Americans, people who are <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/2014-party-identification-detailed-tables/\">more likely to identify as Democrat</a>, are less likely to vote. These facts will negatively affect Hillary Clinton on 8 November, as they have affected Democratic candidates before her.</p> <h2><strong>Won\u2019t vote</strong></h2> <p>Census Bureau data does point to millions of Americans who <em>chose</em> not to vote in the last presidential election. The bureau estimates that 16% of the 19.1 million Americans who didn\u2019t vote were \u201cnot interested\u201d, and another 13% felt they \u201cdid not like candidates or campaign issues\u201d.</p> <p>Those reasons are more crucial than ever in an election with the two most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-general-election-analysis\">unpopular</a> candidates in decades. In national polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">averages</a>, there are still only five percentage points that keep Clinton ahead of Donald Trump. The campaign teams will be wondering whether Americans will hold their noses and show up to vote. And, more importantly, if they do, whether they\u2019ll be more likely to choose Clinton or Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/clinton-v-trump-unfavorable/\" data-alt=\"Unpopularity ratings\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/clinton-v-trump-unfavorable/\">Unpopularity ratings</a> <figcaption>Unpopularity ratings</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polling offers some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/poll-republican-party-could-win-another-candidate-donald-trump\">clues</a>. Last week, George Washington University <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/poll-republican-party-could-win-another-candidate-donald-trump\">released</a> the results of a survey of 1,000 adults who said they were registered <em>and</em> likely to vote. Only 29% of those who said that they would vote for Clinton said their vote was intended to stop Trump from getting to the White House. By contrast, 43% of Trump voters said their decision was a defensive vote against Clinton.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily get us any closer to forecasting the results. It\u2019s a fact that voter turnout will shape this election outcome but it\u2019s much harder to predict how human nature might affect that turnout.

  "<p>Frank Roddy supports the Cleveland Indians and Donald Trump. Matt Brenner supports the Chicago Cubs and Hillary Clinton. When Roddy had a pair of tickets for game 2 of the World Series in Cleveland, Ohio, he knew who to call.<br></p> <p>\u201cI had 50 people I could invite to this game but I only have one friend who\u2019s a Cubs fan and I knew what it would mean to him,\u201d said Roddy, 28, sporting an Indians cap and shirt. \u201cI knew it would mean more to him than anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>With flights in demand and prohibitively expensive, Brenner hired a car on Wednesday morning and drove for five and a half hours to be here; he drove back on Thursday, exultant after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/cubs-indians-world-series-game-two\">the Cubs\u2019 5-1 victory</a> squared the series. This, after all, is history. The Cubs and Indians have the longest title droughts in baseball: 108 and 68 years without winning the World Series respectively. It is the resistible force against the movable object.</p> <p>Cleveland, for a few golden hours, also felt like something of an antidote to, or at least a refuge from, arguably the most divisive and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/world/americas/united-states-trump-clinton.html\">poisonous presidential election campaign</a> ever. It is oddly reassuring to discover that there is still a place in the US not transfixed by Clinton\u2019s reckless emails or Trump\u2019s 3am tweets. Here sports comes first, politics nowhere. A baseball cap is still a baseball cap, not a marketing prop for making America great again.</p> <p>Thom Majka, a sales rep who keeps his Indians cap on through every game for good luck, said: \u201cThese fans couldn\u2019t care less about the election. Every day it gets nastier and uglier, not even talking about the issues. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have something as easy as playing a baseball game. It\u2019s like taking a shower: you\u2019re all cleaned up.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic and Republican nominees have historically high unpopularity ratings. Their contest has been extraordinary rancorous, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">including a tense debate</a> in which Clinton castigated Trump over allegations of sexual assault and Trump threatened to jail his opponent. The blowhard billionaire\u2019s appeal to authoritarianism and cries of rigging have led some to fear an existential threat to the republic.</p> <p>But baseball, as American as jazz, as regular as the seasons, goes on. It is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">storied and soulful of US sports</a>. It survived the second world war when Franklin D Roosevelt declared: \u201cI honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going.\u201d After reaching the World Series at last, Cubs manager Joe Maddon watched the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams and wept. While pro football is by far more popular, baseball is cultural bedrock, a social safety valve for a fractured nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09a78ca96f21c3ef5ff778e4b1087f5a05539d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09a78ca96f21c3ef5ff778e4b1087f5a05539d93/0_62_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indians fans gather outside the gates before game 1 of the World Series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indians fans gather outside the gates before game 1 of the World Series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cleveland feels this more acutely than most. Three months ago its basketball arena, cheek-by-jowl with the baseball park, hosted Trump\u2019s coronation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-speech-republican-national-convention\">dark vision</a> at the Republican national convention. Where in July the strongman claimed that only he can fix the system, and delegates chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d, this week the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2013 led by the Hillary Clinton-endorsing superstar LeBron James \u2013 received their championship rings after ending the city\u2019s 52-year sporting championship famine. </p> <p>Where in July political hacks crowded bars and restaurants on nearby East 4th Street, this week sports fans erupted at every Indians run they saw on multiple TV screens.<br></p> <p>Where in July street vendors sold hats and T-shirts with slogans such as \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d and \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch, don\u2019t vote for one\u201d, this week the merchandise says \u201cHard working town Cleveland\u201d, \u201cLand of champions\u201d, \u201cC*town don\u2019t back down\u201d and \u201cI liked Cleveland before it was cool\u201d. And where in July party delegates walked behind high steel fences separating them from potential civil unrest and thousands of police, this week Clinton and Trump supporters rubbed shoulders, recalled learning the sport in corner parks and backyards, and went to the ballgame together. </p> <p>Cubs fan Joe Wiegand, 51, from Maniton, Colorado, mused: \u201cBaseball is a wonderful distraction from the workaday world and the issues at hand. It brings people together. It\u2019s an important election and this is just a game but this is not only once in a lifetime, it\u2019s once in three lifetimes. There\u2019ll be another election in four years.\u201d</p> <p>Wiegand had come to add to the joviality of the proceedings outside the Indians\u2019 Progressive Field (the name honours an insurance company, it has nothing to do with liberal politics). He bills himself as the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.teddyrooseveltshow.com/\">world\u2019s premiere Theodore Roosevelt reprisor</a>\u201d and was dressed for the part, including a \u201c1908 / Cubs\u201d sign attached to his top hat \u2013 referring to a year when Roosevelt was in the White House and the Cubs last won the World Series (the Indians need only go back as far as Harry Truman). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are long suffering but always hopeful</p> <footer> <cite>Joe Wiegand, Cubs fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are long suffering but always hopeful,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cThat optimistic statement: \u2018Just wait till next year.\u2019 We believe in the Cubs. There\u2019s a great sense of relief and celebration just being in the World Series. And I think we will win the World Series.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke, Wiegand was greeted by old acquaintances: Cubs fan Wendy Menard, 56, and her partner Chris Frampton, 57, an Indians supporter. The couple, both financial advisers, recalled being nine or 10 years old when they attended their first baseball games. Frampton said: \u201cAs much as following Cleveland has been difficult for a long time, I\u2019m an Indians fan and always have been.\u201d</p> <p>Menard added: \u201cIt\u2019s in your blood. Cut me and it\u2019s blue.\u201d</p> <p>And how about the election? \u201cWhat election?\u201d Frampton shot back.</p> <p>The Indians\u2019 comprehensive 6-0 victory in game 1 on Tuesday, with pitcher Corey Kluber dominant, was celebrated by fans driving the streets blasting horns and high-fiving each other. The mood was more subdued on Wednesday as Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta took control over four hours in a raw 43F (6C); a crowd watching the game on two giants screens outside the park ebbed away into the night. A small plane flew overhead trailing a banner that said: \u201cTrump tried to buy and move the Indians.\u201d</p> <p>The Cubs, whose home, Wrigley Field, is one of the great cathedrals of American sport, seem to have most of the country rooting for them. They have been striving and falling short for more than a century. Author Rich Cohen <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/opinion/the-cubs-reach-the-promised-land-now-what.html\">wrote in the New York Times: </a>\u201cFor as long as anyone remembers, following the Cubs has meant embracing futility, choosing the losers over the winners, seeing the romance in failure.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201clovable losers\u201d have suffered a legendary curse ever since a tavern owner, barred from a World Series game in 1945 because he was trying to bring in a <a href=\"http://www.billygoattavern.com/\">malodorous goat</a>, proclaimed that they would never win the title again. But inspired by Cubs fan Bill Murray\u2019s film Ghostbusters, some fans have paraded the slogan \u201cI ain\u2019t afraid of no goat\u201d and this year the team have carried all before them. Barack Obama has expressed hopes for a Cubs victory despite being a supporter of city rivals the Chicago White Sox.</p> <p>Cleveland, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/cleveland-republican-national-convention-lebron-james\">relishing its moment in the sun</a>. It is one of America\u2019s poorest and most racially segregated big cities; only Detroit fared worse from the trauma of industrial decline. It has had to live down nicknames such as \u201cthe mistake on the lake\u201d while its river was so badly polluted that it caught fire in 1969. Progressive Field sits near steel bridges, smoking chimneys and slag heaps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ba820dd5f951b7f2c3109ad74475662e50723f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ba820dd5f951b7f2c3109ad74475662e50723f9/0_67_4880_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"progressive field in cleveland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The idea was that in an industrial, smoky city you could get a ticket and walk through that gate into a green space.

We\u2019re still considered a blue-collar town. Growing up in my neighbourhood, we played baseball in the spring and football in the fall and winter. When all the jobs left, that\u2019s what everyone clung to: our sports team.\u201d</p> <p>Majka, 63, whose daughter Stephanie favours the Cubs, agreed. \u201cCleveland is not a city people flock to as a major metropolitan area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 70s, 80s and 90s have been tough years and that\u2019s why people hold on to their sports teams. Things in Cleveland are consistent. They put up with tough winters and losing sports franchises. They keep on coming back, hoping tomorrow will be a better day.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in Cleveland are hard-working and good-hearted and have their hearts broken thousands of times. To have the baseball after what happened in June with the basketball \u2013 two tremendous events in one year \u2013 was worth the wait. That\u2019s the Cleveland mentality: the harder you work, the luckier you get.\u201d</p> <p>Cleveland is a Democratic stronghold but Ohio remains a perpetual electoral battleground. Majka says he intends to vote for Trump because he wants change from the career politicians who run America. But if he was forced to choose between picking the winner of the election or the World Series? \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the Indians.\u201d</p> <p>Most fans would make the same decision in the view of <a href=\"http://history.case.edu/faculty/john-grabowski/\">John Grabowski</a>, who teaches a sports history course at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cThe election has been a long, brutal process and people are much more interested in the World Series,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pushing the campaign off the front of the news locally.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The election has been a long, brutal process and people are much more interested in the World Series</p> <footer> <cite>John Grabowski, Case Western Reserve University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Grabowski cautioned against notions of baseball as morally pure escapism, noting the sport\u2019s own history of \u201cchicanery and trickery\u201d, but added: \u201cNonetheless it\u2019s linked to what America is supposed to be about \u2013 the field of dreams. The idea was that in an industrial, smoky city you could get a ticket and walk through that gate into a green space. This is the pastoral aspect.\u201d</p> <p>Although there has been concern about the drop in African American players across baseball as a whole, both the Cubs and Indians have increasingly racially diverse lineups, he added, reflecting the diversity of the US itself. \u201cYou can see yourself on the field, no matter who you are.\u201d</p> <p>Baseball has arguably been in decline since the 1980s, although the sport has long served as a metaphorical shorthand for an idealised America. Grabowski sees evidence of a revival in that rose-tinted view in the era of Ronald Reagan \u2013 his celebrated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU-IBF8nwSY\">\u201cMorning in America\u201d</a> TV commercial was released in the same year, 1984, as the fond movie The Natural starring Robert Redford.

So no surprise if the king of winging it had a little help. Sixteen months into his campaign, he rolled out a new slogan, \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d \u2013 referring to Washington. Soon enough #DrainTheSwamp was trending on Twitter.</p> <p>But evidently this wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s own idea.

  "<h2><strong>John Carpenter</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>Seventies fright auteur, synth soundtrack pioneer<br></strong></em>How we scare people with film hasn\u2019t changed particularly. Horror is a very adaptable genre: the subject matter has evolved as society evolves, and as styles change. But what frightens us is essential. We\u2019re all born afraid, and we are all afraid of the same things. That\u2019s what makes horror such a powerful genre. Everybody\u2019s afraid of death, disfigurement, loss of a loved one\u2026 in any culture. I\u2019m scared by everything. Even badasses get scared, that\u2019s why they become badasses. I still find the idea of being followed scary. I think everybody does. A couple of times people have followed me but it never turned out to be as serious as what was portrayed in [my film] Halloween.</p> <p>Horror really works when you\u2019re young. It challenges you. When you get old you\u2019re a little bit more aware of real-life horror, and real-life horror is a vision of hell. Right now in America there\u2019s a lot of crazy fear about this election we\u2019re having and the state of our country. It\u2019s terribly divided. There\u2019s a lot of fear going around about the outsider, about the other. This happens during hard times and I think it arises from the recession. Somebody has to be blamed. Trump could be ripe for a horror monster but he\u2019s sort of buffoonish, as opposed to being scary. It\u2019s our response [to him]; it\u2019s <em>us</em> that scares me; the people that follow him blindly. Human beings, and what they\u2019re capable of, are the scariest things of all.<br><em><a href=\"http://victoriawarehouse.com/whats-on-manchester/john-carpenter-release-the-bats-uk-tour/\">John Carpenter plays Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, Sat</a>; <a href=\"http://www.troxy.co.uk/event/release-bats/\">The Troxy, E1, 31 Oct &amp; 1 Nov</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Alice Lowe</strong> </h2> <p><em><strong>Star of Sightseers and writer-director of upcoming serial-killer film Prevenge</strong></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/03/alice-lowe-on-my-radar-grimes-neil-gaiman\">On my radar: Alice Lowe\u2019s cultural highlights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m a sucker for ghost stories. My theory is that when we see the surreal, paranormal and supernatural on film, it represents insanity. Our fear that if everything goes crazy, it means that we have, and there\u2019s no escape then from horror. It\u2019s everywhere. The best example I can think of is Michael Hordern in [1968 BBC drama] Whistle And I\u2019ll Come To You. He\u2019s this pompous, rational know-it-all, but by the end is a gibbering idiot with his thumb in his mouth. It\u2019s the fear of rationality and structure collapsing. I once had a dream that ghosts were laying siege to my family and bombing us with pins. The scariest thing was when I asked my parents in the dream if ghosts existed; their answer was \u201cyes\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Daniel Myrick</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Co-writer-director of the original Blair Witch Project</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d807083812632f1ba13db0c73362c5ad98aa399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d807083812632f1ba13db0c73362c5ad98aa399/0_119_2290_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Blair Witch Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Blair Witch Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/PATHE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jacob\u2019s Ladder and in particular the subway scene.

I am unsettled by all the great cinematic uses of people or shapes with their backs to us. From the little hooded figure in Don\u2019t Look Now, turning to reveal itself to be a serial-killing dwarf; to the end of The Blair Witch Project with Mike standing in the corner of the room. It is the expectation of the turn, and what it will reveal that is so unsettling. It\u2019s not confined to dark Venetian alleyways or spooky old houses, either. Killer Bob in Twin Peaks, creeping towards us over a sofa in broad daylight, is one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact I think most of what David Lynch does is pretty terrifying. Just watch Lost Highway. A waking nightmare.</p> <p><strong>Steve Pemberton:</strong> I am terrified of cows. It\u2019s the size of them obviously, and the fact that they could easily crush you to death just by leaning against you. The word \u2018bovine\u2019 is enough to bring me out in a sweat with its sickly combination of size and stupidity. Then there\u2019s the liquid black eyes filled with unknowable intent and the big teeth like grinding stones ready to turn your bones to dust. And when one cow turns to look at you, alone in a vast field, and the rest of the herd stop chewing and all slowly look up and stare before lumbering towards you with some evil intent... and that\u2019s before you factor in the flies and the shit-matted hides.

Especially if I\u2019m alone at night, even though I know that they can haunt me. I tend to freak myself out when I\u2019m lying in bed alone in darkness. Only last night I woke up with a panic, thinking someone is in bed because I felt the duvet moved. After sitting up in fear, I realised that one end of the duvet fell off the bed, pulling the whole thing down<em> </em>and that is why it moved. Oh, silly me! Another time, when I was in Amman for the filming of Under The Shadow. I think I was exhausted and stressed. I slept awkwardly on my left arm and it went numb. I woke up in the middle of the night, touching my numb left hand with my right hand and jumping out of bed with a yelp, thinking \u201cTHERE IS A HAND IN MY BED!\u201d and ran out of my room screaming as loud as I possibly could, with my numb hand flapping a long. It took me a few seconds to register that it was my own hand that scared me!</p> <p>What\u2019s truly terrifying is when you sense a strangeness in something that is seemingly ordinary. I have a distinct memory of this lamp that my mum got from my grandmother \u2013 as a child I always thought it looked like a scary face that was constantly staring at me. Or when you are on your own and you sense a presence but you look around and there is nobody in the room. Fear is a primal instinct, alarming you about a possible threat. So I always think it\u2019s fascinating and bizarre that your mind sometimes tricks you to panic for no logical reason. Or maybe it\u2019s a sixth sense and in those situations we are being warned about something that is beyond our understanding.

Big studio films usually pull their punches but these talented young newcomers have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Finding new ways to scare people is what every good horror director dreams about and I\u2019ve been seeing terrific new films, many directed by women: The Babadook, Good Night, Mommy and Honeymoon, to name a few. I\u2019m extremely easy to scare if I sense that the director is talented and will stop at nothing to freak me out. And I\u2019ve discovered that most people who make horror films are the same way. I was at a film festival screening of Reservoir Dogs in the early 90s when the film broke, just as Michael Madsen was about to cut off the cop\u2019s ear, and I found myself in the men\u2019s room standing next to Wes Craven at the urinals. \u201cI\u2019m not going back in there,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut Wes, it\u2019s only a movie,\u201d I couldn\u2019t help telling him. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s too real,\u201d he replied before he took off.</p> <h2><strong>Faris Badwan</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>Frontman of ghoulish garage rockers the Horrors and otherworldly duo Cat\u2019s Eyes</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109f3e36ce2714251d62c2fbb525aa96c9ce4234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/109f3e36ce2714251d62c2fbb525aa96c9ce4234/0_418_2796_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faris Badwan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faris Badwan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cannibal Holocaust. Not so much blurring the lines between fiction and reality as removing the lines altogether and mashing the two sides into one gory soup, it remains harder to stomach than pretty much anything released since. It provokes a feeling only matched by the hyper-reality of the \u201ctrue gore\u201d Mexican Cartel videos found in the darkest recesses of the net. As with those clips, the viewer is an uneasy voyeur, compelled to keep watching, as I discovered the first time I saw it, while house-sitting for a gore-obsessed friend.</p> <p>While admittedly gratuitous in its depiction of sexual violence and real, inexcusable, animal cruelty, it would be short-sighted and too easy to dismiss this film as exploitation horror. In essence CH is a multi-layered scathing social commentary, inspired in part by Italian press coverage of the Red Brigade terrorist organisation. After noticing a pattern in the media\u2019s willingness to disregard journalistic integrity in favour of graphic violence, Deodato decided to create a film that drew on their savagery. \u201cWho are the real cannibals?\u201d asks main character Harold Monroe, and in the end the camera itself turns out to be the feature\u2019s main cannibalising presence. Cannibal Holocaust is both a touchstone for real/fake found-footage horror and brilliant social satire. It is also disgusting; why is this surprising? The turtle-beheading scene in particular renders it unforgettable in the worst sense of the word, and the prospect of another viewing makes me want to vomit. I now own it on DVD after finding a copy in Notting Hill Music &amp; Video Exchange and it sits on the shelf next to the Mexican curse candle.<br><em><a href=\"http://theborderlinelondon.com/\">The Horrors DJ at The Borderline, WC1, Saturday 29 October</a>; <br><a href=\"http://www.songkick.com/artists/3903446-cats-eyes\">Cat\u2019s Eyes are touring to 6 November</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Roger Corman</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>B-movie master</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6801de324d47db20d55289c0be288c7afdf24384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6801de324d47db20d55289c0be288c7afdf24384/0_939_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Corman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Corman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Will/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While I have made many creature films over the years \u2013 from Crab Monsters to Dinocrocs \u2013 nothing scares me quite like the depravity of man.

I feel like we\u2019re all going to start building bunkers and fallout shelters again. But I try not to let the geopolitical landscape or the constant barrage of newsreel carnage interfere with my craft or what I love about the film-going experience. Jump-scares will always be more of a technical feat of timing and misdirection. And creating cinematic tension has less to do with referencing current events than it does building a believable world with relatable characters that ups the stakes and heightens the experience. </p> <p>Beyond the blood and guts and ghosts, there is no tension without emotional investment by the audience. Real life is scarier simply because it exposes us to mortal danger. The best horror doesn\u2019t necessarily need to stem from real-life events, but it needs to tap into the mechanics of how we\u2019re scared in real life. So the task of the horror filmmaker is to somehow access and stimulate the involuntary response audiences have to true danger. Personally, I like to keep a safe distance from horrific, real-life events \u2018ripped from the headlines\u2019. Awareness of such events can creep into the fictional world and pollute the filmgoers\u2019 experience. The last thing I want to think about when eating popcorn and watching an atmospheric horror film is the brutality and injustice of the real world. Escaping all that while experiencing thrills and chills in a safe, dark place is the whole fun.</p> <h2><strong>Robin Herford</strong><em> </em><br></h2> <p><em><strong>Director of West End play The Woman In Black</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a090abb3b0e4daa31fb66fb619e8d52b4b19b324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a090abb3b0e4daa31fb66fb619e8d52b4b19b324/243_652_3766_2260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Woman in Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Woman in Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t specialise only in scaring people in my work, but The Woman in Black has led me to become curious about the process. No-one really expects to be scared in a theatre, for how can theatre compete with the special effects of recorded media? The answer, I believe, is that by using very simple effects, some technical, like sound and lighting, and some which simply pay tribute to and the acting skill of the performers, one encourages audiences to use their own imaginations, and it becomes surprisingly possible to entice audiences into scaring themselves. I would say, however, that Roman Polanski\u2019s film Repulsion had a huge effect on me. I watched it in the late 60s and chain-smoked throughout. The notion of a beautiful, vulnerable young woman, played by Catherine Deneuve, who elicits our sympathy, provokes our protective instincts and then turns out to be a insane killer, I found really disturbing. Because she is insane, there is no way she will see that the wholesome boyfriend who has come to save her is actually her friend, and will batter him to death.

The horror comes because these are properly difficult things for us to look at \u2013 physical and emotional abuse and a dismantling of the cosy idea of \u2018family\u2019. True terror is to be a kid trapped in these worlds, with literally no escape. David Cameron\u2019s potato face was pretty scary, too.

Us Westerners have lived in a bubble for some time now \u2013 we\u2019re amazingly well shielded from terrifying realities, that\u2019s the scary thing.

So when I first saw The Exorcist I thought I was on the list for demonic possession because I was a juvenile delinquent who wasn\u2019t very Catholic in a lot of his ways. Even when I became a Buddhist, which has a lot more demonic iconography and images, at least there\u2019s an explanation and reason for these demonic images. In Christianity, all demons are agents of the devil and preachers of everything evil and malevolent.</p> <p>As an avid surfer it\u2019s been really hard for me to get up the gumption to watch that horror movie The Shallows. I\u2019m surprised at how difficult it is for me to press the play button on that movie.

Even though I might make slightly absurd films, I am more affected by work that is grounded more in reality. Whether that is Ray Winstone in Scum attacking another inmate with a bag of pool balls, or the artist Chris Burden having someone shoot him in the arm on camera, or watching Hidden by Michael Haneke. The less sensational and the more mundane then the weirder it is. Films without manipulative music, films shot in real time, films shot with real grit and dirt where you can\u2019t tell the filmmaker\u2019s agenda. Look at The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The reason that is disturbing is because it feels so innocent and raw. It doesn\u2019t use tricks or fast pacing to scare. It hangs around, and cuts slowly and awkwardly and it goes on too long. That gives it a sadistic gratuitous feel.</p> <p>Of course if a film feels like it could really happen then it\u2019s scary. Look at Deliverance with Burt Reynolds. A rafting trip goes horribly wrong in a weird backwater with some local streetcast oddbods inflicting the damage. Totally believable. Totally upsetting. What\u2019s scary in 2016?

I think there\u2019s always been a genuine need to shock audiences, to remind them of the horrors of reality. I remember lying in bed as a child and experiencing deep anxiety at the sound of the news headlines drifting up from the downstairs TV. A fear of the wider world is always a preoccupation for children, no matter how hard adults try to shield them from it. But adults seem to have grown used to being passive consumers of information, with a sense of entitlement and expectation.

We have three new parties that could grab as much as 40% of the vote. There is a fairly strong sentiment among voters to show their dissatisfaction with the political establishment. This sentiment is far stronger now than in the wake of the economic crash back in 2008.\u201d <br></p> <p>With the current coalition partners, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party, not going to win enough seats to continue in government, Axel thinks other parties will get a chance to form a coalition. \u201cIcelandic politicians needs to distance themselves entirely from special interests and convince their voters that they are first and foremost focused on the public\u2019s interest. Politicians also need to introduce more transparency at all levels of government. Increased opportunities for the public to exert a greater political influence will empower the people and make them feel like they can rein in the politicians.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a428d1d8e3363f91afa85bbc0f985c5efeedc73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a428d1d8e3363f91afa85bbc0f985c5efeedc73/0_0_2992_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man walks past a street art in Reykjav\u00edk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walks past a street art in Reykjav\u00edk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The turnout will show us how interested people really are\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Runar</strong> was born and raised in the village of Seydisfjordur on Iceland\u2019s east coast. He works as a team leader in the local fish processing plant. \u201cThe fishing industry is still strong, but there\u2019s some uncertainty about what will happen after the election. The rightwing politicians want to keep the industry more or less the same, but the parties on the left want to make radical changes. Some of the biggest companies in fishing are benefactors of the Independence party.\u201d </p> <p>Runar hopes there will be a political change that can benefit both his own industry and regain people\u2019s trust in the country\u2019s politicians. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s apathy towards politics in Iceland. You can\u2019t turn on the radio or TV without being bombarded by election news. People seem to be interested, but I suppose the turnout will show us how interested they really are. There is a certain level of animosity towards the politicians that were found out to be involved in the Panama Papers scandal. People are not happy to be in financial quarantine themselves, while at the same time observing politicians stashing money offshore. Whoever is elected also needs to look at a health system that is in tatters and ensure that everyone has equal access to it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1454520d6895a271a209be85f78f6ee0b08799c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1454520d6895a271a209be85f78f6ee0b08799c6/0_0_4806_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Icelandic flag hangs outside a shop in Reykjavik, Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Icelandic flag hangs outside a shop in Reykjavik, Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018There are a lot of people still undecided where their vote will go\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Matt</strong> currently works in the Icelandic public sector and lives in Reykjavik. \u201cThe mood in Iceland is interesting. It\u2019s been a much shorter campaign cycle this time round than last time in April 2013, mostly because everyone knew those elections were coming well in advance.\u201d Matt believes there\u2019s plenty of interest among the public and that the coverage of the elections has gone far to ignite this. \u201cThere\u2019s been regular television debates, often with anything up to ten or 12 participants, and regular opinion polls dominating the front pages. The mood is not one of apathy, but I would say there are a lot of people still undecided where their vote will go.\u201d </p> <p>Matt believes there are different outcomes that can realistically happen once the votes have been counted. \u201cThe Pirate Party might get a shot at governing, people might stick with whom they know and ignore the recent scandals, or another party altogether might have a late surge of support. A centre-left coalition looks simply unworkable. I don\u2019t see how they could all work in government or in coalition. The best option would be a government of just the three with the most seats. I would reckon that will be Pirates, Left Greens and either Social Democrats or Bright Future.\u201d </p> <p>Whichever way the vote goes Matt echoes other people\u2019s feelings about the cronyism in Icelandic politics. \u201cPolticians need to show a bit more humility, show respect to the office they hold and the trust the people have given them. Just this week we\u2019ve had reports of both the Foreign Minister and the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister appointing their advisors to the boards of public bodies. It\u2019s this sort of cronyism that pollutes our politics.\u201d</p>",

An audience member can be seen leaving his seat.</p> <p>He concludes his anecdote: \u201cShe got in that car and she got her ass over here and I love her.\u201d</p> <p>As Hawkins, apparently embarrassed, again cites a miscommunication with her management, Trump says: \u201cI don\u2019t know too many women that are taller than me,\u201d then grabs her by the waist and kisses her on the cheek as she puts up her forearm in between them.</p> <p>\u201cCan I sit down now?\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve embarrassed me \u2013 thank you very much.\u201d</p> <p>The Huffington Post said it showed Trump \u201csexually humiliating\u201d Hawkins before a large audience.</p> <p>But Hawkins told Australian media on Saturday that she had a \u201clot of respect\u201d for Trump.</p> <p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s been going on in the news, but really what is there for me to say other than that he respected me during that time in my life and I have a lot of respect for him because of that ... that\u2019s really all I have to say about it,\u201d she said, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/world/us-election/video-shows-donald-trump-publicly-humiliating-jennifer-hawkins-20161028-gsdk5l.html\">according to Fairfax Media\u2019s report</a>.</p> <p>She did not want to comment on Trump\u2019s political chances.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not saying I agree with everything that\u2019s been happening ... but I am not going to sit here and throw negative comments out there, it\u2019s just not who I am. I don\u2019t like drama in my life so I try to stay away from that.\u201d<br></p> <p>She also denied allegations that she had been cancelling interviews in recent weeks to avoid commenting on Trump and the controversy swirling around him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been avoiding the subject.\u201d</p> <p>Hawkins made the comments at the Birdcage hospitality area at the Derby Day race in Melbourne on Saturday where she was acting as Myer ambassador.

It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign.</p> <p>In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt \u201can obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record,\u201d Comey wrote to his employees.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/792167988929650688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Important new reporting from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SariHorwitz\">@SariHorwitz</a> suggests Comey sent letter because he felt pressure from inside:<a href=\"https://t.co/wWjRQGCQjH\">https://t.co/wWjRQGCQjH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0tWUXnqapq\">pic.twitter.com/0tWUXnqapq</a></p>&mdash; Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/792167988929650688\">October 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-29T15:16:16.575Z\">at 4.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5813f196e4b08d944ba4bcc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-29T00:54:11.504Z\">1.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Blum talks about John Boehner, the former speaker of the House.

Like [this] whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for Clinton, in July the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi\">FBI</a> eventually decided to let this potentially illegal evasion of security protocol pass with a sharp wrap on the knuckles.</p> <p>There was an audible intake of breath among campaign followers in the summer, when Comey criticised her for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">decision not to recommend criminal charges</a>brought to an end the one threat deemed capable of preventing her from becoming president.</p> <p>That was, at least, until Comey dropped a fresh bombshell. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juddzeez/status/792051041399439360\">three-paragraph letter</a> he released to Congress on Friday revealing the existence of potentially significant new evidence may or not have any legal bearing on whether charges are again possible. It certainly had a political impact.</p> <p>Clinton was in the air when the letter leaked. An onboard Wi-Fi outage meant she may not have discovered its existence at all until her plane landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just down the road from her very first event as a candidate on 14 April 2015.<br></p> <p>There was a long delay in her leaving the plane as aides urgently gathered onboard to discuss the issue. A planned photoshoot with Annie Leibowitz had to be cut short. Her opponent wasted no time pointing out that it is never a good look for a presidential candidate to be under criminal investigation by the FBI.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d was Donald Trump\u2019s predictable hyperbole at a rally minutes later in New Hampshire. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats rushed to downplay its significance on Friday, as campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Comey may have been \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d by aggressive Republicans into announcing a relatively minor wrinkle for the sake of transparency.</p> <p>The investigation had still not officially been closed, so it is also oversimplifying to say, as many initially did, that it has been \u201creopened\u201d. The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-election-voters\">Hillary Clinton's email woes refuse to go away \u2013 what does this latest twist mean?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813bd27e4b08d944ba4bbfc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T21:04:40.151Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Lisbon, Maine, nearly an hour after he was scheduled to appear - there was an issue with the stairs on his plane - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a room full of supporters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers when she served as secretary of state is \u201cthe biggest political scandal since Watergate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI, after discovering new emails, is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said, inaccurately. \u201cI have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.
