  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>The prevailing mood at the Labour party conference in Liverpool was of gloomy resignation, with right and left aware they need to unite yet not entirely certain how best to make it happen. For anything approaching fun, you had to take a 20-minute walk to a community centre where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/momentum\">Momentum</a> was having its event, The World Transformed. There, you could find people engaging with ideas in the daytime and having a laugh and dancing in the evening. Trade was brisk \u2013 this wasn\u2019t a capitalism-free zone \u2013 and the bookshop sold out of copies of Poems for Jeremy Corbyn. My favourite was Song of the Knives-in-the-Backbenchers (sung to the tune of Gee, Officer Krupke in West Side Story). It began \u201cDear saintly Jezza Corbyn / you gotta understand / that parliaments of fawning / have left us very bland. / Our voters all drive Volvos / our agents do the same / Golly Moses, naturally we\u2019re tame!\u201d<br></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The talking point of the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-reaction-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">US debate</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been over who won, as most people agree that Clinton cruised it. It\u2019s been over Trump\u2019s repeated sniffing, with some saying the Don had got an allergy, while Howard Dean, a doctor and former chairman of the Democratic national committee, alleged he must have taken cocaine. Trump denied this. I believe him, though he has my sympathies. Imagine what it must be like to suffer from terminal megalomania, to have a total inability to distinguish between fact and fiction even when confronted with the evidence, to know many people find you utterly unbearable, and not even have the excuse that you\u2019ve done some coke.<br></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding a free table for dinner can be tricky at party conferences, but sometimes you get lucky. Passing an Indian restaurant, we noticed one unoccupied table for nine people, so asked if it was available. \u201cIt\u2019s being held for Mr<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/keith-vaz-to-step-down-commons-committee-chair-sunday-mirror-sex-claims\"> Keith Vaz</a>,\u201d the manager replied. We were able to explain the Labour MP wasn\u2019t going to be using his reservation as he had cancelled his annual Diversity Nite event, so we got the table. I did, though, think twice about going to the Daily Mirror party, always the hottest ticket at the conference. Having seen the length of the queue and the state of the people falling out of the front door, I opted for an early night. So I missed the fire-eater who set fire to the carpet, a Beatles tribute band that looked nothing like the Beatles, Yvette Cooper dancing rather better than her absent husband, and rival Labour factions shouting, \u201cJeremy\u201d and \u201cTony\u201d at each other.<br></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The news so many people have been dreading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/danbrown\">Dan Brown</a> is writing a new novel called Origin featuring his world-famous symbologist, Robert Langdon. It won\u2019t be published until next year but Brown has been kind enough to offer me a preview: \u201cLangdon\u2019s mind was a vale of darkness. His eidetic memory had failed him. \u2018You\u2019ve been shot,\u2019 a woman said. He looked up to see a lissom figure with gentle brown eyes that held a profundity of experience rarely encountered in someone of her age. \u2018I\u2019m Carla Miller. A doctor. We have to get you out of here. Someone is trying to kill you.\u2019 \u2018Why would anyone want to do that?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Because they read The Da Vinci Code.\u2019 Just then, a masked woman with spiky hair burst through the doors, firing a metallic gun made of metal. Carla opened a hidden trapdoor no one had guessed might be there and she and Langdon slid down a curved tunnel that took them to a secret hideout. Langdon looked out the window. \u2018From my observations, I deduce we must be in Florence, the most populous city in Tuscany, with 370,000 residents,\u2019 he said. \u2018There\u2019s no time for you to quote Wikipedia,\u2019 Sienna reprimanded him scoldingly. \u2018The world is under threat.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I\u2019d probably have been more receptive to the University of Alicante\u2019s report that we all needed to go on courses to train for retirement had I not been just days away from my own 60th birthday. Right now, I couldn\u2019t feel less joyous about embracing my end-of-life experience. Still, give it a few months and maybe I will become more receptive. I can think of two courses that will be of benefit to me. The first is financial planning: I have stupidly managed to live my life arse about tit and spent most of my 20s living as a retiree, watching plenty of daytime TV in between trying not to get sacked from dead-end part-time jobs. As a result, my pension provision is pitiful. Only this week, Sun Life kindly sent me a statement saying my projected income at retirement is \u00a32,365. I\u2019m guessing, but I suspect that may not be enough. The other course I could use is health awareness. Much of the past 30 years I\u2019ve spent imagining every symptom to be fatal. Now I need help preparing for the fact that, sooner rather than later, one will be.<br></p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Friends Not-Entirely-Reunited<br></p>",

The attacks that have emerged are slander and lies cheap generated with bad intentions, which have no foundation that have been spread by sensationalist media. This, of course, is not the first time that I face such a situation. Through their hate campaign, the Republican candidate insists discredit and demoralize a woman, which is definitely one of the most terrifying features. with this, seeking to distract attention from their real problems and its inability to pretend to be the leader of this great country. When I was a young girl, the now candidate, I was humiliated, insulted me, I disrespected publicly, as he usually did privately in the cruelest way. as this happened to me, it is clear over the years that their actions and behavior have been repeated with other women for decades. Therefore, I will keep standing, sharing my story, my absolute support Mrs. Clinton on behalf of women, my sisters, aunts, grandmothers, cousins, friends and female community. My Latin and in general, I want to thank all the support, love and respect, my career, my person as a human being and my family. I became a citizen of this great country because my daughter was born here and because I wanted to exercise my rights, including voting. I will continue standing firm in my lived experience as Miss Universe and you with me supporting me. I\u2019ve been so pleased with many kind words, for so much love. I\u2019m focusing on my busy career, in my work as mother and I will continue taking positive steps for the Latino community, I will continue as activist for women\u2019s rights and respect we deserve.

In addition to Zakarian, chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s also pulled out of a planned restaurant project in the same hotel.</p> <p>The multi-hour deposition was released by a court order on Friday after a number of organizations, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/danielwagner/trump-video-depositions?utm_term=.hgj07DgZE#.bwnApgKbm\">led by Buzzfeed</a>, sued to have the video unsealed. Trump insisted that his comments should not be controversial because \u201cI\u2019ve been making this statement for many years. This is not just new.\u201d He also insisted that he thought his candidacy would draw more Hispanic customers than otherwise, insisting: \u201cI think you will get more business. I think you\u2019ll get more business,\u201d although he acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s always possible\u201d that some might not patronize his hotel as a result.</p> <p>The Washington hotel project in the Old Post Office building has long loomed over the Trump campaign. The Republican nominee has repeatedly bragged about the building and his work in redeveloping it. Trump even touted it during Monday\u2019s presidential debate. He has held multiple campaign events there, including<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton\"> his statement earlier this month</a> in which he acknowledged that Barack Obama was born in the United States after years of spreading a conspiracy theory to the contrary.</p>",
  "<p>If it\u2019s an unnerving experience to have nine-time Grammy winner Mary J Blige close her eyes and sing directly to you about police violence from just a few feet away, Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t show it. <br></p> <p>Clinton is the first guest to appear on the hip-hop soul singer\u2019s new show The 411 with Mary J Blige \u2013 a reference to her 1992 debut album \u2013 now streaming on Apple Music, and it\u2019s definitely a little different from a typical presidential nominee interview.</p> <p>\u201cMay I call you Hillary,\u201d asked Blige, who had been calling her \u201cSecretary Clinton\u201d earlier in the interview.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you may,\u201d replied Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cOK Hillary, I want to share something with you I haven\u2019t shared with anyone,\u201d declared Blige, announcing that she was going to sing her a song: Bruce Springsteen\u2019s 41 Shots, written about Amadou Diallo in 1999, an unarmed black man who was killed by four NYPD officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt means a lot to me just because of everything that\u2019s taking place now,\u201d said Blige, a reference to the recent high-profile examples of unarmed black men and women who have been killed by police.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to share it with you because believe that so many women, African American women, feel like this when they\u2019re sending their children off to school in the morning,\u201d Blige said.</p> <p>Blige closed her eyes, and started singing to Clinton, who initially had on her best poker face.</p> <p>The lyrics are incredibly relevant after the deaths of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Alfred Olango in San Diego and 13-year-old Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio \u2013 all unarmed black males shot and killed by police in the last two weeks. </p> <p>\u201cIf an officer stops you, always be polite / And you\u2019ll never ever run away, promise mama you\u2019ll keep your hands in sight / Is it a gun, is it a knife, is it a wallet, is it your life,\u201d sang Blige.</p> <p>As Blige sang about black people getting killed by police, she reached out and held Clinton\u2019s hand. </p> <p>A preview <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleMusic/status/780615986344898561?lang=en\">published on social media</a> made the singing look cringe-worthy, with viewers noting Clinton\u2019s ability to remain diplomatic in uncomfortable situations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NyashaMC/status/780609126602792960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone who can keep a straight face while Mary J.

Clinton seemed genuinely emotional, sighing \u201cOh Mary, oh Mary,\u201d at the end of the song.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWhere do we go from here? What is the first thing you would do to begin the healing process with all this?\u201d Blige asked.</p> <p>The pair continued to hold hands, all four hands entwined together almost like they were in prayer. </p> <p>\u201cI have been so heartbroken over what\u2019s been going on because it\u2019s fundamentally at odds and wrong that African American parents have to sit their children down and deliver the message you just sang,\u201d Clinton responded.</p> <p>Clinton mentioned \u201cimplicit bias\u201d during the debate, noting \u201cimplicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t disagree at the time, Donald Trump brought it up at a rally this week, saying that asserting Clinton \u201caccuses the entire country \u2013 including all of law enforcement \u2013 of implicit bias, essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be honest that there needs to be a greater opening of our hearts to one another, put ourselves in each other\u2019s shoes, feel the pain that a mother and a father feel when their son and daughter can go out the door and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI particularly want white people to understand what that\u2019s like and to feel that they must be part of the solution.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton spoke about needing to train police in better de-escalation techniques and \u201cto really address implicit bias so that a young black man walking down the street is not a threat, he\u2019s a young black man walking down the street,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Seems that singing really touched a nerve. \u201cI\u2019ve been interviewed so many times, nobody has ever sung in the middle of the interview. That was so touching to me. Obviously the issue, the subject is so profound but just doing it was so moving to me, thank you,\u201d added Clinton, who looked like she might cry.</p> <p>Blige asked if Clinton thought it was hard for a woman to be both tough and likable.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied Clinton instantly. \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard, to be honest with you, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d she said, dissolving into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard. I think it\u2019s rooted in tens of thousands of years of how people\u2019s lives have been defined, what it\u2019s meant to be a woman or a man and how society was organized. For women to be assuming leading roles in business or entertainment or politics or whatever it might be, it\u2019s still not fully understood because there\u2019s no blueprint for doing it,\u201d Clinton added.</p> <p>And it turns out it\u2019s not so hard to get your hands on Hamilton tickets if you\u2019re famous, Clinton revealing she had seen the musical four times. She revealed the soundtrack was a regular on her playlist.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a work of genius. It\u2019s obsessing me right now. That\u2019s my number one go-to,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The pair also chatted about the impact of Clinton\u2019s mother on her life \u2013 she named her and Nelson Mandela as her personal heroes \u2013 and the role of religion in her life. \u201cBeing a person of faith has sustained me over the course of my life,\u201d she said. They also talked about what it\u2019s like to be famous and handling criticism.</p> <p>\u201cThe public eye has a way of magnifying things that aren\u2019t important and dismissing things that are,\u201d Clinton said.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d replied Blige, who\u2019s currently going through a high-profile divorce.</p> <p>At the end of the interview, the pair hugged and thanked each other repeatedly. \u201cThat was so emotional!\u201d Clinton quipped.</p>",

In response, the European commission called for a special trade court to replace the current system, which dates back to the 1960s.

That is causing unjustified concerns. We should consider this in the context of the bigger picture: Deutsche Bank overall has more than 20 million clients.<br><br>I understand if you feel concerned by the extensive coverage on this issue. <strong>Our bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price.</strong><br><br>It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business. Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust.<br><br>Deutsche Bank has strong fundamentals. Let me mention some of the most important facts at this point:<br></p> <ol> <li><strong>We fulfil all current capital requirements and our restructuring is well on track.</strong> We completed the disposal of the British insurer Abbey Life this week and the sale of our stake in the Chinese Hua Xia Bank will be finalised soon. This will further improve our capital ratio.</li> <li><strong>We have significantly decreased our market and credit risk in recent years</strong>. At no point in the last two decades has the balance sheet of Deutsche Bank been as stable as it is today.</li> <li><strong>Despite low interest rates and a difficult environment we posted a pre-tax profit of about 1 billion euros in the first half of 2016.</strong> Before extraordinary items like restructuring costs, we earned about 1.7 billion euros. This demonstrates the operating strength of Deutsche Bank.</li> <li><strong>In a situation like this, the most important factor is our liquidity reserves</strong>. Currently they still amount to more than 215 billion euros. This is an extremely comfortable buffer. This is clear proof of how conservatively we have planned. This is acknowledged by numerous banking analysts.</li> </ol> <p>There is therefore no basis for this speculation. Nor can uncertainty about the outcome of our litigation cases in the US explain this pressure on our stock price, <strong>if we take the settlements of our peers as a benchmark.</strong><br><br>You have all done a tremendous job over the past few days. You are the ones who are in constant contact with our clients and making it clear how Deutsche Bank is really doing. You are Deutsche Bank \u2013 that is impressively clear. All of us in the Management Board highly appreciate it.<br><br><strong>You will hear back from me soon.</strong> Please keep working as you have been doing so far.

  "<p>The story of Alicia Machado is many things but as it pertains to the presidential election, it is a story about the time Donald Trump smeared a woman and riled up a media circus to spread the gossip. That was back in the 1990s and mostly fodder for tabloids. Now it\u2019s happening all over again \u2013 only as part of a presidential campaign.</p> <p>In the first candidates\u2019 debate this week, Hillary Clinton invoked her opponent\u2019s high-profile fat-shaming of Machado after she was crowned Miss Universe in 1996, comments that pushed her into a downward spiral of eating disorders for five years.</p> <p>Until recently Trump wasn\u2019t denying any of it \u2013 when the New York Times first asked Trump to respond to her story, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0\">he replied simply</a>: \u201cTo that, I will plead guilty.\u201d But on Wednesday, his campaign released talking points <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/781265558721458177?s=09\">claiming the story was</a> \u201ctotally baseless and unsubstantiated\u201d and that Machado was merely attempting to \u201cgain notoriety at the expense of Mr Trump\u2019s name and reputation\u201d.</p> <p>The irony of course is that we can verify Machado\u2019s story not in spite of Trump but because of him. It was he who made sure her weight-gain and his treatment of her was documented around the world; what\u2019s changed is simply public perception.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55vjz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756157\"            data-video-name=\"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: 'I know what he can do' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea8d3fe4b091b7fa2b5a86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\">Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: \u2018I know what he can do\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Back in May, Slate\u2019s Jessica Winter published a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/05/17/when_donald_trump_humiliated_miss_universe_for_gaining_weight.html\">roundup</a> of the media\u2019s cruel and inappropriate coverage from the time, much of which laughed right along with Trump: \u201cNo one could accuse Alicia Machado of being the size of the universe,\u201d wrote a CNN correspondent at the time. \u201cBut as her universe expanded, so did she.\u201d And while the media may have since advanced on the subject of fat-shaming \u2013 it\u2019s no longer acceptable to write about young women\u2019s weight that way \u2013 we\u2019re still falling for Trump\u2019s sensationalized media circuses.</p> <p>This time the line of attack, pushed most aggressively by surrogates and rightwing news outlets, defames Machado as a porn star and murder accomplice, who once threatened to kill a judge and posed topless for Playboy, among other things. The latest assault came from Trump himself on Friday. He called her \u201cdisgusting\u201d on Twitter and asked followers to \u201ccheck out sex tape and past\u201d. Even if the worst of this is true, it doesn\u2019t invalidate anything she said about Trump.</p> <p>The real headline should be \u201cWoman Who Speaks Truth About Presidential Candidate Endures Second Character Assassination\u201d. The sequence is familiar by now: throughout history, women who speak out against powerful men \u2013 as Machado did, for instance, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">in the New York Times earlier this year</a> \u2013 have been subject to a backlash. They\u2019re slut-shamed or cast as crazy, as the Anita Hill movie, Confirmation, recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/hbo-confirmation-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-jill-abramson\">reminded us</a>. </p> <p>Instead the Daily Caller went with \u201cPorn Star Campaigns For Hillary Clinton,\u201d while the Daily Mail <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3810484/Miss-Universe-fat-shamed-Donald-Trump-accused-threatening-kill-judge-accomplice-MURDER-native-Venezuela.html\">landed upon</a> \u201cMiss Universe \u2018fat-shamed\u2019 by Donald Trump was accused of threatening to kill a judge and being an accomplice to a MURDER bid in her native Venezuela,\u201d noting that it was \u201cunknown if [the] Clinton campaign vetted Machado\u201d. Alex Jones\u2019s conspiracy-theory-mongering site also speculated luridly about the father of Machado\u2019s daughter\u2019s past.</p> <p>First off, the Clinton campaign confirmed to the Guardian that she is not being paid by them. She\u2019s a volunteer.</p> <p>The pornography charge appears to be false. The website Snopes, which specializes in debunking online hoaxes, writes that the anal sex clip that turns up on free porn sites under Machado\u2019s name appears to be from the 2004 feature Apprentass 4, which stars another woman. Machado did pose on the cover of Playboy \u2013 twice in fact. But if it\u2019s going to be used to smear her character, perhaps it\u2019s relevant to note that so has Donald Trump? The difference is Trump kept his shirt on, but even that was probably only in deference to the preferences of the audience. And speculation relating to her seven-year-old daughter should not be a journalistic enterprise at any respectable media organization.</p> <p>The most substantive charge is that in 1998 a 21-year-old Machado was accused of driving a getaway car after her boyfriend shot his brother-in-law. This is from <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/604213\">the Economist</a>\u2019s report at the time:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The male lead in this complex plot is Miss Machado\u2019s rugged boyfriend, Juan Rafael Rodriguez Reggeti. He had a sister, who, eight months pregnant, jumped off a fifth-floor balcony. He, allegedly, blaming her husband for the suicide, sought revenge by firing two shots at him just after the funeral. The husband was hit but survived. Mr Rodriguez fled in a car driven, say the police, by Miss Machado.</p> <p>The investigating judge, Maximiliano Fuenmayor, issued an arrest warrant for Mr Rodriguez. But Miss Machado, who claimed she was ill at home at the time, seemed to be in the clear, for the moment anyway. It was a short moment. Within hours, Mr Fuenmayor had a telephone call from her. He says she threatened to ruin his career and have him killed. She admits she rang, but says it was merely to thank him for his unbiased pursuit of justice.</p> </blockquote> <p>The accusations went nowhere and she never faced charges. The report that she drove a getaway car was dropped almost 20 years ago due to lack of evidence. More recently, they did not prevent her from obtaining US citizenship in August, a process involving a background check and clearance.</p> <p>Interestingly Corey Lewandowski, the Trump operator <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/alicia-machado-attempted-murder-228885\">who dredged up the allegations</a>, was charged with battery as recently as this year. And unlike, Machado, who has only volunteered, the former campaign manager was, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/09/29/donald-trump-pays-off-corey-lewandowski/91262286/\">until Thursday</a>, still on Trump\u2019s payroll.</p> <p>Machado\u2019s role in the debate has also spawned <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/27/13079878/alicia-machado-trap\">claims</a> that a profile I wrote was orchestrated with the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>To be clear: it was not. I never communicated with the Clinton campaign around this story except to ask for a comment on Monday afternoon, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/09/after-debate-cosmo-guardian-us-rushed-to-publish-dueling-alicia-machado-profiles-004785\">as Politico explained.</a></p> <p>Given a chance to respond to the personal accusations about her, Machado \u2013 whose English is imperfect \u2013 did not debunk them as forcefully as she might have (though again, she has been denying them for almost 20 years now). Instead <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fmr-miss-universe-machado-on-allegation-she-was-a-murder-accomplice-im-not-a-saint-girl/\">she said something different,</a> and something which has been largely misconstrued. After dismissing the reports as \u201cspeculation\u201d born of her celebrity in Latin America she waxed indignant: \u201cHe can say whatever he wants to say, I don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I have my past. Of course, everybody has a past. I\u2019m not a saint girl. But that is not the point now.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has latched on to this as evidence of her guilt. But perhaps there\u2019s been something lost in translation. Trump said at the debate that she\u2019s \u201cno Mother Teresa\u201d and here she\u2019s echoing Trump\u2019s implicitly sexist line from the debate. Mother Teresa is an actual saint \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t have to be.</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume for a moment that the worst is true and she threatened a judge as a 21-year-old: it doesn\u2019t make Trump look any better.</p> <p>You shouldn\u2019t have to be Mother Teresa to not be fat-shamed before millions of people. And Michael Brown being \u201cno angel\u201d, as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-ferguson-michael-brown-angel-20140828-story.html\">the New York Times put it recently</a>, shouldn\u2019t have been relevant in a case about being killed by police, as Black Lives Matter tried to teach us.</p> <p>These instances aren\u2019t equivalent, but the point is people who lack power because they are women or minorities, or both, too often aren\u2019t given the basic human dignities the rest of us take for granted.</p> <p>Machado saying she\u2019s no saint isn\u2019t an admission of guilt. It\u2019s an indictment of us. </p>",
  "<p>Readers are much better at asking smart questions than I am, which is why I have been ending each of these articles with a request to get in touch with me. Earlier this week, Alan wrote me an email which asked:</p> <p><em>I would like to know more about what supporters of the Greens and Libertarians will actually do on US polling day. Do we expect them to vote for their own lost causes as a principled act of faith, stay at home or switch to a mainstream party?</em><br></p> <p>It\u2019s a great question. For now, though, I\u2019m going to set aside what these individuals are going to do on November 8 \u2013 partly because I think predictive journalism is having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">bad effect on democracy</a> and partly because I haven\u2019t seen enough data to give you a solid answer. <br></p> <p>Instead, I want to take one step back and consider just how many Americans are considering a choice that isn\u2019t Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump.</p> <p>There are a lot of them. According to Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">averages</a>, about 15% of Americans are currently contemplating a choice which isn\u2019t one of the two main parties. About 7% support the Libertarian party nominee, Gary Johnson, another 2% support the Green party nominee, Jill Stein, and almost 6% either support another candidate (like the independent candidate Evan McMullin) or else they\u2019re undecided. </p> <p>Unfortunately for them, candidates whose surnames aren\u2019t Clinton or Trump have approximately a 0% chance of winning any states, let alone the election. But they could nevertheless influence national results by affecting other candidates\u2019 vote share. The numbers on this are pretty fascinating right now. </p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, third-party votes don\u2019t just come from would-be Democratic voters \u2013 they appear to be coming equally from potential Republicans. One way to measure this is to contrast Clinton and Trump\u2019s vote shares in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">two-way race</a> with their support in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">four-way race</a>. Both candidates lose a few percentage points but the overall takeaway remains the same: Clinton is currently three percentage points ahead of Trump. </p> <p>The problem for Hillary is that three percentage points just isn\u2019t good enough, especially when you take into account the inaccuracies of polling. The two leading candidates are pretty much neck and neck and recent political history suggests that could be a big problem for Clinton. </p> <p>In 2000, the Green party presidential candidate Ralph Nader played a huge role in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/05/31/nader_elected_bush_why_we_shouldnt_forget_130715.html\">securing</a> George Bush\u2019s victory, in part because Nader eroded Al Gore\u2019s vote share in the crucial state of Florida. The latest <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5963.html\">polling</a> from Florida suggests the state is going to be just as much of a battleground in 2016 \u2013 just half a percentage point separates Trump and Clinton. </p> <ul> <li><em>You can get in touch with any questions you\u2019d like to see answered in this series by emailing mona.chalabi@theguardian.com</em><br></li> </ul>",

It happened in the 1950s after the Attlee government. The left were unhappy with NHS charges, the policy on nuclear weapons and towards the Soviet Union. This led to infighting which kept the party out of power for 13 years.</p> <p>After the Wilson/Callaghan governments of the 60s and 70s we got the infamous i infighting of the 80s. Corbyn's mentor helped build a myth that the party had betrayed socialism and was just the same as the Tories. This helped keep Labour out of power for 18 years.</p> <p>So now after the Blair/Brown governments we're getting the same thing. The left are trashing the parties record and focusing on the past.

How can you win? You put white thing women in an advert, you're not representative (true). You put a diverse range of women in an advert, you're pandering. True, there was something a bit tokenistic about the campaign, and they could have maybe done it a bit more subtly than having a bunch of &quot;diverse&quot; women in one advert saying &quot;see how diverse we are???&quot; <br />Then again, you have to start somewhere. If this signals a change in H&amp;M's advertising that includes more diversity in all of their media going forward, then I'm in. Let's just see if they carry it forward.<br />Oh and on the unrelated paragraph about portraying mixed race couples - I had no idea it produced such backlash. I am a product of a mixed marriage myself, so I am frankly just bemused at furious reactions over mixed marriages and relationships. They've been a fact of life for thousands of years and have been increasingly common and will only get more common as air travel and multi-culturalism increases. I'm not even offended, I just find it highly amusing that there are still people out there who honestly believe that &quot;mixing&quot; is wrong.

I've worked at several agencies and can tell you from experience that the problem is not down to gender imbalance (though this is definitely the case at the very senior levels). Nor is it necessarily down to a lack of ethnic diversity (though this still has a long way to go). In my opinion, the problem is down to these agencies insisting that they generally hire privately educated individuals with degrees. This means that my colleagues are effectively homogenised in their views and experiences. How then, is it possible for them to create ads which resonate with society at large, when they only hire individuals who have been living in a lovely middle-class bubble their whole lives? A lot of the products we make ads for would never be bought by such people. Rather, it's those in the council estates that flock to buy them en masse. And the disconnect between what they want, and what a lot of my colleagues think they want, is marked.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018This is just the voice in the doorman\u2019s earpiece saying, \u2018It\u2019s a flat night, let the people in we wouldn\u2019t last night\u2019.\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women#comment-84234753\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16541740\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for ID665310\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">ID665310</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84234753\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 6:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Okay, I've watched it.

She responds to the question \u2013 why are women more affected?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Women have always felt more comfortable coming forward and I don\u2019t think men self-harm as much. Instead, they tend to turn to other things to ease their distress, such as alcohol. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have gender specific services. We are seeing more women with post traumatic stress disorder from domestic violence, after childbirth and from sexual violence they experience in relationships. Those sort of conditions need a different approach to ones we have as standard at the moment.</p> <p>Similarly with men a different approach is also needed, and for them we need to make services and treatment accessible. We know that middle-aged men have the highest suicide rate, so what are we doing to get that group into treatment and support earlier. It\u2019s good that we have identified these new statistics as if we know about these problems then we can plan services better and think, why is this happening? </p> <p>Mental health problems are increasingly (there\u2019s lots of reasons for this). I worry, in particular, about the impact of the media and social media. People are seeing things like self-harm on social media dn it makes it more accessible and we need to be really alert and able to talk to our children. We need to have that conversation around those issues and make sure they are safe. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:41:29.230Z\">at 2.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee3b0de4b035c40686bf13\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joanna-ruck\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:29:14.557Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pictures of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Picture editor Joanna Ruck shares some of her images of the week.</em></p> <p>First, the images from Aleppo have been particularly hard to look at this week and very graphic and distressing.

But at the moment, I'd vote Tory because I'm not agreeing with labour on a lot of issues &amp; I feel harassed by the tory-bashing. I don't like voting because of a party leader but jeremy &amp; those around him don't appeal to me either. </p> <p>I think this will be one of their problems come election time if things don't change - they paint anything tory as evil (despite tories winning more votes than labour) &amp; they need tory votes to win anything. If they could just stop the tory-bashing &amp; actually get on with policy, they might get a better message across the divide. They need to start saying how they are similar, not how they are different (although this will alienate momentum et al.)</p> <p>What I really fear though is all those right-leaning labour voters, who tend to be socially right-wing, voting UKIP. UKIP are already on-course to win more votes despite the referendum &amp; any equivocation from the tories or labour (which has already happened to a greater extent) on leaving EU &amp; they'll push more &amp; more to UKIP. Lib dems are a non-starter as corbyn has sapped any hard-left votes that may have gone their way. That leaves UKIP as the 3rd largest party in the HoC (future HoL?!) &amp; they'll likely vote tory on many issues in the house. Overall, I think the future is grim-dark for labour unless they change tactics soon.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84361823\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10104875\" title=\"View fresher\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/10104875\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for fresher\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10104875\" title=\"View fresher\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">fresher</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84361823\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">30 September 2016 1:41pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Labour can't beat the Tories, but the Tories could conspire to lose.

I'm in a supposed Tory safe seat but the truth is that if you counted the Lib Dem and Labour vote together, we would comfortably win. That's repeated up and down the country. An electoral pact means not standing candidates against the most likely to win. It also means people can vote strategically yet maintain allegiance with the party of their conscience.<br />2.

  "<p>Ever since Donald Trump blamed President Obama for the poverty and violence black people face in his \u201chome town\u201d <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-donald-trump-chicago-violence-speech-met-0722-20160721-story.html\">during</a> the Republican National Convention, the GOP candidate has become increasingly obsessed with the city of Chicago. </p> <p>\u201cWe have a situation where we have our inner cities \u2013 African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it\u2019s so dangerous,\u201d Trump said at this week\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cYou walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they\u2019ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1. Thousands of shootings. And I say, where is this? Is this is a war-torn country? What are we doing?\u201d</p> <p>A reasonable person would think that someone who loves to talk about a city as much as this would, in turn, care about it \u2013 especially when that person has his name on one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago)\">tallest buildings</a> in that city. But reasonable and Trump are two words that rarely go together.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe that Trump\u2019s love of Chicago as a talking point has anything to do with him wanting to make it better for black people. Rather, it seems like an easy way of connecting with the racist assumptions of his supporters.</p> <p>Chicagoans haven\u2019t forgotten what happened when he touched down in March to attend his first rally in the city, at a university that prides itself on its diversity. After hearing about the crowd of protesters outside the venue, he cancelled the event, claiming police advised him to. Chicago PD, however, stated that they issued <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/272760-police-say-they-didnt-advise-trump-to-cancel-rally-ap\">no such instruction</a>.</p> <p>The arena exploded with a mixture of celebration and anger. Trump supporters took out their rage at the cancellation on the minorities who had come to show that they would fight to ensure he didn\u2019t win the election \u2013 and being there that day I can tell you \u201cminority\u201d was definitely not the word they used to describe us. The anger seemed to unite them in their support for Trump more than anything he could have on stage. It gave them a clear enemy.</p> <p>Trump has continued to use that moment in his Chicago-focused rhetoric. He also likes to cite the city\u2019s violent crime and homicide rates, boasting that he could bring them down \u2013 and that, for this reason, black people should vote for him. His strategy, he told Bill O\u2019Reilly, would involve the police being \u201cvery much tougher\u201d than they are now. He even claimed a \u201ctop police officer\u201d had told him that he could fix the problems in \u201cone week\u201d. (Chicago police <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-caught-embellishing-story-meeting-top-chicago-article-1.2764158\">denied</a> that any member of the senior team had met with him). </p> <p>Meanwhile, his former campaign manager, when asked why Trump doesn\u2019t discuss these issues with those affected by them, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-chicago-rally-not-safe-lewandowski-227301\">said</a> that while he had once tried to go to talk to African Americans in Chicago, \u201cit was not a safe environment\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has yet to reschedule the rally, but he has since returned to the city for other events \u2013 the latest being <a href=\"http://abc7chicago.com/politics/donald-trump-campaigns-in-chicago/1530093/\">lunch</a> at a suburban country club that sold tickets ranging from $1,000 to $250,000. On the same day he spoke at the Polish National Alliance headquarters. Two places in which the only black people he would likely encounter would be working there. <br></p> <p>As the campaign continues, I expect he\u2019ll carry on avoiding neighborhoods like the south side of Chicago. Places he\u2019d actually have to engage with communities subject to some of the violence he tries to exploit, not, in my view, to win the support of black voters, but to gain the sympathy of supporters who don\u2019t believe black lives actually matter.<br></p> <p>Because to be quite blunt \u2013 and to borrow from Kanye West, the most famous artist of late to come out of the Windy City \u2013 I believe Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care about black people. Especially those who have died. </p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama\">Michelle Obama</a> gets on the microphone, the world listens. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">speech at the Democratic convention</a> in July was judged by many to be the best of the week, reaching the emotional and inspirational heights that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2019s presidential campaign has sometimes struggled to achieve. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4\">Her turn on Carpool Karaoke</a> with James Corden this summer, singing Beyonc\u00e9 and Stevie Wonder, has, at the time of writing, been watched nearly 44m times on YouTube.</p> <p>But for most of the eight years she has lived in the White House, there has been no microphone. Obama is seen a good deal more than she is heard, so how she looks has taken on disproportionate significance. Her image sets the emotional tone for the White House, becoming a symbolic ideal for other women, for other wives and mothers. Every new hairstyle has been combed as a cipher for a change in the national mood; every dress evaluated for the values it embodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec8fa43ccccf93d78c964eaf1dc5917ae162c445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec8fa43ccccf93d78c964eaf1dc5917ae162c445/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama\u2019s Carpool Karaoke with James Corden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no denying that this feels retrograde for a woman of Obama\u2019s intellect and background. There is a call-and-response rhythm to this kind of coverage, with every fashion feature on her wardrobe triggering an opinion piece raging at this unbefitting treatment of a high-achieving lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. Yet, contrary to what many expected, Obama herself has played the role in a notably traditional key. In contrast to her predecessor Hillary Clinton\u2019s battles over public healthcare, she has adopted relatively uncontroversial causes: family nutrition, childhood health and girls\u2019 education, issues that sit neatly around her self-proclaimed identity as Mom-In-Chief. While these causes are, perhaps, more culturally loaded than they first appear \u2013 the campaign against childhood obesity has a more progressive slant when you take into account the fact that the issue disproportionately affects low-income and black families \u2013 they have frustrated those who hoped for a more radical rewrite.</p> <p>Obama has followed in the first lady tradition by putting fashion centre stage of her public persona. On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">night of her husband\u2019s election to office</a> in 2008, she wore a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/17/michelleobama-fashion\">Narciso Rodriguez dress</a> in a fiery red-and-black speckle pattern. The fashion press reported the pattern as \u201cd\u00e9grad\u00e9\u201d, while others went with \u201clava lamp\u201d. To wear a very eye-catching dress at such a moment made it clear that Obama had no intention of allowing the White House to cramp her style. She had broken an unspoken rule of modern culture, which holds that a serious person must have a sober wardrobe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac266b583f634848b00dd527af66700f9ca227c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac266b583f634848b00dd527af66700f9ca227c6/88_44_1148_2317/495.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama in a controversial Narciso Rodriguez dress at Barack\u2019s first election night victory rally in 2008\" width=\"495\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama wore a controversial Narciso Rodriguez dress at Barack\u2019s election night victory rally in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until Obama, the iconography of the first lady revolved around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis\">Jackie Kennedy</a>. There had been glamorous president\u2019s wives since \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/06/nancy-reagan\">Nancy Reagan</a> with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/26/your-next-box-set-dynasty\">Dynasty</a> gowns, say \u2013 but the notion of first lady chic remained almost synonymous with that sunny yet streamlined early-1960s style that is for ever Camelot. Half a century later, wives of heads of state all over the world are still measured against Kennedy, but the comparison is sharpest in the White House. Where her predecessors had tiptoed around the edges of Kennedy style, as if anxious to avoid the comparison, Obama has embraced many elements of the look and made them her own. The sleeveless shift dresses she favours are a direct link, as are the outsize strings of pearls, often framed by wide-set necklines. Even elements of the two women\u2019s hair and makeup are similar, despite their physical difference: note the full, stiffly curled hair and the penchant for false eyelashes.</p> <p>The Kennedys represent an American ideal that is classy and democratic, and Obama has used fashion to ally herself and her husband with that same message. The visual connection with the Kennedys draws the eye to the obvious difference: their skin colour. It\u2019s a way of emphasising the historic nature of the Obamas as the first black family to live in the White House, while at the same time telling the world that this family, and this administration, is traditionally American.</p> <p>At the first inauguration, in January 2009, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/michelle-obama-isabel-toledo-sasha-malia\">Obama wore a dress and matching coat in an unusual shade of pale greenish yellow</a> that observers struggled to put a name to. (The Guardian went with lemongrass.) Her elder daughter, Malia, wore a purple coat with black scarf and gloves; her younger daughter, Sasha, a pink coat with orange scarf and gloves. The colours made for a dazzlingly confident family portrait. Other elements of the look were formal, even traditional (the first lady\u2019s sleek leather gloves, the two girls in their cosy, buttoned-up coats), but the colours were modern, the cheery brights of a holiday snap rather than the sepia tones of an official photograph. That was the day Obama took first lady chic and made it modern and down-to-earth. Later that year, on a state visit to Britain, she wore an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/20/azzedine-alaia-fashion-favourite-maverick\">Azzedine Ala\u00efa</a> cardigan to meet the Queen. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/03/oscar-de-la-renta-slams-m_n_182807.html\">sniffed the designer Oscar de la Renta</a> \u2013 but he was already out of touch. Obama\u2019s approachable, real-life wardrobe had struck a chord.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c97e3a079fa6f3e8e23484f3926a67e1525a029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c97e3a079fa6f3e8e23484f3926a67e1525a029/0_0_2600_2091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama wearing a black cardigan to meet the Queen and Prince Philip with Barack in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama was criticised for wearing a cardigan to meet the Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without wearing a single outfit that could be considered truly rule-breaking, Obama has rewritten the playbook. In early 2009, when the first lady\u2019s official website was launched featuring a photo of her wearing a sleeveless dress, the Chicago Tribune reported that it had received hundreds of online responses, many of which criticised the look for its inappropriate informality. Since then, the trend for the sleeveless dress as grownup but fun, dressy but comfortable \u2013 fuelled, in huge part, by Obama herself \u2013 has grown and grown. She made it OK for a middle-aged woman to wear a dress showcasing arms that speak of serious push-ups, as well as those signature warm Mobama hugs. In that sense, she represents a generation growing old in a different way. Many of her fashion choices \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/15/michelle-obama-fashion-week\">girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown</a> she wore for the first inauguration to the full skirts she often favours for daytime \u2013 are looks that not long ago would have been thought too young, too cute, for a woman in her 50s to carry off. Instead, she has captured something of the confidence of a generation who will not accept that they should slip into the shadows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf8c7564a3c90bf44b4ab1b5ee288bb17cd5f3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf8c7564a3c90bf44b4ab1b5ee288bb17cd5f3bf/121_154_2197_3341/658.jpg\" alt=\"Obama in a girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown at the first inaugural ball in 2009.\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama wore a girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown for the first inaugural ball in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama has consistently played down any interest in fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard. I\u2019m kind of a tomboy-jock at heart, but I like to look nice,\u201d she told ABC news in 2008. But she has steered her image carefully nonetheless. When she appeared on the <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2009-02-10-vogue_cover_michelle_obama.jpg\">cover of American Vogue in March 2009</a>, she did it on condition that the choice of dress was hers, without input from the Vogue team, and that she used her own hair and makeup stylists, something the magazine had not agreed to before. Even the designer and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford\">Tom Ford</a>, renowned for his control freak tendencies, alluded to Obama\u2019s strictures in a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/tom-ford-designer-turned-director-925601\">recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>, when he related the experience of dressing the first lady for an audience with the Queen in 2011. \u201cDoing something like that is easy because you\u2019re dictated to,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018She needs to wear that colour, she has to have gloves, she doesn\u2019t like this, she doesn\u2019t like that.\u2019 It\u2019s pretty simple.\u201d</p> <p>Simple, but strategic. Obama\u2019s mastery of fashion is less about the clothes than about a modern woman\u2019s innate understanding that visual messaging is a crucial part of public life. As she <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/reviews-coverage/michelle-obama-style-social-media\">told American InStyle magazine</a> last month, \u201cWe can fool ourselves into thinking that everybody is still watching the evening news, but I live with Generation Z, and I know that their habits, the way they take in information, are so different\u2026 We\u2019ve got to meet our constituents where they are, and they\u2019re on Snapchat.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/add/michelleobama\">Obama has been on Snapchat since June</a>. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/06/21/michelle-obama-joins-snapchat-teases-upcoming-carpool-karaoke-ride/86191730/\">Her opening post</a>?

  "<p>If you have been around for a sufficient number of years to indulge in this experiment, compare yourself at 18 to yourself at the age of 34. Perhaps your ambitions and attitudes have changed over that time, and maybe your voting behavior has too.</p> <p>Contemplating the first 16 years of adulthood, leads to a pretty obvious question: how useful is the term \u201cmillennial\u201d anyway?

It\u2019s also because the defining trait of millennials (from a demographer\u2019s perspective at least) is diversity. For every 100 millennials, 44 are part of a minority race or ethnic group according to the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html\">Census Bureau</a>\u2019s latest figures. For every 100 Americans age 85 and over, just 11 aren\u2019t white. And, since race is one of the best predictors of voting intention in the US, it might make a lot more sense to slice up this demographic rather than treating it as one, uniform voting bloc.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But that\u2019s not how polling works. If you only have about a thousand people to try to predict national voting behavior, you can only interpret basic information. Imagine the alternative: if you used a survey to understand how 20-year-old, college-educated black women in America will vote, at best you\u2019d probably be anticipating the behavior of tens of thousands of women based on just one person\u2019s answer. Not great.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Once you average out all the nuanced differences between millennials, polling still reveals a difference between them and other age groups. According to <a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/#perceived-vote\">analysis</a> from the LA Times (which has its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/sep/28/donald-trump-poll-la-times-usc-clinton\">limitations</a>), Americans of all ages are more likely to think that Democrat Hillary Clinton will win this election than believe Donald Trump will (currently, 50% expect a Clinton win compared to 45% who think Trump will win). But those views are weakest among millennials \u2013 polling suggests this age group is almost evenly split over who they think will win.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/millennials-political-party/\" data-alt=\"Millennials largely identify as independents\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/millennials-political-party/\">Millennials largely identify as independents</a> <figcaption>Millennials largely identify as independents</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That could be because Americans aged 18 to 34 are more likely than older voters to consider a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-is-losing-some-millennial-voters-to-third-party-contenders/2016/09/18/952a1ac4-7c57-11e6-bd86-b7bbd53d2b5d_story.html\">third-party</a> alternative (many were forced to reconsider their options after their first-choice candidate, Democrat Bernie Sanders, dropped out of the presidential race). There\u2019s good news and bad news for Clinton.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The good news: because age groups are more evenly distributed across the country than racial groups, millennials might not be able to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/ohio-swing-state-republican-national-convention-clinton-trump\">swing</a> a bunch of states.<br></p> <p>But the bad news is that some millennials might be telling pollsters that they doubt a Democratic win because they don\u2019t quite tell the truth in other survey questions about how they\u2019ll vote or whether they\u2019ll vote. If young Americans don\u2019t feel comfortable telling a stranger that they want to vote for Trump or don\u2019t plan on voting at all, then Clinton could be in even deeper trouble in November than first appears.</p>",
  "<p>Soon after the Carrier Corporation announced in February that it planned to close its 1,400-employee plant here and move operations to Mexico, Donald Trump lashed out at the company for betraying the US and its workers.<br></p> <p>On Monday, he was at it again. Only five minutes into his first debate with rival Hillary Clinton, Trump had cited Carrier as an example of the \u201cjobs fleeing this country\u201d. \u201cSo many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this,\u201d he said in his latest attempt to blame trade deals for the US\u2019s industrial decline.<br></p> <p>Carrier, whose founder, Willis Carrier, invented the modern air conditioner, has been in Indiana since the 1950s.

But they will save the company a fortune. Most of its Indianapolis workers make about $26 an hour. Their Mexican replacements make $3 an hour.</p> <p> Unfortunately for Trump, notwithstanding his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-fec-financial-disclosure\">repeated attacks against Carrier</a> and the fact that his running mate Mike Pence is the state\u2019s governor, workers at the company\u2019s sprawling Indianapolis factory voice little support for the Republican nominee.

Staples has been hoping to buy a new house in a neighborhood with better schools, but the pending layoff could sabotage that plan. </p> <p> Chuck Jones, president of the steelworkers local here, was enraged by Carrier\u2019s decision, noting that Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, had record profits of $7.6bn last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we produced a bad product or the company wasn\u2019t profitable,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re greedy sons of bitches who want to make more money. They don\u2019t care a rat\u2019s ass about the 1,400 people they employ and don\u2019t care how their lives turn out.\u201d</p> <p> Jones said Local 1999\u2019s members weren\u2019t excited about the presidential candidates. \u201cSome people are going to support Trump because they want something different,\u201d he said. To many Carrier workers, Jones said, Trump\u2019s choice of Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, as his running mate was a strike against him. \u201cPence did nothing as governor to help the Carrier workers,\u201d Jones said. He noted that many workers further soured on Trump when his financial disclosure forms noted that he owned United Technologies stock.</p> <p> Inside Sully\u2019s, a popular bar across from the Carrier plant, David Parliament, a Carrier worker for three decades, said he favored Trump over Clinton because \u201che\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a businessman\u201d.

He was also an architect of Israel\u2019s undeclared nuclear programme and defence industries.</p> <p>While those in the west and within Israel have hailed Peres as a peacemaker, many Palestinians and those from Arab nations have questioned his record, citing his involvement in successive Arab-Israeli wars, the occupation of Palestinian territory and his support for settlement building before his work on Oslo.</p> <p>He was prime minister in 1996 when more than 100 civilians sheltering at a UN peacekeepers\u2019 base in the Lebanese village of Qana were killed when it was fired upon by Israel.</p> <p>Despite his reputation as a statesman, Peres never managed an outright win in a national election.

  "<p>For Afghan refugees such as me, we are now entering a perfect storm. Europe wants to make aid to our country contingent on its acceptance of at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/28/eu-secret-ultimatum-afghanistan-accept-80000-deportees-lose-aid-brussels-summit-migration-sensitive\" title=\"\">80,000 deported asylum seekers</a> who arrived on the continent last year. Simultaneously, Pakistan \u2013 the country that houses more expatriate Afghans than any other \u2013 plans to repatriate the 3 million Afghans who have sought refuge there since 1978. The former face reprisals from the extremists from whom they fled. The latter must head for a country where most of them have never even set foot.</p> <p>All this will create or worsen three separate crises. The European asylum system might have to bend its own rules to send people back to a war zone, which would set a bad example to other countries \u2013 not least Pakistan. It will also greatly affect refugees already in Europe \u2013 people in similar situations to me.</p> <p>I am an Afghan refugee living in the UK. Thankfully I am now a legal resident here \u2013 but if I were sent back to Afghanistan, I would risk being killed by the militias that forced me to flee in the first place. And then there are the Afghans currently in Pakistan. Tens of thousands of these people are second- or third-generation immigrants who were born and raised in Pakistan. These refugees made Pakistan their home, started businesses, went to college. For most of them, Afghanistan is a foreign country.</p> <p>It could also spark crisis in Afghanistan itself. The return of more than 3 million people would cause mayhem in an already fragile country. It would stretch limited resources, increase ethnic and religious tensions and exacerbate the violence that is already forcing many people from their homes. <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/the-problem-with-afghanistans-counterinsurgency/\" title=\"\">According to a recent report by the Afghan government\u2019s Independent Directorate of Local Governance</a>, over 50% of the country\u2019s 384 districts face some threat of violence.</p> <p>The return of millions more people can only make this situation worse \u2013 and cause yet another wave of refugees to flee their homes. In trying to contain one refugee crisis, Europe and Pakistan are about to create another. There are no quick fixes, and it is foolish to think otherwise.</p> <p>A bit of context: in historic terms, Afghanistan is the world\u2019s top exporter of refugees. Together, the communist revolution in 1978 and the Soviet invasion in 1979 sent 5 million refugees to Pakistan and 3 million to Iran. More followed during the civil wars between the extremist factions who defeated the Soviets. Then more fled the Taliban. And while the western invasion in 2001 may have ousted the Taliban from power, the conflict \u2013 and the migration \u2013 continues to this day. The US and UK armies gave Afghans little reason to stay, and neither has the new Kabul government.</p> <p>Many Afghans living in major cities would rather take a risky route to reach Europe than live with the economic uncertainty and the security threats. And if you live in a rural area \u2013 like nearly 70% of the Afghan population \u2013 you might prefer to leave than be recruited into the ranks of the Taliban, al-Qaida, or Islamic State.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many believe the 2014 presidential election was rigged and that the government is incapable of responding to their basic needs. The rivalry between the president, Ashraf Ghani, and his chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, has made things harder \u2013 the two have been squabbling since beginning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/ashraf-ghani-visit-pakistan-afghanistan\" title=\"\">a power-sharing exercise</a> in November 2014. All the while, political polarisation is on the rise due to ethnocentric agendas within the Afghan government.</p> <p>The west\u2019s response has been to throw aid money at the government. The UK remains one of the largest aid donors, giving \u00a3178m per year. But this is wasted money. As David Cameron himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/10/david-cameron-afghanistan-nigeria-possibly-most-corrupt-countries\" title=\"\">said during an anti-corruption summit</a>, the Kabul administration is \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d. It so far has no proper strategy for re-assimilating such a large number of refugees, nor the funding to make it possible. This makes it very hard for any repatriation plan to be successful.</p> <p>There is little hope that the government in Kabul can care for the existing residents of Afghanistan \u2013 let alone another 3 million with no shelter and food. The plan to return 80,000 Afghans from Europe \u2013 as well as millions from Pakistan \u2013 is dangerous and misguided.</p>",

There was no broadening his appeal, no toning it down, no presidential affect, no pitch to the swinging centre.</p> <p>An audience of millions erupted on social media in howls of acclamation and derision, like there was nothing more at stake than a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji.

I harbour a modest hope that, periodically at least, he will agree with himself.</p> <p>I understand there is a more complex dynamic in play presently than a weakened prime minister performing a grim liturgical dance for the gratification of people with the power to move against him. At the broader strategic level, there is clearly an element of circling the wagons going on. Turnbull is trying to keep his fractious troops together when in practice the Coalition in 2016 is a conservative party with Hansonesque leanings and a centrist liberal party.</p> <p>Most days, in abundant ways, we see how hard it is to synthesise those differences. In attempting to rally and bind his troops, perhaps our individualist prime minister has become a tribalist, after all.</p> <p>Bubbles really can\u2019t be avoided in modern politics. Depressingly, it is the way of things. The prime minister has to develop the trick of subsistence in the bubble, but he also has to puncture it, forcefully when necessary, both to avoid slow suffocation and as a gesture of recognition \u2013 because outside the cloisters the Australian people are watching and hoping that someone in major party politics can rise above the aggressive insularity and the brinkmanship, give them the courtesy of a genuine conversation, and face up to the challenges of the moment.</p>",

Editorial boards tend to have durable leanings which undermine their persuasive power over partisan politics. Conservative editorial boards usually endorse Republican candidates, liberal ones endorse Democrats, and only in man-bites-dog scenarios, in which they depart from their own in-house orthodoxies, do any minds stand to get changed.</p> <p>Man is biting dog now, but it is a tiny, shrunken man and the dog is rabid and enormous.</p> <p>It is partly a failure of today\u2019s media that the public views Clinton only slightly less unfavorably than it views Trump, and sees her as far more dishonest than he. But it is also a failure that goes back a quarter-century. Clinton is flawed in plenty of real ways, but she is also the victim of a hate debt that began piling up in the 1990s, undisrupted by most conservative public figures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed2147e4b07f65489d8331\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T14:17:22.754Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Detroit News endorses Gary Johnson</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For the first time in its 143-year history, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/09/28/endorse-johnson-president/91254412/\">the Detroit News is backing a non-Republican</a>, endorsing Gary Johnson for president in an editorial published today.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since its founding in 1873, The Detroit News has backed a Republican every time it has made a presidential endorsement (three times we have sat on the sidelines \u2014 twice during the Franklin Roosevelt elections and in the 2004 Bush/Kerry contest).</p> <p>We abandon that long and estimable tradition this year for one reason: Donald J.

  "<p>Like most middle-class white liberals, I am concerned with the issue of racial inequality, but tend to assuage my feelings of anger, guilt and impotence with the sentiment that things are getting better. I mean, we have a two-term black president, right? Ava DuVernay\u2019s documentary 13th is an articulate, no-nonsense cup of iced water splashed in my face telling me to wake the fuck up.</p> <p>\u201cPrisons are the new plantations!\u201d may seem like sloganeering from a far-left protestor, but DuVernay\u2019s effective film draws a strong, straight line from the abolition of slavery to today\u2019s mass incarceration epidemic, explaining its root cause: money. Cheap prison labour is knotted up in the US economy in many unexpected ways, and the system is designed to get black men into jails early and often.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V66F3WU2CKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I can hear your conservative uncle interjecting already, but 13th \u2013 named for the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery but restricted rights of those deemed \u201ccriminals\u201d \u2013 is remarkable in the way it takes its time to connect the dots and make its bold thesis. No, no one is saying we should free perpetrators of violent crime. But the numbers don\u2019t lie: beginning in the 1970s with Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign promise of \u201claw and order\u201d, prison populations exploded and continue to grow. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if people suddenly decided to commit a greater number of low-level crimes; there was (and is) a concerted effort to entrap disenfranchised African-American communities with mandatory minimums, plea-bargaining arrangements, different sentences between crack and powder cocaine, programmes like three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/nypd-stop-and-frisk-racial-profiling-guidelines\">stop-and-frisk</a>. No one said \u201cWe once benefited from free black labour under slavery and we shall do so again with our prisons\u201d, but 13th shows how institutions lurch forward thanks to apathy, inertia and the inability to fight back. Did you know that most prisoners aren\u2019t allowed to vote once they are released? Or just how hard it is to find employment if you answer \u201cyes\u201d to the job interview question about previous convictions? I feel that if more people knew this they\u2019d start to realise just how difficult it is to break cycles of imbalance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1ef55679ac82462d636e444c013a03863100dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ef55679ac82462d636e444c013a03863100dc7/0_22_1727_1036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newt Gingrich in The 13th.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Surprisingly forward-thinking\u2019 \u2026 Newt Gingrich in The 13th.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 13th makes its case with alacrity, clarity and a dash of pizazz. DuVernay mixes news footage, stats-laden graphics and a recurring visual highlight of the word \u201ccriminal\u201d whenever someone uses it to make suppositions about black people. There are talking-head interviews with scholars and journalists, some better known than others, as well as politicians. These clips are shot in a straightforward manner, though I suspect DuVernay had a hard time not going the extra mile to make sure Angela Davis got special treatment. She\u2019s interviewed in what looks like the interior of a derelict courthouse, wearing a billowy mustard-yellow scarf. A well-known <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HnDONDvJVE\">older clip of her discussing violence</a> is also included, to great effect.<br></p> <p>The biggest and most welcome shock comes from Newt Gingrich, who is surprisingly forward-thinking, inasmuch as he suggests no white person could ever understand what it is like to be black in America. Bill and Hillary Clinton come under a degree of fire, as much of the mass incarceration initiated by Reagan grew during the 1990s. The Democrats\u2019 current presidential candidate\u2019s use of the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/25/hillary-clinton-race-crime-justice-reform\">super-predator</a>\u201d is analysed and, while she doesn\u2019t come off as badly as some others, it\u2019s hardly a good look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa4582c730e3d08daf255359560bc6f32cf3f938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa4582c730e3d08daf255359560bc6f32cf3f938/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Louis Gates in The 13th.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Louis Gates in The 13th.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of DuVernay\u2019s most effective sequences, however, is saved for Donald Trump, whose campaign speeches are juxtaposed with brutal clips from the civil rights era. Simpering remarks from his hate rallies about \u201cthe good old days\u201d are set against classic images from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/28/usa-barack-obama-race\">Little Rock</a> as well as violence towards minority protesters by his acolytes. These scenes make 13th one of the most effective horror movies in years. Lucky, then, that the film is being released on Netflix, as viewers may need to hit pause and find a bucket into which to vomit.</p> <p>Not every talking point snaps together so nicely, though. A stretch explaining the curious corporate/lawmaker glad-handing club Alec (American Legislative Exchange Council), while certainly alarming, begins to stink a bit of dorm-room weed. I remain unconvinced that Walmart, evil on its own terms, really wanted George Zimmerman to gun down <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>, even if its business model does capitalise on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/stand-your-ground-florida-police-shooting-jermaine-mcbean-peter-peraza\">stand your ground</a> laws.</p> <p>A few small hiccups aside, 13th is very much not a Michael Moore film. It is organised, detailed and powerful. It is also bleak as hell, and, unfortunately, does not conclude with advice on what to do next. I think, though, the first step is obvious: clear one hour and 40 minutes of your time, turn off your damn phone, watch this movie, then tell others to do so. It\u2019s a start.</p>"
