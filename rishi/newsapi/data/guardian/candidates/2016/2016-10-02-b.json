  "<p>Rudy Giuliani on Sunday defended Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage, saying \u201ceverybody\u201d has faced charges of infidelity. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-alicia-machado-republican-women-sexism\">The Republican women unfazed by Trump's sexism: 'I don\u2019t think it matters'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fair game,\u201d the top Trump adviser and former New York mayor said. </p> <p>On Saturday night, Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania that he doubted the constancy of the Clintons\u2019 marriage, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t even think she\u2019s loyal to Bill, you want to know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>He then asked the crowd: \u201cAnd, really, folks, really, why should she be, right?\u201d</p> <p>The baseless accusation, which Trump raised in the context of Bill Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/us/politics/gennifer-flowers-debate-trump-clinton.html\">admissions</a> of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/18/us/testing-president-overview-clinton-admits-lewinsky-liaison-jury-tells-nation-it.html\">infidelities</a> in the 1990s, was defended by Giuliani. </p> <p>\u201cThat was a sarcastic remark pointing out that Bill Clinton has, you know, quite a past,\u201d Giuliani told CNN. \u201cAnd Hillary Clinton has done quite a job on attacking the people who were victims of Bill Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton stood with her husband in the 1990s through two scandals, during which the president eventually admitted to sexual liaisons with Gennifer Flowers, a former model, and Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. The then first lady called Lewinsky a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/90s-scandals-threaten-to-erode-hillary-clintons-strength-with-women.html\">narcissistic loony toon</a>\u201d, according to a friend, Diane Blair, whose diaries were released after her death in 2000. Clinton <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/02/10/hillary-clinton-monica-lewinsky-is-a-narcissistic-loony-toon/\">also refused to excuse the \u201chuge personal lapse\u201d</a> by her husband, Blair wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fair game,\u201d Giuliani insisted, accusing Clinton of \u201cposing as a feminist\u201d, although he did not dispute that there are no grounds for Trump\u2019s aspersion about the Clinton\u2019s marriage. Trump, he said, had in fact been talking about donations by Middle East regimes to the Clinton family charity. </p> <p>In his speech on Saturday night, Trump said: \u201cClinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries.\u201d He did not, however, mention the Clinton Foundation in context of the Clinton marriage.</p> <p>Giuliani was also forced to defend one of his own remarks. After the first presidential debate on Monday, after which Trump praised himself for not having broached the topic of the Clintons\u2019 marriage, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/rudy-giuliani-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-monica-lewinsky/\">Giuliani said</a>: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know the moment Monica Lewinsky said Bill Clinton violated her and was telling the truth \u2013 then you\u2019re too stupid to be president.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, NBC host Chuck Todd pressed Giuliani, who in 2000 announced he was <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/scandals/rudy-giuliani-2012-4/\">leaving his second wife for his future third wife</a> in a press conference, without having told his current spouse in advance. Todd said: \u201cYou have your own infidelity charge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, everybody does,\u201d Giuliani replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Roman Catholic, and I confess those things to my priest. But I\u2019ve never, ever attacked someone who\u2019s been the victim.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think your bringing up my personal life really is kind of irrelevant to what Hillary Clinton did. She\u2019s running for president; I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani also held that he was \u201cthe right person to level this charge, because I\u2019ve never made such a charge, and I\u2019ve prosecuted people who\u2019ve committed rape\u201d.</p> <p>Trump, whose own history includes three marriages and <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/marla-maples-hopes-ivana-trump-can-forgive-her-postdonald-trump-affair-scandal\">tabloid sagas of infidelity</a>, has struggled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">throughout his campaign</a> with references to his long history of<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\"> crude behavior and </a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">objectifying</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\"> insults</a> directed at women. </p> <p>In the week after the first presidential debate, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">repeatedly insulted </a>a former Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, whom he called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d in the 1990s.

In truth, if \u201csoft\u201d Brexit is defined as continued membership of the single market, then the fact that May is heading for a hard version is not a great surprise. She has been dropping hints about controlling immigration taking priority over single market access ever since the Conservative leadership contest. But, gradually, the contours of the Brexit deal likely to emerge are coming into sharper focus. <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>, the president of the European Council, has welcomed her timetable announcement.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/782577278882553856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PM May&#39;s declaration brings welcome clarity on start of Brexit talks.

Did you hear Mr Corbyn last week, telling us all there\u2019s no need for any limit on numbers? Have you ever heard a political party quite so out of touch with its own voters? Let us be clear, we will control our own borders and we will bring the numbers down.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The CBI has urged the government to give more clarity about what Brexit will mean.

So, for example, EU regulations on agriculture frequently refer to the powers of the European Commission. These would have to be reviewed and replaced before Brexit took effect. Much of this is technical stuff \u2013 important to those affected and requiring political judgments, but not of fundamental policy importance.

For example, there is no such thing as a choice between \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This line of argument \u2013 in which \u201csoft Brexit\u201d amounts to some form of continued EU membership and \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a conscious decision to reject trade with Europe \u2013 is simply a false dichotomy. And it is one that is too often propagated by people who, I am afraid to say, have still not accepted the result of the referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>But May defined \u201chard\u201d Brexit as the rejection of trade with Europe. In reality, though, \u201chard\u201d Brexit is generally taken to mean a Brexit that puts an emphasis on independence, and rejects EEA (Norway) or EFTA (Switzerland) arrangements that involve retaining a measure of pooled sovereignty. May made it clear that this was exactly what she was proposing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we are now talking about is very different. Whether people like it or not, the country voted to leave the EU. And that means we are going to leave the EU ...</p> <p>So the process we are about to begin is not about negotiating all of our sovereignty away again. It is not going to be about any of those matters over which the country has just voted to regain control. It is not, therefore, a negotiation to establish a relationship anything like the one we have had for the last forty years or more. So it is not going to a \u201cNorway model\u201d. It\u2019s not going to be a \u201cSwitzerland model\u201d. It is going to be an agreement between an independent, sovereign United Kingdom and the European Union. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May made it clear that, although she wanted companies to have \u201cthe maximum freedom\u201d to trade with the single market, she would not accept any deal that involved the UK having to accept European court of justice rulings or EU free movement laws.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want it to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market \u2013 and let European businesses do the same here. But let me be clear. We are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again. And we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that workers\u2019 rights would continue to be protected as long as she remained prime minister.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert the \u2018acquis\u2019 \u2013 that is, the body of existing EU law \u2013 into British law. When the great repeal Bill is given royal assent, parliament will be free \u2013 subject to international agreements and treaties with other countries and the EU on matters such as trade \u2013 to amend, repeal and improve any law it chooses ... Any changes in the law will have to be subject to full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate. And let me be absolutely clear: existing workers\u2019 legal rights will continue to be guaranteed in law \u2013 and they will be guaranteed as long as I am prime minister. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the government would invoke article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process, \u201csoon\u201d and before the end of March.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was right to wait before triggering article 50. But it is also right that we should not let things drag on too long. Having voted to leave, I know that the public will soon expect to see, on the horizon, the point at which Britain does formally leave the European Union. So let me be absolutely clear. There will be no unnecessary delays in invoking article 50. We will invoke it when we are ready. And we will be ready soon. We will invoke article 50 no later than the end of March next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is marginally more specific than what May said on the Andrew Marr Show this morning; this morning it was just \u201cbefore the end of March\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Scotland would not have a veto on Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are the responsibility of the government and nobody else ... Because we voted in the referendum as one United Kingdom, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, and we will leave the European Union as one United Kingdom. There is no opt-out from Brexit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She implied that she would block further attempts to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will never allow divisive nationalists to undermine the precious Union between the four nations of our United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected the argument that parliament should take the decision to trigger article 50. </strong>The government is being taken to court over this point, but May said Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, would be in court himself to argue the government\u2019s case. (The attorney general is the government\u2019s chief legal adviser, but it is unusual for him to appear in court in person on behalf of the executive.) She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it legislated to establish the referendum, Parliament put the decision to leave or remain inside the EU in the hands of the people. And the people gave their answer with emphatic clarity. So now it is up to the Government not to question, quibble or backslide on what we have been instructed to do, but to get on with the job. </p> <p>Because those people who argue that Article Fifty can only be triggered after agreement in both houses of parliament are not standing up for democracy, they\u2019re trying to subvert it. They\u2019re not trying to get Brexit right, they\u2019re trying to kill it by delaying it. They are insulting the intelligence of the British people. That is why, next week, I can tell you that the attorney general himself, Jeremy Wright, will act for the government and resist them in the courts.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted a future in which \u201cBritain is always the most passionate, most consistent, most convincing advocate for free trade\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She condemned those politicians (like Labour\u2019s Owen Smith and the Liberal Democrats) who are arguing for a second referendum.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because even now, some politicians \u2013 democratically-elected politicians \u2013 say that the referendum isn\u2019t valid, that we need to have a second vote.</p> <p>Others say they don\u2019t like the result, and they\u2019ll challenge any attempt to leave the European Union through the courts.</p> <p>But come on. The referendum result was clear. It was legitimate. It was the biggest vote for change this country has ever known. Brexit means Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make a success of it.</p> <p>The final sentence is one that May repeated continually over the summer. She used it again this afternoon with the familiarity of a comedian using a favoured catchphrase.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She reaffirmed her intention not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the Brexit talks.</strong> She implied that speculative media stories about the UK\u2019s negotiating position could harm the national interest.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we will not be able to give a running commentary or a blow-by-blow account of the negotiations. Because we all know that isn\u2019t how they work. But history is littered with negotiations that failed when the interlocutors predicted the outcome in detail and in advance. </p> <p>Every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She praised David Cameron for being willing to \u201cput his trust in the British people\u201d.</strong> May said that was her answer to those who said Cameron made a mistake when he called the referendum.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11c78e4b05962fdf4a25b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:41:17.368Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says if the UK wants to be treated with good will in the Brexit negotiations, it needs to act with good will too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b8be4b015be6383365c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:37:37.333Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says he is \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d the government will get a deal that allows EU citizens to remain in the UK.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b34e4b015be63833659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:35:58.135Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Davis says the UK does not want the EU to fail.

After Theresa May told Andrew Marr that she would invoke article 50, starting the formal two-year EU withdrawal process by the end of March, we now have a government commitment to a timetable. The UK has six months at most before article 50 tips us down the slipway towards leaving the EU. In theory at least, once the article 50 letter has arrived in Brussels there is no going back.</p> <p>This is a more important announcement than the overnight one about the \u201cgreat repeal\u2019 bill. It was inevitable that leaving the EU would involve repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, and the press statement from the Tories about the bill said relatively little about what this legislation would look like. But by announcing that she will trigger article 50 before the end of March, May will firmly quash the speculation that has been bouncing around Westminster about the EU withdrawal process being delayed for a year, or even more.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end of March\u201d sounds quite soon, but arguably May is announcing a one-month delay. In public, until now, all she had said was that article 50 would not be invoked this year. But in private she has been telling EU leaders it would be triggered early next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/theresa-may-likely-trigger-article-50-brexit-talks-early-2017\">Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said after a recent meeting with May that he expected the article 50 declaration in January or February.</a></p> <p>Article 50 was easily the key story in the interview, but other bits were interesting too. In particular, May sounded less evangelical about grammar schools than she has done in the past. She preferred to describe the policy in terms of extending selection, and she was very keen to stress that this was only one aspect of a policy document intended to improve standards for everyone.</p> <p>I will post a summary with the main quotes soon, as well as rounding up some reaction.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:33:18.705Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f0cc4de4b015be638334ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:04:04.492Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Are you trying to restore cabinet government?</em></p> <p>May say she wants to ensure ministers are involved as policy develops.</p> <p><em>Q: Was government too informal under Cameron?</em></p> <p>May says the last government achieved a great deal.

This isn\u2019t about political games, it\u2019s about what is right for the country. I think an early general election would introduce a note of instability for people.</p> </blockquote> <p>May has ruled out a \u201csnap\u201d election before, and argued that there is \u201cno need\u201d for an election before 2020. But if May is now saying an early election would introduce \u201cinstability\u201d, then it would be harder for her to justify changing her mind on why there might be a need for a pre-2020 poll.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She hinted that she would not wait until the German elections in September 2017 to trigger article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process.</strong> Number 10 has signalled that it will be triggered early next year, probably in January or February.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the Tories wanted to build \u201ca new centre ground\u201d and that she wanted to appeal to people who had not backed the party before. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there will be many people who have not been traditional Conservative voters who will see we\u2019re the party that is actually respecting their views, listening to their concerns and responding to them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she thought government should be \u201csmall, strong and strategic\u201d. </strong>Asked her view on government intervention in the economy, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in that position of thinking that all government is somehow bad. Government is good. But it\u2019s important that government is small, strong and strategic.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She denied having Margaret Thatcher as a role model.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t had a role model in my political career and I\u2019m not somebody who says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be like X\u2019. I just look at the issues that I\u2019m faced with and get on and do what I believe to be the right thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that, unlike David Cameron, she stayed up late to do her prime ministerial paperwork. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m an owl rather than a lark, so I will tend to work late. I carry on working and do the boxes that I have.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shipman says it is not unusual for May to finish working at 2am. Cameron preferred to get up at 5.45am to get through his ministerial red box.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She took a swipe at Jamie Oliver.</strong> May loves cooking, but not necessarily Oliver, Shipman suggests. He writes:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her approach to the kitchen is as averse to gimmicks and quick fixes as her politics. I suggest that, with time tight, she might make use of Jamie Oliver\u2019s book Jamie\u2019s 15-Minute Meals. \u201cYes, 15-minute meals with 45 minutes of preparation,\u201d she said wryly, followed by a quick \u201csorry\u201d as she realises she is traducing a national treasure.</p> </blockquote> <p>Towards the end of the interview Shipman also includes this unusual, and possibly quite telling, anecdote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a world that has often portrayed her as humourless but the tape of our conversation is punctuated by laughter. The transcription service sent it back with a note saying: \u201cTheresa May is a very nice woman and the transcriber thoroughly enjoyed listening to her.\u201d No one has sent such a message to me about a politician before.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03c29e4b015be6383332b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T08:02:58.172Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory conference policy announcements</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Conservative conference policy announcements from yesterday.</p> <p>I will be updating the list as new policy announcements get made.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">Matthew Taylor, head of the RSA thinktank and former head of the Number 10 policy unit under Tony Blair, appointed to lead an independent review of employment practices in the modern economy.</a></strong> Announcing the move, Tory HQ said: \u201cSignalling the importance she attaches to extending workers\u2019 rights - and ensuring they keep pace with these developments - the prime minister today launches an independent review of modern employment practices.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/dwp-scraps-retesting-for-chronically-ill-sickness-benefits-claimants\">People with the most severe health conditions who receive employment support allowance, a disability benefit, to be exempt from having to undergo regular health assessments to continue receiving payments.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-plans-to-make-the-uk-one-of-the-most-digitally-skilled-nations\">Free training to be offered to adults who lack basic digital skills.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/220-million-for-cutting-edge-new-technology\"><strong>A \u00a3220m investment to help life science companies and universities develop viable business projects.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/building-to-start-on-new-nuclear-submarines-as-government-announces-13-billion-investment\">A \u00a31.3bn investment with BAE Systems to enable construction work to begin on the generation of submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles.</a></strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T07:42:02.312Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May became prime minister this summer with voters having only a relatively hazy view as to what her views are. She had been home secretary for six years but she is something of a political introvert and as a cabinet minister she only gave speeches addressing matters outside her home office brief on perhaps two or three occasions. During the Conservative leadership contest she was all set to elaborate on her thinking during the final stage of the contest. But then Andrea Leadsom pulled out, with the result that only one of the series of speeches May was planning,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf#block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf\"> the Birmingham economy speech,</a> actually got delivered.</p> <p>So that is one reason why this promises to be more interesting than the average Conservative party conference. Normally, if the party leader is prime minister, we already know quite a lot about them. This week, and particularly in her keynote speech on Wednesday, May has the chance to flesh out her politics and to present herself to the country she runs in a sharper focus.</p> <p>But there is second issue that will dominate proceedings too: Brexit. Over the summer ministers have said very little about how they will proceed with the EU withdrawal talks, beyond the vacuous and tautologicial \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. This week, and particularly this afternoon, when the conference holds a session on Brexit, May and her team are going to have to say a little more. Equally importantly, conference fringe meetings on the subject are going to give members and MPs the chance to set out what their Brexit demands are.<br></p> <p>Overnight May has announced that Brexit will involve a \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill. Here is the our story on this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">Theresa May to propose 'great repeal' bill to unwind EU laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>May and the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a>, will use the opening day of the conference to detail plans for their \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill that will allow Britain to \u201ctake back control\u201d of its legislation. The bill will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which gives direct effect to all EU law, and at the same time convert Brussels regulations into domestic law. </p> <p>This will give parliament the power to unpick the laws it wants to keep, remove or amend at a later date, in a move that could be welcomed by MPs who are keen to have a say over the terms of Brexit. The move is also designed to give certainty to businesses and protection for workers\u2019 rights that are enshrined in EU law.</p> <p>Davis will say: \u201cTo those who are trying to frighten British workers, saying, \u2018When we leave, employment rights will be eroded\u2019, I say firmly and unequivocally, \u2018No, they won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9am: </em>Theresa May is interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show.

Its economy is struggling, it is not getting the incomes it would have expected and yet it behaves like a much bigger country than Britain.</p> <p>\u201cIt swaggers its way around. The way it is currently operating in the Ukraine, the way it is threatening in the Baltic states and in Syria would be almost unimaginable a few years ago. What Russia is demonstrating is that they are able, like Iran, to do very, very strange things.\u201d</p> <p>He also admitted that Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, had been saved by Russian military intervention. \u201cAssad was in very real problems two years ago. The likelihood is that he would have lost Aleppo, most of the south and probably Homs as well if Russia had not intervened. Russia has been decisive in that intervention.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the west was in a double bind. He said: \u201cAssad has done genuinely terrible things and it is almost unimaginable that there will be peace in Syria so long as that guy is around, partly because it is in his interests to keep disorder. It is in his interests for terrorists to be there because terrorists are his legitimating principle. It is the way he gets support; to say there are terrorists out there.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cOn the other hand, what are the options facing President Obama? Setting aside the fact there are only nine weeks to go for this administration \u2026 it is pretty difficult for poor old Kerry and Obama to make a strong decisive act at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe model of successfully taking on a Russian-backed central government from the point of view of an opposition was only pulled off by the US once and that was in Afghanistan in 1981-89. But \u2013 there is a big but \u2013 because the success of the opposition to Russia led to the catastrophe of Afghanistan from 1991-2000, you end up funding, if you are not careful, opposition groups that are much more radical than you want them to be and actually when the government collapses it leads to a civil war and the situation comes become worse on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>He said the task was to bring some structure of global order and security back into place, partly by investing in the idea of the United Nations. But, he added: \u201cMy God, that organisation needs reform.

May earlier announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 \u2013 the legal device to begin the process of departure \u2013 would be triggered by the end of March</a>.</p> <p>Some traders fear the prime minister\u2019s moves might lead to a swift fall in the value of pound, mirroring the markets\u2019 reaction immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">sterling slumped to a 31-year low</a>.</p> <p>One trader said that financial markets had not taken account of a \u201ctimetabled hard Brexit\u201d when markets closed on Friday evening, meaning the pound could \u201cgap lower\u201d on Monday.</p> <p>However, others argued that the triggering of article 50 in early 2017 was expected, but the debate about what that move would mean would create uncertainty. <br></p> <p>Joshua Raymond, a director at financial trading firm XTB, said he expected volatility in the value of the pound, with both sides of the Brexit argument using the media to sway public opinion to their side of the argument. He believes that the government had hedged its bets by also implying a soft Brexit.<br></p> <p>He said that the prime minister\u2019s indication that the UK would enact article 50 before the end of March could actually be supportive of the pound in the very short term \u201cbecause of the certainty it provides investors and businesses that the roadmap to Brexit has begun\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cHowever, the main support could come from recent comments from both the prime minister and chancellor, who spoke out against the idea of a hard Brexit to end freedom of movement. That leaves the door open for positive conversations about remaining in the single market, which is the markets key area of concern\u201d.</p> <p>The wavering over what Brexit eventually means comes as traders also try to take stock of how prices might be affected by a host of geopolitical issues, such as the increasingly bitter US presidential election.</p> <p>Alastair Winter, the chief economist at the investment bank Daniel Stewart, wrote in a research note on Sunday: \u201cBarclays Bank\u2019s latest survey shows geopolitical developments to have become the biggest concern to investors. Moreover, concern over the developed market economies (i.e. democracies) continues to overshadow those over China and other emerging markets. This suggests rising fears that the \u2018sans culottes\u2019 with their pitchforks will yet storm the great citadels of the west.</p> <p>\u201cIn summary, the political fundamentals are bad enough but may not get much worse soon. Of course ... the economic fundamentals also look grim.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by 6% in the July-September quarter, its best performance since 2013, as the weaker pound pushed up the value of internationally focused blue-chip companies. Sterling, though, fell against the US dollar for the fifth quarter running \u2013 the worst run since 1984.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">What will happen now timescale for article 50 has been revealed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>James Stanley, a currency analyst at foreign exchange group DailyFX, also believes the fourth quarter will be challenging.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some very pertinent themes for markets as we enter the final quarter of 2016,\u201d he said, referring the US election and concerns about the health of European banks following last week\u2019s gyrations in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\">Deutsche Bank</a> share price.

The bigger concern is a contagion effect; because banks trade with each other and if one major bank gets taken out, this can create a nasty cascade effect across markets as other banks get pinched by counterparty risk. </p> <p>\u201cSo going into Q4 this is the top theme for markets to watch because, frankly, it can have the most firepower. It\u2019s also going to be one of the most difficult to time and follow, as this is basically a liquid situation that will continue to morph and develop as there isn\u2019t a template-response for the European Central Bank to handle such situations.\u201d</p>",

Sports fans, whether we love golf or hate it, should recognise the huge service this tournament has done for English, and British, sport \u2013 a service that gives the lie to all those who, jumping on the back of the Sam Allardyce affair, have accused our national games of still being imbued with, or even governed by, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/britain-sporting-virtue-sam-allardyce-fair-play\" title=\"\">Rule Britannia spirit</a>.</p> <p>Talking of Big Sam is a reminder of golf\u2019s strange attraction to pro footballers. Indeed, golf often seems to be football in disguise, with the papers appearing to have more photos of footballers on the fairway than in the penalty area. (What do golfers do in their downtime? Play football.) And when I was growing up, in the 70s, acquiring a rudimentary sense of history, it was our footballers who gave me the belief that we \u2013 that is, England \u2013 were the best in the world.</p> <p>After all, we invented the game. We had recently won the World Cup (1966). We had more recently been stopped from winning the World Cup by having our<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/09/world-cup-stunning-moments-gordon-banks-england-1970\" title=\"\"> ace goalkeeper poisoned</a> (1970). And so on the evening of 29 April 1972, as England faced West Germany at Wembley (in an excitingly rare televised game) I recall to this day being 100% certain that the result would be a royally enjoyable England win, especially as our ace goalkeeper was now safe from dodgy foreign grub.</p> <p>Like I said, my grasp of history was rudimentary. Forget the grub: England were <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gubbed\" title=\"\">gubbed</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/englandfootball/story/0,9565,541541,00.html\" title=\"\">Hugh McIlvanney wrote</a> in the following day\u2019s Observer: \u201cNo Englishman can ever again warm himself with the old assumption that, on the football field if nowhere else, the Germans are an inferior race.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How did the sport of rightwing suburbia react in the era of Europe-bashing Thatcherism?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, a sport-mad patriotic teenager had other sports to warm him in that decade. Cricket: regular drubbings at the hands of Lillee, Thompson and any number of fabulous West Indies players. The Olympics: a world-beating 13th place in the 1976 medal table. Rugby union: just ask any Welsh supporter (or Scottish, or Irish, or French).</p> <p>So the notion that the mother country was a paragon of sporting virtue was crumbling long before the Tories had sold off one school playing field. But what gave it the coup de grace was good old golf and its three-day leisure convention we call the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>The tournament, set up by the <a href=\"http://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/content/herts-history/people/sportspeople/samuel-ryder\" title=\"\">St Albans seed merchant Sam Ryder in the 1920s</a>, had not been going well for the Britain and Ireland team. By 1979, our sorry record read: won three, lost 22 (one tie). The Americans were losing interest.</p> <p>So how did the sport of rightwing suburbia react in the era of Europe-bashing Thatcherism? It invited Europe on board. Out with lose Britannia, in with rule Europa.</p> <p>Since the golfers started looking outwards, things have looked up: the European record since 1979 reads: won eight, lost seven (one tied).</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just this achievement for which I doff my cap to the game of golf. It\u2019s also the example it has set to our other great sports.

British rugby union has embraced the southern hemisphere, and even France.

New Jersey governor Chris Christie told Fox News Sunday the story was \u201cvery good\u201d for the candidate as it showed \u201cthe genius of Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told CNN: \u201cWell all I have is the New York Times story to go on, so let\u2019s comment on it as if it were true.

His obligation is to make money for his enterprises and save money for his enterprises. It would be insane for him not to take advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in support of Clinton, Sanders told ABC: \u201cIf everyone in this country was a genius like Mr Trump and did not pay taxes, we would not have a country.</p> <p>\u201cThis is exactly why so many millions of Americans are frustrated,\u201d he added to CNN. \u201cThey are angry, they are disgusted at what they see as a corrupt political system in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/640281925270286336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> a long history of criticizing people who do not pay taxes</a>, such as tweet from September 2015 in which he said: \u201cThe hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, Sanders said: \u201cYou have middle class people working longer hours for low wages, they pay their taxes. They support their schools, they support their infrastructure, they support the military, but the billionaires, no, they don\u2019t have to do that because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes. </p> <p>\u201cSo Trump goes around and says: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m worth billions, I\u2019m a successful business man, but I don\u2019t pay any taxes, but you, you who earn 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes.\u2019 That\u2019s why people are angry and want real change in this country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/782541307168391168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/failing?src=hash\">#failing</a>@nytimes</p>&mdash; Donald J.

  "<p>Amid all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-new-york-times\">the drama and hyberbole</a>, it slipped by almost without being noticed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-new-york-times\">Trump responds to tax 'bombshell': 'I know complex laws better than anyone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early in the first presidential debate last Monday, Hillary Clinton said: \u201cI also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\u201d</p> <p>This might have ended up as a throwaway line, but it\u2019s a key part of Clinton\u2019s emphasis on trying to create an economy that works for everyone. It also could end up as a key part of her appeal to voters, especially in light of the news flow of late.</p> <p>Exhibit one: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/wells-fargo-investigations-lawsuits-john-stumpf\">Wells Fargo</a>, which doesn\u2019t seem to think too highly of sharing the profits. Instead, as a torrent of recent news has shown, the bank has tended to demand that rank-and-file employees meet impossible sales targets or risk losing their jobs. </p> <p>As long as that worked, those top-tier managers walked away with lavish compensation packages; CEO John Stumpf made $19.5m last year. True, the bank now (finally) will claw much of that back, but none of the ordinary bankers, who took on most of the risk, shared any of the rewards.</p> <p>Exhibit two: Hamilton, the musical. When it shifted from New York\u2019s Public Theater to Broadway, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-hamilton-broadway-profit/\">22 of its stars penned a letter to its lead producer</a>, Jeffrey Seller, aka the CEO of \u201cHamilton Inc\u201d. They wanted \u2013 and got \u2013 a share of the profits the show will earn: 1% of net profits plus a slightly smaller proportion of those from every future production, including the one that just opened in Chicago. </p> <p>Those actors invested their creative energy and took risks every night to make the show the slam dunk success it has been and Sellers recognized that with a share of the rewards. </p> <p> There are two reasons why profit-sharing plans (and variations on this theme) are creeping back into the public discussion. </p> <p> First, there\u2019s the big picture. Since the economy began to recover from the financial crisis and the recession, the lion\u2019s share of the gains have gone not to those who simply collected wages and salaries \u2013 which largely have seen very little change \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/10/11/5-Years-After-Crisis-Why-Income-Gap-Widening\">to those who owned financial assets</a>, such as stocks and bonds. If you had a big investment portfolio in 2009, and simply hung on to it, you probably have done very, very well in the last seven years or so: the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index has risen 105%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has soared 150%. </p> <p> No prizes for guessing which part of the population is most likely to own investment portfolios.</p> <p> Secondly, as the wealth gap has grown, the gap between average CEO compensation and average worker salary has widened. Behavioral economists say that, unsurprisingly, this takes a toll on employee morale and can even dent productivity. Not surprisingly, headlines about CEOs receiving lavish paychecks and other perks when their employees struggle to eke out a living don\u2019t make for great corporate PR. </p> <p> Profit-sharing plans \u2013 which mark their centenary this year \u2013 can help address both of these problems. In many key respects, today\u2019s plans don\u2019t differ too much from the first deferred profit-sharing plan, established by the Harris Trust in 1916. Generally, they are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ebri.org/pdf/publications/books/fundamentals/fund06.pdf\">structured like a defined contribution retirement plan</a> but with the only contributions being made by the company. The business can set up a cash plan or a deferred plan, with payments being made immediately to the employee, or coming when they retire, leave the company, die or are disabled. Those payments can consist of cash or stock. </p> <p> Clinton\u2019s idea is to give those companies that adopt such a plan <a href=\"http://time.com/3961204/hillary-clinton-corporate-profit-sharing/\">a two-year tax credit</a> that is equivalent to 15% of the profit-sharing distributions. Meanwhile, an employee could receive only a sum equal to 10% of his annual salary or wages in profit-sharing, and as his income rose, it would diminish and eventually disappear. </p> <p>Some existing profit-sharing plans that companies put in place end up rewarding senior executives even more lavishly than rank-and-file employees. Clinton\u2019s goal is to direct the benefits to the lower-income and middle-income workers, or at least to restrict the tax incentives to companies that follow this track. </p> <p> Several companies have announced big profit-sharing payouts this year, demonstrating that this can offer a big boost to employees bottom lines. Delta Air Lines, after reporting a record $4.5bn in profits last year, paid its now retired CEO, Richard Anderson, $15.8m in compensation for 2015. While employees didn\u2019t earn anything like that, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/delta-pays-53m-to-local-employees/\">they did collect $1.5bn in profit-sharing payments</a>, which averaged almost 21% of their base pay. Some Seattle-area workers pocketed checks for $18,000 (before taxes). </p> <p> It was also a great year for the auto industry, with nearly 53,000 unionized Ford workers collecting $9,300 apiece, and General Motors paying out a record $11,000 to its hourly workers in profit-sharing, thanks to strong sales of SUVs and trucks. </p> <p> It\u2019s entirely reasonable to wonder what would happen to existing profit-sharing plans like these, and how they would coexist with ones that companies would create if Clinton were elected and implemented her proposed tax incentive for the very specific kind of plans she has in mind.</p> <p> More seriously, there\u2019s the question of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trouble-with-hillary-clintons-profit-sharing-plan/2015/07/22/db9eab02-3084-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html?utm_term=.c01b0eff3600\">what might happen</a> if companies try to use profit-sharing plans as a way to give employees de facto higher wages, without actually raising their base pay, and qualify for a tax break in the process. That said, there are few allegations on the part of profit-sharing beneficiaries today that they are being fobbed off with a benefit in lieu of a wage hike, and it\u2019s reasonable to suppose that a new Clinton administration would be looking hard for that kind of abuse.</p> <p> If there is to be any hope of salvaging some kind of capitalism from the ravages of the greedy 1980s and 1990s; the havoc wreaked by the increasing financialization of the last few decades; and the actions of CEOs from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/business/dealbook/dennis-kozlowskis-path-from-infamy-to-obscurity.html\">Tyco\u2019s Dennis Kozlowski</a> and Enron\u2019s Jeff Skilling to Stumpf of Wells Fargo, it lies in ideas like profit-sharing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/wells-fargo-investigations-lawsuits-john-stumpf\">Wells Fargo problems far from over as investigations and lawsuits expand</a> </p> </aside>  <p> It\u2019s not a perfect concept, but it can help to get managers and ordinary employees thinking and acting as if they are part of the same team \u2013 because they will be. At least the incentives will be on the right side of the scale.</p> <p>Hamdi Ulukaya, the CEO of Chobani, the yogurt company, earlier this year handed out Chobani shares to all his current employees. These <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-on-leadership-chobani-20160430-story.html\">could be worth as much as 10% of his company</a> if the business goes public or is sold, converting to either cash or stock as long as the company continues to hit certain performance metrics. </p> <p>There are plenty of incentives for employees to ensure the company thrives. If it does, some of them could end up millionaires, in exchange for having had confidence in Ulukaya\u2019s ability to get his startup business off the ground in a very competitive industry. </p> <p>Regardless of who wins the election and whetherwe end up with a tax policy prompting the creation of corporate profit-sharing plans, one thing is certain: the corporate world needs fewer John Stumpfs, and more Hamdi Ulukayas.</p>",

As the election draws nearer and the media hysteria mounts, levels of fatigue are hovering around the \u201cplease induce a coma and wake me up when this is all over\u201d mark.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing, though \u2013 nobody is forcing us to keep talking about the elections. We don\u2019t live in Trumpenistan yet; we are not all legally obliged to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s name in every second sentence. The democratic process does not hinge on us spending hours writing long Facebook posts explaining our views on the candidates in block capitals to echo chambers of our own opinion. We are allowed to talk about other things. In fact, \u2019tis the season to talk about other things: there are some autumn conversations that are obligatory. Here are five to get you started and get your mind off the election.</p> <h2><strong>The great pumpkin debate</strong><br></h2> <p>Every year, pumpkin-flavoured drinks, capitalism\u2019s way of ringing in the autumn, start appearing earlier and earlier. This is not a weird sign of climate change; it\u2019s the sign of a weird national obsession. According to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/01/pumpkin-spice-lattes-summer-starbucks/\">Dunkin\u2019 Donuts</a>, \u201cIn the New York City area, pumpkin-flavoured drinks were available starting 18 August due to customer feedback that they wanted pumpkin even earlier.\u201d However, pumpkin spice lattes \u2013 popularised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/starbucks\">Starbucks</a>, but now peddled everywhere \u2013 really come into their own when the temperature starts to drop, as it has in the last few days in New York. For the next couple of weeks, millions of people are going to be pulling on their Lululemons and Uggs, grabbing their first PSL of the season and exclaiming: \u201cAh, now I really feel like it\u2019s autumn!\u201d Meanwhile, millions of PSL haters are going to inform you how abominable the beverage is, to ensure you know they\u2019re not \u201cbasic\u201d. Pumpkin spice lattes are the 2016 election in a cup. Divisive, disgusting and everyone\u2019s got an opinion. Dammit, we\u2019re back to the elections.</p> <h2><strong>Harambe Halloween costumes</strong><br></h2> <p>Americans take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween\">Halloween</a> almost as seriously as democracy. People spend weeks planning their outfits. Somewhere in the US right now, I can guarantee a group text like this is happening:</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s all dress up as a sexy poop emoji or sexy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> this year!\u201d<br>\u201cI dunno \u2026 What do you think about the sexy <a href=\"http://www.kmart.com/women-s-pink-ribbon-costume/p-05038429000P?sid=KDx01192011x000001&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwmri_BRCZpaHkuIH75_IBEiQAIG0rIa1jtaEUruvndQxJAxXmygXNtyLNEB5FQdw0dac_gPAaArqw8P8HAQ&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">breast cancer awareness costume</a>?\u201d<br>\u201cSome people might find that offensive. What about dressing up like Isis?\u201d<br>\u201cNo, wait, I know! Let\u2019s go as slutty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/12/harambe-the-meme-that-refused-to-die\">Harambe</a>!\u201d</p> <p>Yes, there really is a sexy <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/bazaar/sexy-harambe-halloween-costume/\">Harambe costume</a> because this is 2016. And if gorilla-style politics is not for you, there\u2019s also a <a href=\"http://www.yandy.com/Donna-T.-Rumpshaker-Costume.php\">sexy Donald Trump costume</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.yandy.com/Capitol-Hill.php\">sexy Hillary Clinton costume</a>. Who says we need to make America great again? It\u2019s already perfect.</p> <h2><strong>Cuffing season</strong><br></h2> <p>In New York, dating is a blood sport. When the temperature starts to drop, however, competition really hots up and \u201ccuffing season\u201d starts. <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cuffing%20Season\">Urban Dictionary explains</a> that, as autumn begins, people \u201cwho would normally rather be single or promiscuous find themselves along with the rest of the world desiring to be \u2018cuffed\u2019 or tied down by a serious relationship\u201d. Cuffing season is often accompanied by \u201czombieing\u201d. This is when an ex long gone from your life rises from the dead (metaphorically speaking) and starts randomly liking your social media posts or sending you one-word texts such as \u201cHi\u201d. If you go to a bar in New York during cuffing season, you will overhear long discussions about if \u201cI should say \u2018hi\u2019 back?\u201d (No.) You may also see already-cuffed couples in matching flannels discussing their apple-picking plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad61b2c9af6116e56834ee1336247bc179f76bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad61b2c9af6116e56834ee1336247bc179f76bb/0_14_699_699/500.jpg\" alt=\"Why not dress up as Harambe for Halloween?\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Why not dress up as Harambe for Halloween?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fantasy football</strong><br></h2> <p>According to <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/09/05/nearly-75m-people-will-play-fantasy-football-this-year/\">a 2015 study</a>, almost 75 million people, about a quarter of the US population, play fantasy football, spending $4.6bn (\u00a33.5bn) on it. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html?_r=0\">only 9% of the US chose Trump and Clinton</a> as the presidential nominees. Fantasy football (I\u2019m talking about American, no-feet-involved football, obviously) is an obsessive topic of discussion around this time of year. Unfortunately, I could not tell you what is being discussed; Trump\u2019s policies make more sense to me than the ins and outs of imaginary leagues. And it turns out, though, you can\u2019t even escape the nightmare of politics with the fantasy of football this year. Clinton is <a href=\"http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/hillary-clinton-runs-espn-ad-mocking-trump-as-fantasy-football-player.html\">running ads on fantasy football websites</a>, describing Trump as \u201clike that guy in your fantasy league who talks trash all week and forgets to set his lineup\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>The weather</strong></h2> <p>Ah, autumn. The leaves are changing colour, the air is crisp and the carbon dioxide is abundant. Environmental scientists recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\">announced</a> that climate change has reached the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d, with the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere permanently passing the 400-parts-per-million threshold. Some people will tell you that this is a very real disaster of our own making. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/china-climate-change\">Others will tell you</a> that the concept of global warming was a conspiracy created by the Chinese to make US manufacturing non-competitive. Other people will post angry messages on social media asking: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t everyone who is worked up about Harambe start getting worked up about climate change, which really matters!\u201d People have always enjoyed talking about the weather; it used to be a safe topic of conversation. Alas, this is no longer the case. Now if you tell someone \u201cGosh, it\u2019s got cold recently\u201d, there is a good chance they will reply with their unsolicited opinion on global warming. Which will lead you back to politics. Which will lead you back to the elections. There is really no escaping it, after all.</p>",
  "<p>Hopes for an end to Spain\u2019s nine-month political deadlock have risen after the shattered Socialist Workers\u2019 party deposed its leader over his pointblank refusal to allow the acting prime minister to form a government.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/30/spanish-socialists-week-of-turmoil-not-just-down-to-pedro-sanchez\">fought to retain the leadership of the PSOE</a> since a coup against him erupted this week, stepped down after a long and bitter meeting of the party\u2019s federal executive committee on Saturday.</p> <p>His plan to hang on to his job by holding a leadership contest in three weeks\u2019 time was eventually rejected by 132 votes to 107 at the end of an 11-hour session that laid bare the chaos and anger at the heart of the PSOE.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, S\u00e1nchez announced his resignation and the party was put in the hands of a caretaker leadership that will have to decide soon on its next step as a deadline looms for avoiding Spain\u2019s third general election in just over a year.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez had consistently argued that the party would not do anything to support or facilitate the return to government of Mariano Rajoy\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party, on the grounds that the PP had wrought too much damage on Spanish society and was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/former-imf-chief-rodrigo-rato-heckled-at-start-of-corruption-trial\">hopelessly mired in corruption scandals</a>.</p> <p>It was a stance that infuriated not only many voters \u2013 <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/09/28/opinion/1475090003_414591.html\">and the media</a> \u2013 but also his adversaries within the PSOE who blamed him for the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/spains-regional-elections-boost-rajoy-but-political-deadlock-unlikely-to-end\">disastrous electoral performance</a>. </p> <p>\u201cAs I said yesterday and as I\u2019m saying again today, my parents taught me that the most important thing is keeping your word,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThat was my word, which I gave to all the members and to the federal committee, too, when it came to the party\u2019s position on Rajoy\u2019s investiture process.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, hours before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/spanish-socialist-leader-faces-revolt-over-refusal-to-end-political-deadlock\">half of the executive committee resigned</a> to try to force S\u00e1nchez out, the party\u2019s former leader Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez accused him of going back on an assurance that he would allow Rajoy to form a minority government following a second inconclusive election in June.</p> <p>Like many in the party, Gonz\u00e1lez urged S\u00e1nchez to let Rajoy govern. Susana D\u00edaz, the leader of the PSOE in Andaluc\u00eda and the candidate most frequently touted as S\u00e1nchez\u2019s successor, also insisted that the needs of the country had to come before the needs of the party.</p> <p>The PSOE now has a month to regroup and re-evaluate its position before King Felipe could dissolve parliament and call <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/spain-mariano-rajoy-third-general-election-christmas-day\">new elections to be held at Christmas</a>. </p> <p>Although the removal of S\u00e1nchez could help end the political paralysis, his departure is likely to prove a pyrrhic victory for D\u00edaz and her supporters. The civil war that has torn the socialists apart will only serve to strengthen Rajoy\u2019s hand and boost the appeal of Podemos, the anti-austerity party that has long dreamed of replacing the PSOE as the strongest voice of the Spanish left.</p> <p>Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political science professor at Madrid\u2019s Carlos III University, said the PSOE had been left \u201cmortally wounded\u201d by the week\u2019s events and in no mood for third elections in which they would suffer even further.</p> <p>\u201cThe Socialist party is so weakened, so destroyed and so ripped apart that all it can do is limp on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to negotiate, it can only do so with its hands up.\u201d</p> <p>Reports suggest the PP will ask the socialists for far more than just a smooth investiture. Safe in the knowledge that he could use fresh elections to crush his party\u2019s longstanding rivals, Rajoy is likely to extract the maximum possible gains from any deal.</p> <p>\u201cHis conditions are going to be very harsh,\u201d said Sim\u00f3n. \u201cIt seems he\u2019s going to look for their support to make sure he has four easy years in office.\u201d</p> <p>He predicted those who had helped oust S\u00e1nchez were unlikely to find their efforts rewarded. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation of socialist leaders who have damaged themselves with this move: Susana D\u00edaz, Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Vara [the PSOE president of Extremadura] and Eduardo Madina [a former leadership candidate] are all divisive figures within the party now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhoever leads the party into the next phase needs to be someone completely new and unstained by the conspiracy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sim\u00f3n said S\u00e1nchez\u2019s replacement faced an almost insurmountable task. \u201cThe wound the PSOE has sustained is going to be very hard to cure and will need many electoral cycles to heal. I get the feeling that we\u2019re heading for a long cycle of government by the right in Spain.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Like any marketing-approved generational epithet, to be a millennial is not as simple as it sounds. If you read the news, you might be forgiven for thinking that we\u2019re a mass of social-media-addicted gay biracial angels who\u2019d rather take a BuzzFeed quiz than think for ourselves \u2013 we\u2019re responsible for the death of the car industry, the cable industry, we\u2019re lazy, we\u2019re entrepreneurial, we\u2019re overly nostalgic and we\u2019re narcissistic. But however handy the descriptive term, the truth is that we\u2019re a widely various crowd. </p> <p>Just look at this election. Millennials are not lining up for Hillary Clinton, nor any candidate, for that matter. A recent Quinnipiac <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2378\">poll</a> found that support for Hillary Clinton among voters ages 18-34 in a four-person race is a paltry 31%.

Claiming that someone is wasting their vote is undemocratic, even if the outcome is undesirable. In fact, it should be heartening that young people are even aware enough to know that there are more than two political parties in this country. But I do wonder how we got to this point after the utopian high of the 2008 election, when Shepard Fairey posters were hanging on college dorm-room walls and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yq0tMYPDJQ\">will.i.am</a> was releasing inspirational, triumphalist music videos. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"724454fb27cf6b6a9748c17a1b219591e3101179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724454fb27cf6b6a9748c17a1b219591e3101179/0_215_4400_2641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters make their way to East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park, California, in May to protest against Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters make their way to East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park, California, in May to protest against Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J.

Take, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/853886/madonna-rocks-the-vote-1990.jhtm\">this</a> dire MTV Rock the Vote commercial starring Madonna and two anonymous back-up dancers.

Vote or Die didn\u2019t literally mean that you would die if you didn\u2019t vote, though there was certainly the implication that you might get drafted and sent to Iraq if you didn\u2019t support Democratic candidate John Kerry. Puff Daddy has since been on record saying he thinks voting is a \u201c<a href=\"http://uproxx.com/music/diddy-vote-or-die-voting-scam/)\">scam</a>\u201d.

Despite its association with the grunge 90s \u2013 or maybe because of it \u2013 Rock the Vote still exists, even if the idea of \u201crocking\u201d is about as relevant to the youth vote as a rotary phone. This year, Rock the Vote is joining forces with Glamour magazine, Refinery29, Jezebel and the Cut to register at least 100,000 women before the election, an initiative called #OurVoteCounts. As one would imagine with the strategic placement of the hashtag in the name, most of this registration drive will take place online, unlike the TV-centric campaigns of yesteryear. To better appeal to its newer, younger, sexier partners, Rock the Vote might want to also consider rebranding for the 21st century \u2013 maybe something like Electric Democracy Carnival? Organizers can hold voter registration drives in the desert, hand out glow sticks and pacifiers, and build a giant wooden statue of Thomas Jefferson that they can set on fire every evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d39fa66113621b5d51d90e5b654a09d03ee180fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d39fa66113621b5d51d90e5b654a09d03ee180fa/0_0_2934_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Liles, Mary J Blige, Russell Simmons, Puff Daddy, and Jay Z on stage at the Last Chance For Change Rally in support of Barack Obama on 2 November 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Liles, Mary J Blige, Russell Simmons, Puff Daddy, and Jay Z on stage at the Last Chance For Change Rally in support of Barack Obama on 2 November 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, it\u2019s good to see Rock The Vote make the jump from the airwaves to the internet.

There is an increasing awareness in this country that something\u2019s gone wrong. Millennial dissatisfaction with the course that the United States is taking is growing. Earlier this year,<a href=\"http://elections.ap.org/suntimes/content/divided-america-diverse-millennials-are-no-voting-monolith-1\"> the GenForward survey</a>, a collaboration between the Black Youth Project and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago, discovered that 52% of millennials feel the country is \u201cfalling behind\u201d and another 24% believe it\u2019s \u201cfailing\u201d. That <a href=\"http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/GenForward/GenForward%20June%202016%20BYP%20Report.pdf\">same study</a> found that 17% of black millennials aren\u2019t planning to vote, which could be a devastating blow for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, as she\u2019ll be relying on the youth and minority vote to overcome Trump\u2019s significant advantage with white Americans.</p> <p>The apathy of the millennial voter might simply be a symptom of having two candidates in their late 60s or early 70s who don\u2019t have the air of hipness that Barack Obama employed. What pops a hole in that theory is that millennial voting rates <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/08/six-take-aways-from-the-census-bureaus-voting-report/\">fell</a> 7% from 2008 to 2012. Instead, there\u2019s the very real possibility that as millennials age, they are less apt to stomach a thing called hope. The Obama presidency did not usher in a new age of cooperation. Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner did not announce they would be going on a nationwide concert tour performing the hits of the Carpenters. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/millennials-latino-voters-clinton-trump\">\u2018We don\u2019t have a choice\u2019: young Latinos on why they're voting for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Racial tension, climate change, gun violence, terrorism, and poverty persist.

  "<p>In the 21st century, Saturday Night Live has lived or died by its presidential election coverage. For all the flak that the show receives for not living up to its \u201cglory days\u201d \u2013 and those glory days generally happen to line up with the speaker\u2019s teenage years \u2013 it redeems itself in the cultural landscape with presidential debate sketches that hit the mark and justify its existence.</p> <p>So it\u2019s understandable that the show\u2019s writers tilted so heavily in favor of election comedy for this season\u2019s premiere on Saturday. The opening sketch was, as is now de rigueur, a take on the first presidential debate. Recent Emmy-winner (and Ghostbusters scene-stealer) Kate McKinnon of course returned as an ecstatic Hillary Clinton, a shimmying, wide-eyed, over-prepared debater who can\u2019t believe how easy it all is.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/snl/videos/10154512969416303\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10154512969416303\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/snl/videos/10154512969416303/\">Donald Trump v Hillary Clinton debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Facing her was the show\u2019s latest take on Donald Trump, long-time SNL favorite Alec Baldwin, who had been teased earlier this week. </p> <p>Baldwin\u2019s Trump was technically flawless \u2013 the hair and make-up, the sneer, the bravado \u2013 but it felt somehow lifeless, as if the writers couldn\u2019t imagine, or get away with, a more over-the-top caricature than the man himself. (Baldwin is pegged to play Trump for the entire season, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-snl-new-donald-trump-933435\">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>.

Game show sketches are almost always lazy excuses for a string of impressions, and that was as true as ever, with Larry David reprising his Bernie Sanders impression while Robbie took on Ivanka Trump and Cecily Strong premiered an irritating take on next week\u2019s host, Lin Manuel-Miranda. The sketch\u2019s strongest gag was Chris Christie\u2019s inability to stop making bridge references; it ended with a non-joke about Jill Stein that implied that, perhaps more than ever, the SNL writers are taking a firm stand in who their viewers should (and shouldn\u2019t) vote for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df36d266811ab08c62a40d493cbf192701c1b5d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df36d266811ab08c62a40d493cbf192701c1b5d8/0_41_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musical guest The Weeknd, host Margot Robbie, and Kenan Thompson on Saturday Night Live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musical guest The Weeknd, host Margot Robbie, and Kenan Thompson on Saturday Night Live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weekend Update, once a highlight of every episode, has not quite returned to its full-strength Seth Meyers days, but co-hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost are finally finding a groove. Their focus, of course, was on the recent debate and the upcoming election, but they eventually expanded to include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football\">Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest</a> in a bit that showcased their growing camaraderie.</p> <p>The last half-hour took some delightfully quirky turns. The show debuted Melania Moments, inane musings from Trump\u2019s wife that mirrored the show\u2019s classic Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey. It also had fun with a take on a \u201cwomen in film\u201d panel, which seemed to be taking advantage of its strong female cast but ended up being a showcase for McKinnon\u2019s delightful weirdness. She made the loosely structured sketch entirely worthwhile; any scene that allows a bewigged, bespectacled McKinnon to conclude with a phrase like \u201cthe little baboon ran off with my broaches\u201d is always welcome.</p> <p>And in its final moments, the show went meta, with Pete Davidson stepping into the lead role in a Mr Robot sketch to address cast member Leslie Jones\u2019 real-life hacking scandal. It was a cleverly done, if joke-light, sketch, and it ended the premiere in a genially amusing manner. Between Baldwin\u2019s Trump and Robbie as host, SNL certainly looks the part of a glamorous television show; now it needs to work more on the substance that once made it the go-to for political satire.</p>",
  "<p>How do voters select a candidate when no one they like is on the ballot?</p> <p>Behavioral scientists have studied decision-making \u2013 including voting \u2013 for decades. However, researchers usually give respondents at least one appealing option to choose from.</p> <p>This led us to wonder: what do voters do when they consider all of the options bad? Do they fall back on party affiliation, or simply toss a coin? This question is especially appropriate in the current presidential election because the two frontrunners have the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/\">lowest favorability ratings</a> ever.</p> <p>When we did research to answer this question, we learned that in situations where all of the choices are bad, people tend to vote by rejecting the choices they didn\u2019t like, rather than by affirmatively choosing the one they disliked least.</p> <p>Imagine there are two undesirable candidates named Tilly and Ron. Given this \u201ctwo bad choices\u201d option, voters will be more likely to select Tilly because they reject Ron, rather than select Tilly proactively.</p> <p>While the end result may be the same, the thought process that leads to this decision is quite different.</p> <p>As behavioral scientists who study how people make decisions, we think this distinction could affect the upcoming presidential election. If people select between Clinton and Trump by using rejection rather than choice, then the information they use to make their decisions will be different.</p> <p>In some ways, it may be better. Voters using rejection are more deliberate. They are less likely to be swayed by unimportant information about a candidate that they read or hear on radio, television or Facebook. They may pay less attention to rumors. In fact, conscientious voters may be well served to actively adopt a rejection strategy for their vote in order to make a choice more deliberately.</p> <p>In a study we ran online in April, we showed people only Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as the two candidates for president. Those who found at least one of them attractive were more likely to select by choice, while those who disliked both were more likely to select by rejection.</p> <p>Having determined that people use rejection strategies to make their voting decisions in bad-option situations, we next wanted to test how rejection strategies would change the information people focus on.</p> <p>In nine separate studies we conducted, some of which will be published in an upcoming <a href=\"http://www.aradhnakrishna.com/uploads/4/7/8/8/4788965/how_choosing_versus_rejecting_alternatives_affects_information_processing.pdf\">Journal of Consumer Research</a>, we found that when people use rejection strategies, they also become more deliberate in their decision-making. In other words, they pay more attention to all information they have \u2013 both good and bad \u2013 and don\u2019t get swayed as much by one piece of information that sticks out.</p> <p>In our research, we saw more deliberation in rejection decisions and less of a tendency to be swayed by emotional, in-your-face information.</p> <p>For example, one of these studies determined that people were less likely to vote based on party affiliation if they voted by rejection, rather than by choice. Respondents also took less time to make their decision in the choice condition versus the rejection condition.</p> <p>We reached these results by revisiting a classic study known as the \u201cAsian disease problem\u201d.</p> <p>The Asian disease problem was first proposed by the behavioral economists <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1685855?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1981</a>. It is well-studied because of the contradictory choices people make, and is one of the many conundrums that Kahneman proposed which later won him the Nobel prize.</p> <p>In the standard formulation of the Asian disease problem, people choose between two programs to combat an unusual Asian disease: program A, which offers certainty; and program B, which involves a risk.</p> <p>The original research showed that people change their preferences between the two programs depending on how the options are described.</p> <p>People tend to select the more certain program A if it is framed as a gain. Specifically, 72% of respondents preferred (A) \u201c200 people are saved out of 600\u201d while 28% picked the riskier (B) \u201c1/3 probability that 600 people are saved and 2/3 probability that no one is saved\u201d.</p> <p>That may seem rational. However, change the wording and the results also change \u2013 even though the theoretical loss of life remains the same.</p> <p>Program A was preferred by only 22% of the recipients when researchers framed the choice like this: (A) \u201c400 people will die out of 600\u201d versus (B) \u201c2/3 probability that 600 people will die and a 1/3 probability that no one will die\u201d. With this wording, 78% choose the riskier option. This is because people tend to focus on emotionally salient information like \u201csave\u201d and \u201cdie.\u201d</p> <p>Our new research revisits this classic problem to study what would happen if the respondents were choosing which program to reject instead of which one to choose. Would people be swayed less by the attention-grabbing words like \u201csave\u201d and \u201cdie\u201d?</p> <p>When we asked respondents which program would you reject, respondents\u2019 selections were affected less by the use of the emotional words. Program A was selected by 48% in the first pair and 43% selected it in the second. In other words, the decision between program A and program B was similar, whether \u201csave\u201d or \u201cdie\u201d was used to describe the programs.</p> <p>The study results indicate that wild in-your-face claims made by candidates will get less weight if people use rejection strategies to vote.</p> <p>Princeton psychology scholar Eldar Shafir <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03197186\">has also found</a> that rejection makes people focus on negative attributes. Perhaps the candidates\u2019 campaign managers know this already and that is why the negativity in this election has been so high. But, the point to remember is that this cannot be a shallow negative attribute like sounding bossy or having a spray-tanning habit. People voting by rejection will be more deliberate \u2013 and will look carefully at what makes a candidate bad. Emotional claims will not work. Voters will think carefully about why they want to reject one of the candidates.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 October to fix a grammatical error in the headline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/65034/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

But the uniquely polarising candidacy of Trump has raised the prospect that, with important faultlines such as age, gender, geography and race <a href=\"http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/\">relatively settled from election to election</a>, socioeconomic class could swing the presidency in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7/0_221_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One marker is education. In 1992, Republican voters were much better educated than their Democratic counterparts, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/15/educational-divide-in-vote-preferences-on-track-to-be-wider-than-in-recent-elections/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. Today registered voters with a college degree favour Clinton by 23 percentage points, while those without a college degree prefer Trump by five. This trend cuts across demographic groups, although it is most pronounced among whites. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_clinton_is_defined_by_an_educational_gap_among_white_voters.html\">The Slate website noted:</a> \u201cThe educational split among white voters is the defining characteristic of this election.\u201d If this holds in November, it will be the widest educational divide at the ballot box for several decades. </p> <p>Another marker is cultural and about optics. When Clinton recently referred to half of Trump\u2019s supporters as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">\u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d</a>, critics also seized on the context: she was addressing millionaires at a fundraiser headlined by the singer Barbra Streisand at the New York restaurant Cipriani Wall Street. And her backers include those other temples of coastal privilege, Hollywood and Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, was anointed the \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d at the Republican national convention, where Willie Robertson of the TV reality show Duck Dynasty, wearing stars and stripes bandanna and bushy beard, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/18/duck-dynasty-star-willie-robertson-might-have-a-point-about-the-media/\">declared that media pundits</a> \u201cdon\u2019t hang out with regular folks like us, who like to hunt and fish and pray and actually work for a living. Heck, I don\u2019t even know that they know how to talk to people from middle America. I mean, when I tell \u2019em I\u2019m from Louisiana, they really start talking real slow and real loud.\u201d</p> <p>In Boonsboro, a town of 3,400 people steeped in revolutionary and civil war history, a giant Trump sign has been spraypainted with the word \u201clove\u201d. Opposite a Subway restaurant and closed-down bakery, the <a href=\"http://www.ttpbooks.com/\">Turn the Page Bookstore</a>, owned by the romance novelist Nora Roberts, sells soy candles, handmade soaps and organic coffee. Its employees make little secret of their allegiance to Clinton. Two doors away, at Crawfords Restaurant, Guns &amp; Ammo, a handwritten sign behind the laminated counter warns \u201cNo free refills on drinks\u201d and the staff are for Trump.</p> <p>As a reality show about hunting in the woods played on the TV, Rutherford, who is cashier, dishwasher, shelf stacker and much else, said of Clinton\u2019s supporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise the importance of small-town America and they don\u2019t see the value of it. Everybody in this community loves this little store but big companies make it harder and harder for us.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018You must be doing well with Obamacare\u2019. I say, actually, unless you have an astronomical salary or a company to pay for it, it\u2019s crippling. Our health insurance is $900 per month for the family; that\u2019s why I work.

But she moved to Boonsboro in 2002, where the family keeps horses, dogs and chickens on 30 acres of land and hunts 80% of their own food. Her daughters, aged 13, 14, 15 and 16, \u201call hunt and play volleyball\u201d.</p> <p>Displaying a phone picture of herself with a deer she bagged, Rutherford said: \u201cA lot of my friends don\u2019t agree with what I do but they don\u2019t have trouble wearing a full-length coyote coat to a fundraiser in January. They will wear leather shoes and carry an alligator handbag. The people of Washington don\u2019t want to go out to the rural areas; no one wants to go out of their comfort zone. But I would love to go to a Clinton rally just to eavesdrop and hear the interaction.\u201d</p> <p>Along the street, at Marly\u2019s Laundry, Wayne Stonesifer was waiting patiently as his clothes spun in a tumble dryer.

If you try to interrupt me when I\u2019m hunting, that\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>The country has a bigger divide now than ever, he added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your gay rights, abortion laws, racism.

Times are getting nearer.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Dobereiner, 36, owns two small businesses and complains that taxes are too high. He is also supporting Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not a liberal and we\u2019re $20 trillion in debt and unemployment is too high and our healthcare is terrible. The community organiser-in-chief has no qualifications and Hillary Clinton is just an extension of that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Trump says; I care what he does and he\u2019s not a billionaire because he\u2019s stupid. I like a guy who puts his foot in his mouth because at least he tells the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s plain speaking has been identified as one of the sources of his appeal to voters angry at the status quo in general and Republican establishment in particular. Even his outlandish gaffes are said to humanise him, emphasising his status as outsider and non-politician. His anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim diatribes have disgusted liberals and been cheered at raucous rallies, where he declares his love for \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/john-hudak/\">John Hudak</a>, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cI think supporters look at Donald Trump and see a bit of an everyman, even though his biography completely opposes that worldview. Then they look at Hillary Clinton and see her as more elite than her background would actually suggest. Trump is the person you want to see on TLC; Clinton appears to live the way an average wealthy person lives.\u201d</p> <p>There is a crucial gender dimension, Hudak argues. \u201cA female candidate would not be allowed to ramble like Trump does or Bill Clinton did. Only in a race between a man and a woman could her polish be a liability and his freewheeling be an asset.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has scrambled the orthodoxy of class, for example by tweeting a picture of himself eating McDonald\u2019s fast food and drinking Coke on his luxurious private jet. He loves both boxing and golf. He has named Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece Citizen Kane as his favourite film but also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo\">once told the New Yorker</a> that Bloodsport, a violent action flick starring Jean Claude Van Damme, is \u201can incredible, fantastic movie\u201d. The music at his rallies ranges from Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera Turandot, to Elton John. His properties are crammed with chandeliers, gold leaf, mirrors and marble \u2013 tacky to some, aspirational to others. Both patrician and plebeian, his reading list is said to consist mainly of articles about himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf/0_153_2624_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme \u2026 right up there with Citizen Kane, according to Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some would say he lacks class, in every sense. And there is a tenacious myth that, free of the ossified layers of agricultural and industrial Europe, America is a class-free land of opportunity, where someone born into poverty can become president. It is not so simple, according to sociologists. Arlie Hochschild of the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, said: \u201cClass is profoundly important, imprinting all aspects of childhood, self, character and behind, and the denial of it is in the service of keeping alive the hope of lifting out of it. But America would be far better off talking about the realities of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.robert-h-frank.com/\">Robert H Frank</a>, a professor of economics at Cornell University and author of Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy, added: \u201cPeople here, if you ask them, will say they are \u2018middle class\u2019. Even relatively rich people will answer middle class because we deny there\u2019s such a thing as class here, which is of course preposterous. The barriers are different from England but they\u2019re real.\u201d<br></p> <p>Research suggests that Trump\u2019s core support should not be simply characterised as the white working class. Many earn an average of $70,000 but are caught in the downdraft of deindustrialisation, losing jobs to factory or mine closures, lacking the skills for a digital economy, anxious that their children will be worse off than they were. Joe Sims, a member of the national board of the <a href=\"http://www.cpusa.org/\">Communist Party USA</a>, said: \u201cMy sense is that Trump\u2019s support comes not so much from the white working class but the lower middle class and small business people who have been pushed into the ranks of the working class. The wages are flat and they\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>But in a supposedly classless society, there is often a gap between perception and reality. Sims added: \u201cDuring the 1950s and 1960s there was a myth propagated about the American dream and the American way of life and the sense that everyone was middle class and upwardly mobile. Certainly during that period there was at least a steadiness in increase in income and their children were able to do a little better than them. But this idea of everyone being middle class has crashed on the rocks of reality. Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Numerous academic studies have found that the extent of social mobility was probably always exaggerated and, in the past generation, may have become deteriorated. The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html\">soaring cost of studying at university</a> has been blamed for stifling upward movement and allowing middle-class families to entrench their advantage. Pew\u2019s research, published last week, found a growing ideological divide, with highly educated adults holding increasingly liberal attitudes, while under a third of the less educated held liberal views.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gqrr.com/stanley-b-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>, a veteran political consultant and senior pollster for Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the biggest divide between working-class voters and those with a college degree in this election. It\u2019s already there in the polls. Trump is reinforcing it by the nature of the campaign he\u2019s running and the issues he\u2019s running on. He\u2019s driving away college graduates as well as the whole Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>In the Republican primaries, Trump the class warrior made Ted Cruz, the conservative Christian ideologue, look quaint. Greenberg admits that he was surprised. \u201cThe college-educated Republicans keep moving year after year more to the Democrats but this election has really accelerated it because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a candidate running on a straight working-class campaign. [George W] Bush was very much centred on faith; that\u2019s legitimate but it wasn\u2019t an economic argument.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6/0_69_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he warned against an oversimplified binary split, pointing to the success of Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, in the Democratic primaries. Sanders stressed issues of economic inequality and access to college education, to the extent that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">criticised by some for neglecting race</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of Democrats who were voting for somebody who was a self-described socialist, running against big money, getting big money out of politics, going after Wall Street and big banks, attacking Hillary for being a creature of the big banks, so you need a third bucket,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThere are others who are not so focused on the racial and cultural issues who are quite ready to rally. Sanders, in the polls at least, was stronger than Hillary against Trump because he actually was winning both millennials and working-class voters.\u201d</p> <p>But now Sanders is out, there are two historically unpopular candidates and a fear of two classes, or tribes, or nations, mutually hostile and suspicious. Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote in Britain,</a> a painful rift has been exposed and polling day itself will not necessarily heal it. If diehard Clinton and Trump supporters sat down to dinner tonight, would they find much to talk about?</p> <p>In Chevy Chase, an affluent neighbourhood in north-west Washington DC, an area where deer roam audaciously in the gardens of multimillion-dollar houses, Trump fans are hard to find.

Trump is a regrettable example of the latter. He has no politics and caters to the worst part of the American psyche. He caters to people who don\u2019t know what fascism is.\u201d</p> <p>Asked his opinion of Trump\u2019s supporters, Avdoyan replied: \u201cThey\u2019re scared little people.\u201d</p> <p>And how would they regard him? \u201cI\u2019m gay.

Those voting for Trump think it\u2019s two different countries and two different cultures. They see liberals and Democrats as alien life forms. I grew up in a rural environment and it\u2019s not like guns are totally alien to us.

  "<p>Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes in the US for up to 18 years after declaring a $916m (\u00a3706m) loss on his tax returns in the mid-1990s, according to reports. </p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, who has throughout his campaign for the White House refused to release his tax returns, is said to have received the large tax benefit from business debts recorded in 1995. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">New York Times</a>, which claimed to have obtained Trump\u2019s tax return for that year, reported that tax experts hired to analyse the documents said US laws would have let Trump use the near-$1bn loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income until 2013. </p> <p>The Trump campaign said in response that the tax document was obtained illegally and that the New York Times was operating as \u201can extension\u201d of the presidential campaign of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>The Times said that although Trump\u2019s taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916m loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50m a year in taxable income over 18 years. </p> <p>Trump has declined to release his tax records, unlike previous presidential nominees in modern history, saying his taxes are under a federal audit.

It is hardly an exaggeration to say that she has imposed her personality on the entire world.</p> <p>After the hills of Somerset, the first place to influence James was Oxford, where he was sent at age nine to the cathedral choir school at Christ Church. \u201cOxford made me,\u201d Jan wrote in <em>Conundrum</em>, recalling lessons attended in a \u201cfluttering\u201d white gown. The atmosphere of High Anglican Christianity, dwelling within beautiful buildings and courtyards, deeply imbued her sensibility both as a person and as a&#xa0;writer (even though it did not make her a Christian).</p> <p>At 17, James joined the army and in 1946 was posted to Palestine, via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/22/jan-morris-talks-about-venice\" title=\"\">Venice</a> and Trieste. These came to be two of Jan\u2019s favourite cities, and she later wrote wonderful books about them both. In Palestine, James was an intelligence officer, and conceived a fascination with the Arab world. After returning to Oxford to take his degree, he secured a job at the Arab News Agency in Cairo.</p> <p>A career in journalism followed, first at the Times and later at what was still then the Manchester Guardian. He accompanied the British Mount Everest expedition of 1953, securing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/12/topstories3.mainsection\" title=\"\">one of the great journalistic coups of the 20th century</a>. Although the Times had exclusive rights to cover the expedition, James was concerned that other newspapers might steal his story, and devised a code that would make news of success appear to be news of failure. Once Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had reached the peak, James scrambled down the mountain, at great risk, to delivered his despatch at a radio station in the nearest town. It read: \u201cSnow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement.\u201d Which actually meant: \u201cSummit of Everest reached on 29th May by Hillary and Tenzing.\u201d This news arrived in London on the eve of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, enabling the Times to run its story on a day when the nation was celebrating the dawn of a new Elizabethan Age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06ffc92b66fd8f99218827fb3bfd7bf1ce192df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06ffc92b66fd8f99218827fb3bfd7bf1ce192df3/0_88_2937_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Morris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morris in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James parted company with the Times over its line on the Suez crisis of 1956, and went over to the Guardian. Suez led to his other major journalistic scoop: the report that the French and the British were engaged in a covert attempt to invade Egypt under the guise of a mission to maintain peace between Egypt and Israel. Having seen first-hand the fighting in the Negev desert and the Suez Canal Zone, James flew to Cyprus to escape Israeli censorship and file his story. There he got into conversation with French pilots who admitted that they and the British were flying missions against Egyptian forces. The new editor of the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/04/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Alastair Hetherington</a>, bravely decided to print this incendiary story. The British and French were shamed into withdrawing their forces, and Anthony Eden was later obliged to resign as prime minister.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 1960s, James began his book-writing career in earnest, writing on America, the Arab world, Everest, Venice, Spain, Oxford, Sydney and Hong Kong. In 1964, he embarked on what Jan subsequently described as \u201cthe intellectual and artistic centrepiece of my life\u201d: the Pax Britannica<em> </em>trilogy, which traced the history of the British empire.</p> <p>What is it that renders Jan\u2019s style so distinctive? She is a supremely skilled writer who involves the reader while she remains unobtrusively present herself; who uses the particular to illustrate the general, and scatters grace notes here and there like benefactions. These skills are matched by her talents for observation and analysis, and her wonderful ability (despite being only a moderately endowed linguist) to engage people and draw them out. She is a watcher, usually alone, seldom lonely, alert to everything around her.</p> <p>By the early 80s, Jan Morris had been pretty much everywhere, and she must have a claim to being the most widely travelled person alive today. Standing in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1983, she felt that she had fulfilled a \u201cperhaps jejune\u201d ambition to visit and portray all the chief cities of the world. This remarkable achievement invites consideration of what underlies it. There was something compulsive about Jan\u2019s travelling, something apparently not willed by her but driven by forces beyond her control. This was travel as a quest, as \u201can outer expression of my inner journey\u201d.</p> <p><em>Conundrum</em>, which was a worldwide bestseller when it was published in 1974, describes the process that led to a&#xa0;clinic in Casablanca, and the adjustment to life as a woman. It is a&#xa0;powerful and beautifully written document, from which Jan and her lifelong partner Elizabeth emerge as heroines of a sort. While gender reassignment operations had been conducted on many people before, none of them had Jan\u2019s public profile. There were great stresses, for Jan, Elizabeth and their four children, but they have remained a close-knit and loyal family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24c56a12b4dc02e87c812478b08adec48aa456fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24c56a12b4dc02e87c812478b08adec48aa456fc/0_63_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At home in north Wales in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At home in north Wales in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time that Jan was transitioning from male to female, she was also moving from being thoroughly English (Oxford, the army, the Times) to thoroughly Welsh. Jan and Elizabeth bought a big house in the far north-west of Wales, where they still live, and Jan began to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/06/comment.politics2\" title=\"\">Welsh republicanism</a> that has become one of the great passions of her life. When Jan and Elizabeth die, they will be buried together on an island in a stream near their home, beneath a stone bearing an inscription in both English and Welsh that says: \u201cHere lie two friends, at the end of one life.\u201d</p> <p>During the course of that life, Jan has gone wherever she pleased, and reported back on what the world is like for those of us who have not taken the trouble to explore it fully or with such an open mind.

  "<p>Go back a year to the Conservative party conference in Manchester. David Cameron basks in the \u201cnew light \u2013 the bluer light \u2013 that fell across our isles\u201d when the general election results came in. George Osborne is Dave\u2019s dauphin, a triumphant PM in waiting. Jeremy Corbyn isn\u2019t getting good reviews after Brighton. Britain remains firmly in Europe, with only the Farage fringe and usual suspects cutting up rough. And across the pond there\u2019s incredulity that candidate Trump is still standing.</p> <p>\u201cI was writing my speech and preparing to go and see Her Majesty. And I thought \u2026 I\u2019ll just lie down and let it all sink in,\u201d Cameron continues. \u201cAs I shut my eyes, Ed Balls had gone. And when I woke up and I switched on the radio, Nigel Farage had gone too. There was a brief moment when I thought it was all a dream. But there\u2019s a serious point. Why did all the pollsters and the pundits get it so wrong?\u201d</p> <p>A question as relevant now as it was a year ago. Cameron, out of luck and out of Westminster, has a new career to find. George Osborne is in powerhouse exile. An ecstatic Farage has Brexit victory. Corbyn has just been thumpingly re-elected. And Trump, bombast unabated, faces Hillary Clinton in the great debate round two.</p> <p>Cameron answered his own question, to be sure. Why were the pundits wrong? \u201cBecause, fundamentally, they didn\u2019t understand the people who make up our country. The vast majority of people aren\u2019t obsessives, arguing at the extremes of the debate. Let me put it as simply as I can: Britain and Twitter are not the same thing.\u201d Cue a hollow laugh and a farewell wave. But cue, too, continuing introspection.</p> <p>Our media world is awash in commentary and opinion. It increasingly majors on analysis and advocacy because digital can do breaking news in a flash. Commentators must make sense of what\u2019s happened, explaining the trends of history. They can bring expertise to bear on specific events and policies. But the biggest picture of the lot \u2013 landscape with earthquakes and floods \u2013 is hidden from view. As you move from the collapse of the Soviet Union to, <em>diminuendo</em>, the collapse of Cameron, surprise overwhelms prediction. (And Michael Gove is eerily right about such expertise.)</p> <p>Most compellingly, no one began even to hint at the political script that has played out over the last 12 months. No one today can be confident about anything in the passing parade. Look at that first Trump-Clinton debate. America\u2019s front pages led on tentative conclusions like \u201cRound one to Clinton\u201d (<em>Des Moines Register</em>) or holding bromides like \u201cFighting words\u201d (<em>Orange County Register</em>). Comment was suitably mixed too, from Democrat euphoria over the supposed outcome to <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/09/27/clinton-trump-round-one-a-draw-and-thats-bad-news-for-hillary/\" title=\"\">this from the <em>New York Post</em></a>: \u201cThe first debate was roughly a draw \u2013 which is bad news for Clinton, because she needs to turn this race around, and she failed.\u201d</p> <p>Danny Finkelstein in the <em>Times</em> was studiously cautious. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand anything in American politics unless you appreciate the demographics. People see things differently depending on who they are. A comment that strikes one person as unreasonable and rude will strike another as a bold and colourful salvo., telling it like it is, courageously defending their interests\u201d Which, coincidentally, is the basic conclusion of a new Pew Center study that finds Republicans and Democrats trapped in impermeable bubbles of their own experience, their whole existence shaped in different ways.</p> <p>Even facts we\u2019re supposed to accept as givens don\u2019t stand much scrutiny. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cgreat debate\u201d in audience terms. As <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/27/13074594/trump-clinton-debate-ratings-historic-disappointing\" title=\"\">Vox calculated</a>, \u201cthere are roughly 250 million Americans eligible to vote. So if roughly 81 million Americans watched the debate, that means only 33% of the population who can vote in November bothered to tune in\u201d. That\u2019s barely Reagan v Carter, never mind Nixon v Kennedy.</p> <p>And who knows what to make of Trump, this \u201cstrange, complex and comical figure\u201d, asks Chris Jones, theatre critic of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/2016/trump-lin-manuel-miranda-and-the-medias-post-debate-group-think/432420/\" title=\"\">talking to James Warren of the journalism website Poynter</a>. \u201cThe political class will scoff. The past is prologue. Ingrained assumptions rule. How could Trump\u2019s peevish, sexist stumbling positively impact insiders\u2019 targets of dissection, such as white suburban independent females? No way, right?\u201d</p> <p>Politics, in sum, has become an increasingly mystic, unpredictable business to write or think about. Last year\u2019s heroes are this year\u2019s rejects. The unknown voter always keeps his counsel. And one bit of testimony from James O\u2019Brien, of LBC and <em>Newsnight</em>, <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/james-obrien/james-o-brien-media-change-jeremy-corbyn/\" title=\"\">struck a chord last week</a>. \u201cThe media, myself included, now have to stop talking about Jeremy Corbyn like he is some sort of pimple on the backside of British politics and start talking about him as the only alternative prime minister to Theresa May.\u201d</p> <p>OK, countless pundits say Labour can\u2019t win. It\u2019s a risible story to write. But think back to Manchester 2015, ponder the months of upheaval: and remember the dictum of William Goldman, Hollywood scriptwriter supreme, with its message for pundits everywhere: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u25a0 James Purnell, former Labour minister, becomes BBC head of radio and much besides \u2013 poised to take on James Harding, monarch of news, and Charlotte Moore, monarch of TV, in the race to be next director general. Mild ructions follow. Can an ex-politician become theoretically supreme boss of <em>Today</em>? Which is rather like asking whether politics isn\u2019t a ball and chain you carry through later life. Purnell is an agile thinker who\u2019s made a new life for himself far beyond Westminster. He deserves his promotion, and chance.</p>"
