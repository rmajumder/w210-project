Disappointed by the harsh tone of Trump\u2019s Phoenix speech, the Republican National Committee <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/us/politics/donald-trump-rnc-reince-priebus.html?_r=0\">reportedly</a> withheld planned praise.</p> <p>\u201cHe pivots and then pivots right back,\u201d the Arizona senator Jeff Flake told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of a 360-degree pivot at times. That\u2019s not clear at all. Some people said it was hardening, some said softening. I say it was just confusing.\u201d</p> <p>Flake is one of a handful of Republican senators who have refused to support Trump, though he said on Sunday he would like to escape that \u201cuncomfortable\u201d position and vote for the businessman. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see a firm position that he sticks with for a while,\u201d he said, \u201cand obviously I\u2019d like to see a more realistic position in dealing with those who are here illegally now.\u201d</p> <p>But Flake also damned Trump with a hint of praise for his rival, Hillary Clinton, who has recently urged Republicans to remember that the businessman\u2019s claims that Mexicans are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">rapists</a>\u201d and refugees a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-warns-refugees-could-be-trojan-horse-for-u-s/\">Trojan horse</a>\u201d of terrorism do not reflect their party. </p> <p>\u201cFor people to be reminded that this is not what the party stands for I think is a good thing,\u201d Flake said. \u201cI wish more Republicans would say that as well. But if Hillary Clinton wants to say it I\u2019m glad \u2013 I\u2019m glad people, voters, are being reminded of it, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday night Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/772556213313765377\">responded on Twitter</a> \u2013 by bashing Flake. \u201cThe Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as Jeff Flake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he said. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/772571293438840832\">Shortly thereafter</a>, he elaborated: Flake, he said, was \u201ca very weak and ineffective senator\u201d.</p> <p>Trump and Flake had already clashed, exchanging sharp words in July when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-meeting-congress-republicans-divided-responses\">the Arizona senator confronted Trump</a> in a meeting with elected Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83f948a778a654583782a3dab8f706cd11dacee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83f948a778a654583782a3dab8f706cd11dacee/0_155_4720_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Phoenix\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump supporters during his immigration policy speech in Phoenix this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cruz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_clinton-5832.html\">the realclearpolitics.com poll average</a> for Arizona, which has been won by a Democratic presidential candidate once in 65 years, Trump leads Clinton by less than three points. However, a rapidly growing Hispanic population means the state\u2019s politics are turning steadily from red to purple, if not yet blue, prompting Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/hillary-clinton-arizona-advertising-immigration/\">advertise</a>. In attacking Flake, Trump is unlikely to aid his own Arizonan cause.</p> <p>Senator John McCain, Flake\u2019s fellow Arizona senator and the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, has started running an ad that look toward a hypothetical Clinton presidency.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy opponent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, is a good person,\u201d he says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAdOwaIQ-E \">in the ad</a>. \u201cBut if Hillary Clinton is elected president, Arizona will need a senator who will act as a check, not a rubber stamp, on the White House.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is conspicuously absent from the ad: his name unsaid, his image omitted and his ideas implicitly rejected as McCain tells voters: \u201cWe need more control over our borders but also smarter immigration policies that enforce the law and reflect our values.\u201d</p> <p>McCain has not explicitly rejected Trump, who last year mocked the Vietnam war veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">for having been captured</a> by the Vietcong, but he has repeatedly asked the businessman to apologize to other former prisoners of war. Months of such harsh rhetoric from Trump have painted Republicans like McCain in a corner, Flake admitted, by threatening to turn reliably red states like Arizona into swing states. </p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be up for grabs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut frankly it is.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018When America is safe, we will be open to all of the options\u2019</h2> <p>Even Trump\u2019s most stalwart allies could not seem to agree about his immigration message, even though the businessman said in Phoenix: \u201cYou can call it whatever the hell you want. They (undocumented immigrants) are gone.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that Trump had left \u201ca very big opening for what will happen with the people that remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen America is safe, we will be open to all of the options,\u201d Giuliani said. According to the former mayor, Trump \u201cwould find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that\u2019s been here for 15 years, and they have three children, two of whom are citizens. And that is not the kind of America he wants.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told ABC\u2019s This Week through crosstalk with the host that it was \u201ccorrect\u201d the businessman would deport more than just migrants with a criminal record \u2013 and then changed her tone. </p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cno, but he also said that, once you enforce the law, once you get rid of the criminals, then we\u2019ll see where we are.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be. We don\u2019t know who will be left. We don\u2019t know where they live, who they are. That\u2019s the whole point here, that we\u2019ve actually never tried this.\u201d</p> <p>The man who would serve Trump as vice-president, Indiana governor Mike Pence, evaded any clear answer about his running mate\u2019s position. In an interview aired Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/mike-pence-will-release-tax-returns-next-week\">with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press</a>, he said: \u201cWhat Donald Trump laid out this week in Arizona was really a roadmap to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Pence then rattled off some of Trump\u2019s ideas, including a wall on the southern border, targeting people who have overstayed visas and increasing border patrol staff, but left details for the future. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give consideration, working with the Congress, in a new and reformed immigration system, to consider it at that time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>All three said Trump would prioritize deportations of people with criminal records, the same strategy Barack Obama has taken during his two terms, during which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">record numbers of migrants have been deported</a> and Border Patrol staffing has reached an all-time high. Obama has also deferred deportations for several million migrants who came to the US as children through executive actions that Trump has said he will rescind.</p> <p>Giuliani also conceded the limits of Trump\u2019s shifting deportation plans, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">would eject between 4 and 11 million people</a> and cost <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/01/trumps-big-immigration-crackdown-comes-with-a-big-5-year-price-tag-more-than-50-billion/\">an estimated $50bn</a>. But he and Conway insisted that Trump will somehow force Mexico to pay for the proposed border wall, even though Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">told Trump this week</a> it would not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"831ff957c45156a52f27689a8fad0b3e5130fbcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/831ff957c45156a52f27689a8fad0b3e5130fbcf/0_18_4365_2619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Pena Nieto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Donald Trump shake hands after a meeting in Mexico City on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/who-will-win-presidential-election-2016-labor-day-prediction\">Who will win the presidential election?

That will be priority No1.\u201d<br></p> <p>Democrats had their own interpretations of Trump\u2019s positions on immigration. Labor Secretary Tom Perez told CNN that Trump was \u201ca loose cannon\u201d and said his week of Janus-faced speeches \u201cwas a perfect illustration of why he\u2019s not fit to be president\u201d. </p> <p>In a taped interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, Obama was more stoic, saying anti-immigrant sentiment could be traced to the founding of the US, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the majority of America\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe next generation of Americans, they utter \u2013 completely reject the kinds of positions that he\u2019s taking,\u201d the president said. \u201cSo overall, I\u2019m optimistic.

The community has its origins in the Balkan refugee crisis in the 1990s, when Yugoslavia was ripped apart at its seams, displacing millions. Bosnian refugees were resettled in St Louis by the thousands, and eventually the city became the anchor of the United States\u2019 Bosnian diaspora.</p> <p>Historically, Missouri has been a swing state, though is often assumed by pundits to be a Republican giveaway. In 2008, Republican John McCain won the state\u2019s electoral votes by a margin of less than 1% \u2013 mere thousands of votes. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney won the state by 10%, but liberal Democrat Claire McCaskill also kept her seat in the US Senate by more than 15%. The state also has a Democrat governor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I came here just like those Syrian refugees are coming here.

  "<p>An ailing Mao Zedong was presiding over the last knockings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\">Cultural Revolution </a>when the era of modern summitry was launched in a French chateau just outside Paris in late 1975. It\u2019s a reasonable bet that none of those present at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_G6_summit\">Rambouillet </a>envisaged that 43 years later the annual get-together for their successors would be in Hangzhou.</p> <p>The emergence of China as an economic superpower with its distinctive breed of state capitalism is a striking example of what has changed in the past four decades. Back then, the six developed nations represented at Rambouillet dominated the global economy. These days it would be inconceivable to hold a meeting to discuss trade, currencies or climate change without the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, the Russians and the Saudis. The G6 has become the G20.</p> <p>But while the guest list has expanded, the agenda has remained similar. The inspiration for Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s fireside chat in 1975 was the stagflation unleashed by the weakening of the post second world war boom, triggered by soaring oil prices. The summit was an attempt to reinvigorate the full employment model that had delivered record levels of growth over the previous quarter of a century, but it proved impossible to return to business as usual. Time was up for a generation represented by Harold Wilson and Gerald Ford, both attendees at Rambouillet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-g20-china-britain-stronger-relationships\">Theresa May to seek stronger relationships with G20 countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20\">G20 </a>was born in equally difficult circumstances. It met for the first time in Washington a couple of months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, just after the US had voted for Barack Obama to succeed George W Bush. As in the 1970s, the prevailing economic model had suffered system failure. This time the problem was caused by unfettered capital flows and over-exposed banks. Again the imperative was to return to business as usual as quickly as possible. Again, the attempt has been unsuccessful.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/imf-urges-g20-to-champion-globalisation-at-china-summit\">The extent of the failure was highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in the report it prepared for the Hangzhou G20.</a> \u201cThe weak outlook can further reduce incentives to invest and slow down trade, adding to demand shortfalls and limiting the room for productivity gains going forward. At the same time, income growth has not only been meagre, it has bypassed low-income earners in many countries, raising anxiety about globalisation and worsening the climate for political reform.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t need the skills of a Bletchley Park cryptographer to get the gist. The fund\u2019s message is that there is a lack of investment, a lack of good, well-paid jobs, and a growing disenchantment with the status quo. Hence Donald Trump and his plan to build a wall along the Rio Grande. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/26/brexit-is-the-rejection-of-globalisation\">Hence Brexit</a>, the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy, and the support for Marine Le Pen in France.</p> <p>To be sure, these trends can be over-stated. Governments of the centre-right and centre-left are still in power in Germany, Italy and France. The polls suggest Trump is going to lose to Hillary Clinton, and Le Pen is unlikely to be the next president of France. Greece\u2019s experiment with the radical left has not been an unalloyed success.</p> <p>But the fund is still right to be concerned. Globalisation was sold to voters in the west as a system that would deliver greater prosperity for all through more open markets. Yet as the IMF noted, the income for top earners in many developed countries has been rising while remaining stagnant for those at the bottom. The customers are not getting what it says on the tin.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/corruption-of-capitalism.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">new book</a>*, Guy Standing says it is a myth that the political and economic changes of the 1970s created free markets. Instead, he argues, globalisation has hastened the development of rigged markets dominated by \u201ca plutocracy and plutocratic corporations linked to concentrated financial capital that are able to gain increasing amounts of rental income by virtue of their wealth. Meanwhile wages are stagnating\u201d.</p> <p>Interestingly, this critique has echoes of another feature of the 1970s \u2013 the Alternative Economic Strategy (AES) developed by Tony Benn and his allies on the left of the Labour party. The main thrust of the strategy was that Britain\u2019s economic problems stemmed from the size and power of multinational corporations able to exploit their market power by pushing up prices while at the same time under-investing.</p> <p>Rejecting the idea that Keynesian demand management was sufficient to tackle what Benn called the \u201cspiral of decline\u201d in manufacturing, the AES provided a radical alternative. It involved public ownership of a company in each key sector of the economy, planning agreements with big private-sector companies, price controls, industrial democracy, curbs on imports and withdrawal from what was then the European Economic Community.</p> <p>While Benn and his allies were putting together the strategy, Mrs Thatcher was putting together what might be called the \u201calternative alternative economy strategy\u201d. There was agreement between Benn and Thatcher that British capitalism was in a bad way and a shared derision for the attempts to fix it by the Wilson and Callaghan governments. But there was disagreement about the remedy: Thatcher wanted to sweep away the physical and financial controls without which Benn\u2019s siege economy would not have been viable, and her idea of industrial democracy was to limit the power of the trade unions and restore the \u201cright to manage\u201d. Thatcher\u2019s opponents inside the Conservative party were as dismissive of her ideas as Benn\u2019s enemies inside the Labour party were of his. But only one of the alternative economic strategies was ever implemented, and it was not the left\u2019s.</p> <p>Decades later, there are again competing alternative economic strategies. On the right, Theresa May\u2019s plan to make Brexit work involves some themes familiar to those in the 1970s: workers on boards, an industrial strategy, the need for more public investment.</p> <p>On the left, the Labour party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, who is as critical of Labour\u2019s handling of the economy under Blair and Brown as the Bennites were of the policies pursued by Wilson and Callaghan.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/28/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-policy-careful-words-bold-intent\"> If Corbyn\u2019s approach has echoes of the AES</a> that\u2019s because the problems identified in the 1970s \u2013 hollowing out of manufacturing, under-investment and the power of multinational corporations \u2013 remain unresolved.</p> <p>Of course, pursuing an AES in the 2010s is a lot more difficult than it was in the 1970s. Globalisation has seen to that. It is also possible that the AES will be rejected by voters just as it was in 1983. But it is important to understand why Corbyn sees a role for nationalising the train operating companies, why he would set up a national investment bank, and why he retains a strong degree of Euroscepticism. His critique, that there is something dysfunctional about modern industrial capitalism, has not changed since he was a supporter of Benn in the 1970s and 1980s. And, after a decade of crisis, recession and austerity, that\u2019s perhaps unsurprising.<br></p> <p>* <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/corruption-of-capitalism.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Corruption of Capitalism</a> by Guy Standing (Biteback, \u00a317.99).

  "<p>Blasberg beams as he greets this woman who apologises for missing his birthday. (It\u2019s 22 April which is also World Earth Day, a coincidence, Blasberg jokes, because \u201cI\u2019m so grounded.\u201d) The woman tried to send flowers but she\u2019s so unsure of where he is these days that she wasn\u2019t certain of the best address to send them to. Blasberg demurs: that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a lovely surprise to see her here, given there are no wedding dresses on show anywhere, he teases, impishly. But he\u2019s forgetting himself; he introduces me to the woman. And this, he says, is Vera.</p> <p>And that\u2019s how I met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vera-wang\">Vera Wang</a>. As we head off \u2013 after Blasberg\u2019s invited Wang to a party later at his friend Lauren Santo Domingo\u2019s house, naturally \u2013 I tell him I\u2019m impressed: not everyone gets called Honeybear by Vera Wang. Self-deprecating as ever, Blasberg shrugs. Maybe Vera calls everyone that. Maybe she\u2019s forgotten his name.</p> <p>Somehow, I doubt it. Even if you don\u2019t know Blasberg\u2019s name \u2013 if you don\u2019t read him in <em>Vanity Fair</em>, if you don\u2019t watch him on CNN Style, if you\u2019re not one of his half a million followers on Instagram \u2013 fashion folks know Blasberg. While I was shadowing him for this piece I was inundated with people enthusing over how adorable, smart and funny he is. How well-liked. How well-connected. You don\u2019t need to take my word for it. Even a cursory glance over his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/derekblasberg/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> feed shows him snuggly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and cuddly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/mar/23/matt-lever-behind-the-runway-fashion-shows-karlie-kloss-cara-delevingne\">Karlie Kloss</a>, cosy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/09/jessica-chastain-myth-women-dont-get-along-jennifer-lawrence-fight\">Jessica Chastain</a> and matey with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung\">Alexa Chung</a>, sandwiched between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dolce-and-gabbana\">Dolce and Gabbana</a> and touchy-feely with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/picture/2014/jan/22/keira-knightley-proenza-schouler-jack-ryan-premiere\">Proenza Schouler</a>, moody with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> and all smiles with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/05/pressandpublishing.popandrock\">David Geffen</a>, at the theatre with <em>Girls</em>\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/30/-sp-allison-williams-girls-nbc-peter-pan\">Allison Williams</a> and at the Met Ball with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/katy-perry\">Katy Perry</a>, lip-synching to Prince. For a \u201cnobody\u201d, he sure knows a lot of somebodys.</p> <p>Blasberg studied dramatic literature at university and seems to have a liking for Tennessee Williams; and it\u2019s lines from <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> that spring to mind when I watch him in action. Whether he\u2019s in the plush apartment of Carine Roitfeld, or at the aforementioned party at Santo Domingo\u2019s Paris mansion, at which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell\">Naomi Campbell </a>will turn up, Blasberg seems to \u201cmove in a continual spotlight\u201d. Always running or bounding, never just walking. Always seeming to be at the point of defeating gravity.</p> <p>And given what Blasberg\u2019s achieved, I wouldn\u2019t bet on gravity to win that bout. So what, you might not unreasonably ask, has he achieved?</p> <p>It\u2019s true that journalism \u2013 especially Blasberg\u2019s fashiony, styley, arty stuff\u2013 isn\u2019t exactly akin to splitting the atom. Nor has his journey from Missouri to glossy New York and beyond been like climbing Everest backwards and blindfolded. And yet, Blasberg\u2019s ascent is to be admired, because, partly, it\u2019s the American Dream: a smalltown boy with big ambitions goes to the even bigger city where he makes those ambitions a reality \u2013 a job at <em>Vanity Fair</em>! A job at the <a href=\"http://www.gagosian.com/\">Gagosian Gallery</a>! A job on CNN! \u2013 through hard work, charm and an extraordinary gift for networking. Blasberg has managed to turn what essentially could have been an endless, vacuous and soul-destroying whirl of cocktail parties, magazine launches and exhibition openings into the foundation for a powerbase.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His greatest skill remains his social climbing. And many people are very envious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blasberg has power, influence, connections. They may, for now, be largely confined to the fashion industry and its associated social bubbles but when that industry is estimated to be worth $3 trillion annually, power in that sphere translates into money. Blasberg is the living embodiment of the old adage that it\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know. He says he doesn\u2019t have a work-life endgame but I\u2019m not sure I believe him. He\u2019s been playing pretty good game up until now.</p> <p>When I asked Ellana Lee, senior vice president and managing editor at CNN International, why she chose Blasberg to front the resurrected <em>CNN Style</em>, she said, \u201cWe wanted to find a host who could connect with our audiences in different ways, and Derek offers that \u2013 knowledge of the industry, huge charisma, and an impressive, sizeable social media presence.\u201d Which, when you boil it down, means: a fusty \u201cold media\u201d brand like CNN needs someone modern and connected. Lee\u2019s calculation certainly paid off: it was Blasberg who landed them a <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2016/05/13/exp-cnn-style-naomi-campbell-vogue.cnn\">Naomi Campbell interview</a>, Blasberg who landed them <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2016/07/12/carine-roitfeld-french-style.cnn\">Roitfeld</a>, and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2016/07/08/karl-lagerfeld-chanel-haute-couture-style-tv.cnn\">Karl Lagerfeld</a>, who, Blasberg tells me, will only use fax to organise anything. \u201cDo you know how difficult it is to find a fax machine in Switzerland?\u201d he faux-grimaces. \u201cEmail, Karl! Email!\u201d</p> <p>So how does a boy from Missouri \u2013 who spent his Halloweens dressed, variously, as Tutankhamun, a vampire and the first George Bush \u2013 transform himself into the fashion world\u2019s BFF, dressed today in a double-breasted Vuitton suit, Berlutti shoes and a Gucci belt? Because, put simply, Blasberg is something of a phenomenon. A digital Capote, a Gatsby of the Instagram age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:37.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCkW5v7jnHo/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">The King and I @karllagerfeld \ud83d\ude0e</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Derek Blasberg (@derekblasberg) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-03-05T10:31:49+00:00\">Mar 5, 2016 at 2:31am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I was growing up I wasn\u2019t aware of fashion as an industry,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no <em>America\u2019s Next Top Model</em>, no <em>Project Runway</em>. You didn\u2019t know what a stylist was or what an art director was. There was a photographer and a model and everything else was a mystery.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, it was through his interests in photography and in art that Blasberg alighted on fashion as the sphere in which to carve a career. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I decorated all four walls of my room, and eventually my ceiling, with collages I had made of pictures I liked: of the Kennedys, of Marilyn Monroe, of Kate Moss\u2026 I also liked Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. I liked old-school glamour at a young age. Have you heard of The Secret? That you visualise stuff until it happens? I never did The Secret but that\u2019s sorta what I was doing, I guess. I wanted to be where the action was.\u201d</p> <p>And the action was in New York, where Blasberg\u2019s ascent began in earnest. After graduating from university where, by all accounts, he was popular and where his skill as a \u201cpeople person\u201d was honed, he landed a job as an assistant at American <em>Vogue</em>. \u201cI was a pretty terrible assistant,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was there about a year. I wasn\u2019t very organised. Ten per cent was writing but 90% was updating contracts, Excel spreadsheets and taking meticulous notes.

She\u2019s an animal\u201d \u2013 Blasberg got organised and threw himself into work, toiling for the likes of <em>Harper\u2019s Bazaar</em>, <em>Interview</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. Along the way, he fattened up his contacts book in the way that a farmer might stuff a goose for the production of foie gras. But he has had a sideline that\u2019s aided his progress. He\u2019s made himself useful as a walker, the latest in a tradition popularised in the 1980s by Nancy Reagan among others, whereby a single, usually gay man would chaperone unaccompanied women to events. Blasberg\u2019s choices of companion \u2013 Roman Abramovich\u2019s wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dasha-zhukova\">Dasha Zhukova</a>, for example \u2013 show impeccable taste and judgment. And his role \u2013 \u201ca flirt but never a threat\u201d (as Stephen Sondheim calls Bobby in <em>Company</em>) \u2013 has served him well in cementing his position as the must-have accessory, making it difficult to find anyone with anything bad to say about Blasberg.</p> <p>Difficult, but not impossible. \u201cDerek\u2019s greatest achievement remains his social climbing \u2013 and that he\u2019s been so extraordinarily good at it means that many in the fashion industry are very envious of his \u2018achievement\u2019,\u201d said one person I spoke to. They asked not to be named, lest the froideur of Blasberg be directed towards them. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen,\u201d said this fashion insider, \u201cand it ain\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true what they say: fashion is a bitchy business, and while its denizens don\u2019t eat much, they gorge on sour grapes. But where many fresh-faced wannabes from flyover states find themselves chewed up and spat out, Blasberg has thrived. Why? It comes down to two key things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e16aff1c0728498b8598b0edaa4e71184612b1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e16aff1c0728498b8598b0edaa4e71184612b1b/336_124_1395_1811/770.jpg\" alt=\"Vera Wang and Derek Blasberg, arm in arm, posing for the camera\" width=\"770\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man of the moment: with Vera Wang in Miami Beach, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Dom Perignon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, Blasberg is charismatic. You may have someone like Blasberg in your life. Someone who makes you feel like you\u2019re the only person in the room. A bit taller, more interesting, wittier. I can confirm this first-hand: Blasberg\u2019s attention is blissful, moreish and almost disarming.</p> <p>Second, Blasberg is, or at least does a damned good job of appearing to be, happy \u2013 or, perhaps, confident. There is not a hint of a secret sadness or insecurity about him. Or as he puts it breezily, \u201cI\u2019m not damaged, sorry!\u201d And he\u2019s not damaged, I imagine, because of his upbringing. As he explains, \u201cBecause my parents provided me with a traditional and solid foundation, I like to think that I\u2019m fairly well-equipped for the follies, fabulousness and frivolities of an industry like this. Some of the most successful people are hard-working and smart and good to be around.\u201d</p> <p>And here\u2019s the nub of Blasberg\u2019s appeal within an industry populated by brittle, neurotic, unhappy and damaged-to-the-point-of-deranged people. Like Santa at an orphanage, he comes bearing the most precious gifts of all: acceptance and the (brief) respite from the wretched feeling of being less-than, a feeling on which the fashion industry was founded and a feeling that it fuels in others in order to make its billions. As Amanda Wingfield says in <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, \u201cHe smiled \u2013 the world was enchanted!\u201d And so it is.</p> <p>So does Blasberg feel important? \u201cEr, no,\u201d he bristles. \u201cWhat douchebag would say they did? No. I feel more so than ever that I am part of this industry but the shows are still going to happen if I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p> <p>Does he feel popular then? \u201cThere\u2019s is a difference between popular and important, isn\u2019t there? I don\u2019t think everyone who\u2019s popular is important. I will not say I\u2019m popular nor will I say I\u2019m important \u2013 because that\u2019s a really assholey thing to say. You can feel free to say it though\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Given his otherwise breezy demeanour, Blasberg\u2019s guardedness can turn the atmosphere a little chilly. When he doesn\u2019t like a question, he either answers a different question or pirouettes to avoid it. For example, when I ask him what it\u2019s like being an American abroad at the moment \u2013 the moment being defined by the rise and rise of Trump \u2013 his defences go up and I get a glimpse of the colder side of this erstwhile Mr Sunshine. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being a Brit abroad, with your Brexit,\u201d he retorts. \u201cIt\u2019s neither here nor there. It\u2019s fine.\u201d But then, to be fair, he\u2019s thoughtful. \u201cAmerica is having an interesting time. New York is staunchly and fiercely Democrat, and so is LA and when you get to the middle\u2026 When I go home [to Missouri], there are Trump signs in the neighbourhood.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aef2c096f42de18c16f6c747c22906be74669420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef2c096f42de18c16f6c747c22906be74669420/271_42_2923_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladies\u2019 man: in Brooklyn, New York, with Lauren Santo Domingo, Harley Viera-Newton, Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung, Jos\u00e9phine de la Baume and Poppy Delevingne. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladies\u2019 man: in Brooklyn, New York, with Lauren Santo Domingo, Harley Viera-Newton, Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung, Jos\u00e9phine de la Baume and Poppy Delevingne. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pham/bfa.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And how does that make him feel? \u201cNot particularly excited,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m with her [meaning Hillary]. I\u2019m with anyone but him.\u201d</p> <p>But back to Blasberg himself. Given his Instagram following \u2013 which rises almost 30,000 in the month that I\u2019m in his orbit \u2013 does he accept that he has clout? \u201cFive hundred thousand is a nice number but it\u2019s not big numbers. You follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/selenagomez/?hl=en\">Selena Gomez</a>? She\u2019s got 96 million.\u201d</p> <p>When I point out that comparing himself to Selena Gomez is ridiculous, he becomes suddenly serious: \u201cI\u2019m 34 years old. I\u2019ve worked hard to get clout, be that in social media or in the industry or with the people I work with. You\u2019re taking for granted that popularity is on the tip of my brain when I\u2019m working and it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>So what is? \u201cIf I get a lot of Instagram Likes, that makes me feel good that I\u2019ve been informing and amusing. Probably more the latter than the former. But that\u2019s why I do what I do. Likewise, if something doesn\u2019t get a lot of Likes, I feel as if I\u2019ve underinformed or underamused. Life, for better or for worse, is now about the Likes.\u201d</p> <p><em>Derek Blasberg presents </em>CNN Style <em>on CNN International, Sunday 11 September at 1930 BST and Wednesday 14 September at 1730 BST <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/style\">www.cnn.com/style</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Sheena Monnin saw beauty pageants as a way to fulfill her potential \u2013 she never imagined they\u2019d be the gateway through which Donald Trump would try to destroy her life. Even now, she insists, the debacle has not made her anti-pageant, just anti-Trump.</p> <p>Monnin got her start as a teenager in 2002, when she was spotted at a mall in Orlando by a woman who worked in the pageant industry. At first she was surprised to be singled out for her looks given her modest height, but when she started watching the contests on television, she was seized by the pageants\u2019 vision of beauty. \u201cI remember walking up and down the living room and copying their poses,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI always had the image of the ideal woman in my mind, and part of what helped me reach for that was my pageant education and acting like a lady.\u201d</p> <p>Soon she was competing in pageants every year and, with the help of coaches, a careful diet, and a rigorous exercise routine, she could feel herself beginning to resemble the \u201clady\u201d she envisioned. In a few years, she would be winning pageant titles, including Miss Pennsylvania, in 2012, at the age of 26. But it was competing in Trump\u2019s Miss USA pageant the same year in Las Vegas that would alter the course of her young adult life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb292225c862d7f6318b5c0ecbc1510c474c3c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb292225c862d7f6318b5c0ecbc1510c474c3c9/0_74_1973_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheena Monnin competing in the 2012 Miss USA competition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheena Monnin competing in the 2012 Miss USA competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During that competition, according to Monnin, another contestant, Karina Brez of Florida, insisted to several women backstage mid-pageant that she already knew who the top five final contestants would be, and specifically, that she had seen the names of the pre-selected women listed in a notebook at the back of the stage. </p> <p>Though Monnin never saw such a notebook herself, when contestants Brez had predicted were later selected, Monnin came to the conclusion that the pageant was rigged. <br></p> <p>The Trump Organization denied allegations of favoritism and Brez later said what she had seen was a \u201crehearsal list\u201d and that she was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/322220/miss-florida-to-giuliana-rancic-miss-penn-s-been-taking-pageant-rigging-claim-way-too-far\">joking</a>\u201d. Brez did not return the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment.</p> <p>But<strong> </strong>this year, Miss Universe judge Jeff Lee admitted in <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/mr-miss-universe-jeff-lee\">GQ</a> that Trump \u2013 who from 1996 to 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/univision-donald-trump-miss-universe-mexican-immigrants\">owned or co-owned</a> both Miss Universe and Miss USA \u2013 frequently had a say in which women made the final round. According to the story\u2019s author, Burt Helm: \u201cLee will tell you that from 2005 until Donald Trump sold the Miss Universe pageant last year, the billionaire quietly handpicked as many as six semifinalists \u2013 \u2018Trump cards\u2019, they were called.\u201d Helm said that lower-level beauty pageant picks were so often subject to \u201cmassaging\u201d that this was considered an \u201copen secret\u201d among former contestants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy\">Trump and Atlantic City: the lessons behind the demise of his casino empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If so, this \u201copen secret\u201d had not been shared with Monnin, and she resigned her Miss Pennsylvania crown in protest. </p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until she wrote a post on Facebook about the situation that things started getting out of hand.</p> <p>Monnin\u2019s post was strongly worded and to the point. </p> <p>She wrote: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have decided to resign my position as Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012. Effective immediately I have voluntarily, completely, and utterly removed myself from the Miss Universe Organization. In good conscience I can no longer be affiliated in any way with an organization I consider to be fraudulent, lacking in morals, inconsistent, and in many ways trashy. </p> <p>I do not support this system in any way. In my heart I believe in honesty, fair play, a fair opportunity, and high moral integrity, none of which in my opinion are part of this pageant system any longer. </p> <p>Thank you all for your support and understanding as I walk a road I never dreamed I\u2019d need to walk, as I take a stand I never dreamed I\u2019d need to take. After 10 years of competing in a pageant system I once believed in, I now completely and irrevocably separate myself in every way and on every level from the Miss Universe Organization. I remove my support completely and have turned in the title of Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>(In a separate letter of resignation to the pageant organizers, Monnin also cited the inclusion of transgender women in the contest that year as a reason for her returning her title. She told the Guardian that she had no problem with the inclusion of transgender contestants in pageants generally, but that she was upset that the rules had been changed in 2012 without notice. \u201cThe point I was trying to make \u2013 and I don\u2019t think I made it well \u2013 is that they changed the contract and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\u201d)</p> <p>Monnin\u2019s aim in writing the Facebook post, she told the Guardian, was simply to explain her decision to friends. Back then her page was mostly set to private, she added, and she had just a few hundred Facebook friends.</p> <p>But Trump, having seen the post, did what he often does in the face of petty insults \u2013 he escalated the conflict exponentially. Specifically, he used his platform as a person in the public eye to cast aspersions on Monnin and impugn her reputation on national TV. Speaking on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America the next day, Trump called Monnin\u2019s claims \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d and her character worse.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe suffers from a thing called \u2018loser\u2019s remorse\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"https://gma.yahoo.com/organization-denies-miss-pennsylvania-sheena-monnins-claim-pageant-074006712--abc-news-topstories.html\">he said</a>. \u201cShe lost, and if you looked at her compared to people who were in the top 15, you would understand why she was not in the top 15.\u201d </p> <p>Trump said his organization would be bringing a lawsuit against her, detailing his intentions <a href=\"http://www.today.com/id/47702741/ns/today-today_style/t/trump-were-suing-miss-pennsylvania-over-claims/#.V8ATaZMrKV4\">in a second appearance</a> on NBC\u2019s Today. And when Monnin <a href=\"http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/06/former-miss-pennsylvania-claims-miss-universe-pageant-rigged-today-show/\">appeared on the same show</a> days later to defend herself, Trump sued her for $10m for defamation.</p> <p>Trump has never been one to let an insult go. A decade ago, when a biographer estimated his net worth was much lower than he claimed, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/25/books.usa\">Trump sued</a> the author, a New York Times business reporter, for $5bn. This election cycle, he has made the disproportionate deployment of force a point of pride, maybe even a credo, saying: \u201cAnybody who hits me, we\u2019re going to hit them 10 times harder.\u201d There at least, Trump has been as good as his word \u2013 his sharp tongue typically starts the fights, but it is his lawyers who finish them.</p> <p>In 2012, Monnin was completely blindsided by the lawsuit. \u201cThere was no way I could have afforded to pay that off and frankly, he had to have known that,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s $10m suit. \u201cI was just a normal person.\u201d At 27, she had no legal experience or connections, and had never seen anything approaching that kind of money. She was still paying off her degree from the online university she attended, and making strides to grow a small business.</p> <p>Unlike Trump, she did not come from privilege. Her family had to move every few years for her father\u2019s business, work which took them to Florida, Texas, New York, Kentucky and the Carolinas before she was grown. Sometimes her parents would take in foster kids in the cities where they lived, but they never stayed anywhere long.</p> <p>The three years she spent battling Trump and his lawyers she recalls as the most traumatic period of her life. Family helped keep her feeling grounded and protected, she said, but there were still mornings when she didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. \u201cMy focus was getting through each day and getting through what was going on around me and understanding my options,\u201d she said of that period. \u201cEvery day seemed to bring a new legal document that I didn\u2019t understand, that I had to seek legal counsel on.\u201d</p> <p>As recently as last year, Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen bragged to the Daily Beast about the time he \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/31/trump-lawyer-bragged-i-destroyed-a-beauty-queen-s-life.html\">destroy[ed</a>]\u201d Monnin\u2019s life. Attempting to intimidate a Beast reporter, Cohen said: \u201cDo you want to destroy your life? It\u2019s going to be my privilege to serve it to you on a silver platter like I did that idiot from Pennsylvania in Miss USA.\u201d Monnin rebuffs the notion her life was destroyed, but concedes Trump succeeded in the short term and not just with regard to making her feel small and afraid. \u201cThere was this message being sent out to all the contestants: you better not say anything bad about us. And that\u2019s how the other young ladies felt.\u201d It may have worked: not one of the women whom Monnin said sent supportive messages after Trump attacked her came forward to defend her in public, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/06/13/exclusive-second-miss-usa-contestant-says-overheard-list-top-5-finalists-before.html\">though one did anonymously defend her story to Fox News</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s no secret that Trump is incredibly litigious. A recent <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/\">investigation by USA Today</a> tallied 3,500 lawsuits involving Trump. He gets sued quite a bit, but mostly he does the suing, filing 1,900 suits, including many \u2013 like the one against Monnin \u2013 for defamation. He has sued biographers, journalists, business partners, even an ex-wife and a Native American tribe, but he has threatened to sue even more. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is a former schoolyard bully who was sent away to military school to learn proper behavior,\u201d says biographer Harry Hurt III, author of Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J Trump. \u201cThat schooling obviously failed. Trump has matured, if one can use that term, into a courthouse bully.\u201d</p> <p>Another biographer, Michael D\u2019Antonio, Pulitzer-winning author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Never-Enough-Donald-Pursuit-Success/dp/1250042380\">Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success</a>, chose the same metaphor in describing the difficulty in getting sources \u2013 even people with every reason to hate Trump \u2013 to go on the record speaking against him: \u201cIt\u2019s a strange bullying kind of process. Like how in the schoolyard, a lot of kids will go to the bully\u2019s side of the conflict because they\u2019re afraid of what might happen to them if they\u2019re not in his favor.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s an all too familiar narrative to Monnin. \u201cThat is not a sign of a good leader if that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to treat someone who you don\u2019t like,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Interestingly and tellingly, Trump himself seems on at least one occasion to have conflated the terms \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201cpresidential\u201d. When Fox News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren prompted him to elaborate on what he meant by being more \u201cpresidential\u201d, he began by saying, \u201cIt means maybe not be so aggressive, maybe not get so personal,\u201d but quickly reverted to his favorite formula for leadership: \u201cBut you know what happens? What happens is they hit me and I hit them back harder, and usually in all cases, they do it first. But they hit me and I hit them back harder and they disappear. That\u2019s what we want to lead the country.\u201d</p> <p>Monnin lost large swaths of her late 20s, from 27 on, doing legal battle with Trump, or more accurately, trying ineffectually to navigate the maze of legalese he threw in her way. The lawyer she hired was so inadequately prepared he failed to appear at the arbitration hearing in November 2012 at which the fate of the case with Trump was decided \u2013 nor did he even tell her it was happening. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c135273dab21a8cc25e1e81e6f1cab9a57b82da4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c135273dab21a8cc25e1e81e6f1cab9a57b82da4/0_99_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, left, and Erin Brady pose onstage after Brady won the 2013 Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, left, and Erin Brady pose onstage after Brady won the 2013 Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Bottari/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Monnin only realized she had missed the chance to defend herself against the mogul the following month, when she received correspondence from her lawyer notifying her that the arbitration had gone forward without anyone present on her behalf. But by then it was too late for Monnin to mount her case. In December 2012, arbitrator Theodore Katz ordered Monnin pay the Trump organization $5m for defamation.</p> <p>Trump issued a self-congratulatory press release: \u201cWe cannot allow a disgruntled contestant to make false and reckless statements which are damaging to the many people who have devoted their hearts and souls to the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageant systems,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I feel very badly for Sheena, she did the wrong thing. She was really nasty, and we had no choice. It is an expensive lesson for her.\u201d </p> <p>Monnin <a href=\"#ixzz2GY0ySz2V\">resolved to \u201cfight\u201d</a> the ruling,  but she no longer trusted her lawyer to do the job.</p> <p>In January 2013, her father, Philip Monnin, wrote a letter on her behalf to J Paul Oetken, the Manhattan federal judge who\u2019d been asked to sign off on the arbitrator\u2019s ruling, arguing that the hefty fee for damages was not \u201cjust\u201d. But it did little good. In July 2013, Oetken upheld the arbitration decision. \u201cThe court does not take lightly that Monnin is compelled to pay what is a devastating monetary award,\u201d Oetken wrote in his decision. \u201cMoreover, Monnin undeniably is suffering from her poor choice of counsel ... [But] sympathy, or apparent inequity, may play no role in a court\u2019s legal analysis, and here, the law is clear.\u201d </p> <p>In his ruling, the judge even went so far as to acknowledge that her lawyer did not appear to be acting in her best interests. \u201cBlindly, but perhaps understandably, Monnin put her trust in her attorney, believing that he would represent her interests,\u201d Oetken wrote, adding, \u201cUnfortunately, [he] chose to ignore the responsibilities owed to his client, along with the ethical duties governing his profession.\u201d</p> <p>In fall 2013, Monnin hired a new lawyer and filed a suit against her former lawyer for malpractice. The details of the settlement of this suit are protected, but Monnin has said that the upshot meant she never had to pay Trump a dollar out of her own pocket. </p> <p>Now, at the age of 31, Monnin says she is able to see some silver linings in the experience. It\u2019s not the same set of ideals she had in mind as a teenager when she watched the pageant girls deliver their lines \u2013 though she cherishes all she learned in that realm. It\u2019s not even about the satisfaction of having spoken up about her convictions, despite real legal consequences, and pulled through. The experience taught her to empathize and connect with other victims of bullying, and crucially, to help them feel less alone.</p> <p>In June she published a self-help book, Hands on the Wheel: Getting Control of Your Life, which draws on her experience being bullied by Trump to help advise readers in dealing with bullies wherever they may find them. \u201cI cover almost every topic imaginable, because I want people, no matter what their controlling factor looks like, to know there are ways to stand your ground and not stoop down to the bully\u2019s level,\u201d she said. \u201cThe advice I give is it\u2019s not appropriate to cower down and give in to people who are using their strength in such a negative way.\u201d</p> <p>The book aims to transcend the political election cycle in favor of the universal; Monnin only delves into her experience with Trump in the foreword. But as an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton, she is only too happy to help interpret what Trump\u2019s shock-and-awe legal tactics could mean in an Oval Office setting: \u201cIf you have someone who goes after me, a normal person, when all I did was write something on Facebook that he disagreed with, then what would happen if you had a real grievance against him and you started speaking out?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Chicago is on pace to see as many as 650 or 700 murders this year, more than any year since the early 2000s, and likely more than the total murders in New York and Los Angeles combined. <br></p> <p>Through the end of the day Friday, Chicago had seen 475 murders \u2013 just six less than in all of last year, according to police department statistics. The city has already exceeded last year\u2019s total number of gun-related homicides, with 430. <br></p> <p>As violence rises, an increasing number of shootings and murders are going unsolved. Through 28 August, the police department had only made arrests in 73 of the nearly 2,000 non-fatal shooting incidents so far this year \u2013 or just under 4%, according to a department spokesman. </p> <p>The clearance rate for murders is not much better. Last Sunday, police swiftly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-nykea-aldridge-men-charged\">charged two brothers</a> in the murder of Nykea Aldridge, a 32-year-old mother of four, who was shot to death the Friday before while pushing a stroller on her way to register her kids for school. Her shooting had made national headlines because she was the cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade, who mourned <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DwyaneWade/status/769350076162383872\">her death publicly </a>as \u201cunreal\u201d and \u201canother act of senseless gun violence\u201d.</p> <p>But the quick charges in Aldridge\u2019s case are an exception. Police have only made arrests in about 16% of fatal shootings through 28 August this year, according to a department spokesperson. Through June, the clearance rate for all murders was 22.2%. That\u2019s lower than last year\u2019s rate of 30.4%, and dramatically lower than the national average of 64.5%, according to the most recent available national FBI data. </p> <p>Overall arrests in Chicago also have dropped 27% compared with last year, according to police statistics. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/chicago-guns-child-execution-tyshawn-lee-gang-violence\">Chicago gun epidemic, out of control: the execution of nine-year-old Tyshawn Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Illinois governor Bruce Rauner <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-bruce-rauner-chicago-violence-national-guard-met-20160831-story.html\">said on Wednesday</a> that he did not believe it was appropriate to call in the National Guard, a perennial political talking point in response to violence in Chicago. </p> <p>\u201cNo thoughtful leader thinks that\u2019s a good idea or would really provide a solution.

The blood was from Winters\u2019 face, where he had been shot twice by a man in a ski mask, and his chest, where the third bullet struck. As neighbors looked on and police knocked on doors, television news helicopters appeared overhead, marking what detectives wouldn\u2019t say to onlookers: after being rushed to the hospital in critical condition, Winters had succumbed to his wounds.</p> <p>This was now a homicide scene.</p> <p>\u201cI just remember that he wasn\u2019t even really running,\u201d said Tynika Garner of the shooter. \u201cI would say he was trotting.\u201d</p> <p>Garner watched from the kitchen window of her mother\u2019s Marquette Park home as the shooter \u2013 his face covered in a black ski mask and carrying a silver pistol \u2013 casually left the 33-year-old lying bleeding in the street. The shots woke up Garner\u2019s mother, 66-year-old Shirlene Garner, from an afternoon nap. Shirlene then watched a tragic scene unfold.</p> <p>Winters\u2019 mother ran to her son, pleading with him to stay alive.</p> <p>\u201cShe was begging him to stay with her,\u201d Shirlene recalled. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see him breathing very well.

At the time of writing, the New York Times projects that she has a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">86%</a> chance of winning in November, and FiveThirtyEight puts her chances at <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">69%</a>. </p> <p>But these probabilities don\u2019t take into account the fact that polls have become plagued by systemic issues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">from low response rates to media biases</a>, that have made them sometimes unreliable. What\u2019s more, in polling (much like every other type of human interaction), it\u2019s hard to tell whether people mean what they say. Are Trump supporters reluctant to share their views when a stranger from Ipsos, Rasmussen or Gallup calls them up? If so, Clinton could be in trouble.</p> <p>Forecasting the political future means considering not one probability but many possibilities. Here are the three most likely outcomes in this election.</p> <h2>Hillary Clinton wins</h2> <p>Over the past 20 years, there are just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/ohio-swing-state-republican-national-convention-clinton-trump\">19 states</a> that have flipped between the two main parties at least once. Many of those states are also on the list of closely fought contests this year: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire. Clinton\u2019s hopes rest on voters choosing her and those who might vote Trump staying home.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s rhetoric in the coming months will be important for securing these victories. The former secretary of state needs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/sanders-supporters-clinton-vote-survey\">convince</a> former Bernie Sanders supporters that she shares the values that galvanized so many young voters. Similarly, Clinton needs to persuade voters that she is the only way Americans can keep Donald Trump out of the White House.</p> <h2>Donald Trump wins</h2> <p>Like Clinton, Trump needs to focus his energies on mobilizing supporters to actually go to the polls. Although demographics don\u2019t seem to work in his favor (his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/angry-white-men-love-donald-trump\">supporters</a> make up a relatively small fraction of the overall electorate) it is quite possible that Trump\u2019s support is understated in polls. Polling analysis appears to privilege left-of-centre ideas (and many of the journalists who interpret polls, including this journalist, may be viewing the numbers with a misplaced optimism) which helps explains why forecasts about the British EU referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/mar/18/israel-election-why-were-the-exit-polls-wrong\">the Israeli election</a> and the Scottish independence referendum were all off the mark. </p> <p>There\u2019s another factor in this election which may well work in Trump\u2019s favor: third party candidates. Between them, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein stand to pick up <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">11%</a> of the national vote. Votes for Johnson and Stein appear more likely to erode Clinton\u2019s vote share than Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>Those third-party candidates have a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/gary-johnson-presidential-debates-227654\">slim chance</a> of making it to the presidential debates (they need to be polling with at least <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">15%</a> of the national electorate\u2019s support to qualify), meaning Trump will want to sow what doubt and frustration he can in Democratic-leaning voters, in order to convince them to stay home or vote for a third party candidate.</p> <p>Sexism could also benefit Donald Trump. In a <a href=\"https://www.pershing.com/our-thinking/thought-leadership/americans-crave-a-new-kind-of-leader-and-women-are-ready-to-deliver\">survey</a> of more than 2,000 US adults in 2014, only 74% of women and 58% of men agreed that there are not enough women in positions of power.</p> <h2>Hillary Clinton wins by a landslide</h2> <p>The mere fact this is a possibility shows just how much uncertainty there is around this election. And it is a real possibility, even though more than 20 years have passed since anyone won by a double-digit margin. For a start, the distribution of US electoral college votes privileges the Democratic party. Together, Democratic \u201csafe\u201d states (those that have voted Democratic consistently in the past six presidential elections) yield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/may/06/donald-trump-odds-winning-us-election-reality-check\">242</a> of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. States that Republicans can reliably count on have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/may/06/donald-trump-odds-winning-us-election-reality-check\">102</a> electoral votes.</p> <p>As a Democrat and a seasoned politician, Clinton is the most likely candidate to represent continuity in the minds of many voters. Past elections have also shown that even after contemplating the different options, voters tend to revert towards the status quo in the final days before casting their ballot. Then again, this is no ordinary election.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 5 September 2016. An earlier version said that of the 19 states that have flipped between the two main parties at least once in the last 20 years, around two-thirds of those are likely to be closely fought this year. It went on to list several states, implying those in the list were also among the 19. The list was of the states likely to be closely fought this year, and included some of the 19, as well as others that have previously been safe seats. This has been corrected. </li> </ul>",
  "<p>Donald Trump shared some marital advice at a recent campaign stop in Virginia: \u201cIf your wife got angry with you,\u201d he said, \u201csay: \u2018I\u2019m just sorry, Charlotte, I\u2019m going out to vote for Trump.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As his poll numbers are cratering among every demographic except white men, support for the Republican nominee is dividing couples at a level far beyond the last presidential election. A new poll exclusive to the Guardian reveals that in households across the US, Trump is fueling a deep split among married couples. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/secret-donald-trump-voters-speak-out\">'Not even my wife knows': secret Donald Trump voters speak out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the online poll of 1,249 adults who have been in a relationship since at least 2012, polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs asked whether spouses\u2019 political leanings had diverged in the last four years.</p> <p>The results provide evidence that the most pronounced divisions were found in households where both spouses consider themselves politically independent. </p> <p>\u201cWe can say, with some caveats, that many Trump voters are really not confident that their spouses are going to support Trump,\u201d said Chris Jackson, an Ipsos pollster.</p> <p>While only one in 10 people supporting Hillary Clinton thought their spouses would vote another way, one in five supporting Trump expect their spouses to vote for someone else. Among men and women who supported Trump or Clinton, men voting for Trump were the least confident that their spouses would do the same.</p> <p>The results may come as no surprise after 13 months of campaigning in which Trump has made a number of sexist remarks. In the most memorable example, at the first Republican debate in 2015, Fox News host Megyn Kelly challenged Trump to explain \u201cseveral disparaging comments about women\u2019s looks\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve called women you don\u2019t like \u2018fat pigs,\u2019 \u2018dogs\u2019, \u2018slobs\u2019 and \u2018disgusting animals\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cYou once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?\u201d </p> <p>These remarks from his past, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diMp241gAcw\">the suggestion that he would date his own daughter</a> if they were not related, have shadowed his candidacy for over a year. Clinton\u2019s team has tried to capitalize, highlighting reports that Trump once said of women, \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetween married men and married women, there is a record gender gap right now,\u201d said Celinda Lake, head of the Democratic polling firm Lake Research Partners. Married women, a group won by the Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, are currently supporting Clinton by about 12 points, Lake said. </p> <p>\u201cWe have a situation where Donald Trump\u2019s personal style is just so offensive to women, and it is much more salient to women than it is to men.\u201d</p> <p>Some husbands seem less than thrilled by this dynamic. In voter interviews, Lake has noticed an unusual number of married women reporting that their husbands have pressed them to vote for Trump.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had it come up in our focus groups extensively,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThat always happens toward the end, but it\u2019s coming up in this election much sooner than usual.\u201d</p> <p>In Columbus, Ohio, three door-to-door canvassers for Working America, a group affiliated with the labor federation AFL-CIO, reported similar versions of the same story: after leaving a house where the husband planned to vote for Trump, the wife chased the canvasser down the street to say that under no circumstances would she do the same.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re certainly picked up tensions between husbands and wives before, but this kind of manifestation was really stunning to our field staff,\u201d said Karen Nussbaum, executive director of Working America, which is campaigning on behalf of Clinton and other Democrats. </p> <p>\u201cThis level of passion around the candidates, and then the big divisions between men and women is at a different level than we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d<br></p> <p>Even in a typical election year, more women tend to vote Democrat than men, and households split between the major parties are not uncommon. Same-sex couples make up too small a share of respondents to be represented in most national polls.</p> <p>But there is evidence that the split is particularly acute in 2016. In the Ipsos poll, only about half of those who said their household was split this year believed they and their spouse voted differently in 2012. </p> <p>That is the position in which George Kraft, 68, finds himself. Kraft, of Bullhead City, Arizona, said he and his wife both voted for Romney in 2012. This fall, he plans to vote for Trump. His wife, however, wants nothing to do with the party\u2019s inflammatory standard-bearer. </p> <p>\u201cShe thinks he\u2019s too outspoken, too abrasive toward other people,\u201d Kraft said. The same controversies don\u2019t bother him. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p> <p>Although the most drastic splits have surfaced between independent couples, Trump is also faring poorly among Republican women, married or not. In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-gop-women.html\">some recent polls</a> among women who identify as Republicans, he has run nearly 20 points behind Romney, John McCain (the 2008 nominee) and George W Bush (2004).</p> <p>Romney and Bush won 93% of Republican women\u2019s votes and McCain in 2008 won 89%. </p> <p>One respondent from Utah, Cheryl Steele, 36, voted without reservations for Romney but said she did not like the way Trump attracted accusations of racism and bigotry. \u201cI don\u2019t even want my child to listen to his speeches,\u201d she said, \u201cand yet he\u2019s supposed to be my president?\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s unpopularity with women, Nussbaum said, is reflected in a dynamic her canvassers have seen over and over in the field. \u201cMen who love Trump love women who love Hillary. Or at least, they don\u2019t hate Hillary,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Susan, 62, who lives near the border of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, did not wish to give her last name. She plans to vote for Clinton, repulsed by reports that Trump stiffed many of the contractors who helped build his casinos. </p> <p>\u201cI have no use for a man like that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But her choice is causing strife between her and her husband, who she called a \u201cvictim of talk radio\u201d. She believes he will be voting for Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall us ever arguing about an election before this one,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll come out with \u2018Trump said this\u2019 and we\u2019ll have a fight.\u201d </p> <p>To avoid any more quarrels, Susan has begun skirting talk of the election altogether. \u201cWe\u2019re too old for that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Lake believes many couples try to excise politics from their relationships, and not just in the heated final months of the 2016 race. Several years ago, her firm conducted a survey in which 72% of men but only 49% of women said with confidence that their partners would vote the same way they did. </p> <p>\u201cWe called it the, \u2018Sure, honey\u2019 factor,\u201d Lake said. \u201cGuys just assume who their wives are voting for. And I think some women go, \u2018Sure, honey.\u2019\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s visit to a black church in Detroit met with disgust among protesters and activists on Saturday, but won praise from parishioners who attended the service at the <a href=\"http://www.greatfaith.org/\">Great Faith Ministries</a> church on the city\u2019s west side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/trump-black-vote-detroit-speech-obama\">Black Americans on 'what they have to lose' if Trump becomes president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A sea of protesters and a heavy police presence surrounded the church, as local residents along Grand River Avenue looked on. Chants of \u201cNo Trump, go home Trump\u201d were raised by about 75 people in a march organized by local pastors and activists.</p> <p>The visit by the Republican presidential nominee came just two weeks after a speech to business tycoons in downtown Detroit was nearly derailed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">activists who continually interrupted him</a>. </p> <p>Tony Minetee, who grew up near the church, called the scene on Saturday a \u201ccircus\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is an idiot, and he\u2019s pandering,\u201d said Minetee, 48. After months of harsh campaign rhetoric from the former reality TV star, Minetee said his effort to court the African American vote was almost incredible. \u201cYou can\u2019t just talk to people like that and think it\u2019s going to just smooth over,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rick McGowan, 62, carried a sign with a caricature of Trump that deemed him \u201cunstable in all his ways\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with Donald Trump on everything that he says,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Trump campaign would not allow the Guardian inside the church, as different aides said it was a \u201cclosed event\u201d or said no press would be permitted at all. Events inside the church were, however, broadcast on television. As the service began, shortly after 11am, Trump shook hands with members of the congregation, then took a seat in the church\u2019s front row, swaying back and forth to music. </p> <p>To mild applause, Bishop Wayne T Jackson noted that the Republican nominee was in the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cThis is his first African American church he\u2019s been in, y\u2019all,\u201d said Jackson, laughing and noting that the service would be a \u201clittle different\u201d to those of the Presbyterian church to which Trump is accustomed.</p> <p>After Jackson spoke about the need for love and called on parishioners to hug and love each other, Trump could be seen hugging and greeting churchgoers himself. He posed for selfies and held up a baby.</p> <p>Trump had not been expected to address the congregation, having sat beforehand for a privately taped interview with Jackson that was due to be edited and published later on Saturday. In the event, he said he would read some remarks he had written several days earlier.</p> <p>Trump is not known for his strong Christianity: asked last year at an evangelical event in Iowa <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sWzJZMTNd4\">if he had ever sought God\u2019s forgiveness</a>, he said that he had not. Accordingly, he has struggled among white evangelical voters. In Detroit, his speech was heavily focused on faith and the importance of black churches through US history.</p> <p>Reading from a script and adopting a milder tone than that familiar from campaign rallies and debates, the billionaire businessman said: \u201cWe\u2019re all brothers and sisters and we\u2019re all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we\u2019re in this all together.</p> <p>\u201cI fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and there are many wrongs that must still be made right. They will be made right. I want to make them right.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the pews and pulpits [and] Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. </p> <p>\u201cThere is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also noted that the Republican party was the party of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, who defeated the slave-owning Confederacy in the civil war and signed the emancipation proclamation.</p> <p>\u201cBecoming the nominee of the party of Abe Lincoln has been the greatest honor of my life,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not focus on crime and law and order, as he has done when speaking to white audiences, or touch on police violence against the black community, gun violence or mass incarceration \u2013 major African American issues that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, has discussed on the campaign trail. Instead, he focused on jobs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can remedy economics so that the African American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and many different ways,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>\u2018Detroit\u2019s only gone through bankruptcy once\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"833be2b2535bf79a6b20fa26e302310bd5044ef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/833be2b2535bf79a6b20fa26e302310bd5044ef5/0_73_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Trump protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march outside the church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outside, protests continued. A group of clergy from across metropolitan Detroit denounced Trump\u2019s visit. The Rev Lawrence Glass said Trump\u2019s message to the black community and minorities \u2013 asking \u201cwhat do you have to lose\u201d through a vote for the Republican \u2013 was not genuine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we have to lose?\u201d Glass said. \u201cHow about voting rights, civil rights, human rights?\u201d </p> <p>The mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, also criticised Trump\u2019s decision to speak in his city and attacked the businessman on economic lines. At a press conference, in a restatement of remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July, Duggan said: \u201cThe difference between Donald Trump and Detroit is Detroit\u2019s only gone through bankruptcy once.\u201d </p> <p>The city is attempting to leave behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/detroit-formally-files-bankruptcy\">the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history</a>. In his speech to the Detroit Economic Club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/donald-trump-economic-speech-detroit-michigan-locals-angry\">last month</a>, Trump sought to use the city as an illustration of Democratic party policies that he said produced \u201csilenced victims\u201d. Duggan noted key improvements, particularly falling rates of homicide and unemployment. </p> <p>Detroit\u2019s police chief, James Craig, told reporters at the church he had spoken to Trump for about 30 seconds, and said the Republican nominee told him: \u201cThanks for making us safe.\u201d As of 11.45am no arrests had been made, Craig said. Activists claimed a woman\u2019s shoulder was broken by a police officer during a brief confrontation prior to the service.<br></p> <p>When events inside the church were over, attendees said Trump had received a warm welcome. Frank Bailey, 69, had driven in from Farmington Hills, a suburb about 20 miles north-west of the city. He said he enjoyed the service, having been concerned about how Trump would be received, due to his low polling among African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI think at the beginning [of the service] it was slow, but the more he talks and the more he said and the more genuine he seemed to become, I guess, I felt that they really warmed up to him,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Jacquelyn Rhodes, a pastor at New Light Christian Ministries in Detroit, said Trump offered substantive remarks. A lifelong independent, Rhodes said the visit had bolstered her support for the Republican. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody had any animosity toward him because we\u2019re all Christians</p> <footer> <cite>Cynthia Price</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my first choice during the primaries,\u201d Rhodes said, \u201cbut I do support Donald Trump.

The mayor highlighted one question Jackson intended to ask \u2013 \u201cAre you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?\u201d \u2013 and said: \u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t answer that question to a minister without going through scriptwriters and consultants.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most phony major party candidate I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s address, Jackson presented him with a Jewish Heritage Study Bible, a prayer shawl and a pin.

What\u2019s more, the two previous months \u2013 June and July \u2013 saw strong increases in demand for labour, so the three-month average for non-farm payrolls is running at a healthy 200,000. That could persuade some of the hawks at the Fed to move, but they will not be able to muster a majority.</p> <p>The second conclusion drawn by Wall Street is more questionable. That is the assumption that the rate rise some analysts had pencilled in for September has now simply been put back to a later date. Some economists believe the Fed won\u2019t waste any time once US voters have chosen who will be Barack Obama\u2019s successor at the White House; some think the central bank will wait until March next year.</p> <p>There is, though, a different way of looking at the numbers. For most of this year, the strength of the US labour market has been at odds with data showing the economy growing only slowly. Sooner or later, the theory went, growth would accelerate and come into line with employment numbers, so justifying higher interest rates.</p> <p>But what if Wall Street has got things back to front? Is it possible that it is the labour market that has been giving off false signals and that eventually job creation will decelerate and come into line with a growth rate that averaged just 1% in the first half of 2016?</p> <p>There is enough evidence to make this a plausible hypothesis. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">Take the details of the most recent jobs report</a>, for example. The annual growth rate in average hourly earnings fell to 2.4%, its lowest in six months, while average weekly hours worked declined to 34.3, the lowest in two and a half years.</p> <p>Hours worked by production and non-supervisory staff \u2013 who account for five out of six workers in the US \u2013 rose by 1.1% over the past year, the slowest rate of increase since 2010. None of this suggests the labour market is humming, nor that the recent pick-up in consumer spending \u2013 the economy\u2019s only real source of growth in the first half of the year \u2013 can be sustained.</p> <p>With investment weak and exports affected by low global demand and the lagged effects of the dollar\u2019s previous strength, it is not immediately obvious why the Fed would raise interest rates any time soon. Over the past couple of years, the US has succeeded in creating millions of jobs, but most of them are relatively unskilled and attract low pay. There is no obvious inflationary threat.</p> <p>Rather, the Fed should be focused on the risk that the economy might stall altogether. Corporate profits have come under pressure and this is leading to cuts in business investment. Historically, this is a good leading indicator that the US economy is heading into recession.</p> <p>The softness of the US economy is a concern to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has rightly adopted an ultra-cautious approach to raising rates. It will also be a concern for Hillary Clinton. The state of the economy does her no favours in her battle with Donald Trump.</p> <h2>Now bosses actually have to ask not to get bonuses</h2> <p>News that David Brown, chief executive of Go-Ahead Group, has asked not to be considered for a bonus this year prompts an obvious question: why did he think he might get one?</p> <p>Go-Ahead is the main company behind the chaotic Southern rail franchise that delivers daily misery to London commuters. If Brown\u2019s \u00a3558,000 bonus from a year ago had been repeated, riots might have broken out on station platforms.</p> <p>Not all Southern\u2019s woes can be laid at the operator\u2019s door, it should be said. The company doesn\u2019t control the tracks, which is where some of the problems have arisen as Network Rail gives London Bridge a major upgrade.</p> <p>But those difficulties have been compounded by Southern\u2019s bitter battle with the RMT union over plans to hand responsibility for closing train doors from conductors to drivers. Whatever the rights and wrong of the dispute, Southern\u2019s handling of the fallout has been appalling. Time and again, Brown has found himself apologising to customers for the sub-standard service. A bonus would have been another PR disaster.</p> <p>In practice, however, the bonus question arises because the rest of Go-Ahead is doing OK. The bus operations and other parts of the rail business are up to scratch. Despite losses at GTR \u2013 the unit that includes Southern \u2013 Go-Ahead\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 27% to \u00a399.8m. So Brown might have expected a juicy personal reward.</p> <p>But such a notion merely underlines the perversity of the modern bonus. No longer is it a reward for exceptional performance; instead, executives get them merely for delivering targets. In Go-Ahead\u2019s case, meeting the target \u2013 in other words, doing your job \u2013 is worth an extra 75% of salary in normal circumstances; at other companies, the ratio can be higher.</p> <p>This is a nonsense. Pay committees have become wedded to formulas that pay out even when disaster has struck in part of the empire. Boards should get a grip and apply common sense, which they are allowed to do. It should not have been a case of Brown doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d. His chairman should have said no bonuses would be paid because Go-Ahead was failing its customers.</p> <h2>The best way to stop Hinkley is to agree to it</h2> <p>What should Theresa May say to her Chinese G20 hosts about Hinkley Point? Nothing. The PM only ordered a review of the \u00a318bn project, which Beijing wants to part-fund, at the end of July. Hard conclusions probably haven\u2019t been reached. Don\u2019t risk a diplomatic quarrel on the other side\u2019s turf.</p> <p>A decision will have to be reached soon but an elegant solution seems to be emerging from Downing Street: tell the Chinese Hinkley is cleared for take-off but proposed nuclear plant Bradwell, in Essex, which the Chinese hope to build under their own steam, requires an in-depth security review.</p> <p>The Chinese, we are led to believe, would take offence and abandon Hinkley. Good. The plant would be hideously expensive for bill-payers and developer EDF\u2019s other two Hinkley-style developments outside the UK are years behind schedule. If Beijing packs its bags, the UK would have a choice: part-fund Hinkley; or let the plans collapse. Option B is best.</p>",

Indeed, the performance can\u2019t be sustained unless we support it with our credulity, like a tentful of rubes gaping at the tricks of a carnival magician, even offering ourselves up as subjects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted heat. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The wishful thinking that is the source of this credulity is, of course, a prelude to disappointment if our candidate actually gets elected. Take the case of candidate Barack Obama. He was going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and close Guant\u00e1namo. He would save our failing economy, mend our broken healthcare system, and enact sensible gun control legislation. He would overhaul our immigration system, address climate change with meaningful policies, and change the bilious tone of our political discourse. We weren\u2019t a nation of red states and blue states, he reminded us: we were the United States. Despite my years, I believed \u2013 believed not only that he meant what he said, but that he could get it done.</p> <p>My wife and I gathered several friends on a November night in 2008, and watched with joy and disbelief as this young, literary, ironical man with a Kenyan father was elected to the presidency. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I was one. But as time went on those tears began to burn. He wasn\u2019t getting it done, or so it seemed to me. Guant\u00e1namo was still in business. The planet kept heating up, and the wars dragged on, though increasingly waged by special forces. As before, just about anybody was free to walk into a gun store and come out armed, and each year some 30,000 Americans continued to pay for that freedom with their lives.</p> <p>And the tone of political life had become even more toxic than before the election. During President Obama\u2019s first State of the Union address, a congressman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/10/you-lie-joe-wilson-obama-speech\" title=\"\">South Carolina shouted: \u201cYou lie!\u201d</a> and became a Republican hero, even as the leaders of that party dedicated themselves to obstructing President Obama\u2019s legislative initiatives and judicial appointments, effectively disabling the government in order, as the senate majority leader shamelessly admitted, to make Obama a one-term president. The birthers continued to question his legitimacy, and, further, to imply that he was a secret Muslim and supporter of Isis. He was Hitler. He was Lenin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9/0_137_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obamacare supporters react to the US Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care law, 28 June, 2012, Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obamacare supporters react to the US Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care law, 28 June, 2012, Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this of this was Obama\u2019s fault. Indeed, he reacted to the unrelenting stream of slander and congressional malfeasance with unflappable calm and an air of faintly amused detachment. And for that I did blame him. The coolness I had admired during his campaign became an irritant. In fact, it drove me sort of crazy. Why didn\u2019t he fight back? Show some rage at what was truly outrageous, the obstruction, the name-calling, the attacks on Michelle Obama for encouraging schools to serve healthy food, even for occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/04/fashion-michelleobama\" title=\"\">wearing dresses that showed her arms</a>? Call these liars and bullies out, damn it! Politics is mud wrestling, did he not understand that? And if he really didn\u2019t feel anger, then why not take some acting lessons, and fake it?</p> <p>Well, I was wrong. As Barack Obama prepares to leave office, I think about what he managed to do in the face of implacable resistance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans\" title=\"\">No, he didn\u2019t close Guant\u00e1namo</a>; the Republican congress wouldn\u2019t let him, nor would they let him bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/05/what-obama-said-on-gun-control-doesnt-matter-republicans-oppose-it\" title=\"\">sanity to our gun laws</a>, or to our immigration policies. But as most economists agree, his financial initiatives, narrowly approved, did save us from a profound recession, possibly even a depression. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/06/auto-industry-obama-bailout\" title=\"\">successful auto industry bailout</a>, fiercely contested at the time, saved countless jobs at virtually no expense to the taxpayer. If Obama couldn\u2019t entirely extricate us from the wars he inherited, he has refrained from entangling us in new wars, despite being constantly urged to do so by congressmen and senators who otherwise refuse to spend tax dollars \u2013 on, say, education, or roads, or environmental safeguards.</p> <p>Finally, 20 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/obama-healthcare-reform-key-provisions\" title=\"\">Americans who&#xa0;did not have health insurance</a> when Barack Obama took office have it now; and in spite of dire Republican predictions, and umpteen votes for repeal, it has actually lowered the healthcare cost inflation rate. No one in this country, however poor, or sick, need be without insurance. This achievement eluded Theodore Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, among others.</p> <p>So why has Obama not been celebrated for what he\u2019s done? Why did so many of us so often feel a sense of impatience, even disappointment? I believe it comes down to immaturity \u2013 in us, not him. At least part of the reason for our failure to recognise and praise what he\u2019s accomplished has to do with his style \u2013 that coolness. He doesn\u2019t brag, or gloat. He doesn\u2019t call attention to himself, or proclaim his deeds in the thoroughfares, or ridicule those who oppose him. But we wanted him to. We wanted heat. We wanted anger, slashing rhetoric, mockery. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies. We wanted him to wage war, and crow over his fallen enemies. And because we did not get the melodrama we demanded, we lost the plot.</p> <p>But now we have a candidate who will give us all the sound and fury we could ask for, or imagine. Let\u2019s see how we like it.

I have an acquaintance who was Obama\u2019s boss when Obama had just gotten out of college. My acquaintance, a white man, was deeply irritated that Obama had become president and that he himself had not. I can certainly claim to my share of irrationality but when I heard this, it seemed to me a new level of bizarreness. Before the Obama presidency, if I had heard something so stupid I would have just laughed.

But I had a hope that we were about to move past the worst of our racial history. Right now, America is at a crossroads. The Obama presidency can move us forward, or we can backslide into racial intolerance and violence for good. One of the effects of Obama being elected is that there is a level of racism in America that can no longer be ignored. If a man like Barack Obama, so well-educated, so graceful, so intelligent, so charming, can be so reviled and denigrated on a daily basis in some parts of the country and in Congress (to the point that he can hardly do his job), you can no longer as a normal American ignore the profound problem of race in this country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4c73953412b135a39a7e8521615a3dc8e4eca6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4c73953412b135a39a7e8521615a3dc8e4eca6/39_90_1261_723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack and Michelle Obama: \u2018We\u2019re just beginning to see what this man and his wife together are going to do for the country. \u2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are a lot of well-meaning white folks who for years could not see the breadth of racism in America, so I feel that one of the gifts of Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 a perverse gift \u2013 is the fact it allowed a sickness to bubble up to the surface, like a boil on the skin.

He got dumped with an economy in freefall in 2009 but he\u2019s managed to turn it around. And his healthcare reforms were humongous, as big to me as stuff that Lyndon Johnson did back in the 60s, like creating Medicare. Of course he\u2019s done things that I do not agree with. I have a problem with the failure to close Guant\u00e1namo, I have a problem with drone strikes around the world. But you\u2019re never going to like everything that any president does. What I\u2019m not going to do is hold Obama to a higher standard, where he has to be a magical negro who is perfect.

We\u2019ve now spent eight years watching Republican congressmen scurrying hither and thither brandishing pitchforks, outraged at the latest whiff of terrorist fist-bumpery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama has always been a cautious centrist Democrat, not a man likely to align himself with the politics of black power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The obstructionist opposition to Obama came tricked out in 18th-century Founders\u2019 drag, bewigged and buckle-shoed. Ostensibly they were angry that the framers of the constitution were being traduced by a stoner Kenyan community organiser, yet beneath the surface, their grievances often turned out to be rooted in the erosion of the racial deference that has been expected in this country since the days when Jefferson and Washington toured their slave quarters .</p> <p>The presence of a black first family in the White House, the nation\u2019s lifestyle fishbowl, is just as symbolically powerful as the sight of a black husband and father shouldering the responsibilities of the presidency. In their immaculate media presentation, the Obamas have communicated themselves to the readers of the kind of magazines found in supermarket checkouts as a family whose dignity and essential decency are well sheathed in the necessary American armour of glamour. Whoever wins the presidency in November, the first spouse will command a fraction of the respect that Michelle Obama enjoys. The sight of the two Obama daughters, young black women growing up with unlimited aspirations in a loving home, begs a response from a country where the number one cause of death for black women aged 15-34 is homicide by a current or former partner.</p> <p>Many of the young people driving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> came of age during the Obama presidency, their political consciousness formed by the 2008 election. For them, Obama turned out to be more hope than change, and his failure to speak in a full-throated way in their support has felt like a betrayal,&#xa0;but once the thick rind of symbolism has been peeled, the president has always been a cautious&#xa0;centrist Democrat with an instinct for consensus, not a man likely to align himself with the politics of black power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9ffa28b259de0ab5fc2f7a010a58bb318bc948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9ffa28b259de0ab5fc2f7a010a58bb318bc948/0_0_3512_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a US Air Force MQ-1B Predator drone at a secret air base in the Persian Gulf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"597\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The drone war is considered in many parts of the world the administration\u2019s signal moral disaster\u2019: a US Air Force MQ-1B Predator drone at a secret air base in the Persian Gulf:</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In policy terms, the Obama legacy is mixed.

Eight years after the financial crisis, the president has succeeded in keeping the wheels on American capitalism, but once the dust settled, it became clear that the crash accelerated the transfer of wealth from the middle class to the very rich, an injustice he has done nothing to address.</p> <p>Middle Eastern policy has been rudderless. There were, to be honest, no good options available after the squalid disaster of the Bush wars, but Obama\u2019s vacillation about engagement helped produce the chaos in Libya and the vacuum in Syria so ruthlessly exploited by Isis and the Russians. He allowed \u201cred lines\u201d to be crossed without sanction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/20/americas-drone-policy-all-exceptions-no-rules-yemen\" title=\"\">The drone war</a>, considered in many parts of the world as the administration\u2019s signal moral disaster, has carried on with little serious domestic opposition.

Sometimes, out of his extensive rhetorical tool kit, the president pulls a weird folksy tone, a subliminal suggestion of Merle Haggard, designed, no doubt, to soothe the terror induced by his blackness. Desperate as it is to go on a psychic vacation in the magical kingdom of the \u201cpost-racial\u201d, America will discover that it was lucky to have had a figure capable of such virtuosic code-switching, a man who demonstrated that it was possible to communicate across the lines.</p> <h2>Jayne Anne Phillips: \u2018Just by being who he is&#xa0;he has made an enormous impact\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1c80c3cc95be6b3bc15f1b54451ae4e13636f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1c80c3cc95be6b3bc15f1b54451ae4e13636f83/0_759_2912_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Jayne Anne Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jayne Anne Phillips: \u2018Obama has been a stealth president.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon &amp; Sc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Guggenheim fellow </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/11/fiction.familyandrelationships\" title=\"\"><em>Jayne Anne Phillips</em></a><em> won the 1980 Sue Kaufman prize for first fiction when she was only 26, for her debut book of stories, Black Tickets.

People forget that when he assumed the presidency in 2009, he was handed a financial disaster in the making and his response to it really saved the country, and possibly the world, from financial collapse. But he\u2019s done so much more. In the two years in which he had a Democratic Congress, he passed the Affordable Care Act and oversaw a $36bn dollar expansion in Pell Grants, which very much affects students at Rutgers University-Newark, where I direct the MFA programme.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama\u2019s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history.

He has worked hard to fight climate change. Solar energy production has increased 30-fold since he became president. Jobs in the solar industry have grown exponentially, and he\u2019s leading the effort to phase out damaging hydrofluorocarbons used in air conditioning. His presidency has accomplished so much of which citizens are not aware. He has embraced executive actions, unwilling&#xa0;to accept the stasis Congress embodies.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the whole leadership case. He can\u2019t end racism and sexism in America, but just by being who he is, he\u2019s made an enormous impact. I think he is truly a visionary who is uniquely qualified to serve.

It\u2019s like going from the sublime to \u2013 if Trump is actually elected \u2013 the ridiculously dangerous. It\u2019s a very strange time in this country and we can only hope that Trump will&#xa0;continue to implode. Hillary Clinton is exceptionally qualified and I think she\u2019d be a good president; American sexism plays a huge part in her supposed \u201cunlikability\u201d. She might not be as inspiring as Obama, she\u2019s not cool or chic, but she is such a policy wonk, so prepared and careful. And constant. Her priorities \u2013 children, families, justice \u2013 are the same after 30 years. Yet she is suspected because she has breached the establishment. I\u2019m just praying she\u2019ll win. If Trump wins, there\u2019ll be a lot of people in America trying to marry Canadians.</p> <p>Obama has been a inspiring and provocative leader. The fact that this is more or less the consensus around the world really matters, because it means he\u2019s not vulnerable to the sniping and griping, to the ridiculous \u201cgo low, no, go lower\u201d tone that Trump has set in this election. I don\u2019t think anything will change the fact that Obama\u2019s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history. He is Trump\u2019s polar opposite. What a country this is, to nurture and succour two such opposite cultural/political beings. The best and the worst have moved further and further apart; we are a completely divided nation. Those paradise moments \u2013 the very surprising 2008 Obama election, the crowds, the alliances, the decency, charm and intelligence of it all \u2013 exist alongside all that we now endure. It\u2019s a world that only a 24-hour news cycle could love. What will Trump do or say next? Like everything Trump touches, it\u2019s all about him. But I digress.</p> <p>Desperation and chaos are distracting. How dark will it get? Regardless, Obama is not going away.&#xa0;The America that elected him twice is not going away either. Like Elvis, that America has left the building. Hopefully it will reappear on election day.</p>",

That\u2019s just the nose stupid <em>God</em> gave you.\u201d There were wonderful riffs on being VIP\u2019d through the Anne Frank rope, and the insanities of papped shots of the Schumer clan, and later Amy told us about her weight in most graphic fashion, by inviting us to guess when her thighs, as she splayed them cheerfully from within her black minidress, were no longer touching. I\u2019m convinced half the men in the audience fell in love with her then and there. But who wouldn\u2019t, with a sexy blond who\u2019s sharp enough not to care?</p> <p>Jo Rowling, who was there, loved it. After one extended \u2013 plug is not the word here \u2013 extemporisation on anal sex, specifically the bizarre male predilection for same, Schumer turned to carefully catch the Playhouse\u2019s spotlight silhouetting her in a halo. She\u2019s not the Messiah, just a very naughty girl. Here\u2019s to very naughty, very clever girls.</p>",
  "<p>So it\u2019s not exactly <em>King Lear</em> 2016, but the dark clouds swirling around Fox News and its acting chair, monarch Rupert, are beginning to gather. Remember his essential doctrine: he doesn\u2019t back losers. His mystique rests on backing winners. Thatcher, Reagan, Blair, Bush, Brexit \u2026 but now comes Trump.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch was no Trump fan, initially \u2013 he was tweeting warm thoughts about Ben Carson and Marco Rubio before they departed and The Donald was the last Republican left standing. The latter was embraced by Fox because he brought fat ratings and prospectively fatter profits. But that sticky embrace looks problematic now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"826a49493a37f52f3d600f4b3b96bbe9f07a44b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826a49493a37f52f3d600f4b3b96bbe9f07a44b5/437_0_2049_2561/800.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump sticks to Fox and Fox appearances like glue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry W Smith/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For one thing, Trump sticks to Fox and Fox appearances like glue. For another, though Roger Ailes may have departed the news channel he created \u2013 pursued by sexual allegations \u2013 he\u2019s found a new role prepping Trump for the presidential debate. And Sean Hannity, star Fox presenter, seems to have gone OTT with on-air rants against fellow Republicans who don\u2019t think Donald\u2019s the true far-right deal.</p> <p>(\u201cIf we elect Hillary because you are so stubborn, arrogant and stupid, that can\u2019t say \u2018radical Islam\u2019 and can\u2019t engage an enemy and identify it, that\u2019s your fault! And if you help elect the single most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency\u2026 somebody who sold out her office for gain\u2026 somebody who has failed on Iran and Isis and radical Islam in general, and Iraq and Iran and Syria and North Africa and Libya, I\u2019m blaming you!\u201d).</p> <p>All of which is a problem. Fox News\u2019 average viewer is nearly 70. The channel\u2019s fantastically profitable: well over $1bn a year. But it needs to move on, to refurbish, to scotch the spreading sex allegations, to connect to new generations. James and Lachlan, the two heirs in waiting, clearly understand that.</p> <p>But does emergency executive chairman dad, 85, and the two co-presidents and old Fox retainers he\u2019s promoted <em>in loco</em> Ailes? It\u2019s an odd way of sweeping out stables and an odder way of building a fresher future. So, the rumours of family fuming mount. What would happen if Trump (and Republican majorities on Capitol Hill) go down to defeat in November? Who gets blamed? Not for being stubborn, arrogant and stupid, perhaps. But for still being in charge when winners turned to losers.</p>"
