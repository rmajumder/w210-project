  "<p>When I first called Jill Harth back in the spring, she didn\u2019t want to talk. Neither did a number of the other women I called who had crossed paths with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\"> Donald Trump</a>. But few of them had documented their encounters as thoroughly as Harth, whose 1997 lawsuit alleging attempted rape against Trump is a matter of public record.</p> <p>Harth had kept quiet for almost 20 years. But a few months after my call, her lawyer got in touch. The impetus, as Harth put it in an emotional hour-long interview at the Guardian\u2019s New York office in July, was Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that any woman alleging misbehavior on his part was lying. </p> <p>Trump is still calling Harth and many others liars, even as the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct has risen into the double digits. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership embed</a> </figure>  <p>Long before crass tapes of Trump boasting about sexual groping entered the picture \u2013 and Harth\u2019s story suddenly became front-page news \u2013 the Guardian was the rare publication that took Harth\u2019s story seriously. We were the first to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">publish her account</a> last July, even as other outlets dismissed stories like it as too frivolous or implausible. We also published the accounts of fat-shamed beauty queen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado</a> and legally bullied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">Sheena Monnin</a>, well before Trump\u2019s mistreatment of women became the defining story of the presidential election.</p> <p>Harth, who charged Trump with sexually assaulting her in one of his children\u2019s bedrooms at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 1993, didn\u2019t come to the Guardian by chance. She came to me because she knew the Guardian was committed to telling her story; and she sensed I had the time, flexibility and resources I needed to tell it.</p> <p>She was right. When Trump clinched the nomination last spring, my editors asked me to dig deeply into Trump\u2019s long history of misogyny, and gave me the support I needed to do so.</p> <p>But the Guardian\u2019s commitment to this kind of in-depth reporting is time consuming and expensive. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to ask for your support by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=co_us_editorial_copy_USlgravesTrump\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_mem_USlgravesTrump_inarticle\">becoming a member</a>.</p> <p>The business model for investigative journalism is broken. As comedian John Oliver explained recently in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2_wSsDwkQ\">this brilliant segment</a>, nobody in journalism has figured out a sustainable formula for making money on the internet. Online ads generate a tiny fraction of the revenue that print ads once did \u2013 and news publications like the Guardian are competing with tech giants Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue. </p> <p>From Bill Cosby to Roger Ailes to Donald Trump, this election year may go down as the moment our country finally started taking sexual assault seriously. These stories found an audience because of the brave women who told them, but also because of the journalists and the editors who listened first. We did that at the Guardian, and now we hope you\u2019ll listen back.</p> <p>Please<strong> </strong>support independent journalism at the Guardian by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=co_us_editorial_footer_USlgravesTrump\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_mem_USlgravesTrump_footer\">becoming a member</a> today.</p>",
  "<p>For years, journalists have treated American gun violence as an hopeless problem. They cover the latest mass shooting, they write about congressional inaction, and then they move on. </p> <p>We\u2019re not doing that.</p> <p>Early this year, the Guardian hired me as one of the country\u2019s only full-time gun politics reporters. My job was to help us begin to understand why the gun debate is so broken \u2013 and what it would actually take to fix it. </p> <p>America\u2019s gun violence problem is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/gun-control-debate-mass-shootings-gun-violence\">so much bigger than mass shootings</a>. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/gun-control-changing-the-conversation-hillary-clinton-reform\">liberal orthodoxies</a> about what might work to prevent gun deaths aren\u2019t always correct. </p> <p>Our reporting this year on guns has been fiercely independent. We\u2019re holding both Democrats and Republicans accountable for what they\u2019re doing to prevent gun violence and suicide.</p> <p>Last month, we published the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">exclusive results</a> of the most definitive survey of gun ownership in two decades. The central finding \u2013 that only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">3% of American adults own half the country\u2019s guns</a> \u2013 is already reshaping the assumptions of the gun debate. </p> <p>This kind of reporting requires investment. When the data sets we need to answer crucial questions don\u2019t exist, we build them. That\u2019s what we did with The Counted, our in-depth database of police killings. That\u2019s what we\u2019re now doing with gun murders in America. </p> <p>We\u2019ve already learned that there are powerful voices for gun violence prevention that simply aren\u2019t getting heard, and solutions that are getting lost in the swift cycles of tragedy, outrage and backlash. </p> <p>Help us keep our focus on how to fix this problem.

And in this election cycle Gwinnett County currently has only one early voting location. Cobb County has only two voting locations. As we get closer to the election more polling locations are supposed to open up. But, until then, no one should be surprised about the large turnout of early voters.

Thus far these declarations have not resulted in a mobilized citizenry demanding that voters present identification and prove their identity as they wait in line to vote. But we should not overlook how Trump and the Republican party want to increase voter intimidation and suppression efforts as we get closer to election day.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>No one should have to wait for hours to vote, and the sight of people collapsing from heat exhaustion as they waited should outrage us all.

WikiLeaks has released successive dumps of damaging material over recent months from inside the Democratic party and the Clinton campaign, which the US government has blamed on Russian state hacking.</p> <p>\u201cThe government of Ecuador respects the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states,\u201d Ecuador\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cIt does not interfere in external electoral processes, nor does it favour any particular candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The statement, in which Ecuador stressed that it \u201cdoes not yield to pressure from other states\u201d, followed claims by WikiLeaks that John Kerry, the US secretary of state, had requested a private meeting with Ecuador last month \u2013 during a visit to Colombia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/colombia-farc-peace-deal-resounds-homeland-uribe\">show support for a peace deal with leftwing rebels</a> \u2013 specifically to ask the country to block Assange. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b75164caacf5671d307186dc6fc4321764457f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b75164caacf5671d307186dc6fc4321764457f02/0_0_2670_3987/670.jpg\" alt=\"Pamela Anderson visited Julian Assange in the embassy on Saturday.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pamela Anderson visited Julian Assange in the embassy on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben A.

His deputy, Mark Toner, added later that Kerry had not even met with the Ecuador delegation during the talks. \u201cThere just was no meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t discuss any of this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The confirmation that Ecuador had shut down the internet at least put to rest <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/17/conspiracy-theorists-pamela-anderson-poisoned-julian-assange-with-a-vegan-sandwich.html\">one bizarre rumour</a>, which surfaced after the Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson visited Assange in the embassy on Saturday, telling reporters she had brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret a Manger. </p> <p>Three WikiLeaks tweets after her visit, labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584\">pre-commitments</a>\u201d and containing strings of code, led to a brief, feverish conspiracy theory that Assange could be dead \u2013 with some even pointing to the sandwich as a possible culprit \u2013 before the site explained its connection had been \u201cintentionally severed by a state party\u201d.</p> <p>Neither WikiLeaks nor Ecuador\u2019s foreign ministry responded to requests for comment on Wednesday, and it is unclear whether Assange will have been able to restore his internet access independently. The journalist John Pilger, a close ally and frequent visitor of Assange in the embassy, told the Guardian that Assange \u201cwill have a contingency\u201d, and stressed that WikiLeaks was bigger than its founder. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that the restrictions will stop the leaks or deter WikiLeaks and Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cThe significance of the action by Ecuador, which is clearly under pressure, is to show how frightened the US establishment is of further revelations reaching the public about its preferred presidential candidate.\u201d</p> <p>WikiLeaks said it had \u201cactivated the appropriate contingency plans\u201d, and has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">continued to tweet links</a> to its stream of damaging email leaks, most recently from the personal email account of the chairman of Clinton\u2019s election campaign, John Podesta. They included transcripts from speeches made to Goldman Sachs bankers in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\">avoided any direct criticism of Wall Street</a>, raising questions of an overly cosy relationship with the banking establishment. </p> <p>But for a man who cannot move beyond a handful of rooms in what is, in essence, a modest apartment, even the temporary loss of his connection with the outside world will be a significant blow and troubling development. Ecuador\u2019s move to silence him points starkly to frustrations at some of Assange\u2019s activities while on diplomatic premises.</p> <p>Periodic rumours have emerged of strains between Assange and his Ecuadorean hosts in the more than four years he has lived in the embassy. Confidential embassy documents <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/mr-white-and-mr-blue?utm_term=.drzw9qy5p#.co8Y50zd2\">leaked to Buzzfeed News</a> last year revealed Assange had a late-night scuffle with a security guard in the embassy who said he had found the Australian tampering with security equipment in its secure room (Assange said the guard had accosted him).<br></p> <p>The documents also showed that embassy staff painstakingly monitor Assange\u2019s movements \u2013 referring to him as \u201cMr Guest\u201d \u2013 and contained references both to the stressful situation in which he lives and his \u201cevident anger\u201d and \u201cfeelings of superiority\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/14/wiileaks-from-liberal-beacon-to-a-prop-for-trump-what-has-happened\">From liberal beacon to a prop for Trump: what has happened to WikiLeaks?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about occasional strains to the relationship, Pilger said: \u201cWhen I met Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister and other officials not long ago, they spoke highly of Assange and Ecuador\u2019s commitment to protect him. I have always regarded this small country\u2019s decision to give him asylum and refuge as a rare example of principle and courage.\u201d</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, US election or not, Assange is unlikely to be going anywhere. Sweden is still seeking to extradite him over a rape allegation that he denies, and he says that he could face onward extradition to the US, where WikiLeaks is being investigated over the Cablegate releases in 2010. </p> <p>\u201cEcuador granted political asylum to Julian Assange in 2012 based on his legitimate fears of political persecution,\u201d the country\u2019s statement said, adding that it \u201creaffirms the asylum granted to [him] and reiterates its intention to safeguard his life and physical integrity until he reaches a safe place\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>This week\u2019s episode of Donald Glover\u2019s auteur dramedy, <a href=\"http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/atlanta/episodes\">Atlanta</a>, saw his character Earn spend most of the show\u2019s 25 minutes trying to catch a Nigerian club manager who kept using elaborate escape routes (including a rotating wall) to avoid paying an appearance fee to Paper Boi, Earn\u2019s rapper client.</p> <p>As well as the farcical cat-and-mouse chase, the episode also included a postmodern deconstruction of \u201cthe club\u201d, with its arbitrary rules, VIP area etiquette and wristband color-coding system. Like most of Atlanta\u2019s first season (it\u2019s been renewed for a second), within a few minutes of sitting down to watch you become aware you\u2019re entering a world that looks unlike anything else on TV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/atlanta-brian-tyree-henry-tv-fx-black-culture\">Atlanta star Brian Tyree Henry: if Trump gets elected 'it's going to be Mad Max'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Atlanta is what television looks like when writers and creative teams are allowed to take risks. Kenya Barris has consistently managed to push things right up to the line on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/black_ishABC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Black-ish</a>, while making a fundamentally relatable sitcom for a broad base of American viewers. What Glover and Atlanta offer is different. Before the series aired Glover said he wasn\u2019t thinking about getting renewed: if he only had 10 episodes then so be it, this was going to be his uncompromising look at life. That\u2019s what he\u2019s delivered after years of development. There\u2019s no real narrative structure in Atlanta. There\u2019s the weapons charge hanging over Paper Boi \u2013 the rapper played by Brian Tyree Henry, whom Earn manages.<br></p> <p>Before the club episode came BAN, a standalone episode which lampooned <a href=\"http://www.bet.com/\">BET</a>, self-satisfied academics and the notion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp\">transracialism</a>. The week before that Vanessa, Earn\u2019s on and off again girlfriend, had a whole episode dedicated to her where she went out for dinner with a friend, had her lifestyle and aspirations questioned, smoked weed then tried to beat a drug test the following day by strapping a condom filled with baby\u2019s pee to her leg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97b532359c83744e612b41b7b97e172f3cbaf7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97b532359c83744e612b41b7b97e172f3cbaf7e/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"B.A.N: Alano Miller as Franklin Montague, Mary Kraft as Deborah Holt, Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.

There was the N-word debacle in the first episode, in which Earn\u2019s white friend casually dropped the N-bomb in his presence \u2013 then wouldn\u2019t dare do it in front of other black people. The BEN episode included a scathing critique of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/rachel-dolezal-i-wasnt-identifying-as-black-to-upset-people-i-was-being-me\">the Rachel Dolezal case</a> in which a black teenager claimed to identify as a middle-aged white man called Harrison \u2013 then was unveiled as an anti-gay marriage transphobe.</p> <p>Perhaps the smartest example of Atlanta taking on race was the episode where Justin Bieber is depicted as a black teenager. He turns up at a charity basketball game, knocks over refreshments, gets into a fight and says he\u2019s found religion while being embraced by fans and the media. When Paper Boi asks why this is accepted he\u2019s told to play his part \u2013 that of the heel to Bieber\u2019s babyface. Yes, it\u2019s farcical but underneath the comedy there\u2019s a harsh truth: a black entertainer who acted like Bieber would not have a career, and rappers are pigeonholed regardless of who they are. It\u2019s subtle but pointed, knowing without being too self-satisfied, and uncomfortable viewing for some.</p> <p>Moral judgments are few and far between. When Vanessa confesses to smoking weed after the baby pee plan blows up in her face, she gets fired \u2013 but not before her boss confesses that most of the faculty smokes weed. The shooting in the first episode is background noise rather than the story arc that drives the action. As with Seinfeld there\u2019s no hugging and no learning, and no need to present the mistakes of young black people as fatal errors rather than simple rites of passage.</p> <p>This approach has been rewarded: the show became the highest-rated premiere of any basic-cable primetime scripted debut in more than three years among the coveted 18-45 age bracket. For a show this experimental to pull in those kind of numbers, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a desire to see work like this.</p> <p>When you look at the directorial efforts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/07/creed-director-ryan-coogler-marvel-black-panther\">Ryan Coogler</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/issa-rae-insecure-misadventures-of-awkward-black-girl-hbo-tv-comedy\">Issa Rae</a> or the music of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dev-hynes\">Dev Hynes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/30/solange-a-seat-at-the-table-a-stately-sprawling-celebration-of-black-identity\">Solange</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/young-thug-hits-bring-money-lil-wayne\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\">Frank Ocean </a>there\u2019s a thread that runs throughout: young people of color in the US creating work for and by them. Atlanta follows that tradition as another piece of pop culture that isn\u2019t concerned with appealing to the mainstream. It\u2019s happy to wait for the rest of the world to catch up.<br></p>",

  "<p>I didn\u2019t give much thought to Canada for the first 18 years of my life.

For my whole life all of these Canadians had been living in Canada, not wanting to be American, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/81468/why-do-canadians-drink-milk-bags\">drinking milk from bags.</a> </p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why I was particularly moved by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/world/americas/sympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F18%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fsympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click\">the sympathetic message sent south this week</a> by some lovely northern neighbors: <em>America</em>, they say, <em>you guys are already great</em>.

Polite. Sensitive. Cheerful. Gently overlooking the fact that Canada rarely crosses the mind of many Americans unless they\u2019re looking for a way to easily emigrate if national leadership is passed into the hands of a despotic, racist egomaniac by a bonkers electorate.</p> <p>Americans often speak as if \u201cmoving to Canada\u201d to escape the worst of the United States is a decision that can be made casually. We discuss the idea as though we believe that Canada is but a giant, pleasant, snowy backyard that we can wander into when we feel like it. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2016/may/12/donald-trump-president-move-to-canada\">That\u2019s far from the case</a>, and not just because you do have to complete a rigorous visa application process.

But despite 75% of Canadians living 100 miles (or fewer) from our northern border, they\u2019re proud of their distinctly non-American national identity and don\u2019t regard us with particular envy \u2013 ever, not only when we\u2019re in dire circumstances.</p> <p>Is there a note of smugness to the #tellamericaitsgreat campaign? Perhaps just a touch. But I learned from my years in Canada not to hold a grudge. After all, that country, too, is far from perfect \u2013 from Vancouver to St John\u2019s, there\u2019s plenty of tussling between right and left over the same issues that cripple our government, from crime to climate change to healthcare. </p> <p>But the debate is undergirded by a level of stability most Americans can only dream about. There\u2019s a public healthcare system in place. There\u2019s a federal government <a href=\"http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E18C8F2D-1\">commitment</a> to work on climate change. And <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/1354803/fact-checking-michael-moore-does-canada-have-more-guns-per-capita-than-the-us/\">contrary to rumor</a>, Canada has far fewer guns per capita than the US, and far fewer gun-related deaths (one study found that \u2018<a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2378037/gun-violence-by-the-numbers-how-america-canada-and-the-world-compare/\">you\u2019re more likely to be shot to death in the US than to die in a car accident in Canada</a>\u2019). In 2009, the inauguration of President Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/feb/17/barack-obama-canada\">made some people speculate</a> that Canadians would no longer be able to look down on their southern neighbors the way they once did. </p> <p>They shouldn\u2019t have worried.

There\u2019s a couple of possibilities beyond the usual \u201cthe CIA can\u2019t keep a secret\u201d \u2013 which they obviously can when they want to. To me, the most likely scenario is this could be the CIA\u2019s attempt to back President Obama into a corner by putting public pressure on him to approve such an escalation in cyberwarfare.<br></p> <p>So far, Obama has (commendably) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/almost-everyone-gets-russia-wrong-apart-from-obama\">been virtually the only official or politician</a> in DC not to succumb to scaremongering and dramatic cold war 2.0 rhetoric when it comes to Russia. That hasn\u2019t stopped him from criticizing Putin when he should. But he\u2019s not pretending like Putin is some 11th-dimensional chess mastermind, pulling the strings behind every twist and turn in presidential poll numbers, like the rest of Washington.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There\u2019s also a chance the whole thing is a ruse, where the CIA purposefully leaks a fake story for the purposes of attempting to scare Russia. But assuming the CIA plans are real, why on earth do all these national security geniuses think this is a good idea? Countless politicians have spent the last four months saying how \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d Russia\u2019s actions are, so now the magic solution is to do it back to them?<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/russia-blame-dnc-email-hack-premature\">The rush to blame Russia for the DNC email hack is premature | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who thinks that once the US leaks some documents back on Putin that he\u2019ll suddenly be like \u2018oh, you got me, I guess we\u2019ll stop!\u2019 The more likely scenario is that this half-baked idea will escalate the cyber tensions rather than act as a deterrent.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Remember, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/world/europe/vladimir-putin-panama-papers-american-plot.html\">Putin reportedly thinks</a> that the Panama Papers leak was the work of the US government (even though there\u2019s no evidence to suggest it was) and some think the current leaks involving US politicians are his revenge. This potential CIA operation will, in his mind, only confirm his suspicions.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Putin is also much less susceptible to public pressure than US politicians are (given his alleged heavy-handed dealings with his opponents) and has increasingly attempted to implement draconian internet surveillance laws which he\u2019ll surely use to his advantage if the US does go through with this plan.<br></p> <p>Why does the reaction to alleged Russian actions have to turn into a contest in who\u2019s the bigger tough guy?

Realizing that for the first eight years of his life, my son would only know a president that looks like him. </p> <p>We all embarked upon this with such hope. This was going to be the beginning of change. This was the corner we had turned onto a brighter street. This was the first of many moves to a more just and equal nation. </p> <p>And in many ways it was. These past eight years have seen marriage equality, expanded healthcare, a renewed economy, federal divestment from for-profit prisons, the Fair Sentencing Act reducing the disparity between crack and cocaine sentencing, the end of the war in Iraq, the appointment of the first Hispanic supreme court justice and <a href=\"http://pleasecutthecrap.com/obama-accomplishments/\">so much more</a>.</p> <p>But we\u2019ve also seen that equality isn\u2019t free. Those invested in systems of injustice will make the oppressed pay for any progress they make. I, and many others, watched as the mildly prejudiced became vehemently racist. Rumors of Obama\u2019s \u201cMuslim identity\u201d during the campaign didn\u2019t dissipate after his election, instead becoming a regular part of the conservative lexicon that fueled violent Islamophobia. </p> <p>We saw an <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/year-hate-and-extremism\">increase</a> in hate crime and hate groups nationwide. Many people lament the angry and sometimes violent rhetoric and actions of this current election, the frequent demands of angry white people to \u201ctake the country back\u201d \u2013 as if the election of a black president amounted to a coup \u2013 the cries of a \u201creturn to the good old days\u201d which were certainly not good for anyone who didn\u2019t pass the paper bag test.</p> <p>But for many people of color, the violence started the moment Obama took office.<br></p> <p>Right after the inauguration, I got an email from an old work customer. It was addressed to every female person of color in the office that he knew. </p> <p>\u201cCongratulations bitches,\u201d it read. \u201cDon\u2019t come crying to me when you\u2019re forced to wear a burka in a few months.\u201d </p> <p>I saw all of my political views easily dismissed by white conservatives as being the ignorant, race-based support of a black woman supporting a black man \u2013 never once questioning what must have been their 100% support for white men in all previous elections.<br></p> <p>And I saw how angry and threatened voters elected an angry and threatened Congress and the business of our government ground to a halt. I watched our first black president treated with unimaginable disrespect \u2013 not just from the electorate, but from our own government. I watched a proud black man stand stoically while the congressman Joe Wilson yelled \u201cYou lie!\u201d at during a speech to Congress, turning Wilson into a folk hero amongst those who would have been outraged at such conduct against a white president. </p> <p>I learned that for our one instance of black leadership, for our one taste of the American dream, we would pay with a nation more divided, with enemies more convinced of our inhumanity, with an emboldened hate. </p> <p>And I\u2019ve seen the heartbreaking and perhaps even unforgivable compromises our president has chosen to make these past eight years. I\u2019ve seen glimpses of the carnage wrought by our drone strikes and known that my little boy, born into this election with so much hope, will likely be the one to pay for the enemies we\u2019ve made with all the indefensible deaths we\u2019ve caused. </p> <p>I\u2019ve seen millions of families torn apart as this administration has deported more undocumented immigrants than any other president in our nation\u2019s history. I\u2019ve seen our president try to walk the \u201cmiddle road\u201d on the extrajudicial killings of thousands of black people at the hands of police officers, knowing that if he were to voice too much support for our right to live, he\u2019d be lambasted by those who would claim that he\u2019s anti-white and anti-police. And every time we\u2019d look for a real response and receive platitudes I\u2019d wonder: aren\u2019t we worth the risk?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/15/michelle-obama-rage-politics-donald-trump\">As political discourse descends into rage, thank god for Michelle Obama | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And at the end of eight years of a black president, I\u2019m no more safe, no more equal, and no more free.

And I have to explain to my son that this horror show he sees \u2013 which to him, and to many people of color, is not the recorded conversations and outlandish antics but rather the exploitation, the fear-mongering and the erasure of our humanity \u2013 is how it always was for us before. </p> <p>I\u2019m not ready for lot of things, but most of all, I\u2019m not ready for my child to learn that.</p>",

While approximately 400 people are expected to rally in the morning on the Las Vegas strip, the trucks will be handing out free tacos in order to support the protest.

Band leader Ben Gibbard seized on an anecdote from the first presidential debate in which the Donald claimed he started his business empire with a million dollar loan from his father. It\u2019s a spoof on both privilege and elastic truth, sung with maximum sarcasm and wariness. </p> <p>The American singer-songwriter Bhi Bhiman zeroed in on Trump\u2019s apparent one-way bromance with Vladimir Putin. Using the James Bond-inspired title With Love, From Russia, the song imagines a deal between the two politicians which has Putin taking the Baltic countries while giving Trump in return fantasy properties from Monopoly. An accompanying video surveys a painting of Trump and Putin lost in a deep kiss, as the music lurches through a flatulent synth-pop beat.</p> <p>El Vy \u2013 a project between the National\u2019s Matt Berninger and Ramona Falls\u2019 Brent Knopf \u2013 takes an equally cartoonish approach. The visuals for Are These My Jets center on a video game character named Richard Walrus, who flies a tiny plane that blows things to hell while a weeping Abraham Lincoln looks on. The lyrics aren\u2019t as coherent, but at least they beat the clunk of Before You Vote, a last-ditch entreaty to Trump supporters by Thao Nguyen (of Thao &amp; the Get Down Stay Down). \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about you,\u201d she yelps. \u201cHe just wants his terrible reality show back on NBC.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biMXbtMp-GQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biMXbtMp-GQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Far more insightful humor can be found in Aimee Mann\u2019s contribution. Her sprightly folk-pop song Can\u2019t You Tell aims to get inside Trump\u2019s head, treating his candidacy as a joke he started that got out of control. \u201cIsn\u2019t anybody going to stop me?\u201d she has Trump poignantly ask. \u201cI don\u2019t want this job/I can\u2019t do this job/My God/ can\u2019t you tell?/I\u2019m unwell.\u201d </p> <p>Mann\u2019s song may have the best lines, and the catchiest melody, but a special award for speed should go to Franz Ferdinand for Demagogue. Just two weeks after the Access Hollywood revelation, the band managed to jam in an allusion to Trump\u2019s famous \u201cp\u201d-word outburst. The music has a Bowie-in-Berlin sturm und drang, while the video boasts artwork from Shepard Fairey. Not since Neil Young dashed off Ohio mere weeks after the Kent State shootings has a band reacted this quickly to a public event. Of course, Demagogue hasn\u2019t anywhere near the potency of Ohio.

  "<p>Climate change has been the elephant in the room during the past two US presidential debates. Ignoring this issue would be more understandable if this metaphorical pachyderm weren\u2019t about to rampage through the lives of Americans, causing upheaval on a scale not seen since the start of human civilization.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been shocked at the lack of questions on climate change. It really is fiddling while the world burns,\u201d said Kerry Emanuel, a leading climate scientist. \u201cThis is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it. I\u2019m just baffled by it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have yet to face a moderator question on climate change during two debates in which time was found to grill Clinton repeatedly over her use of emails and to ask Trump about a series of late-night tweets he sent about a former Miss Universe\u2019s sex tape. Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, was reportedly set to ask a climate question but ran out of time. </p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s final debate is set to retread the same ground, with the debate referee, Chris Wallace of Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=71&amp;cntnt01origid=93&amp;cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&amp;cntnt01returnid=80\">planning to prod</a> the candidates on immigration, the economy and \u201cfitness to be president\u201d.</p> \n<p>Wallace has also decided to ask about \u201cforeign hot spots\u201d, but it appears unlikely that it will segue into talking about the diabolical heat suffered in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/kuwait-swelters-record-breaking-54c-heatwave-weather-7152911.html\">Kuwait</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/india-records-its-hottest-day-ever-as-temperature-hits-51c-thats-1238f\">India</a> this year. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a sort of collective cowardice,\u201d said Emanuel of the omission.

Clinton has talked about installing half a billion solar panels, halting oil drilling in the Arctic and, in sobering evidence of this election\u2019s debasement, proudly told the Democratic national convention: \u201cI believe in science.\u201d </p> \n<p>While some liberal Democrats are suspicious of Clinton\u2019s climate credentials \u2013 fears were exacerbated by recent leaked emails <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-wikileaks-update-leaked-emails-show-hillary-told-climate-change-activists-get-2432359\">that show</a> she said those who wanted to shut down fossil fuels should \u201cget a life\u201d \u2013 the former secretary of state\u2019s plan cannot be compared meaningfully with Trump\u2019s.</p> \n<p>The Republican nominee has called climate change a Chinese hoax and \u201cbullshit\u201d. He has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, revive the coal industry while also expanding oil and gas drilling. He has darkly hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency and resurrecting the controversial Keystone oil pipeline. </p> \n<p>\u201cI wish there was a proper battle of ideas that we could judge accordingly,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Green groups have supported Clinton almost as a default position because she\u2019s the only major party candidate who accepts climate science. </p> \n<p>While Clinton and Trump differ on issues such as police shootings, immigration and the economy, both candidates at least accept that these things actually exist. It\u2019s tricky to have a debate on a topic that a participant doesn\u2019t think is real. </p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s denial is shared by many members of Congress, who have been lavished with $29.6m in contributions from fossil fuel companies in the 2016 election cycle, according to figures <a href=\"http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/\">compiled by ClimateTruth.org Action</a>. </p> \n<p>Regardless, here are three germane, and pressing, climate change questions that Wallace could ask: <br></p> \n<p><strong>An overwhelming majority of climate scientists say that climate change is real, caused by humans and a growing threat to our way of life.

  "<p>In Monday night\u2019s game 3 of the AL Championship Series, Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer had to make an early exit after his injured pinkie refused to stop gushing blood. In Massachusetts, the gory sight conjured up surprisingly positive memories: it was hard not to think back to Curt Schilling\u2019s starts in game 6 of the 2004 ALCS and game 2 of the World Series. Pitching on a surgically repaired ankle with blood dripping through thick socks, the Red Sox ace stayed in the game, mowing down the offenses of the New York Yankees and then the St Louis Cardinals on the way towards the team\u2019s first championship in 86 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/11/david-ortiz-big-papi-retires-boston-red-sox\">The Red Sox say goodbye to Big Papi, and Boston will never be the same</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schilling, in essence, was sacrificing his body, risking his entire career, to deliver New England a World Series title many thought they would never live to see. It was such a vivid drama that it could have been the climax of a particularly cringe-worthy Kevin Costner movie, so much so that there remain baseball fans who still believe it was faked. To see Bauer in action was, for Massachusetts residents, to be reminded of the old Curt Schilling, the Schilling who made such a memorable sacrifice to such long-suffering fans.</p> <p>It was easily the most defining moment in Schilling\u2019s remarkable playing career. So, yesterday, with his 2004 heroics <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/francona-making-right-moves-cleveland-keeps-rolling/\">returning to public consciousness</a>, Schilling decided it was the perfect time to make his announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve made my decision,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/18/curt-schilling-elizabeth-warren-massachusetts-state-senate\">he said</a> to Boston radio station WRKO, confirming talk that he would run for Senate in 2018, presumably against sitting senator Elizabeth Warren. He did give himself an out, however: \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Shonda, my wife. And ultimately it\u2019s going to come down to how we feel about our marriage and our kids.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time when the notion of Senator Curt Schilling (R-MA) <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/curt-schilling-for-what-feels-like-the-hundredth-time-1787928947?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">seemed like it was possible</a>. In 2009, while still basking in the glow of his Red Sox heroics, his name was bandied about as the Republican candidate in the 2010 special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy. He demurred, saying it wasn\u2019t his time, and the Republicans nominated moderate Scott Brown, who eventually beat out Democratic candidate Martha Coakley on 19 January 2010.</p> <p>Instead of politics, Schilling was deep into video game developing. In 2011 he moved the company he founded, 38 Studios, from Massachusetts to Rhode Island after securing $75m of taxpayer money. 38 Studios <a href=\"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/07/38-studios-end-game/\">went bust in 2012</a>, a debacle that resulted in a lawsuit filed by Rhode Island, since settled and a fraud investigation by the Rhode Island state police.</p> <p>Following the failure of 38 Studios, Schilling focused on broadcasting. It went better than his time in gaming, only in that he didn\u2019t make an enemy out of an entire US state this time around. During a stint with ESPN, when Schilling wasn\u2019t <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://deadspin.com/espn-suspends-keith-law-from-twitter-for-defending-evol-1661836868\">arguing with co-workers</a> about evolution, he was using his down time to share increasingly controversial political views and offensive cartoons, most notoriously one comparing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/26/curt-schilling-espn-twitter-mlb\">Muslims and Nazis</a>. This led to a lengthy suspension, during which he was forced to defend his own <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/curt-schilling-nazi-world-war-ii-collection-muslim-tweet-espn-suspension/y25n11fae8l11tygm6h64tv7\">Nazi memorabilia collection</a>. His return didn\u2019t last too long. In April of this year, one final meme, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/espn-fires-curt-schilling-transgender-facebook-comments\">this one highly transphobic,</a> ended his tenure at ESPN permanently.</p> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/21/curt-schilling-espn-firing-baseball-transphobia\">overdue termination</a>, and his subsequent embrace of his new role of truth-telling conservative martyr, victim of the PC police, hastened his full plunge into politics. The transition hasn\u2019t gone smoothly, even as the political bar for acceptable discourse has plummeted to unfathomable new depths. Most recently, Schilling was defending Donald Trump\u2019s habit of flirting with pre-teens in a way that was creepy even by Trump surrogate standards.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEHCK9Q-6jI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xEHCK9Q-6jI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If Schilling makes good on his decision to run for the US Senate, he will till have a significant group of core supporters. The problem is that things like calling for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/09/19/curt-schillings-solution-for-terrorism-executions-without-trial/\">\u201ca version of the Berlin Wall\u201d</a> on the Mexican border, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/08/25/espn-analyst-curt-schillings-worst-facebook-pos/205146\">equating Islam straight up with terrorism</a> aren\u2019t going to play very well in heavily liberal-leaning Massachusetts, no matter how many great memories voters have of him striking out Alex Rodriguez.</p> <p>At this point in his life, Schilling is a failed broadcaster and a businessman who, through either incompetence or deceit, has already screwed over one state in New England. He has gained no specific political experience since he declined to run in 2009 \u2013 unless you count his time spent as an unpaid racist meme curator. He\u2019s Trump without without the smarmy charisma that allows Trump to skate away from scandal far more intact than he has any right to be. Instead, Schilling is something more basic. Schilling\u2019s <a href=\"https://theringer.com/curt-schilling-political-aspirations-9f32bc426c4b#.grozglwry\">that one uncle on Facebook</a>, just with three World Series rings and access to multiple media outlets.</p> <p>Scott Brown managed to pull off his special election victory back in 2009 for two reasons. First, Brown, a Republican, was able to position himself as a moderate who appealed to a broad range of voters, an avenue thoroughly closed off to Schilling at this point. Secondly, he was running against a candidate in Martha Coakley who drew lukewarm water levels of enthusiasm, even among registered Democrats. It also didn\u2019t help that she inexplicably called Schilling a \u201cYankees fan\u201d during her 2009 campaign (this may end up being Schilling\u2019s biggest positive contribution to Massachusetts GOP history.)</p> <p>Warren, who defeated Brown in the 2012, makes a formidable opponent for any GOP candidate to face \u2013 partly because her supporters are so passionate. Warren was popular enough (a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/senate-approval-bernie-rubio-cruz/\">61% popularity rating</a>, according to one recent poll) that there was recent talk that Clinton was considering her as her vice-president. This was opposed by many liberals, not because she would be unsuited for the job, but because they considered her too important <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/06/13/vp_does_not_make_sense_for_elizabeth_warren_130860.html\">to remove from the Senate</a>. In short, Schilling v Warren could end up being an absolute bloodbath. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/09/30/elizabeth-warren-curt-schilling-senate-poll-2018-president/\">recent poll</a> showed Warren holding a 19-point lead over Schilling in a hypothetical election.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to say that there\u2019s absolutely no way that Schilling would actually become the GOP nominee, it would be tantamount to party suicide. But after this presidential election, it is foolish to assume that this is the case. In a sane and just world, this wouldn\u2019t end up being anything other than a one-time local hero burning through the last of his goodwill on yet another hopeless scheme. But that might not be the type of world we currently inhabit.</p>",

Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/trending/2016/10/oregon_high_school_athletes_re.html\">A group of male high school athletes in Oregon</a> posed in feminist shirts with the picture\u2019s caption reading, \u201csexual assault is not locker room banter\u201d; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-locker-room-banter-athletes-reaction\">pro athletes across the country</a> weighed in on social media, decrying the idea that this is just what men are like; a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/locker-room-talk_us_5803819fe4b0e8c198a89710\">player for Amherst College\u2019s men\u2019s soccer team</a> criticized Trump\u2019s comments, writing: \u201cAs a sports team, we have found success by valuing the ideal of doing the right thing even when no one is watching.\u201d These men and others are quelling that nauseated feeling I\u2019ve had the last week or so. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161018womenst_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161018womenst.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161018womenst_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yes, it should go without saying that men don\u2019t support groping or vile comments about women and their bodies.

But her life changed after a nervous breakdown. Now relying on social security, she was forced to leave her Seattle apartment when the rent went from $950 to $1,450 a month. She\u2019s been staying outdoors at Tent City 3, an encampment operated by homeless residents, while trying to save for a rental deposit.</p> <p>Over the last year, Portland, Seattle and the state of Hawaii have declared a state of emergency on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/09/homelessness-us-election-2016-san-francisco-voting\">homelessness</a>, with other cities considering it. But in the presidential election, the issue is receiving minimal political attention. At homeless camps Hazelnut Grove in Portland and Tent City 3 in Seattle, the issues that led people to become homeless reflect on the issues facing many voters this election: soaring rent, debt, access to healthcare, discrimination.</p> <p>We asked several camp residents for their thoughts.</p> <h2>Amyann Darden, 55: \u2018Retaining social security is an important issue to me\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5013b8da3e28e2578afa9e8f42eb3f6b6c65e886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5013b8da3e28e2578afa9e8f42eb3f6b6c65e886/0_109_1700_2441/696.jpg\" alt=\"Amyann Darden.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amyann Darden in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was going to vote Republican but when I watched the convention and saw what Trump stood for, I thought, \u201cNo way.\u201d His platform\u2019s based on hatred and fear.

Now he\u2019s telling people to vote for Hillary; I\u2019m disappointed in him.</p> <p>There are many misconceptions of houseless people. First of all, that we don\u2019t work \u2013 we do. I had a job for a long time at a country club. I would say through that I\u2019ve been subject to employment discrimination as a female who\u2019s trans.</p> <p>There are also the insinuations that we\u2019re lazy, use drugs, we\u2019re all thieves. In Hazelnut Grove, where I\u2019m lucky enough to live, we\u2019re an intentional community. If you steal from someone, you\u2019re run the hell out. Here there\u2019s the idea that if you put into the community, the community reciprocates. I feel like that type of culture is being squeezed out during the gentrification process [of Portland]. Property values are taking precedence over community.</p> <h2>Andrew Constantino, 41: \u2018I have to watch the train wreck\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"dd407800bd70c16ff416b30f0a770bc6c99ba5b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd407800bd70c16ff416b30f0a770bc6c99ba5b6/0_200_1700_2350/723.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Constantino\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Constantino in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m voting for Hillary.

You hear all these Trump lovers here. I try telling them, \u201cDo you realize he\u2019s the type of person who doesn\u2019t care about anything that\u2019s ever happened to you?\u201d But it\u2019s like being with your family at Thanksgiving; you try avoiding those conversations because they go nowhere.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived in Seattle for almost 20 years. It\u2019s become more and more expensive to survive. When my girlfriend and I lost our jobs very close together, we burned through our savings.</p> <p>We\u2019re both working full time again, but it\u2019s just that there are no good options. I refuse to pay some exorbitant amount of rent to live in absolute poverty.

She\u2019s more interested in the needs of the rich and powerful.</p> <p>If I could only vote between her and Trump, I\u2019d choose her. The thought of him winning scares me, especially for women. I\u2019ve got two daughters and two granddaughters. If he\u2019s voted in, he\u2019ll turn back the clock. He\u2019s already stirring up trouble by getting people worried about immigrants.</p> <p>None of the candidates are addressing homelessness. It\u2019s an invisible society. Lots of people here don\u2019t know they can vote. But when we had a voter drive, around 30 people registered and were excited to find they could vote.</p> <p>I have peripheral neuropathy and spinal stenosis. This is the second time I\u2019ve been homeless. About five years ago, my husband said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get stuck taking care of you.\u201d He said he wanted a divorce, which is fine. I was homeless while I waited for the settlement but then I got a house. I had to go into hospital and while I was very unwell; I lost my house. It went into foreclosure in July. I stayed with friends but they\u2019ve got some other people staying there now, but I\u2019m going back when they\u2019re gone.

  "<p>The face of celebrity has changed dramatically in recent years. That\u2019s not a cheap shot at Kylie Jenner\u2019s lip fillers \u2013 it\u2019s true. Aside from tabloids such as the Daily Mail which uphold the old-school ideals of celeb reportage (three Cs: credulity, censoriousness and a concerted effort to divide women up into their constituent body parts), the advent of the meme age has transformed the way we talk about famous people.

It was a revelation that resurrected the pre-web celeb narrative of Jennifer Aniston v Brangelina: the idea that Jolie stole Aniston\u2019s husband and left her single, childless and old (well, 35 at the time, but she is a woman). Aside from Jolie\u2019s 2012 leg fandango, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2012/feb/28/angelina-jolie-right-leg-oscar\">where her bizarre determination to showcase her right leg</a> through a slit in her dress prompted a <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/angelina-jolie-s-leg\">raft of mocking photoshop jobs</a>, the trio aren\u2019t really meme material, being old-school celebs who avoid social media and whose public outings usually only projected the one expression: smug marrieds.</p> <p>Luckily there was still Aniston, whose time on Friends had generated feelings of faux-intimacy among fans (it is the ultimate millennial series, after all), as well as providing endlessly memeable footage of her expressing the full gamut of emotions, all of which meant social media users were able to convert the breakdown of a family into viral fun. The resulting memes, mostly repurposed Friends screengrabs, consisted of Aniston looking triumphant at the demise of the evil Brangelina. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f124cb87c7e39740579cff6a00bb6987bae88c4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f124cb87c7e39740579cff6a00bb6987bae88c4d/0_0_632_877/360.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Post\u2019s reaction to the Brangelina split.\" width=\"360\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Post\u2019s reaction to the Brangelina split.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@nypost</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/18/harambe-the-gorilla-and-the-month-in-memes\">Harambe the gorilla: whose meme is it anyway?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Notably, US tabloid the New York Post decided to capitalise on this, and its cover channelled the proliferation of memes with a picture of Aniston laughing under the headline \u201cBrangelina 2004-2016\u201d. That this was widely perceived as being excessively crass spoke volumes about the new mode of celebrity coverage. The internet may have made our relationship with celebrities more intrusive, intimate and presumptuous, but it has been tempered by a tone that is often affectionate and amateur; even professional coverage on sites such as Buzzfeed makes itself out to be breathless fan art (\u201c23 times Taylor Swift was right about life\u201d, etc). Yet a powerful celeb-shaming outlet like the Post simply cannot co-opt that mood; when it tries to, it looks try-hard and strange, sort of like Angelina Jolie trying to show people her leg.</p> <p>Slightly more serious than the marital problems of the super-wealthy are the recent exploits of a web-based frog. Before Dat Boi and Kermit, the frog meme scene was dominated by a single anthropomorphic amphibian. <strong>Pepe The Frog</strong> began life as a character in a 00s comic called Boy\u2019s Club. In the following years he gained widespread popularity: his likeness became shorthand for a number of \u201cfeels\u201d (sadness, smugness, optimism), and his lo-fi Microsoft Paint aesthetic made him one of the most visually distinctive characters on the web.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"327e46c3ab049358fad80575146be9e0e65686e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/327e46c3ab049358fad80575146be9e0e65686e7/0_56_1023_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pepe the Frog.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pepe the Frog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s fair to say then that his trajectory took something of a left-turn in September, when the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/pepe-the-frog.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/#.V_5paDYrJdA\">Anti-Defamation League made the decision to declare Pepe a hate symbol</a>. Like most bizarre and depressing things that have happened in recent months, it has something to do with one Donald Trump. In October of last year, the Republican candidate retweeted a fan illustration that merged his likeness with Pepe\u2019s. Then, last month, Donald Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump posted a doctored parody of the poster for action film The Expendables on Instagram with the reappropriated epithet The Deplorables (a reference to Hillary Clinton categorising half of Trump supporters as belonging to \u201ca basket of deplorables\u201d). Alongside conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and internet troll du jour Milo Yiannopoulos, there stood Pepe the frog. How did he end up there?</p> <p>It was thanks to the Trump-supporting white nationalist movement widely referred to as the alt-right. They have spent the past few years co-opting Pepe into their world via a series of racist memes, which in turn made him a symbol for those views. It\u2019s a sad demise for a meme that was once a favourite for so many. More importantly, it\u2019s a scary indication of the internet-savviness of Trump supporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc418b83ad9bc9a5869a3bd727d7cd8c857e1598\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc418b83ad9bc9a5869a3bd727d7cd8c857e1598/0_0_626_934/335.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump reimagined as Pepe the Frog.\" width=\"335\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump reimagined as Pepe the Frog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@codyave</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of things that give you nightmares, one unhappy customer recently took to Facebook after sampling some Sainsbury\u2019s vegan cheese, telling the supermarket to \u201cCall it Gary or something just don\u2019t call it cheese because it\u2019s not cheese!\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s responded by mocking up a packet of \u201c<strong>Gary</strong>\u201d in a tweet, which was shared thousands of times by approving users. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3dd38a52ab35a79cf3ec70ab742cd736a11f0ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3dd38a52ab35a79cf3ec70ab742cd736a11f0ad/0_0_631_875/361.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cGary\u201d.\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cGary\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@sainsburys</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a sign of these strange times that broadcasting the fact your products don\u2019t do what they say on the tin can still be a masterclass in marketing and also an important lesson for shops: next time someone criticises your product on sicial media, don\u2019t play it down \u2013 make it a meme.</p>",
  "<p>Despite some reassurance from polls, many are still worried about Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton. Some deal with this anxiety through prayer, others get on the internet and rage. If you are Michael Moore, you go and shoot a movie and have it debut in New York City 11 days later to tremendous international fanfare.</p> <p>Moore, the most famous thing from Flint, Michigan besides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/20/grand-funk-railroad-footstompin-music\">Grand Funk Railroad </a>and poisonous water, understands more than most just how appealing a \u201cfuck you\u201d vote for Trump would be. In his new emergency film, Michael Moore in TrumpLand, he thinks his way inside the head of a dejected working-class citizen from, as he puts it, one of the \u201cBrexit states\u201d of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Ohio. All states that could still swing to Trump and lead to to an upset victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7660425143ba9f91cdfbd66da9976f9c02053b86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7660425143ba9f91cdfbd66da9976f9c02053b86/0_10_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Art installation All-Seeing Trump outside the IFC Theater showing Michale Moore in TrumpLand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Art installation All-Seeing Trump outside the IFC Theater in New York showing Michael Moore in TrumpLand</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was in Ohio that Moore hastily put on the one-man show that the film records, a mix of a TED Talk and Spalding Gray-esque monologue in which he thinks through his misgivings about Hillary Clinton but ultimately works himself up into a froth of support. TrumpLand is a fascinating document, but undeniably awkward in presentation. A few of his jokes land, but Moore is hardly Chris Rock or Louis CK. He\u2019s more like a good public radio DJ who can slip in an above-average zinger now and then. </p> <p>What\u2019s a little cringeworthy, though, is the repeated use of audience reaction shots. Every talking point is met with an assertive head nod, tissue-dabbed cheek or virtuous applause. It\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abrWTwxoo4Q]\">that Monty Python clip</a> of the old ladies clapping, but twice as hilarious, unintentional though that may be.</p> <p>Moore does get serious, and when he does, his Holy Roller for the ethical culture set schtick works. Moore\u2019s feminist bona fides seem legit. His stage is dressed with photos of college-aged Hillary Rodham, and he plays a clip from her <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=2CAUOa5m5nY\">commencement address from Wellesley College</a>. He argues that this is the real Clinton, not the woman who stood by a serial adulterer or who is too cosy with Wall Street. (Moore, who voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, has been extremely critical of Clinton for this last point.) He compares her to Pope Francis, who remained silent during the years of the Argentinian junta, but who, once elected, unleashed a new era of liberalism in the Holy See.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/19/michael-moore-gets-behind-hillary-clinton-at-surprise-trumpland-film-screening\">Michael Moore gets behind Hillary Clinton at surprise TrumpLand film screening</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a ridiculous argument, but that isn\u2019t the point. Moore doesn\u2019t want to tear Trump down so much as he wants to build Clinton up, and however much of a dingus he may be (some of his jokes really don\u2019t work), he is sincere in his optimism and empathy. That\u2019s something that you just can\u2019t fake. When Moore talks about his mother, and the current sea change in the conversation about rape culture, he builds a strong case that is totally pro-Clinton, not anti-Trump. And, yes, there is a whole riff about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/may/23/campaign-president-2016-live-updates-trump-clinton-sanders-polling?page=with:block-5743706ce4b0e361e755cc2a\">Vince Foster conspiracy theories</a>, suggesting that Hillary is some sort of ninja assassin, that got a few belly laughs out of me.</p> <p>Michael Moore in TrumpLand is not, unfortunately, likely to sway many voters. For all his good intentions, Moore\u2019s unique blend of greasy palmed populism and hard-left truthbombs isn\u2019t what it takes to get a Trump voter to turn his or her dormant brain back on. The movie also takes a good long while to find its rhythm, which is very much a problem when its only got a 73-minute running time. </p> <p>You\u2019ll have as much luck telling Michael Moore what to do as as someone in a Make America Great Again baseball cap, though, and if spending a few weeks before election day putting this together is what he thinks will work \u2013 well, I guess I\u2019m With Him.</p>",

Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull\u2019s messages. But his National MPs have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split.</p> <p><strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s </strong>revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result of internal pressure from the National party and presumably some Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the \u201csplit\u201d story for the PM. Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm (given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do so, we don\u2019t know.</p> <p>So if the import ban is lifted \u2013 as at least some of the Nats would like \u2013 it will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over Turnbull.</p> <p><strong>Enter WA premier Colin Barnett</strong>. He has said this:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it\u2019s obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into this state.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and his issue with the Nats.</p> <p>If the states cannot decide on the category \u2013 as they are required to do under the National Firearms Agreement \u2013 the import ban stays for the time being. This would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision \u2013 that is the condition of the Howard laws. </p> <p>As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he fought the good fight for shooters. If the ban is lifted, it was all because of him. </p> <p>The art of politics. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c8f06f994597815ba50b0c87057fbdfdf94be03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c8f06f994597815ba50b0c87057fbdfdf94be03/0_113_1310_1637/800.jpg\" alt=\"Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T06:09:21.112Z\">at 7.09am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5807022fe4b0cd26ff71e94c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T05:20:42.424Z\">6.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The house is sitting until 8pm. </p> <p>The VET bills are still in the house. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5806fe5ae4b005f21833ae8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T05:03:29.276Z\">6.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In an attempt to rein-in rising private health insurance premiums, the health minister, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, has announced reforms aimed at cutting the costs of medical devices and prostheses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/19/cutting-medical-device-and-prostheses-costs-should-lower-health-premiums-says-minister\">writes Mel Davey</a>.</p> <p>The high cost prostheses, which includes devices like pacemakers and replacement hips and knees, are currently being passed on to private patients through rising insurance premiums.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5806fc42e4b005f21833ae82\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T04:58:28.654Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wayne Swan v BHP: Part four - the dummy spit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You may remember last week <strong>Wayne Swan</strong> tore strips off BHP regarding their tax affairs last week.</p> <p><strong>From our friends at AAP:</strong></p> <p>Former treasurer <strong>Wayne Swan</strong> has accused BHP Billiton of a \u201cdummy spit\u201d over criticism of its tax affairs.<br><br>The mining giant\u2019s chief executive <strong>Andrew Mackenzie</strong> told a function in London on Monday the \u201ccontinual questioning of our economic and social contribution\u201d in Australia was \u201cchilling\u201d when compared to countries such as Chile.<br><br>Mackenzie said the president of Chile, where BHP owns 57.5% of the Escondida copper mine, had recently praised the company\u2019s economic and social contribution.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But in our home country of Australia where we have contributed hugely to employment, and through taxes and royalties, we still find ourselves blamed for problems that we didn\u2019t cause and the target, if you like, of people who assume that we are the ones trying to avoid tax.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swan told parliament on Wednesday BHP could not claim to be transparent over its tax affairs \u201cgiven their failure to clearly outline numerous back payments to the Australian taxation office as a result of tax audits over a decade\u201d.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>BHP are like that guest at the hotel.

And after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/foster-carers-fight-working-rights-trade-unions\" title=\"\">foster carers voted to join the IWGB</a> last month over concerns about their lack of employment rights, the union is looking at the viability of a legal test case to challenge their employment status. In all, it now has 1,000 members and 19 elected officials.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee is a US citizen. His involvement in trade unions stems from his student days at Soas University of London. While there, as a fluent Spanish speaker, (he also speaks French, Portuguese, Italian and a smattering of Arabic and Chichewa) he helped the university\u2019s cleaners \u2013 mostly from South America, many of whom had come to England on Spanish passports \u2013 improve their English. He then helped Unison\u2019s 2011 campaign to get the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/victory-cleaning-staff-strike-at-university-of-london-wins-major-concessions-on-pay-and-conditions-8972785.html\" title=\"\">outsourced cleaners, security and maintenance staff at the University of London</a> the London living wage.</p> <p>Following that campaign\u2019s success, as a student activist Moyer-Lee helped organise the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/12/03/harry-stopes/not-a-recognised-union/\" title=\"\">3 Cosas campaign</a>. This successfully argued that there were three areas where disparity between university staff and contract workers was greatest and that they should also get the same sick pay, holidays and pension rights as direct employees of the university. The 3 Cosas campaign developed within the university branch of Unison, but in April 2013 many of the workers joined the IWGB.</p> <p>The bicycle couriers\u2019 tribunal cases are the culmination of 18 months\u2019 efforts to improve their working conditions. The outcome will undoubtedly be influenced by the test case brought by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\" title=\"\">19 drivers for the taxi-ride app Uber</a>, who are also seeking \u201cworker\u201d status.

If we are not careful, tomorrow we will wake up and none of us will have the minimum wage, sick pay or paid holidays. The IWGB has been at the forefront of the struggle for decent working conditions for these low-paid workers and we will continue to fight until everyone has decent working rights.\u201d</p> <p>But Moyer-Lee\u2019s efforts to help the low paid nearly came at the expense of his right to stay in the UK. After completing his PhD, he applied for a graduate entrepreneur visa to enable him to remain in the UK when his student visa expired at the end of 2014. Under the scheme, graduates from oustide the EU with a credible business proposal are sponsored by their university for an application to remain. Soas <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/soas-research-assistant-claims-bias-in-visa-decision/2017390.article\" title=\"\">initially turned Moyer-Lee down</a> and he could have been deported, until the decision was reversed. From a workers\u2019 rights perspective, he believes leaving the EU will be \u201ca total disaster\u201d. European courts tend to be more generous in their interpretation of statutes as they relate to workers\u2019 rights than UK courts, he points out. And without the EU blocking it, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to prevent future Tory governments from shredding rights\u201d, he adds. Furthermore, UK workers won\u2019t benefit from any new protections the EU introduces. And as many of the IWGB\u2019s members have Spanish passports, Brexit&#xa0;will \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affect its members.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee is very committed to helping the lowest paid, but is aware this makes the IWGB reliant on donors and grants to top up its funding. Members pay just \u00a34-\u00a39 a month in subs, nowhere near enough to cover the IWGB\u2019s costs. \u201cThese are mainly low-paid workers who can\u2019t afford to pay more, yet make a disproportionately high demand on our resources,\u201d he says. So the union has launched a <a href=\"https://www.crowdpac.co.uk/campaigns/216/the-independent-workers-union-of-great-britain\" title=\"\">crowdfunding drive</a> to help finance its campaigns.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee has no immediate plans to return to the US, particularly given the \u201cdismal\u201d state of politics there. He grew up in Maine in a family of Democrats who have always been involved in politics. \u201cMy state is governed by a reactionary Tea Party governor, and the presidential choice is between bad on the one hand and utterly terrifying and repulsive on the other,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Bernie Sanders in the primary and will be voting [Hillary] Clinton in the general.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIt is sometimes tempting to go home and try and do something about the situation rather than despair on the sidelines.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>30.</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married.</p> <p><strong>Lives </strong>south London</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>Greely high school, North Yarmouth, Maine; American University of Paris, BA international economics; School of Oriental and African Studies, Msc, development economics, PhD economics.</p> <p><strong>Career </strong>2016: general secretary, Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain; 2015-present: director, Grassroots Organiser Ltd; 2012-14: campaign organiser, 3 Cosas campaign; 2014: branch secretary, then vice-president, IWGB; 2012: admissions assistant, Soas; 2010-13: ad hoc research assistant for academic Deborah Johnston.</p> <p><strong>Interests </strong>Dancing, politics.</p>",

In Ottawa last week, Canadian prime minister <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/eu-rejection-canada-trade-pact-send-wrong-message-150527090.html\">Justin Trudeau</a> surveyed the hundreds of thousands of Europeans demonstrating against the continent\u2019s treaty with his country and said: \u201cIf \u2026 Europe is unable to sign a progressive trade agreement with a country like Canada, well, then with whom will Europe think that it can do business in the years to come?\u201d</p> <p>Their outriders in the press have dropped the pretence of liberal politesse for red-cheeked self-righteousness. The hairy-palmed hordes are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/liberal-internationalists-populists-globalisation\">coming for our internationalism</a>! As if internationalism were little more than business-class flights and the freedom to structure derivatives across several time zones. The Economist slaps an image of anti-globalisation demonstrators on its cover with the headline: \u201c<a href=\"https://image.issuu.com/161002070406-64bef4336bdc2cc1ad4576efec597e0b/jpg/page_1.jpg\">Why they\u2019re wrong</a>\u201d. Note that use of \u201cthey\u201d, with its shadow of the drawbridge being hastily pulled up. Coming soon, perhaps: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get the 99% we deserve?\u201d</p> <p>I heartily agree that Nigel Farage and Trump are grotesques. But the free-traders peddle their own untruths. They have insisted that black is white, even as the voters beg to differ. In their seminar rooms, their TV studios and their Geneva offices, they have perpetrated the ideological sleight of hand that equates internationalism with free trade, and globalisation with untrammelled corporate power. The result has been misery for workers from Bolton to Baltimore to Bangladesh. But it has also left the six-figure technocrats who supervise our economic system pushing a zombie idea. Because that is what free trade has become: an idea leached of life and meaning but stumbling on for want of any replacement. We have a globalisation for bankers, but not for children fleeing the bombs of Syria. Security for investors but not for workers.</p> <p>To see how debased the notion of free trade has become, look at the deal between Canada and the EU that is currently being voted through Europe\u2019s parliaments. It\u2019s called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</a> (Ceta), and the fact that you can see it at all is largely down to leaks of the documents, which forced the European commission to publish,. That is after the negotiations were conducted for five years in secret, with even the <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/15-eu-canada-trade-negotiating-mandate-made-public/\">directives kept hidden</a> from the hundreds of millions of citizens affected.</p> <p>This is no minor technical work. Provided it is passed in time, Ceta will apply to Britain too \u2013 and parts of it will affect Britons\u2019 lives even after we\u2019ve \u201ctaken back control\u201d. It has been billed as \u201ca backdoor for TTIP\u201d, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/28/eus-ttip-trade-deal-with-the-us-has-collapsed-says-germany/\">collapsed this summer</a> amid public opposition both in Europe and the US. Like TTIP, Ceta includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">investor-state dispute settlement system</a> \u2013 which hands big business the power to sue governments, including for profits they haven\u2019t made yet. A US multinational with an office in Canada (nearly all of them) will be able to sue Britons for bringing in laws that lose them money. This was the mechanism tobacco giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/australia-wins-international-legal-battle-with-philip-morris-over-plain-packaging\">Philip Morris used to sue Australia\u2019s government</a> for bringing in plain packaging. On that occasion, Big Tobacco was unsuccessful \u2013 but it took four years of expensive legal battle.</p> <p>Free trade used to be about tackling protectionism; now it\u2019s about protecting big business \u2013 against the public. If populists take a complex situation, offer a simple answer and warn any dissenters of gruesome consequences, then the free-traders are guilty of populism too. With Ceta or TTIP, it goes like this: if this deal goes through, then economies will grow, jobs will appear, and a rising tide will lift all boats, from super-yacht to rubber dinghy. That is pretty much what mainstream politicians of Europe \u2013 both left and right \u2013 and their officials are saying about the deal with Canada.</p> <p>In economic history, never mind that the biggest winners \u2013 whether the US in the early 1900s or China now \u2013 are those who break the free trade rules. Never mind that the actual forecasts for Ceta show the gains will be relatively meagre. Never mind that the studies cited don\u2019t bother to look at who wins and loses, and by how much.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An auto engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer. If there aren\u2019t any jobs, they can work for Deliveroo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most of all, ignore their shared assumption that after any deal the affected economies undergo a short, sharp shock before bouncing back. Anyone who has lived through the past eight years has heard that one before. After the financial crisis, the Bank of England and Treasury both kept forecasting a return to normal \u2013 and they kept getting it wrong. Eight years on, that bounceback hasn\u2019t materialised. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01\">British workers are still not paid as much</a> after inflation as they were when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>That assumption\u2019s lack of substance is called a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d by two independent economists, Pierre Kohler and Servaas Storm, in a <a href=\"http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/16-03CETA.pdf\">recent paper</a> scrutinising the likely effects of Ceta. As they say, it presumes that laid-off workers \u201cwill rapidly find new jobs\u201d \u2013 whatever the industry, however far away the employer. A car engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer. And if there aren\u2019t any actual jobs, they can deliver takeaways for Deliveroo.</p> <p>The assumptions are both laughably far-fetched and, in the cost citizens are expected to bear, disgusting. No wonder the EU would rather there was as little public discussion as possible.</p> <p>Using a model employed by the UN, Kohler and Storm found that the benefits of Ceta become microscopic next to the costs. For at least the first seven years after the agreement is brought in, unemployment will rise, wages will fall and economies will see their growth rates decline. Governments will lose revenue, and so increase austerity.</p> <p>The burden will fall hardest on the poorest, the lowest-skilled, older people and those with disabilities. A senior lecturer at Delft University of Technology, Storm summed up for me the consequences: \u201cThe weaker your position in an economy, the more strongly you\u2019ll feel the fall-out.\u201d These aren\u2019t people and regions who are left behind: they\u2019ve been chucked off the train by their own governments. This is the settlement free-traders, left and right, are fighting to impose on voters.
