  "<p>The stage has been set for the most politically charged court case in Brazil\u2019s modern history after a judge ruled that former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\">Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva</a> must stand trial on charges of corruption. </p> <p>Judge Sergio Moro \u2013 who has overseen the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation into bribery and kickbacks at Petrobras and other major corporations \u2013 must now assess allegations that the Workers\u2019 party figurehead accepted 3.7m reais ($1.1m) in bribes.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/brazil-ex-president-luiz-ignacio-lula-da-silva-interview\">'There is no crime': Brazil's ex-president keeps faith in party and justice system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lula denies the accusations, which he claims are an attempt to prevent him from running in the next presidential election in 2018.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The decision to go ahead with the trial \u2013 which will take place in the city of Curitiba \u2013 comes amid a period of intense political and economic turmoil, which has been exacerbated by the two-year Lava Jato investigation and a conspiracy to end 13 years of Workers\u2019 party rule.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last month, Lula\u2019s successor president <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeached-president-brazilian-senate-michel-temer\">Dilma Rousseff was impeached and ejected</a> from office less than halfway through her mandate on relatively minor charges of window-dressing state accounts ahead of the 2014 election.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last week, Brazil\u2019s congress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/eduardo-cunha-brazilian-politician-impeachment-dilma-rousseff-expelled\">expelled the politician who orchestrated that campaign</a>, former speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is accused of accepting millions in bribes and stashing them in secret Swiss bank accounts. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>New president Michel Temer has also been implicated in the scandal, three of his ministers have been forced to resign, and other senior figures in his ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party (PMDB) are expected to come under more pressure in the weeks ahead.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Brazil\u2019s major cities have witnessed sporadic, large and sometimes violent street protests for much of the past year, most recently focussed on a Fora Temer (Temer Out) campaign. The president is booed whenever he appears in public and has also divided the region. When he spoke at the United Nations on Tuesday, delegates from Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Costa Rica walked out in a sign that they refuse to recognise his legitimacy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The trial of Lula could raise temperatures further. The former union leader has dominated the political landscape since he led the Workers\u2019 party to its first presidential victory in 2002.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Prosecutors allege that he kept his party \u2013 and its allies, including Temer\u2019s PMDB \u2013 in power with funds illegally obtained from over-inflated contracts from government-run companies, such as Petrobras. <br></p> <p>Last week, public prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, said Lula was the \u201ckingpin\u201d in the Petrobras scheme, which caused an estimated 42bn reais ($12.6bn) in losses.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the conductor of this criminal orchestra,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/brazil-petrobras-oil-kickback-scandal-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\">Dallagnol said</a>. \u201cThe Petrobras graft scheme aimed at keeping the Workers\u2019 party in power by criminal means.\u201d<br></p> <p>Prosecutors also allege that Lula benefited through refurbishments carried out by construction companies at two properties. This is denied by the former president and his lawyers, who say he does not own the properties in question and has not even visited one of them. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Workers\u2019 party supporters claim the Lava Jato investigation is politically biased and that most of those accused in other parties will not be held to justice. Underlining their fears, congressmen last night attempted to push through legislation that would grant sitting lawmakers amnesty.</p> <p>The implications go far beyond the trial itself. Ana Claudia Farranha, a law professor at the University of Brasilia, said the legal case \u2013 although contentious \u2013 will distract Da Silva and complicate the next presidential election in which he is the frontrunner. </p> <p>Ultimately, she said, it could lead to a realignment of political parties.<br>\u201cThe fence is closing around Lula,\u201d said Farranha. </p> <p>\u201cAs the investigations progress, Lula weakens. I think we will see big surprises for 2018 \u2026 I don\u2019t think the PT (Workers Party) will disappear, but there will be a redefinition of party blocs.\u201d</p>",

In 2011 he used Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/106431713835614208\">to describe</a> who he thought was Representative Maxine Waters, who has served in Congress for 25 years, as looking \u201clike a stripper\u201d; and in 2012 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/158341867564564482\">he joked</a> about Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State football coach who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for child abuse.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/best-tweets-from-donald-trump-jr?utm_term=.jcj4gZgE9#.qbqMwRwvW\">BuzzFeed catalogued</a> 49 of Trump Jr\u2019s tweets earlier this year. The collection portrays him as surprisingly immature for a man approaching 40. Trump Jr repeatedly refers to people tweeting at him as \u201cmorons\u201d, while he also described himself as \u201c<a href=\"http://gawker.com/the-one-best-tweet-from-donald-trump-jr-1755251923\">a boob guy</a>\u201d and called a follower a \u201cpussy\u201d.</p> <p>This year Trump Sr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/08/trump-repeats-insult-from-crowd-member-calling-cruz-a-pussy\">referred to Ted Cruz as a pussy</a> during the Republican presidential primary.</p> <p>Trump Jr\u2019s behaviour would not matter if he was just a rogue son tweeting from a basement. But he is a surrogate for his father\u2019s presidential campaign who even <a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/173659-transcript-of-donald-trump-jrs-rnc-speech-focuses-on-his-fathers-strengths-why-hes-better\">spoke at the Republican national convention</a> in August, and was also involved in the vice-presidential selection process. Trump Jr even met with the National Rifle Association ahead of them endorsing his father, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-jrs-skittles-tweet-highlights-key-campaign/story?id=42218871\">according to ABC News</a>.</p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about Trump Jr\u2019s continued role in his father\u2019s campaign. But given his long history of causing upset, it seems unlikely that he will be dropped now.</p> <p>As long ago as 2012, Trump Jr was getting himself in hot water. That year, photos emerged of Trump Jr and his brother, Eric Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/31/donald-trump-sons-hunting-iowa-zimbabwe-pheasants\">on a hunting trip to Zimbabwe</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c1643914acaa96bdd5af8378d429c8c76bdbd21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c1643914acaa96bdd5af8378d429c8c76bdbd21/0_0_1330_798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump Jr on Zimbabwe hunting trip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump Jr drew attention after a big game hunt in Zimbabwe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hunting Legends</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the images showed Trump Jr smiling next to his brother Eric, who is holding up a dead leopard. Another showed Trump Jr, wearing a backwards baseball cap and holding a rifle, sitting next to a dead buffalo.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s a photo of Trump Jr holding a severed elephant\u2019s tail in one hand and a knife in the other, with a dead elephant in the background and a photo of him and Eric Trump standing next to a dead crocodile hanging from a tree.</p> <p>The pictures resurfaced during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, angering animal rights activists further and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJzZiBHBaQR/\">even prompting Madonna to wade in</a>.</p> <p>More recently, Trump Jr <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/03/03/listen-donald-trump-jr-and-pro-confederate-whit/208993\">drew ire</a> for agreeing to an interview with prominent white nationalist James Edwards. Edwards, host of rightwing radio show the Political Cesspool, <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/james-edwards\">is listed in the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201cextremist files\u201d</a>. The SPLC says the Political Cesspool \u201chas featured a wide roster of white supremacists, anti-Semites and other extremists\u201d.</p> <p>A week earlier Trump Sr <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/28/politics/donald-trump-white-supremacists/\">had refused to disavow</a> an endorsement by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke.</p> <p>There are other offensive things Trump Jr has done, too \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-jr-media-would-be-warming-up-the-gas-chamber-if-gop-di?utm_term=.lt6egXg1z#.vi0obmb0p\">invoking the holocaust</a> when discussing the media\u2019s treatment of Hillary Clinton \u2013 but if Trump Jr\u2019s behavior reveals anything, it is the similarity between him and his father.</p> <p>Both Trump Jr and Trump Sr have a knack for upsetting people over Twitter. Both have, at times, struggled to distance themselves from white supremacists. Both have displayed misguided views on alleged foreign rapists.</p> <p>Trump Jr was even born into extravagant wealth before being offered a well-paid position in his father\u2019s company \u2013 just like Trump Sr.</p> <p>Oh, and there is one more similarity: Trump Jr <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/07/24/donald-trump-jr-wont-rule-out-running-for-mayor-of-nyc/\">has suggested</a> he might run for mayor of New York City in 2017.</p>",
  "<p>It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if, as one recent visitor to the Bush compound in Kennebunkport reports, former president George HW Bush <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/george-h-w-bush-voting-for-hillary-claims-member-of-kennedy-family\">will be voting for Hillary Clinton</a> over Donald Trump this fall.</p> <p>After all, the elder Bush president is a moderate from the north-east who has in recent years developed a close relationship with the Clintons. His old patrician sensibility is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/politics/watching-gop-race-bush-41-is-glad-to-be-old.html\">reportedly offended</a> by Trump\u2019s vulgar style. And let\u2019s not forget Bush witnessed Trump ruthlessly and gleefully eviscerate his son Jeb during the Republican primary, often in the most personal of ways, and delve into conspiracy theories to attack the presidential legacy of another son, George W.</p> <p>This is not to say that Bush voting for Clinton is a non-story altogether. When is the last time a former Republican president not only refused to endorse the presidential nominee of their own party but allowed it to get out they were actually voting for the opposition party\u2019s presidential candidate? Off the top of my head, I can\u2019t think of any parallel in recent American history. </p> <p>But if you forget for a moment that George HW Bush was once was a Republican president, he is not all that different from the type of Republicans who have crossed party lines in past elections to endorse the Democratic nominee. (Think Colin Powell in 2008 and 2012.)</p> <p>To understand why this story is more remarkable than notable Republicans crossing party lines to support, say, Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, you have to take a look of the full scope of top-tier Republicans who have refused to endorse Trump, if not declared they will be voting for Clinton. </p> <p>Yes, you have the squishy north-eastern Republicans such as Bush, Maine senator Susan Collins and former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman. But you also have staunch movement conservatives like Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, Washington Post columnist George Will and radio host Erick Erickson not getting aboard the Trump train.</p> <p>Now, unlike Bush Sr, this latter group is probably far less likely to let it be known they support Clinton over Trump. But unlike in 2008 and 2012, there are bulwarks of the conservative movement refusing to get behind the Republican presidential nominee, not just those easily dismissed as Rinos (Republicans-In-Name-Only). That\u2019s no small thing.</p> <p>It is true that as the election draws nearer, some so-called Never Trump conservatives have come around to supporting Trump. Conservative talkshow host Mark Levin is perhaps the most famous example. But many more Never Trumpers seem to be in it for the long haul, even in the face of conservatives who argue that they have to vote for Trump at the very least to prevent Clinton\u2019s supreme court nominees.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not only significant right-leaning politicians, activists and opinion columnists who are refusing to support Trump. The most famous conservative academics are refusing to get behind him as well, including <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-legal-scholars-prefer-a-liberal-supreme-court-to-a-president-trump_us_57ade55fe4b069e7e504d4d3\">conservative and libertarian legal scholars</a> \u2013 exactly the kind of people who understand how important the supreme court is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/george-h-w-bush-voting-for-hillary-claims-member-of-kennedy-family\">George HW Bush 'voting for Hillary', claims member of Kennedy family</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For instance, you have Princeton professor Robert P George, perhaps the most noted intellectual defender of social conservatism in the country, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mccormickprof/status/757265456210309121\">refusing to back Trump</a>, even as he says he can\u2019t back Clinton either. The same goes with some of the top conservative economists, <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2016/08/my-take-on-mr-trump.html\">such as Harvard\u2019s Greg Mankiw</a>. In fact, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/08/25/what-former-white-house-economists-say-about-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton/\">the Wall Street Journal reached out to 45 past economists</a> who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under both Republican and Democratic administrations and not one responded to say they were supporting Trump.</p> <p>You can make fun of these people as egghead elitists, but the reality is most have fought the intellectual conservative fight in the most liberal of environments their entire lives. These are are not squishy moderates. They are true believers in conservative principles.</p> <p>So it may be easy to dismiss George HW Bush\u2019s putative decision to vote for Clinton (his spokesman <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/exclusive-george-hw-bush-to-vote-for-hillary-228395\">refuses</a> to confirm or deny the report). But when you look at the scope of figures \u2013 from Republican establishment politicians to leaders of the conservative movement to members of the conservative intelligentsia \u2013 who still refuse to get on the Trump train and likely never will, it is hard to conclude anything other than there is something truly repellent about the current Republican presidential nominee \u2013 and something deeply awry with a conservative movement that could nominate him. </p>",

  "<p>The European commission will launch a further crackdown on tax avoidance by reviving a long-stalled plan to overhaul how companies report their profits, according to Europe\u2019s most senior tax policy official.</p> <p>Under the plans, companies would have to calculate their profits under common European rules rather than national ones, closing down options for creative cross-border accountancy. The draft law, known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, will be published in late October or early November.<br></p> <p>The idea has failed in the past, partly because of opposition from the UK and Ireland.

Moscovici, who met the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in Bratislava earlier this month, said he did not consider \u201cthe UK as an obstacle \u2026 when we speak on the fight against tax avoidance\u201d, though he expects \u201cvery difficult debates\u201d on the plans.</p> <p>Speaking in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers including <em>Le Figaro</em> and <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeiting</em>, Moscovici also said the commission was not seeking to punish the UK over Brexit but would uphold the integrity of the single market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d622530339aea53d50024dc7159abe96ae733a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d622530339aea53d50024dc7159abe96ae733a1/0_280_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Moscovici\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre Moscovici, EC commissioner for economic and financial affairs, on Brexit talks: \u2018We are ready to negotiate tomorrow and that is not a joke.\u2019<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bundas Engler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis commission is not organising a dirty fight, our goal is not to punish.

He accused \u201cpowerful patrons\u201d of warring parties on all sides in the five-year war of having \u201cblood on their hands\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cPresent in this hall today are representatives of governments that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria conflict against Syrian civilians,\u201d the normally soft-spoken Korean secretary general said. \u201cMany groups have killed innocent civilians, none more so than the government of Syria, which continues to barrel-bomb neighborhoods and systematically torture thousands of detainees.\u201d</p> <p> By contrast, Obama \u2013 normally the more passionate of the two statesmen \u2013 was dispassionate and more general in his remarks. He mentioned Russia only fleetingly, suggesting that in a post-imperial era, Moscow was \u201cattempting to recover lost glory through force\u201d. </p> <p> He did not name his Russian counterpart and one of the world\u2019s \u201cstrongmen\u201d, Vladimir Putin, nor did he mention Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who has spoken in favour of Putin\u2019s style of leadership. But several of Obama\u2019s allusions to domestic political divides were clear references to Trump and his electoral appeal. </p> <p> He talked about \u201ca crude populism \u2013 sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right \u2013 which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot dismiss these visions,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens.\u201d<br></p> <p>He made clear he was talking about both the strategic decisions faced by emerging powers and the looming, hard-fought presidential election at home, when he said: \u201cI believe that at this moment we all face a choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration. Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion,\u201d Obama said.</p> <p>For his final appearance, Obama arrived late at the general assembly. When he was due on the assembly\u2019s green marble podium, by tradition the second national leader to speak after Brazil, he was just getting into his limousine at a central New York hotel for the short journey across town. In a rare break with tradition, his slot was given to another leader, Chadian president Idriss Deby. </p> <p>When his turn came, Obama recognised that it was his last time to address the general assembly and reviewed what he portrayed as the achievements in international diplomacy during his eight years in office: financial recovery in western markets, the denial of safe havens to terrorists and last year\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran.</p> <p> \u201cWe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/us-cuba-diplomatic-relations-obama-raul-castro\">opened relations with Cuba</a>, helped Colombia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/colombia-farc-rebel-ceasefire-agreement-havana\">end Latin America\u2019s longest war</a>, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this assembly,\u201d he said. </p> <p> Despite the fact that world was more peaceful and prosperous than ever, \u201cour societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife\u201d.</p> <p> He called it \u201cthe paradox that defines our world today\u201d.</p> <p> He explained much of the malaise by inequality, observing that a society in which 1% of the population hold as much wealth as the other 99% could never be stable. </p> <p> Safeguarding free societies and markets, and the path to global integration \u201crequires a course correction\u201d that involved addressing inequality and the weakness of international institutions in the face of global threats. Failing to do so would lead down the path towards \u201cstrongman\u201d leadership, who can never live up to the expectations they stir up. </p> <p>Obama said: \u201cHistory shows that strongmen are then left with two paths \u2013 permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After so many atrocities, it is hard to be as shocked as one should be by the horrors of the war in Syria. Appalled, yes. But surprise is harder to muster. Week after week and month after month, the crimes mount up. Civilians have been attacked with chemical weapons and have learned to fear the roar of government forces\u2019 helicopters bearing barrel bombs, and the deployment of \u201chell cannons\u201d by rebels. Medical facilities have repeatedly been targeted. The limp body of Alan Kurdi and the dazed, dusty face of Omran Daqneesh have forced us all to recognise again and again that no one is protected from this war. Syria is not the first place where besieged families have faced starvation, but their suffering has been extraordinarily protracted. Five years of civil war has killed half a million citizens and displaced millions more.</p> <p>Even so, Monday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\" title=\"\">airstrike on a UN aid convoy</a> delivering food to a rebel-held area close to Aleppo was another low. This was not only a humanitarian initiative but one that had been agreed by all parties. The convoy was clearly marked, had the necessary permits, and had notified everyone who needed to know of its passage. If the attack was deliberate \u2013 and it is hard to believe otherwise \u2013 it was a war crime.</p> <p>Government forces have spent months blocking aid deliveries to besieged civilians and stripping those that did get through of essential medical supplies. It appears that the prospect of some relief at last for rebel areas could not be tolerated, whatever promises had been made. The regime perhaps felt it enjoyed a degree of cover too due to the deaths of 62 government soldiers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/us-accuses-russia-of-grandstanding-over-deadly-syria-air-strikes\" title=\"\">in a US airstrike at the weekend</a> \u2013 \u201con purpose and planned in advance\u201d, the government claimed. But above all, it appears that the Syrian regime now enjoys a sense of utter impunity. It has nothing and no one to fear. Neither Bashar al-Assad nor his forces have any reason to believe they will be held to account for their actions.</p> <p>They are not the only ones to blame. As Ban Ki-moon warned in his final address to the UN general assembly as secretary general,&#xa0;powerful patrons on both sides have blood on their hands. He was pointed, too, in&#xa0;his references to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/russian-vetoes-putting-un-security-council-legitimacy-at-risk-says-us\" title=\"\">countries exercising vetoes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54961#.V-FtvjaU1yo\" title=\"\">\u201chold[ing] the world hostage on so many important issues\u201d</a>. Russia\u2019s role in Syria was underscored by the remarkable, almost smirking pronouncement from its defence ministry that there was no evidence of an attack and the convoy had simply caught fire \u2013 even if that was not a line that its foreign minister could or did maintain in talks with the US.</p> <p>The attack appeared to sound the death knell for a ceasefire that was painfully reached and had been greeted only tentatively as a potential step forward. Not dead, insisted the main players, only in danger. But after Monday\u2019s attack, it is hard to regard a ceasefire as a meaningful concept in Syria. No one can feel enthusiastic about attempts to revive it; nor will anyone be keen to test its parameters by attempting another aid delivery. Yet as Boris Johnson warned on Tuesday, negotiations between US secretary of state John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov are the only game in town. Barack Obama, who once spoke boldly of red lines on chemical weapons use, can now only reiterate calls for \u201chard diplomacy\u201d. With the president on his way out, the US has even less leverage over Moscow; its best hope is that Russia might be more concerned about negotiating with a&#xa0;Hillary Clinton administration.</p> <p>In the meantime, the west can at least do something for those who have escaped the conflict, both by supporting the countries that have accepted the vast bulk of refugees and by welcoming individuals. Britain\u2019s record in this regard is particularly poor; so far it has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37268971\" title=\"\">taken in fewer than 3,000 of the 20,000 Syrians</a> who have been promised resettlement over the next four years. This weekend Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-resists-calls-uk-accept-syrian-refugees-aid\" title=\"\">resisted calls to improve on that meagre offer</a>.</p> <p>Equally important is a commitment to hold the Syrian government to account for its actions one day. It should not believe that the licence it enjoys now will be extended to it permanently. No one should be able to mount attacks like Monday\u2019s so casually. The<a href=\"https://justiceinconflict.org/tag/commission-for-international-justice-and-accountability-cija/\" title=\"\"> Commission for International Justice and Accountability</a> has already begun collecting material on the Assad regime\u2019s actions with a view to potential prosecutions. It deserves support, not only because Syrians deserve justice, but to protect civilians in future conflicts. If war crimes cannot be prevented, they must be punished.</p>",

But there\u2019s nothing laconic about Henry, who seems determined to put the world to rights \u2013 one genetically modified piece of fruit at a time.</p> <p>\u201cYou can put Trump in the White House, but you need to prepare for a revolt because I\u2019m going nuts,\u201d says Henry, as he waits for his English breakfast \u2013 a deconstructed version including black pudding \u2013 to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/08/escapefromnewyork.kurtrussell\"> Escape From New York</a> in here and you might as well call me Kurt Russell because I\u2019m going to be fucking people up. It\u2019s going to be Mad Max.\u201d</p> <p>From the coldly seething anger to the apocalyptic references, Henry\u2019s takedown of the Republican presidential candidate and his possibly cataclysmic consequences could come straight from the script of Atlanta. It has been the most popular of FX\u2019s offerings this autumn and one of the most critically lauded of the TV fall debutants. It\u2019s been called genre defying, earned comparisons to fellow FX show Louie and The Wire, and was dubbed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/the-slo-mo-specificity-of-atlanta\">shrewd, emotional, and impolite</a>\u201d by the New Yorker\u2019s Emily Nussbaum.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s also black.

Atlanta has managed to stand out during a season that\u2019s been heralded for embracing diversity. But where other shows such as Luke Cage, Pitch or Queen Sugar may exist in alternate universes or times, Atlanta is set in the here and now, in contemporary America. And that setting, slap bang in the middle of the most divisive election race in recent history, feels apt.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be over this by now but we\u2019re not,\u201d says Henry of race relations in the US. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing our show because we\u2019re going to be telling you exactly how we feel and exactly where we\u2019re coming from, and exactly how it feels to be a black American in this country right now.\u201d</p> <p>Variations on that line have been used by a lot of the cast while promoting the show \u2013 Donald Glover said he \u201cwanted to show white people, you don\u2019t know everything about black culture\u201d. During the show\u2019s first episode, which focuses around a shooting in a car park, the standout moment is when a white friend casually throws around the N-word. It\u2019s a scene which finishes on Glover and Henry staring down the camera at their acquaintance, and it feels like they\u2019re also looking at the viewer and America at large. It\u2019s as if those scenes are supposed to elicit a knowing nod from African Americans and a wince from white America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4/199_126_2603_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo one seems give a shit about what they say about any race in this country,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhich is funny because the last time I checked isn\u2019t this the land of immigration?

Henry was the youngest in a house with four older sisters in Washington DC. Acting was a survival mechanism as much as a hobby. \u201cMy sisters were teenagers when I was born so the last thing they wanted was a little nappy-headed boy running around,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would imitate them or copy things off TV. I would leave the house and be these people.\u201d </p> <p>That early play turned into something more when Henry started acting at Morehouse College, the most famous of the historically black colleges and the same place <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/amuel--ackson--was-a-drug-addict-out-of-my-mind-but-showed-up-on-time-and-hit-my-marks\">Samuel L Jackson caught the acting bug</a>.

He\u2019s the godfather to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/07/sterling-k-brown-emmy-people-v-oj-simpson\">recent Emmy winner Sterling K Brown</a>\u2019s child and played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/27/romeo-juliet-review-royal-ballet-gary-avis-tybalt-steals-the-show\">Tybalt</a> in Shakespeare in the Park in New York alongside a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/03/oscar-isaac-most-violent-year\">Oscar Isaac</a>, who played Romeo. It also saw him land the role of the General in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/21/the-book-of-mormon-review\">the original lineup of the Book of Mormon</a> (\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m playing a warlord and I get to say fuck and shit on Broadway. Let\u2019s do it\u201d). He made the transfer from stage to screen with bit parts in The Good Wife, The Knick and Boardwalk Empire, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/13/michael-k-williams-interview-omar-the-wire-the-gambler\">Michael K Williams</a>. He\u2019s in HBO\u2019s Vice Principals, but Atlanta is where Henry looks most at home, which isn\u2019t surprising considering it\u2019s where (at Morehouse) he matured. </p> <p>But the city itself is important to Henry for another reason: \u201cWe went there, we created it, we made it a metropolitan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the place where a lot of black history happened: Martin Luther King was there, Jim Crow was there, even the Olympics were there.</p> <p>\u201cAtlanta has become and has always been a place where you create your own universe. That\u2019s what our show is trying to do; create our own universe with these two young men trying to make it in this universe which is still part of this bigger picture. It\u2019s still part of America, it\u2019s still part of Georgia, it\u2019s still part of the south, but it\u2019s created it\u2019s own entity and I love that.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to Henry, that idea of identity and defining yourself comes up frequently. Whether it\u2019s talking about his favourite book as a kid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery\">Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry</a>\u2019s The Little Prince (\u201c[it\u2019s about] opening your mind and not letting people limit you\u201d), his dress sense (\u201cI love wearing a fitted hat because as soon as I put it on people go \u2018oh wait, he went to Yale?\u2019\u201d) or his love of rap (\u201cIt\u2019s the place I feel like black artists have the most room to be who they want to be\u201d), it\u2019s there in the background.</p> <p>Questioning, teasing and often provoking, there\u2019s an obvious link between the world Henry and Glover have created and the real one they inhabit. So what about the world of Atlanta hip-hop? It\u2019s often presented as an out of control, drug-laced trap house where debauchery is next to godliness. For Henry it\u2019s much more complicated than that.</p> <p>\u201cIn hip-hop you can be anything. What you look like is the least of it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">Fetty Wap</a> has one eye. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review-trap-stars-quickfire-post-prison-set\">Gucci Mane</a> has an ice cream cone tattooed on his face, and they\u2019re both still great,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about hip-hop: it challenges the norms of what we, especially as black men should be and look like. It welcomes the freaks and the ones who haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Is that what Atlanta is doing? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s necessary, but it is absolutely necessary,\u201d he says. Welcome to the future.</p> <p><em>Atlanta continues on FX tonight at 10pm ET</em></p>",

But in an interview with the Financial Times he said he was ready to call for a cut if unemployment picked up. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the moment I think the economy still has some slack left in the labour market, you can see that in the subdued pace of pay growth. If the jobless rate were to rise, increasing labour market slack further, then that would be an argument in favour of lower interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the other hand he believed the UK economy was set for a less severe slowdown than most economists expect. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the near term, the next year or two, I think the economy will slow, but perhaps not slow as much as the consensus has been expecting. This is partly because of the support from loose financial conditions, partly because of the underlying advantages - including supply side flexibility - of the UK economy.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

But most believe there will be no change to the Bank of Japan\u2019s inflation target of 2%. James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The big question is whether this review will lead-in to more stimulus or an introduction of monetary prudence. Many are questioning Japan\u2019s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn\u2019t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion.</p> <p>But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u2019re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u2019re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation?</p> <p>So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u2019s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year.</p> <p>Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish.</p> <p>[There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month.</p> <p>We believe, though, that the BoJ\u2019s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures. Rather than scale back its asset purchases, we think that the Bank may increase them and is more likely to find other ways to support systemically-important institutions, such as lending to commercial banks at negative interest rates.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66da18b63c0c9f526f652fcf3ac3f836ed5dfa53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66da18b63c0c9f526f652fcf3ac3f836ed5dfa53/0_39_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of Japan building in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of Japan building in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toru Hanai / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e14e39e4b0603ea33c4492\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T15:10:51.172Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound hits five year low against the dollar</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has hit a five year low against the dollar, weighed down by concerns about the economic risks of Brexit.</p> <p>Sterling fell as low as $1.2948 and is currently down 0.55% at $1.2950 amid worries about the outcome of talks about Britain leaving the European Union, especially with some EU members promising there would be no easy ride.</p> <p>The strength of the dollar is also a factor, with the outside chance of a US rate rise at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting.

Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US.

I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news,\u201d the Republican nominee later boasted to Fox News.</p> <p>\u201cImmigration security is national security,\u201d added Trump in a speech on Monday, as he seized on the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-bombing-suspect.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">bombing suspect\u2019s background</a> to bash Hillary Clinton for wanting what he claimed were \u201cthe most open borders of anyone ever to seek the presidency\u201d.</p> <p>But Clinton also has wasted little time making clear she viewed the unfolding drama as a clear act of terror and a sign of why her foreign policy hawkishness is so important.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis threat is real, but so is our resolve. Americans will not cower, we will prevail. We will defend our country and we will defeat the evil, twisted ideology of the terrorists,\u201d she said in a hastily arranged press conference in an aircraft hanger near her New York home on Monday while the manhunt was still under way.</p> <p>Outside Clinton\u2019s heavily guarded house in the leafy suburb of Chappaqua, a steady flow of vehicles could be seen coming in and out of the property over the weekend as she met with advisers and began preparing for what many expect to be most the watched televised political debate in history.</p> <p>Even though opinion polls suggest the race is tight, Clinton is expected to spend much of this week here focused on debate preparation \u2013 making only brief visits to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Florida \u2013 as aides fear a crucial night ahead.</p> <p>\u201cFor all his lack of substance, Trump\u2019s showmanship, as [an] ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,\u201d Clinton\u2019s press secretary Brian Fallon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/769592439195787264\">recently wrote</a>. </p> <p>Among some Democrats there is also concern at how quickly the election has once again become overshadowed by terrorist attacks, a factor that boosted Trump\u2019s early standing in the Republican nomination race after atrocities in Paris.</p> <p>The speed with which both candidates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton-new-york-new-jersey-attacks-trump-muslims\">fired off rhetorical volleys</a> at each other during Monday\u2019s manhunt was a source of mild consternation, if not surprise, to those still involved in dealing with the unfolding drama. \u201cThis close to the election, everything is political,\u201d acknowledged one senior government source.</p> <p>\u201cI would ask that the press try to refrain from getting out ahead of the investigation,\u201d added Barack Obama, in a public plea that could easily have been leveled at the campaigns too.<br></p> <p>There is obvious relief in Washington that no one died in the attack \u2013 a factor that perhaps encouraged both campaigns to move swiftly to the political implications \u2013 but also anxiety that another more deadly incident before 8 November could have a more significant affect on the outcome.</p> <p>So much of Obama\u2019s legacy and Clinton\u2019s record also depend on hard-to-control events in far off places such as Syria, where the fight against Isis appears to be making progress even while wider security conditions deteriorate.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s alternative ideas meanwhile remain shrouded in mystery, but in a taste of the simplistic logic that could come at Monday\u2019s Hofstra University debate, his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">latest tweet</a> simply charges: \u201cCrooked Hillary has been fighting Isis, or whatever she has been doing, for years. Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the electoral impact of terror is not always clear cut and could easily go against him.

Authorities towed that car, along with a black Toyota, on Monday. In the FBI\u2019s wanted poster, authorities asked people to look out for a 2003 Blue Honda Civic.</p> <p>\u201cThey had a whole bunch of cars: two 2x4s, that black Toyota Camry, a white Infiniti and a blue car,\u201d said Torres.</p> <p>He described the news of a potential bomber just doors away as \u201cterrifying\u201d. \u201cI want to move.

The only thing he had encountered was some quiet religious study.</p> <p>\u201cOne day I was in the chicken shack and he had a book and he was reading the book while he was listening to music and I asked: \u2018How can you do that and what kind of book?\u2019 He said it was some kind of religion book; supposedly they read it while they\u2019re listening to music,\u201d said Ocampo.</p> <p>\u201cHe would always be there, and usually when there was no customers he would be there reading it. He said it was like a Bible but runs in his religion.\u201d</p> <p>Rahami\u2019s father, Mohammed, was known as the most religious in the family, dressing only in traditional robes and praying in front of customers. </p> <p>Nawaz Sheikh, president of the Muslim Community Center of Union County, which includes Elizabeth, said Mohammed came to the mosque every day.

This one was certainly well written, and the delivery had its moments, but very few party conference speeches get remembered much after October and this one may sink from the memory even more quickly.</p> <p>Lib Dem leaders always find themselves giving speeches in which they have to differentiate themselves from both the Tories and Labour and Farron had strong passages on both. He attacked the Tories, with more than a little justification, by saying they had forfeited the right to be seen as the party of business because of Brexit. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-speech-lib-dem-conferenence-says-lib-dems-would-be-willing-to-raise-taxes-to-find-a-lot-more-money-for-nhs-politics-live?page=with:block-57e1339fe4b0603ea33c444d#block-57e1339fe4b0603ea33c444d\"> 2.59am</a>.) And he attacked Jeremy Corbyn and Labour for failing to provide serious opposition. More interestingly, he heaped praise on Tony Blair. Given that saying anything positive about Blair is tantamount to thought crime in Corbynworld, Farron is probably the only party leader who will pay tribute to Labour\u2019s three-times election winner this autumn and the pitch for the Labour, centrist vote was obvious.</p> <p>Farron\u2019s jokes weren\u2019t great, but there was a lot of personal content in the speech which came over as natural and uncontrived. And his passage about refugees, where he cleverly linked moral outrage with patriotism, was superb.</p> <p>Blair famously spoke about the \u201chand of history\u201d at one point and there was an echo of this when Farron said he wanted the Lib Dems \u201cto be audacious, ambitious and accept the call of history\u201d. Farron even set out plans for how his party might march back towards success although, having sketched out the Canadian route map to general election victory, he swiftly followed it up with a much more modest ambition that involved just depriving the Tories of a majority at the next election.</p> <p>But, with the polls as they are (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-speech-lib-dem-conferenence-says-lib-dems-would-be-willing-to-raise-taxes-to-find-a-lot-more-money-for-nhs-politics-live?page=with:block-57e0fa3be4b0ef60eaef1193#block-57e0fa3be4b0ef60eaef1193\"> 10.08am</a>), even this felt quite a big ask. A great speech is one that can make its audience believe in its message. But, despite Farron\u2019s eloquence on the subject of the Lib Dem recovery, it did not feel as if the Lib Dems will be going home truly convinced.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T16:11:02.976Z\">at 5.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1499ae4b05714d0da2ae3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T14:37:25.618Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/778241210674806784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Farron gets long standing ovation, there&#39;s plenty of classic Lib Dem meat (veg?) thrown.

The Lib Dem position on Brexit is in fact fairly nuanced, accepting departure from the EU, at least for now, and fighting for a future in the single market. Or at least, it\u2019s more nuanced than that of Owen Smith, who simply wants to turn the clock back. Speaking from the stage in Brighton, though, Farron\u2019s default mode was a lament for the recent past. As a result, he sounds like he belongs in it.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s worse than that. Quite suddenly, on both sides of our politics, it is liberalism itself that has become the enemy. For the right, it smacks of multiculturalism and aloofness; stick the word \u2018elite\u2019 on the end and you\u2019ve really got something to rail against. For the Corbynite left, meanwhile, it smacks of Blairism, globalisation, cowardice and treachery.</p> <p>With Labour moderates in despair and Tory moderates in hiding, the Liberal Democrats now look an awful lot like everything that the rest of our politics defines itself against. Tragic, really. Destined for extinction when they weren\u2019t needed and somehow, still destined for it when they are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a48944e4-7e79-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4\">Henry Mance and George Parker in the Financial Times (subscription) say the Lib Dems are struggling to get a hearing.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for Mr Farron is getting a hearing from voters. His team admit that he needs a byelection victory to raise his profile, although the party\u2019s old hands say that two of his predecessors, Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, did not become widely known to voters until they fought a general election.</p> <p>One byelection prospect is the former Lib Dem seat of Richmond Park, now held by the Tory Zac Goldsmith. Mr Goldsmith has said he will resign if the government approves a third runway at Heathrow. Alternatively, if a snap general election takes place, Mr Cable and other former Lib Dem MPs will stand, guaranteeing news coverage.</p> <p>A high-profile defection from Labour would also help Mr Farron but none seems forthcoming. Talks of some kind of Lib-Lab realignment have not progressed, with moderate Labour MPs determined to stay and fight against Jeremy Corbyn.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T12:29:39.064Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e10364e4b0aa4fe87f7576\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T09:42:02.830Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The more I hear about Glee Club, the more it sounds like a Momentum rally.

Here are the main points from the interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Watson said Labour had to unite \u2013 or \u201cput the band back together\u201d, as he put it \u2013 because an early election was likely. </strong>Having an elected shadow cabinet would help, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve had a very bruising summer, we are going to get a new leader elected on Saturday, we all think there is the likelihood of a very early general election and so we have got to put the band back together. </p> <p>For me, the heart of our party is the parliamentary party \u2013 they are the people that come on the Today programme to talk about our policies to the nation \u2013 and we have got to bring people back in. </p> <p>I think to have an elected shadow cabinet, not an appointed shadow cabinet, is one way we do that. </p> <p>The debate we are going to have today is how we may elect a future shadow cabinet so that we get all the talents represented round the table.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the NEC would discuss alternative ways of electing the shadow cabinet and that he was \u201copen minded\u201d as to what was best. </strong>The parliamentary Labour party has voted to bring back the old system of shadow cabinet elections, which says shadow cabinet members being elected by MPs. Jeremy Corbyn has proposed an alternative that would involve party members elected some shadow cabinet members, MPs electing others, and the party leader choosing some too. Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m taking both options to our NEC today. Jeremy wants a debate at the NEC to discuss that. I\u2019m open minded on both options.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Watson said the NEC would also be debating plans to change the way the party leader is elected, but that the proposed changes would not affect whoever is elected leader on Saturday. </strong>He said he wanted to scrap the system that allows registered supporters to vote in leadership contests.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the last set of reforms we had was some very rushed reforms and we created a new category of member, a registered supporter, which is pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that, and we also want to enfranchise more ordinary trade unionists in the new process ...</p> <p>Let me just specify \u2013 this would be after the current leader, whoever wins on Saturday, leaves their post. This won\u2019t be a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over whoever is elected on Saturday.</p> <p>Watson said he hoped the NEC would agree changes to the leadership election rules today, to enable them to be debated at Labour\u2019s conference next week.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about some MPs facing the threat of deselection.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m very concerned about that because I do think if energy is expended trying to undermine political opponents in your own party then obviously that\u2019s time not spent characterising and attacking our opponents.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3908ce4d95325386958684821f08d91136ec1d26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3908ce4d95325386958684821f08d91136ec1d26/0_115_3696_2219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T13:19:35.722Z\">at 2.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e0f1ade4b02fcdee725e4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T08:33:53.155Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Brighton Lib Dem members have just started debating an emergency motion saying Britain should take \u201cits fair share\u201d of refugees, including unaccompanied children, and that refugees contribute \u201ca huge amount to local communities throughout the UK\u201d. </p> <p>Perhaps many Lib Dems are still sleeping off the effects of Glee Club, the satirical singalong extravaganza that activists indulge in on the final night of their conference.

We have of course a brilliant NHS, the best staff in the world, free care at the point of access ... but we are spending at least far less every year than we need to make sure that we have a health and care service that really will provide for you and your family from cradle to grave. </p> <p>So we need to face the hard truth that the NHS needs more money \u2013 a lot more money \u2013 not just to stop it lurching from crisis to crisis but so that it can meet the needs and the challenges it will face in the years ahead. So that it can be the service we all need it to be for the long-term. To provide confidence in our health service for the next fifty years.</p> <p>In Norman Lamb we have the politician who is most trusted and respected by the health profession \u2013 and deservedly so. And Norman and I are clear, we will not join the ranks of those politicians who are too scared of losing votes to face up to what really needs to be done.</p> <p>We will go to the British people with the results of our Beveridge Commission and we will offer a new deal for health and social care, honest about the cost, bold about the solution. </p> <p>If the only way to fund a health service that meets the needs of everyone, is to raise taxes, Liberal Democrats will raise taxes. </p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s preview story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/lib-dems-will-turn-nhs-into-national-health-and-care-service-says-farron\">Lib Dems will turn NHS into National Health and Care Service, says Farron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I will post more from the speech extracts released overnight soon.</p> <p>Today I will mostly be focusing on the Lib Dems, but I will keep an eye on other stories, including, of course, today\u2019s meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9am: </em>The Lib Dem conference opens with an emergency debate on refugees.

It\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Gubbins.</p> <p>In her acceptance speech, McKinnon thanked comedian and chat show host Ellen DeGeneres.</p> <p>She also thanked Hillary Clinton, who returned the compliment with a congratulatory tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/777673718982184964\">including</a> a gif of McKinnon impersonating her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not usually a person who shouts at the television, but when I saw these women winning Emmy after Emmy I just burst into applause and screamed \u2018Yesss\u2019 every time,\u201d said Trish Bendix, editor-in-chief of the self-described lesbian and bisexual pop culture website <a href=\"http://www.afterellen.com/\">AfterEllen.com</a>.</p> <p>It was named in tribute to the watershed moment when Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 sitcom character Ellen and the performer herself came out as a lesbian in 1997.</p> <p>DeGeneres became an instant gay hero, but her show was dropped and she was in the professional wilderness until she voiced the part of Dory in the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, then got her own chat show that became a hit.</p> <p> AfterEllen.com also <a href=\"http://www.afterellen.com/tv/514245-emmys-2016-huge-night-queer-women\">picked out </a>other less well-known lesbians and lesbian characters also enjoying Emmy success this year.</p> <p>There was a mini-uproar from parts of the live audience and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimTeeman/status/777684138321145856\">social media </a>Sunday night when the band played over The People v OJ Simpson producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/18/how-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-staged-a-revolution\">Nina Jacobson</a> just as she was giving an emotional thank-you to her wife.</p> <p> However Bendix considered it mainly rotten timing, and similar snubs happened to several others on the night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was rude, though,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Lisa Kron, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AejUt7TdexI\">won</a> two Tony awards in 2015 for writing the lyrics and book for Fun Home, the groundbreaking hit musical about lesbian cartoonist Alison Bechdel, said that lesbian visibility in arts and entertainment had hit a \u201ctipping point\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe were not just invented, none of this success is happening in a vacuum. There is a wave of visibility, it\u2019s being helped by the proliferation of social media and the ability for us to talk across distances to each other,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She thought the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">legalization</a> of gay marriage has also helped. Kron is married to playwright Madeleine George.</p> <p>Oscar-nominated lesbian designer Patricia Field was winning accolades for her costumes for the straight characters of Sex And The City and The Devil Wears Prada years ago, but the stage was anything but crowded.</p> <p>\u201cThe talent and the content has always been there, in numbers. Now it\u2019s rising to the top as it always should have done, and coming of age,\u201d said Frances Wallace, executive director of Frameline, the media arts non-profit that produces the annual San Francisco international LGBTQ film festival.</p> <p>And, she pointed out, with transgender politics and related edgy story lines now in the vanguard, many lesbians and bisexual women in the industry feel there is even less to lose by coming out these days \u2013 and thanking their wives and girlfriends on global TV to boot.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge celebration,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>The independent presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/evan-mcmullin-republican-donald-trump-utah\">Evan McMullin</a> has linked Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, saying such events are a \u201creflection of a nativist movement across Europe and in the United States\u201d that is \u201cdestructive to [the] economy here and in the world and to peace and security\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">Donald Trump's police: officers backing Republican have murky legal histories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 40-year-old former CIA agent and Capitol Hill policy adviser accused Russia of fueling such sentiments \u2013 a phenomenon he said he understood because when working for the US intelligence service he \u201creceived the same training that Vladimir Putin did\u201d while in the KGB.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey do it through supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Donald Trump poses a true threat to our national security by carrying Putin\u2019s water in the United States,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin is running as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">an independent conservative alternative to Trump</a>, backed by some of the Republican nominee\u2019s most determined rightwing opponents. Speaking to the Guardian, he discussed his longshot bid for the White House and his disdain for those on the right who have failed to stand up to Trump, who is now closing in on Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">in presidential polling</a>.</p> <p>In McMullin\u2019s view, the forces that drove the British vote to leave the European Union and have aided the rise of Trump are part of the \u201csame movement, fueled largely by the Russians who seek to destabilize eastern and western Europe as well as North America through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin, who spent a decade at the CIA, will make a foreign policy speech in Washington on Tuesday focusing on the global threats to US national security. </p> <p>He said he felt comfortable viewing Trump from Putin\u2019s perspective. \u201cI received the same training that Vladimir Putin did. He received it from KGB. I received it from the CIA. Vladimir Putin trained to identify weaknesses in people and exploit them for intelligence purposes.\u201d<br></p> <p>McMullin said Putin saw weaknesses in Trump \u2013 \u201cego, financial vulnerabilities\u201d \u2013 and also \u201cin a different sort of a way an alignment ideologically, at least as it pertains to leadership\u201d.</p> <p>As a political rookie and rank outsider, McMullin freely admits his own weakness. Aside from the benefits of understanding the Russian president, he says, there may not be \u201ca lot of parallels frankly, between what I am doing now and what I did in the CIA\u201d. He takes pains to note his experience working on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs, however, and as policy director for the House Republican Conference on Capitol Hill.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either\u2019</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bhd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724745\"            data-video-name=\"A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' conspiracy \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC/The View, NBC/Today show, PBS Newshour, Donald Trump/YouTube, MSNBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc5c11e4b0df02df202fd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s birther comments: a short history</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>McMullin has barely made a ripple since he declared his candidacy in August, motivated he said because he felt there had to be some alternative to the choices being offered. </p> <p>\u201cI firmly believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthat someone needed to step up and stand in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-bigotry\">Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted rhetoric</a> and his allegiance to Vladimir Putin and at the same time to Hillary Clinton\u2019s promotion of large centralized government that is unaccountable to American people.\u201d </p> <p>He was dismissive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/gary-johnson-and-jill-stein-not-allowed-in-first-televised-debate\">the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson</a>, whom he described as not \u201csuitable to be a leader of the free world\u201d. Johnson, a two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, has polled at around 8% nationally \u2013 not enough to qualify for the first presidential debate on 26 September. In contrast, McMullin has struggled to gain any traction at all. </p> <p>In one sense, that is part of his plan. As he is not on the ballot in enough states to get 270 electoral votes, it is impossible for him to win the White House outright. Therefore, his goal is to force and exploit electoral deadlock. The <a href=\"http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii\">12th amendment</a> says that if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses, with one vote for each state, from among the top three candidates who received electoral votes. McMullin is hoping to win such votes from at least one state in the Mountain West. In Utah, strongly conservative but also strongly anti-Trump, he is polling at 9%.</p> <p>Should deadlock be reached, McMullin imagines a whole new campaign in which he, Trump and Clinton would compete in the Republican-dominated House, a chamber where, he thinks, Clinton would never stand a chance. At that point, he thinks Republicans in the House would realize \u201cI am more aligned with them on issues than Trump\u201d and Democrats would support him too. </p> <p>\u201cI am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Of course, McMullin acknowledges that such goals will be very difficult to achieve, depending as they do \u201con variables that we don\u2019t control and very few that we do\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are realistic about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s about trust more than issues\u2019</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign\">Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While his ambition relies on draining votes from Democrats as well as Republicans, McMullin did not have an immediate answer for why Democrats unhappy with Hillary Clinton, especially those who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, should support him. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question and I don\u2019t exactly know the answer to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a theory based on some comments because we do have Bernie Sanders people coming to us saying we\u2019re going to support you and people who have supported Hillary Clinton but have grown concerned about the stories that have come out about Clinton Foundation and other things.\u201d </p> <p>Such people, he said, knew they didn\u2019t agree with him on many issues, particularly social concerns, but viewed him as trustworthy in a way Clinton is not. \u201cIt\u2019s about trust more than issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin has taken some stances that do not accord with mainstream conservative thought.

He is pro-life and would hope to appoint supreme court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.

If the GOP sticks with Trump, he worries, \u201cas his bigotry becomes more front and center, even as the alt-right becomes more vocal and it\u2019s more and more clear that they contribute heavily to the empowerment of his campaign\u201d, the party will sign its own death warrant. </p> <p>He doubts whether the Republican party \u201cwill be able to make the kinds of reforms they need to make to be a competitive party on a national level,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He hopes to build something for the conservative movement, \u201csomething that will be a place for [conservatives] \u2026 something that has real traction and real influence and it will be either to influence the Republican party or potentially start our own\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Hillary Clinton is having a harder time beating Donald Trump than she bargained for. According to a <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2378\">recent poll</a>, a staggering 44% of millennials say they\u2019ll be voting for either Green party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson. The chief reason for Clinton\u2019s dip in these polls is not \u2013 as Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/18/obama-says-sexism-could-lead-voters-to-back-trump-over-clinton/\">claimed</a> on Sunday \u2013 that she\u2019s a woman (though sexism does have a lot to answer for). It\u2019s because Clinton has assumed a third of the electorate \u2013 millennials \u2013 would vote for her out of fear of her opponent.<br></p> <p>Simply put, we want more. <br></p> <p>Millennials are the generation that has occupied Wall Street, shut down bridges for black lives and chained ourselves to the White House fence to stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Disillusioned by Obama\u2019s embrace of war and austerity alike \u2013 especially after knocking on doors to get him elected \u2013 we know better than to put blind faith in any candidate for the Oval Office. <br></p> <p>What Clinton can do now is prove that she\u2019s listening. Doing so could bear fruit in the polls, but only if she shows she\u2019s willing to part ways with her billionaire friends and push for policies that are in line with what millennials really want.<br></p> <p>Since the Democratic national convention, Clinton and Trump have peddled their own politics of fear. Hers: of an ascendant far-right. His: of immigrants and the prospect of a truly multi-racial democracy. If Bernie Sanders\u2019 primary campaign showed anything, though, it\u2019s that young Americans are eager to vote <em>for </em>something \u2013 not against it. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/politics-for-humans-guardian-us/its-millennial-week-in-election-season-politics-for-humans-podcast\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F283806286&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Laying out plans for single-payer healthcare and a $15 minimum wage, Sanders beat Clinton among millennials in each one of the 27 states where they faced off in the primaries. And he might still be the most popular politician in the US today.<br></p> <p>At a time when Americans across the political spectrum are turning against the status quo, Clinton seems to be embracing it. She spent weeks in August wooing millionaire donors in Silicon Valley and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and has chased endorsements from Bush-era official and war criminals like Henry Kissinger. It\u2019s out of frustration that millennials will register protest votes, not ignorance.<br></p> <p>Make no mistake: a vote for either Jill Stein or Gary Johnson in a swing state is a vote for Trump, and could land the US in a situation more dangerous and unstable than any it has known yet. Clinton is this country\u2019s best hope right now. Especially if we want to avoid a future defined by hostility towards immigrants and people of color, the near certainty of catastrophic global warming and a disastrous economic plan ripped straight from the Tea Party\u2019s playbook.<br></p> <p>But making sure that painful, hate-filled future never comes to pass is up to the Clinton campaign now, and its ability to make an earnest and heartfelt appeal to the future of the Democratic party. <br></p> <p>So what is it that millennials actually want? Around 70% favor wealth redistribution, one Gallup poll found, and many are eager to avoid six-figure debt for things like education and routine visits to the doctor\u2019s office. The Movement for Black Lives released a detailed policy agenda this summer with plenty of ideas for senior Clinton staffers, and round-the-clock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline should give them a sense for where young Americans stand on new fossil fuel infrastructure and violations of indigenous rights.<br></p> <p>For the most progressive and diverse generation in history, Trump represents virtually everything our generation is against. Clinton represents everything that hasn\u2019t worked for us. Her embrace of politics as usual these last few months could cost her the election, putting Trump in the White House and emboldening his most dangerous supporters. Either way, Trumpism will grow so long as elites are setting the political agenda.<br></p> <p>Millennial-led movements, meanwhile, are showing a way forward, free of fear-mongering and full of hopeful visions for a fairer future. If defeating Trump means voting for Clinton \u2013 and it does \u2013 defeating the toxic ideology that surrounds him means she needs to take these movements\u2019 advice seriously.<br></p>",

He said his firearms collection began to grow after he became a father. He had a \u201ccatastrophic knee injury\u201d that he worried would make it hard for him to protect his wife and child, and when he researched his neighborhood, he saw crime was going up. </p> <p>\u201cI want everyone in my home to be able to defend themselves at a moment\u2019s notice if a violent criminal decides he wants to break down the door,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fred said his wife usually carried a gun in her purse or on her person, and his 70-year-old mother, who sings in the church choir, had become such a gun enthusiast that he got her a laser sight for her gun for Christmas. </p> <p>He keeps guns stored in the living room; in his bedroom, on both his side and his wife\u2019s side of the bed; and in his garage workshop.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m working in my garage and someone wanders in and he wants rob me, I can\u2019t say: \u2018Can you hang on for a second?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Fred couldn\u2019t know where he might be \u201cwhen the worst day in my life arrives\u201d, he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to believe that I\u2019m prepared, I better be prepared.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s not just a home intruder that worries him, but a broader societal breakdown. He spent five years as a civilian truck driver during the Iraq war making deliveries between military bases in southern Iraq. Today, he sees the fragility of America\u2019s food supply network. If the interstate highways aren\u2019t drivable, or if the electrical grid fails and diesel stations can\u2019t pump their fuel, many local stores would quickly run out of food, he said. </p> <p>\u201cAll of our morals or ethics would be out the window in the fear of the inability to survive as soon we got just a little bit hungry.\u201d</p> <p>His collection includes five AR-15s for self-protection, and rifles and shotguns for hunting small, medium, and large game, since a rifle that\u2019s good for hunting deer \u201cwould just obliterate\u201d a rabbit. </p> <p>But the benefit of his gun collection isn\u2019t just the security. It\u2019s the joy of being able to constantly tinker with his guns, personalizing and improving them. He bought one rifle for $700 and then spent more than $1,500 customizing it. </p> <p>\u201cSome of them were just pretty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like man jewelry, for lack of anything better to call it. </p> <p>\u201cIn Florida, we cannot open carry unless we\u2019re on personal property or our own business, so these things are never really going to be seen by the general public,\u201d he said. But he likes knowing that there\u2019s something fully custom-made for him, in a custom-designed holster, on his hip. \u201cIt kind of makes me giggle. It\u2019s not different than a woman who would have a very very nice tennis bracelet that she wouldn\u2019t dream of wearing out just to go to dinner and catch a movie, but when you open up the jewelry box, it\u2019s there.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m just an accumulator\u2019</h2> <p>Compared with gun owners overall, people who own more than eight guns are more likely to be men, less likely to be black or Hispanic, and more likely to own a gun for protection, said Deborah Azrael, a Harvard School of Public Health firearms researcher and the lead author of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">new survey of gun ownership</a>. </p> <p>But American women are firearms super-owners, too. Patti Bonnie, 45, a military veteran and small-business owner in Florida, used to own just a single handgun and a shotgun. Then, in May 2014, she used one of her guns to deter an attempted home invasion \u2013 simply by raising the shotgun and moving toward the intruder, she said.

A well-chosen gun collection might grow in value like a 401k. </p> <p>Though gun collecting has been around since the dawn of firearms in the 1400s and 1500s \u2013 Henry VIII was an early collector, as were Thomas Jefferson and George Washington \u2013 in the United States, gun collecting started to take off around the 1930s, as more Americans began to have the kind of disposable income that allowed them to buy for pleasure, not just for immediate need. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get somebody to identify themselves as a collector,\u201d Schreier said. \u201cNine out of 10 of them, you\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019 re a gun collector,\u2019 they\u2019ll go, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m just an accumulator.\u201d</p> <p>The United States does have serious community of firearms collectors. The NRA sponsors an annual gun collectors\u2019 show with more than $10,000 in prizes for the best collections. There are more than 120 gun collectors\u2019 clubs across the United States. </p> <p>Among the serious gun collectors is Robert, from central Florida, who has a collection of American military firearms that has been featured in several firearms television programs. </p> <p>The collection of roughly 100 firearms includes weapons used in the revolutionary war through the modern day, including a \u201cnear-complete collection of small arms from world war two and Vietnam\u201d.</p> <p>Among the firearms he owns are several fully automatic weapons, including a Thompson submachine gun, or Tommy gun, and a Model 50 Reising submachine gun. These are prized collectors\u2019 items in the US, where ownership of these guns has been strictly regulated, tracked and limited. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11723dc7c324b6c9a7bf352d3154081a621c97ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11723dc7c324b6c9a7bf352d3154081a621c97ae/0_190_5712_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert, an avid gun collector who lives in Florida, poses for a portrait while sitting at a bunk in the room he dedicated for his collection, Wednesday, August 17, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert poses for a portrait while sitting at a bunk in the room he has dedicated to his collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Douglas Bovitt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert meets friends at a range weekly to fire some of his historic guns. \u201cI probably have less than 10 that I would not fire,\u201d he said, though ammunition for some of the more exotic guns is expensive enough to make firing them a rare treat. With the Thompson submachine gun, he said, \u201cyou can easily go through $100 worth of ammunition in one shooting session\u201d.</p> <p>For Americans concerned about about a potential government breakdown, though, it\u2019s more commonly available guns that often have the most potential value. </p> <p>\u201cIf I had to pick a number to survive a collapse, I think every person in your family or group should have a personal handgun and a personal carbine. That\u2019s a bare minimum,\u201d said Bryce Towsley, the author of Prepper Guns, who gave away copies of his book at this year\u2019s National Rifle Association convention. He added: \u201cYou should have a couple of backups,\u201d and recommended guns that use the most common forms of ammunition \u2013 perhaps 9mm for handguns and .223 for rifles.</p> <p>\u201cI know there are preppers out there who are buying guns and ammunition with the anticipation that\u2019s bartering material, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be wrong.\u201d</p> <p>But Towsley, though he believes in preparing in case of disaster, is optimistic that in the United States government, \u201cgrown-ups take over and get us back on track\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope it never happens,\u201d he said. \u201cMy worst nightmare is having to shoot anybody in defense of myself or my family.\u201d </p> <p>Towsley lives in a Vermont home overflowing with books, which he also collects avidly, and his own gun collection includes a selection of guns for the hunting trips he takes around the world, as well as for competitive shooting events.</p> <p>He said he is weary of gun owners being demonized and held up as a threat by Hillary Clinton and other politicians. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m what used to be considered a Joe Average American,\u201d Towsley said. \u201cI\u2019m a little conservative in my politics. I work hard. I pay my taxes, I raised my kids ... I try to give back.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHow many guns is enough?

I am grateful for the quick action of law enforcement in capturing the terrorist responsible for Saturday\u2019s bombings, and the off-duty police officer for stopping the terrorist in Minnesota. This weekend\u2019s attacks, from Minnesota to Manhattan, are just the latest to be carried out on US soil under President Obama. These should be a wake-up call for every American.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything - and blame anyone - to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State. The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking Isis seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.</p> <p>While our President has referred to them as the \u2018J.V. Team\u2019 and Hillary Clinton calls them our \u2018determined enemies,\u2019 I have been willing to call them exactly what they are: radical Islamist terrorists.</p> <p>I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we\u2019re in a fight about \u2018narratives.\u2019 These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.</p> <p>When I am President, terrorists like today\u2019s suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, and yesterday\u2019s knife-wielding ISIS sympathizer in Minnesota, Dahir Adan, will be stopped. We will not look the other way. We will not allow political correctness and soft-on-terror, soft-on-crime policies to threaten our security and our lives.</p> <p>Revelations that the Obama Administration wrongly granted citizenship to over 800 immigrants awaiting deportation from countries of concern to national security or high rates of immigration fraud puts this weekend\u2019s attacks in a broader perspective. The safety and security of the homeland must be the overriding objective of our leaders when it comes to our immigration policy.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed extreme vetting for immigrants from troubled parts of the world where terrorists live and train, and oppose Hillary Clinton\u2019s 550% increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in Syria. These are tough problems that require tough leadership. We need to get smart and get tough fast so that this weekend\u2019s attacks do not become the new normal here as it has in Europe and other parts of the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03907e4b051672d9f7e2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T19:14:52.227Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News Channel host and future press secretary Sean Hannity will host a town-hall meeting with Donald Trump in Ohio on Wednesday, according to Politico:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hannity will do a Town Hall with Trump this Wednesday in Ohio</p>&mdash; Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">September 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03541e4b0ef60eaef0f33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T18:58:18.398Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bernie Sanders is feeling the...

  "<p>A shootout on the streets of New Jersey ended a dramatic manhunt on Monday as police arrested a man suspected of involvement in weekend bombings that injured 29 people in New York.</p> <p>Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized US citizen born in Afghanistan, had hours earlier been named in a \u201cwanted\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-explosion-suspect-mobile-alert-ahmad-khan-rahami\">alert sent to millions of local cellphones</a> as Manhattan prepared to host world leaders at the United Nations general assembly.</p> <p>At a media briefing on Monday afternoon, police and FBI officials said they had linked Rahami to Saturday\u2019s bombing in Chelsea, another unexploded device found nearby, both constructed in pressure cookers packed with metallic fragmentation material. They also said he was believed to be linked to a pipe bomb that blew up in Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday and explosive devices found in the town of Elizabeth on Sunday.</p> <p>By evening, prosecutors charged Rahami with five counts of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. He is being held on $5.2m bail.</p> <p>A businessman in Linden, New Jersey, found and reported Rahami asleep in the doorway of his bar, the town\u2019s mayor, Derek Armstead, said on Monday morning. When police arrived, Rahami pulled a gun and shot an officer, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, in the torso. Officers then joined in a running gun battle down the street and brought down Rahami, police captain James Sarnicki said.</p> <p>Another officer was grazed on the hand by a bullet, officials said, and both were expected to recover. Rahami was shot in the leg and underwent surgery, FBI agent Bill Sweeney said. He would not answer questions about any possible links to other people or groups, but said, \u201cI have no indication that there\u2019s a cell operating in the area or in the city,\u201d with the caveat that \u201cthe investigation is ongoing\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/19/us-authorities-investigating-new-jersey-explosive-devices-live-updates\">New York bombings: Ahmad Khan Rahami in custody after shootout \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Fears of an active terror cell grew earlier on Monday morning when five other suspicious devices were found near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and one exploded as the bomb squad attempted to disarm it with a robot.

Sires said his office wrote a letter to the US embassy in Pakistan to check on the status of the case and the woman eventually received a visa. He said he didn\u2019t know if she ever came to the country, and the FBI didn\u2019t answer when asked on Monday.</p> <p>Speaking in a televised address to the country, Barack Obama stressed that the three east coast incidents were not thought to be directly linked to a separate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-stabbing-somali-americans-suspect-name\">stabbing incident at a shopping mall in Minnesota</a>, but this too was being investigated as a separate possible act of terrorism.</p> <p>The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the stabbing rampage, in which a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer on Saturday.

About 300 businesses run by migrants were destroyed, and workers from countries such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique were attacked.</p> <h2>Real unity?</h2> <p>So amid optimistic talk of a \u201cUnited States of Africa\u201d, critics have been quick to point out that the union has been catastrophically weak in dealing with continental crises and supporting populations under attack.</p> <p>Though it has deployed peacekeeping forces to Somalia and Darfur, and has recently agreed <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/19/486592426/african-union-approves-plan-to-put-peacekeeping-force-in-south-sudan\">to send troops to South Sudan</a>, it has been accused of largely ignoring the brutal <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mali-rebels-africa-idUKBRE90Q06Z20130127\">jihadi occupation in northern Mali</a>, <a href=\"http://newafricanmagazine.com/ebola-au-done-enough/\">the deadly Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, and failing to hold \u201cpresidents for life\u201d to account.</p> <p>This ambiguous approach to democratic principles has led to a situation in which Chad\u2019s president, Idriss D\u00e9by, who recently extended his 26-year rule amid accusations of vote rigging, intimidation and holding \u201cthe whole country hostage\u201d, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/chads-president-set-to-mediate-in-disputed-gabon-election\">mediating</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/gabon-election-results-disputed-incumbent-ali-bongo-victor-jean-ping\">an election crisis in Gabon</a>. </p> <p>Dapo Oyewole, director of the Policy Development Network, said the AU needs to change its image if it is to truly bring about continental unity. </p> <p> \u201cThe African Union needs to become much more active and meaningfully relevant in the day-to-day life of average Africans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to become an accessible and responsive platform for actualising collective aspirations and not just like a club of African leaders.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the new project shows promise says Imad Mesdoua, an Algerian political analyst based in London. \u201cThe new inter-African passport is proof that member states are genuine about making integration a reality,\u201d he said, but added \u201cmore needs to be done and at a much faster pace.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has urged the party to \u201cput the band back together\u201d before a possible snap general election, saying it should consider adopting elections for shadow cabinet positions as a way to tempt back discontented MPs.</p> <p>Speaking before a crucial meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) on Tuesday, Watson said a return to Labour MPs electing the shadow cabinet, as happened until 2011, could help reunite the parliamentary party and bring back \u201call the talents\u201d after a series of resignations over the summer.</p> <p>But Watson also said he was open to a counter-proposal being put to the NEC by Jeremy Corbyn for the shadow cabinet positions to be decided three ways \u2013 appointments by the party leader, election by MPs and votes by ordinary members.</p> <p>Watson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he hoped for a decision at the NEC meeting. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very bruising summer, we\u2019re going to get a new leader elected on Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all think there\u2019s the likelihood of a very early general election and so we\u2019ve got to put the band back together.\u201d</p> <p>Watson said he preferred the idea of MPs electing the frontbench: \u201cFor me, the heart of our party is the parliamentary party. They\u2019re the people who come on the Today programme to talk about our policies to the nation and we\u2019ve got to bring people back in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/jeremy-corbyn-would-have-power-to-sack-elected-ministers-proposes-tom-watson\">Labour proposals could allow Jeremy Corbyn to sack frontbenchers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think to have an elected shadow cabinet, not an appointed shadow cabinet, is one way we do that. The debate we\u2019ve got to have today is how we elect a future shadow cabinet, so that we get all the talents represented round the table.\u201d</p> <p>While saying he remained \u201copen-minded\u201d to allowing Labour members a say on the shadow cabinet, Watson said one potential worry was the cost, as each election could take more than \u00a3300,000 to organise.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/jeremy-corbyn-would-have-power-to-sack-elected-ministers-proposes-tom-watson\">Guardian understands that Watson is likely</a> to present Corbyn with a sweetener for such an arrangement by including a clause allowing the party leader to remove frontbenchers, thus preventing anyone from using shadow cabinet elections to try to destabilise the leadership.<br></p> <p>Both plans will be debated at what is likely to be a long and tense NEC meeting before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> party conference, which will begin in Liverpool on Saturday with the announcement of the new party leader. Corbyn is widely expected to beat his challenger, Owen Smith.<br></p> <p>In a move that could place the deputy leader on a collision course with Corbyn, Watson will also call for a wholesale review of the way Labour elects its leader.<br></p> <p>Plans put forward include a return to Labour\u2019s electoral college system, with far more power in the hands of trade unionists, and an end to the registered supporters system, under which anyone can pay a fee and vote in the leadership contest.</p> <p>Watson told Today a new system would only come into place when the new leader left office. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over whoever is elected on Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>He said the current system had been somewhat rushed in under Ed Miliband, and that the new voter category of registered supporter was \u201cpretty unpopular in all sections\u201d.</p> <p>Asked if the frontbenchers who resigned from Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet after the EU referendum would return, Watson predicted this would be the case for many but not all. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think all members should consider how they can best serve their party,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they become MPs. But of course some of them might feel uncomfortable with that. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dignity issue \u2013 if they resigned in the summer they might feel they\u2019re honour-bound not to go back. There are some people who might feel they don\u2019t want to serve a team that are just appointed. There\u2019s a host of reasons why people may not wish to serve on the frontbench.\u201d</p> <p>An elected system would address those issues best, Watson argued: \u201cI think we\u2019ll get a frontbench, get a shadow cabinet, whatever the system is, but I would like us to get the best shadow cabinet that represents all the traditions in our party and all the talents.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s supporters are open to the idea of elections as a means of making peace with MPs, and have appointed a member of staff to try to persuade politicians to return.<br></p> <p>However, many remain suspicious of Watson and will only sign up to a system under which not just politicians but the party\u2019s members can vote. Sources have suggested they will use the NEC meeting to push for a separate review into how the system could be \u201cdemocratised\u201d.</p> <p>Other allies of the leader are likely to push the NEC to back plans for mediation between the warring factions of the Labour party. Corbyn is preparing to deliver a speech to set out his plans for unity on Wednesday.</p> <p>Jonathan Ashworth, who sits on the NEC, said: \u201cI think the key thing is getting an effective functioning frontbench team back quickly to take on the Tories.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stick to the status quo. It looks like Jeremy has agreed to some form of elected shadow cabinet but there are lots of practical questions the NEC will need answered.\u201d</p> <p>The plans for shadow cabinet elections will be among recommendations for rule changes put forward by various members. Ideas include paving the way for a formal policymaking women\u2019s conference, more positions reserved in the NEC for Welsh and Scottish politicians and a bursary scheme to help working class and disabled people become MPs.</p>",

Since January, Khorsandi has been president of the <a href=\"https://humanism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Humanist Association</a>, which campaigns for high-quality sex and relationships education (SRE) to be made statutory. For her it\u2019s the ubiquity of online porn that makes proper education so critical.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be much more open about what we talk about and really understand the difference between fantasy and reality,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery fantasy, every kink between consenting adults is fine, but I don\u2019t like the idea of any teenager watching pornography and not having an outlet to talk about what they\u2019ve seen.</p> <p>\u201cA very young friend told me when she first started sex she just started acting out porn stuff because she thought that\u2019s what sex was meant to be. It\u2019s said so often, but there are so many pressures on kids these days and they\u2019re subjected to so much damaging nonsense on the internet, on TV, on their phones. If we don\u2019t give them all the information they need to stay healthy and happy and safe, we\u2019re letting them down.\u201d</p> <p>The last Labour government had been set to make personal, social, health, and economic education (PSHE) \u2013 which includes SRE \u2013 statutory, but dropped the plan to get its schools bill passed before the 2010 election. After that Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan rejected calls for statutory PSHE, most recently in February this year. Last week the new education secretary, Justine Greening, told the education select committee she was looking at the possibility, but was yet to reach a formal view. Figures published by the Department for Education last month reveal a 29% drop in teaching time given to PSHE in English secondary schools between 2011 and 2015.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2015/oct/19/sex-lads-grey-areas-uk-universities-consent-rape-sexual-assault-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ddma\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2391724\"            data-video-name=\"Sex, lads and grey areas: what's going on at UK universities? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5624cfe1e4b0229634d39d7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2015/oct/19/sex-lads-grey-areas-uk-universities-consent-rape-sexual-assault-video\">Sex, lads and grey areas: what\u2019s going on at UK universities? \u2013 video (October 2015)</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe emotions around sex need to be talked about in a safe place and I can\u2019t think of a safer place than school,\u201d says Khorsandi, mother to Cassius, nine, and&#xa0;Genevieve, three. \u201cWe need to let our guard down and be less prudish.

The city is on its knees. The public services don\u2019t work \u2013 notably rubbish collection and public transport \u2013 and the lobbies of those services are so strong that it would take a very powerful political force to fix them, which she is not.\u201d </p> <p>When Raggi was elected, it was seen as a breakthrough for the anti-establishment M5S, a Eurosceptic political party created by the satirist Beppe Grillo in 2009 that espouses direct democracy and transparency. The <em>Cinque Stelle</em>, as it is known in Italy, has become the country\u2019s second most popular party thanks to a knack for tapping into Italians\u2019 anger over the status quo. <br></p> <p>Grillo, an admirer of Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/corruption-gripes-help-five-star-movement-top-italy-local-election-polls\">routinely rails against everything</a>, from corruption to establishment politicians\u2019 cosy ties with big business, and M5S politicians often portray themselves as above reproach because of the party\u2019s tough internal anti-corruption rules.</p> <p>The Raggi victory was significant because it was seen as a test of whether the M5S could move beyond its role as a protest party and actually govern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8550bf129fce4b81d120985b3b86e3c1a5d1bb34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8550bf129fce4b81d120985b3b86e3c1a5d1bb34/0_151_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists stand next to an overflowing bin in Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists stand next to an overflowing bin in Rome.

Romans are also still awaiting a final verdict on whether Raggi will support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/15/rome-olympic-bid-corruption-recession-matteo-renzi\">Rome\u2019s bid for the 2024 Olympics</a>, which she said she opposed during the campaign. Given the M5S\u2019s stated commitment to public transport and its opposition to big, unwieldy projects, both issues are significant.</p> <p>The big question now is whether or not Raggi\u2019s problems in Rome will diminish the reputation of the M5S nationally, with just weeks to go before the referendum on constitutional reform. Renzi says the reforms will make it easier to pass legislation by dramatically restricting the powers of the senate, a major source of political gridlock. He has vowed to resign if he loses the referendum, which in turn could force Italy\u2019s president to dissolve the current parliament and call a new election.</p> <p>With Italy\u2019s right in disarray, the biggest threat to Renzi\u2019s Democratic party is the M5S. For months, the party has been trying to portray itself as a viable alternative to Renzi, but Raggi\u2019s travails could lead Italians to wonder whether it is ready to lead the country.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have anyone in charge of finance in Rome. Yet they want to be in charge of a country with \u20ac2.5tn (\u00a32.1tn) in debt? There is a huge issue of credibility at stake,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London.</p> <p>Raggi\u2019s problems started early on, when she decided to appoint officials who served under Gianni Alemanno, a previous mayor and a rightwinger. This angered left-leaning supporters, confirming their suspicion that Raggi \u2013 who has portrayed herself as non-ideological \u2013 had ties to Rome\u2019s right. When it emerged that her chief of staff would be earning about \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3170,000) \u2013 a figure far exceeding recommendations for the role \u2013 she was forced to sack the official, prompting several other high-profile resignations. </p> <p>The most controversial decision has centred on her choice of person to clean up the city, Paola Muraro, who had previously been paid hundreds of thousands of euros as a consultant for the city\u2019s rubbish collection agency. Raggi learned in July that prosecutors were examining Muraro\u2019s record, but she has nevertheless stood by her appointment, and Muraro has denied all allegations of impropriety. <br></p> <p>The controversy has ensnared another M5S politician, Luigi Di Maio, who was alerted about the Muraro investigation by Raggi but never acted on it, contrary to the spirit of internal M5S rules. The 30-year-old vic- president of parliament, a wunderkind of the M5S, had been considered a possible rival to Renzi.<br></p> <p>Now Raggi is fighting back. In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/virginia.raggi.m5sroma/videos/vb.469144566601331/642333055949147/?type=2&amp;theater\">Facebook post</a> this month, she defended Muraro and made a defiant declaration.</p> <p>\u201cNot a day has passed without attacks, polemic and accusations.

While Raggi has been the focus of negative headlines almost every day, Romans seem willing to give her more time, said Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar in Rome.</p> <p>M5S\u2019s attempt to use municipal elections to prove its credentials has, however, undoubtedly taken a hit, much to the delight of Renzi. But the prime minister is not out of the woods yet, and Raggi can still turn things around.</p> <p>\u201cRomans are very angry at the previous administrations and they are very patient. They are ready to wait for a few months, so if they can start solving some problems of the city and if she does it, all this will be forgotten,\u201d Orsina said. \u201cBut how can she do that if she doesn\u2019t have a viable group of people around her?

At their phone banks calling Labour members, some Smithite MPs say they are getting better results than reported; others fear the worst. Two quite separate parties cohabit under one title, each accusing the other of betraying all Labour exists for. Polls show Corbyn scores -36 among pre-2015 Labour members, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSmithsonPB/status/770865148139634688/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">+72 among later joiners</a>.

Tom Watson\u2019s attempt to return to a shadow cabinet elected mainly by MPs may succeed. But would the 172 stand for these positions? Some are adamant they wouldn\u2019t; others will because, crucially, with the shadow cabinet positions come an extra three seats on the NEC, ruling out the Bennite/Robespierre rule by members that Corbyn seeks.</p> <p>What will the refuseniks do? They won\u2019t split: Labour failed to reform an electoral system that kills any who try. Get serious, is the answer. Return to real politics. Stop obsessing about the party issues and devote your considerable talent and experience to the one thing that really matters \u2013 the fast-approaching catastrophe of Brexit. It\u2019s for the 172 MPs to fill empty space where Labour should be campaigning hard to rescue the country from the grip of vandals causing maximum mayhem.</p> <p>Across the house, the Brexiteers are doubling down on their success, with Boris Johnson joining the new \u201chard Brexit\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\">Change Britain</a> group, alongside the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/tory-eurosceptics-push-for-hard-brexit-eu-single-market\">Leave Means Leave</a> group. With Liam Fox and David Davis they are rejecting the single market. All statements from EU leaders make it increasingly clear that there is no cake-and-eat-it option, no \u201cunique British model\u201d on offer; and the full force of the likely damage is dawning on one business sector after another. Brexit advocates crassly gloat: \u201cLook! The economy is doing fine!\u201d But nothing has happened yet. Philip Hammond, the silent chancellor, lets the Financial Times know that he wants to keep as close as possible to the single market and the customs union. Defying clean breakers he is \u201cnot afraid to highlight the risks to the economy of Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Danger ahead grows as the <a href=\"http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about\">Visegrad group</a> countries \u2013 Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \u2013 say they will tolerate no UK deal that curtails free movement. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, doesn\u2019t see \u201cany possibility of compromise\u201d, merely stating the obvious, since all 27 countries plus the European parliament have to agree the deal. One thing unites them \u2013 the determination to warn others against leaving by making sure Britain will be worse off out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/sep/19/momentum-kids-where-childcare-meets-leftwing-activism\">Momentum Kids \u2013 where childcare meets leftwing activism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lies of the hard Brexiteers continue, even while their <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/\">claims are exploded</a>. Of our exports, 44% go to the EU, but only between 8% and 17% of their exports come to us. It becomes frighteningly apparent that our finance industry will be struck badly if prevented from trading inside the single market, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/london-city-eu-passport-brexit\">obliging many to shift </a>to Frankfurt. Rebalancing our dependency on finance is not best done by wrecking it, with no substitute. Hammond was no Europhile, but any chancellor would be horrified at this loss of revenue. British manufacturers are similarly alarmed: the EEF, their umbrella group, warned this week that they \u201cmust have ongoing access to the single market \u2026 and be able to employ and deploy staff from and across the EU\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s whose side Labour must be on: Smith made that central to his campaign. If Corbyn and John McDonnell are supremely uninterested, the 172 must be the Labour campaign for all who will suffer from Brexit. It\u2019s for them to stand against the ideological saboteurs Theresa May recklessly put in charge of the negotiations. The 172 must put Labour on the side of those at risk of losing jobs and businesses. The Lib Dems are saying as much, but what use is a rump of eight MPs? Labour\u2019s 172 should define themselves not as a warring Labour faction, but as standard bearers for the nation\u2019s pro-EU 48%.</p>",
