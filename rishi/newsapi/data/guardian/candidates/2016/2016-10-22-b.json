[
  "<p>Two decades ago, the Democratic Republic of Congo, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest country, was engulfed in what became known as <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/1213296\" title=\"\">Africa\u2019s Great War</a>, a conflict that drew in half-a-dozen neighbouring countries and raged for five years from 1998.</p> <p>The conflict and its aftermath cost the lives of an estimated 5.4&#xa0;million people, mainly from starvation and disease. This epic disaster was largely ignored outside Africa, even though it was the developed world\u2019s insatiable demand for the DRC\u2019s mineral riches that helped to fuel it.</p> <p>The war was halted, in part, by the introduction of a new constitution and a democratic system of governance, replacing decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/mobutu-sese-seko-remains-repatriated-congo-zaire\" title=\"\">Mobutu Sese Seko\u2019s brutal dictatorship</a>. In 2006 Joseph Kabila was confirmed as DRC president by popular vote, although the fairness of the election was widely disputed. In 2011 he was re-elected. Again, the results were hotly contested. A key factor in their acceptance was his pledge to honour the constitution and refrain from seeking a third term.</p> <p>The DRC\u2019s next presidential election is due next month. It isn\u2019t going to happen. A court last week upheld a request by the election commission that the poll be postponed, ostensibly because voter rolls are incomplete. A \u201cnational dialogue\u201d by the ruling coalition and involving fringe parties and civic groups, but boycotted by the main opposition and Catholic church, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/drc-elections-put-back-to-2018-as-opposition-calls-strike-in-protest\" title=\"\">also agreed a delay until at least April 2018</a>. In effect, Kabila and his security force backers have compromised the constitution and the judiciary and engineered a silent coup. His solemn 2011 promise has been broken.</p> <p>This shameless subversion of the democratic process (parliamentary and provincial polls have also been put off) was condemned by the main opposition party, the UDPS, as a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d. Rassemblement (Gathering), the multi-party opposition organisation, reacted with fury and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/general-strike-kinshasa-drc-congo-kabila-election-postponement-president\" title=\"\">called a general strike</a> last Wednesday. Kabila\u2019s attempt to cling to power threatens the DRC\u2019s hard-won and still precarious stability. Worse, it risks a return to national and regional upheaval, violence and war. At least this time the world is paying more attention. Maman Sambo Sidikou, the senior UN official in the country,<a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/un-warns-of-large-scale-violence-in-congo-crisis/a-36019244\" title=\"\"> warned the UN security council</a> last week that \u201clarge-scale violence is all but inevitable\u201d if the impasse is not resolved. \u201cThe tipping point could be reached very quickly.\u201d After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/democratic-republic-congo-demonstrations-banned-police-killed-joseph-kabila-etienne-tshisekedi\" title=\"\">related clashes in Kinshasa last month,</a> in which at least 50 people died, the US imposed limited sanctions on army generals implicated in human rights abuses. On Monday EU foreign ministers also agreed to pursue possible punitive measures.</p> <p>Matters are not as clear cut as they might seem. Kabila denies he wanted the delay. Analysts suggest the president, thrust into office after his father was assassinated in 2001, is a frontman for the security apparatus. The opposition is fragmented and its readiness to resort to protests often leads to violence. Concerns over stability by <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/france-moots-drc-sanctions-with-elections-delayed/a-35958088\" title=\"\">countries such as France</a> and Belgium are not wholly disinterested, commercially speaking. But that the leadership of another African country appears ready to ride roughshod over democracy and laws is clear. The DRC has never had a peaceful transition of power since independence in 1960. This is why term limits are so important. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/burundi/11614000/African-presidents-dilemma-Should-I-stay-or-should-I-go.html\" title=\"\">presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and Congo-Brazzaville</a> overrode constitutional requirements that they step aside. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/14/fake-calm-in-burundi-as-tension-threatens-return-to-violence\" title=\"\">In Burundi\u2019s case</a>, violence and displacement resulted. In Uganda, Yoweri Museveni looks determined to go on for ever. Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwean \u201cpresidency for life\u201d and Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos\u2019s Angolan ascendancy provide further examples of endemic disregard for democratic principles.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to think Africans care less about self-serving, corrupt and irresponsible politicians than Europeans or Americans. The African Union has repeatedly stressed peaceful political transitions in embedding democratic habits. Studies show African voters <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/africa/how-to-deepen-transition-to-democratic-governance-in-central-africa.cfm\" title=\"\">value democratic systems</a> but are increasingly frustrated at their malfunctioning and wilful subversion.</p> <p>Nigeria demonstrated last year<a href=\"http://blog.crisisgroup.org/africa/nigeria/2015/04/02/nigerias-unexpected-election-success/\" title=\"\"> how it could be done</a>. But South Africa, ruled since apartheid\u2019s end by a single, overpowerful party, is less of a shining light. Its reported decision to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/south-africa-to-quit-international-criminal-court-document-shows\" title=\"\"> renounce the International Criminal Court</a> is another sign that too many African politicians would rather jettison democratic and legal norms than subject themselves to scrutiny and public judgment.</p>",

Not only has Trump confounded expectations all year, but like those campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union, he has closed within touching distance of his opponent several times already.</p> \n<p>Four weeks ago, on the morning of the first presidential debate, his position in key swing states was so strong that the statistician <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">Nate Silver</a> estimated his chances of overall victory at more than 45%. After the Republican convention in July, Silver briefly projected Trump would win.<br></p> \n<p>As in the case of Brexit, average poll numbers tilted back in favour of the status quo. The murder of MP Jo Cox was credited with shocking the British electorate back into a <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/\">two-point poll lead for Remain by the time of the referendum</a>. Outrage over a tape of Trump boasting about sexual assault precipitated his latest popularity slide and left Clinton with the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">near-six-point lead she now enjoys</a>.</p> \n<p>But Britons proved less ashamed of Brexit\u2019s dark reputation once they were inside the privacy of a polling booth, eventually <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-referendum/\">voting in favour of leaving by a nearly four-point margin</a>. What if US pollsters are missing shy Republicans? Or failing to account for Trump\u2019s ability to inspire people to turn out in greater numbers?</p> \n<p>It is certainly a complacency Democrats wish to avoid. Fortunately for them, this may be where the similarities with Brexit begin and end.</p> \n<h2><strong>Playing the system</strong></h2> \n<p>The biggest difference can be seen as a combination of America\u2019s voting system and its political tribes.</p> \n<p>A simple majority of the national popular vote was enough to rewrite Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, but US presidents are required to win a majority of electoral college votes, which can be decisively achieved with a series of wins at the state level. In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan secured 97.6% of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_Electoral_College_margin\">electoral college votes</a> with 58.8% of the popular vote, because Walter Mondale lost every state except Minnesota.</p> \n<p>Even if she defeats Trump in Republican strongholds like Texas, Utah, Arizona and Georgia, Clinton is unlikely to ever match Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide over George McGovern in 1972 or Lyndon Johnson\u2019s epic defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964, for the simple reason that America has become more politically polarised in the years since.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a337725e0611f6cd2a72299d0010eb75d507487\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a337725e0611f6cd2a72299d0010eb75d507487/0_23_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman is moved to tears as Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman is moved to tears as Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But even a relatively small lead in the popular vote can translate into a decisive win, as Barack Obama found when he went into the 2012 election just 0.2% ahead of Mitt Romney in the polls yet emerged with a four-point majority in the popular vote and nearly two-thirds of the electoral college.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

Nonetheless, projections point to a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/senate-update-the-last-week-has-been-very-kind-to-democrats-hopes-for-a-majority/\">growing likelihood</a> that Trump\u2019s woes will help Democrats take back the Senate and a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/12/heres-how-good-a-shot-democrats-have-of-actually-winning-the-house/\">small but rising possibility</a> the same could happen in the House of Representatives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/22/trump-the-world-hates-obama-and-the-us-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58jbm\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2828839\" data-video-name=\"Trump: the world hates Obama and the US \u2013&nbsp;video\" data-video-provider=\"AP|POOL|\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580b2022e4b0d7abfb253893\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/22/161022worldhatesob_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/22/161022worldhatesob.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/22/161022worldhatesob_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/22/trump-the-world-hates-obama-and-the-us-video\">Trump: the world hates Obama and the US \u2013 video</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Demographic changes also suggest a clear win for Democrats on 8 November. The white men who favour Trump may do so in part out of resentment that they no longer control the country so completely as they did, but the Democrats\u2019 far larger lead among female, African American, Asian and Latino voters is likely to only grow as the country diversifies. As each side adopts the insults of the other as a badge of pride, Clinton\u2019s \u201cnasty women\u201d and their allies simply outnumber Trump\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d.</p> \n<p>Charts reveal other lines dividing the US in 2016. Educational attainment, often a proxy for class in a country that doesn\u2019t like to talk about it, is particularly indicative. College-educated voters flock to Clinton\u2019s message of optimism about the economy while those without degrees are among the biggest supporters of Trump\u2019s thesis that the system is rigged.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments about race and immigration have also polarised voters, driving non-whites back toward the Democratic coalition built by Obama but appearing to shock some white voters less.</p> \n<p>And, if it is about anything, this election is about gender. Although men overall may now lean narrowly toward Clinton after a month of Trump\u2019s misogynistic outbursts, it is striking that the average white American male is still pro-Republican.</p> \n<h2><strong>The unpopularity contest</strong></h2> \n<p>Of course, opinion pollsters can get demographics wrong too. Polls that listen to registered voters are better predictors of electoral outcomes than polls that listen to anyone who\u2019s willing to talk. But those polls still aren\u2019t perfect, partly because before voters actually vote, they\u2019re just people and people change their minds. Especially a long time before election day.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why now, with just over two weeks to go until the US votes, the polls are far more accurate than they were months ago. A lot has happened over those months \u2013 two party conventions, three debates and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">10 allegations</a> of sexual assault against one candidate. After all the boosts and dips, the overall effect has been that Trump has fallen in popularity while Clinton has risen.</p> \n<p>Or, to be more specific, the polls show that Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">unpopularity</a> has risen while Clinton\u2019s has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">fallen</a>. Both candidates are disliked by the majority of Americans.</p> \n<p>But it is not just Brexit and Romney that have given polling methodology a bad name. There has been a string of polling failures: the Israeli election, the Scottish independence referendum and the last UK general election. If anything, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">problems of polling</a> have got worse since those votes, partly because it is getting even harder to contact people who are willing to share their voting intention.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/democrats-texas-hillary-clinton-polls-donald-trump\">'It's surreal': is a Democratic uprising afoot deep in the heart of Texas?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, though polls will not perfectly predict the US election, state by state and down to the decimal point, they are likely to accurately guess who will win nationally, especially if Clinton has a large enough lead.</p> \n<p>The accuracy of polling in this election will hinge on the margin of error. Buried in the methodology of most polls is a note that says something along the lines of \u201cmargin of error: \u00b1 4%\u201d. It means if you repeated the poll 100 times with different respondents each time, the overall results would be within 4% of the results in at least 95 of those 100 polls.</p> \n<p>Right now, Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">polling average is 48% and Trump\u2019s is 42%</a>. If the margin of error on those numbers is \u00b14%, that means Clinton\u2019s support could be as low as 44% or as high as 52% with Trump\u2019s somewhere between 38% and 46%. The bigger the gap between the two candidates, the less the margin of error matters.</p> \n<p>The margin of error in this election could well be more than 4%, because polling has become less accurate. For Clinton supporters to really sit back and relax, the candidate needs to widen her lead to the extent that even if the polls are wrong on the numbers, they are still right about the result.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"Membership Drive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">Membership Drive</a> \n</figure>",

  "<p>The very inclusion of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG) to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/\">reduce inequality</a> is a gamechanger.<br></p> <p>For a generation or more, any serious mainstream discussions of inequality had been off the table. In the formulation of the millennium development goals all the key players knew that income or asset inequality was to be kept off the agenda. Governing elites and international organisations would hardly acknowledge it as a relevant concept for development, often dismissing inequality focused academics and activists as hard-leftists. Many commentators vehemently argued that inequality promoted competition, by reducing inefficiency, which in turn created jobs and profit.</p> <p>The global financial crash of 2008 and the fallout that continues to affect so many people, has changed the conversation. A small group of people made vast profits while tens of millions lost their jobs, houses and dignity. The evidence of the damage to society caused by high levels of inequality has been re-examined, while new research and popular <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum\">campaigns</a> have seen a new consensus form relatively rapidly. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/05/sustainable-development-goals-most-difficult-targets\">How can we reach an SDG target when we're moving in the wrong direction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett set the ball rolling in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/13/the-spirit-level\">The Spirit Level</a>. They argued that rising inequality in rich nations negatively impacts on our physical and mental health, education, experience of work and even life satisfaction, and is associated with the use of illegal drugs and mental illness. Detailed studies by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=780485\">Martin Ravallion</a> and World Bank colleagues showed that as inequality rose in poor countries, the poverty-reducing impacts of economic growth declined. Subsequent work revealed how rising inequality also slowed downs rates of improvement in human development indicators. Rising income inequality was bad for the citizens of both rich and poor countries. </p> <p>The SDG for reducing inequality, with a specific target to \u201cprogressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average\u201d encapsulates the broad acceptance of the perils of inequality, not just between countries, but within them. The fact that the target applies and demands action from all countries enhances its potency as evidence of shifting global norms. </p> <p>However, this is not a radical goal, such as arguing that top incomes must be capped or that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient\">Gini coefficient</a> must be reduced every year. Rather, it is a modest, reformist goal that seeks to ensure that those at the bottom of the income scale are not left behind as economic growth moves forward. </p> <p>Yet for all the evidence, the hand-wringing from business elites at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/davos-2015-tackling-inequality-world-economic-forum\">Davos</a>, calls from parties across the political spectrum and increasing disaffection with the status quo from those left behind (at least in rich nations), relatively little is being done to seriously address the problem of rising inequality around the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since 2000, the incomes of the bottom 40% have experienced slower growth year in, year out. Inequality is rising at spectacular rates. While different measures (wealth or income), different datasets (national accounts or taxation) and different analysts disagree on the detail, they all agree that the wealthiest are getting richer faster than anyone else (except in Latin America). The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008.</p> <p>Turning this situation around will take a Herculean effort, for two main reasons. First, contemporary capitalism is based on economic processes that permit those who manage to amass money by their brain power or political connections or both, to increase their wealth faster than others. As Thomas Piketty tells us, the returns to capital (owning physical and financial assets) are greater than the returns to labour (working). So the rich get richer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/23/paradigm-shift-needed-governments-fight-poverty-inequality\">A 'paradigm shift' is needed from governments to fight poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly, when the rich get richer, they have the ability to keep it that way. They are able to shape national and international public policies to such an extent that they remain on a rising tide of prosperity. They can also safeguard national and international patent and competition laws, enabling them to dominate the markets in which they operate, and influence rules which allow them to avoid paying tax. </p> <p>To top it all, by gaining control of the media plutocrats, the super-rich even persuade the public that inequality is good for everyone. Billionaire Donald Trump somehow becomes the voice of those left behind. Gold taps in private jets seem to be a qualification for public office in what Francis Fukuyama terms \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-rise-of-trump-brought-to-you-by-the-decay-of-americas-institutions/2016/03/10/ca6438b4-e6f2-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?utm_term=.a9c7aff2c01c\">political decay</a>\u201d in the US.</p> <p>So what can be done? Few support the 20th century revolutionary solution of seizing and redistributing land and assets, as happened after the second world war in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Perhaps more reformist measures are a more popular 21st century answer? In most low income countries, effective public expenditure on domestically-financed education, health and social protection would raise the prospects for sustained growth, structural transformation and welfare advances. The evidence for such policies is clear but, enacting them in the places they are most needed is very problematic. The nature of domestic business and political elites \u2013 often greedy, extractive and predatory \u2013 allied to international business elites and the social norms they transmit, means that socially beneficial policies are not effectively implemented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f156da1939bf531ce7ed3ec5edf66eed6ceba9d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f156da1939bf531ce7ed3ec5edf66eed6ceba9d1/0_0_3210_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her Bolsa Familia social plan card.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her bolsa familia social plan card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanderlei Almeida/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Significantly reducing inequality doesn\u2019t have to be the stuff of utopian dreamers. In Brazil, a sustained decline in inequality levels has been of the most striking aspects of its development performance over the last 10 years. In addition to raising an estimated 40 million people out of poverty, the Brazil\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2014&amp;start=2014&amp;view=map\">Gini coefficient fell by 12%, from 0.59 in 1995 to 0.52 in 2012</a>. While inequality in Brazil remains high, this reduction stands in stark contrast to other OECD and Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, which have seen levels rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/oct/18/the-e-waste-reduce-waste-old-technology-mountains-in-pictures\">The e-waste mountains - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently published research <a href=\"http://www.brazil4africa.org/\">investigating the Brazilian development model</a> looked in detail at the factors behind this trend. An estimated 35-50% of the reduction in inequality in Brazil can be attributed to changes in non-labour incomes, largely as a result of growing social assistance programmes. Despite costing just 0.7% of GDP, the extremely effective targeting of the  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/brazil-bolsa-familia-decade-anniversary-poverty-relief\"><em>bolsa familia</em></a>, a conditional cash transfer scheme, has been vital. A further 10% or so can be attributed to demographic factors, particularly the declining household size among poorer families. The remaining 40-55% is attributed to changes in the distribution of labour earnings. This had previously been attributed to the effects of an increasingly educated workforce, but our research suggests that reduced wage gaps for women and ethnic minorities actually made the biggest impact.</p> <p>Achieving the SDG target to reduce inequality will require a huge shift in how economies and political systems operate right around the world. Some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, demonstrate that sustained reductions in inequality are achievable, when there\u2019s a fairly explicit shift in the social contract, enabling politically difficult decisions to be taken and sustained over a long period. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/angus-deaton-wins-nobel-prize-in-economics\">Angus Deaton tells us</a>, humanity has made amazing progress in reducing income poverty and raising health standards. The next big task is reducing inequality so that we can all enjoy a better life. </p> <p>Reducing inequality in every country will be extremely difficult. But a growing tide of protest and its consequences (sometimes socially progressive and sometimes regressive) may persuade the 1% that they will not get the world they want for their grandchildren if business continues as usual.</p> <p><em></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Eight years ago, the US economy went to hell. Lehman Brothers bank collapsed, the first of many. As a financial crisis swept the globe, unemployment soared, house prices and stock markets collapsed. Today, stock markets are at record highs, house prices have bounced back, the unemployment rate is 5%, half its peak during the recession. And yet ...</p> <p>Earlier this month we told the stories of five people who lived through the recession, many of whom said the recovery feels hollow. Below readers who responded to the story share their experiences and how it will impact their vote.</p> <h2><strong>Craig from Jacksonville, Florida</strong></h2> <p><strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008?</strong> I am about the same. In 2008 I was just two years out from finishing my undergraduate degree. I had the option to graduate early but when things began to turn dark, every intelligent person I knew told me to hold off. I remained in school for another year thinking I could wait it out. Boy, was I wrong. I ended up going to graduate school hoping to wait out the storm again. Turns out, that didn\u2019t help much either. After graduating as a highly skilled student, finding full-time employment was about as easy as finding affordable living in Manhattan.</p> <p>Since then, I worked just about everywhere. I have done consultant research, bussed tables, worked in an emergency room and even spent a year working at a Florida beach bar all while applying for applicable jobs in my field that came with benefits. I finally have a job, but the amount of debt I have acquired and the amount of job insecurity I still feel has me on edge about as bad as 2008.</p> <p><strong>Who will you vote for? </strong>I am absolutely terrified of what is to come November 8. I am still a Florida registered voter so maybe my vote counts (if it does not end up on a beach somewhere). I plan to close my eyes and vote for Clinton.

In 2008, I just started working after an awful divorce. My ex-husband was a homebuilder and laid off in the crash and there went my maintenance and child support. Today, I\u2019m an executive assistant for a CEO. I\u2019m better off because my first job after being a stay-at-home mom for 13 years paid $50,000 and I was thrilled. In 2016, I\u2019m now at $75,000 so I\u2019ve taken some job risks but it\u2019s paid off.</p> <p>But everything else \u2013 my cost of living \u2013 seems to have absolutely skyrocketed. I literally live paycheck to paycheck. I have two kids in college and I pay their auto, health insurance and cellphones. It\u2019s crazy and I\u2019m a tad frightened for the world they\u2019ll enter soon. Not sure they\u2019ll ever be able to buy a home, at least here in Colorado.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I literally despise the Clintons so I can\u2019t vote for HRC. I always wanted to vote for the first woman, too. They\u2019re too sleazy for me. Trump scares the shit out of me. I was leaning toward him in the beginning because I do think a business person might bring a fresh perspective but, Jesus, not now.</p> <p>I think I\u2019ll write in Bernie\u2019s name.

Real estate where I live has returned to 2007 prices and as a result, we have enjoyed a good ride of appreciation of homes we have bought over the last eight years.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I can\u2019t vote for the current Republican candidate under any circumstances. He is not fit to be a CEO, much less a president. I would be fine with things staying as they are so Hillary doesn\u2019t concern me that much. The Senate and House will keep her from making any changes for better or worse so I can stomach another four years until a respectable Republican runs in 2020.</p> <h2>Willard from San Jose, California </h2> <p><strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008?</strong> I am better off than I was in 2008.<strong> <br></strong>The economy is in far better condition. Housing has recovered.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> The economy will play a role with how I\u2019ll vote. Both parties make big promises which I don\u2019t expect to be fulfilled. But at least Trump does discuss trade, jobs and manufacturing.

I have not had a steady income since I left teaching in 2012. I lost my home to Wells Fargo and now live with a friend. I don\u2019t have health insurance.</p> <p>I have a master\u2019s degree in education, a BA, speak three languages, and I am a veteran with combat experience, yet don\u2019t have a full-time job or meaningful part-time work. I don\u2019t make more than $15,000 a year. It\u2019s unlikely that at 53 I will ever work full-time again. So what, another 20-plus years of this meaningless existence?<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">When people do that horrible \u201cthank you for your service\u201d [thing], I want to scream and tell them that serving my country as a soldier and my community as a teacher were the worst mistakes of my life.

Forgotten.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> Not voting, don\u2019t care.</p> <h2>Leslie from Wilmington, North Carolina</h2> <p><strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008? </strong>I am worse off than I was in 2008.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> I had to close the company. I went from earning $70,000 a year to now working two jobs, one full time for $37,000 a year and one part time (evenings and weekends) to bring my salary to $41,000. My health insurance costs have skyrocketed. Food is more expensive. I have a home that I cannot sell as I am still underwater. I had to use all my savings to help pay for my daughter\u2019s education so she is not lumbered with loans when she graduates.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for? </strong>I hate them both. I do feel that if Clinton is elected it will be the same, no change in the housing market, no change in income, no change in healthcare costs \u2013 just more of the same. It is appalling and tragic that we have two awful people to choose from. It just shows the level of corruption and dysfunction in this country.</p> <h2>Jacob Lutz from Portland, Oregon</h2> <p> <strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008?</strong> I am about the same. <br></p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> In 2008, I was a student and a cashier at Kmart. I was transitioning from foster care to adulthood while balancing a part-time job with my first and last attempt at higher education. I was overwhelmed with the responsibility of college and surviving on $6.75 an hour but managed to survive thanks to my home state\u2019s support system for foster children and lack of financial burden.</p> <p>Today, I am a motorcycle technician and make around $30,000 a year and owe $20,000 in student loans. I also pay $200 a month for health insurance and bills on top of barely supporting myself. The stress is still the same but I\u2019ve gotten better at handling it. Lowering my hopes and expectations significantly has helped too.<br></p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I had more faith in Bernie than Hillary regarding the economy but since he\u2019s not an option, I\u2019m with her.

I no longer have a good, well-paying job and benefits. I was forced by circumstances to use up a good portion of my retirement savings to relocate and survive. I also used a lot of my savings to pay off my son\u2019s college law school loans as he has been unable to find even an entry-level job in the law profession.</p> <p>I had a successful, lifelong, professional career that disappeared overnight, and was unable to find comparable work because of my age and the terrible state of the economy.</p> <p>I think my efforts to navigate my way through the economic downturn likely mirror those of so many others. It isn\u2019t just the loss of decent paying jobs that has been an issue. It\u2019s also the erosion of savings meant for retirement. Also the enormous debts that have been run up for financial bailouts and the \u201ccheap money\u201d used to inflate the stock market will have to be faced eventually.<br><br>I believe the entire political establishment has been complicit in what has happened. I worked on Obama\u2019s first election campaign and contributed quite a bit of my own money believing the \u201chope and change\u201d message. I felt optimistic that it was a possibility. Now I just feel used and betrayed.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I will be voting for Jill Stein because she represents the only real choice that exists. The Democrats and Republicans are the same in virtually every meaningful respect and do not represent the interests of the average person at all. The definition of a wasted vote is voting for either of them.</p>",
  "<p>Seventy million Americans tuned in to watch the last of the presidential debates on Wednesday, which saw both candidates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">clash over abortion</a>, gun rights, immigration and foreign policy. <br></p> <p>Each of the three debates was mired with heated exchanges over the series of controversies that have surfaced about each candidate throughout this electoral cycle, with discussions on their policies peppered in between.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/third-presidential-debate-fact-check-trump-clinton\">Debate fact-check: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spoke for most of the combined 270 minutes, with some interjections from the moderators. But what exactly did they talk about, and for how long?</p> <p>The Guardian has aggregated the time spent on key topics throughout the three debates. Our analysis counted topics discussed at length. We did not count passing mentions of Isis or Clinton\u2019s email scandal. </p> <p>The candidates spent the majority of their time speaking about foreign policy and the economy. This is in part due to our broad definition of both topics: foreign policy includes the Syrian war, the invasion of Iraq, US relations with Russia and Nato, among other things; the economy category encompasses trade deals, tax policy, jobs and more. </p> <p>The candidates\u2019 differing styles affected how much they spoke on each issue. Clinton\u2019s succinct responses on issues of foreign policy meant that her answers often took less time. Trump danced from one issue to the next whenever he was given a chance to speak, and Syria and Iraq were common fail-safes for the Republican nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/debate-topic-totals/\" data-alt=\"Debate topics\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/debate-topic-totals/\">Debate topics</a> <figcaption>Debate topics</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The candidates spent more than 30 minutes across the three debates discussing the many controversies surrounding Trump.

However, he did push back on moderators\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\">questions regarding his tax returns</a>, blaming Clinton for allowing the tax loopholes in the first place.</p> <p>Combined with Clinton\u2019s emails and the WikiLeaks revelations, the candidates spent 45 minutes \u2013 equivalent to half of a debate \u2013 discussing the scandals that they\u2019re embroiled in. </p> <p>Evidently, their debating styles differed. While Clinton was more likely to stay on one topic each time it was mentioned, both candidates attempted to pivot the discussion when less favorable issues were raised. </p> <p>When Trump was asked about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">his treatment of women</a> or his questionable tax returns, he would revert to a range of his favorite talking points such as Isis or Clinton\u2019s emails. In the second debate, for instance, Trump mentioned Isis six times in response to a question from Anderson Cooper on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">Access Hollywood tape in which Trump said he would grab a woman\u2019s genitals without her consent</a>.</p> <p>Clinton avoided tough questions about her use of a private email server or the content of numerous emails from her inner circle released by WikiLeaks by highlighting Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. Clinton mentioned Putin or Russia seven times in one response in the third debate when asked by Chris Wallace about a speech she gave to a Brazilian bank that was released by WikiLeaks. </p> <p>The economy consistently ranks among the most important topics for voters, often followed closely by national security and terrorism. In this respect, the candidates\u2019 focus on the debates was closely aligned with public interest. </p> <p>However, the supreme court is one of the most divisive issues, especially for conservatives voters conflicted on whether to vote for Trump, and it only featured prominently once in the third debate. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/where-is-climate-change-in-the-trump-v-clinton-presidential-debates\">Climate change would not have been mentioned at all</a> if it hadn\u2019t been for one question in the second debate from a man in a red sweater named Ken Bone. </p>",

Clinton\u2019s team said she raised $154m; Trump said he raised $100m.</p> <p>Throwing off his previous shoestring operation, Trump spent more in September than in the previous four months put together, splashing out about $70m, including $23m on advertising. But he was outspent again by Clinton, who invested almost $83m, including around $66m on advertising.</p> <p>Notably, Clinton\u2019s employees claimed on expenses $260 worth of products from the Trump International Hotel in New York: a tie, polo shirt and hat. These were used as props a Clinton campaign digital video highlighting that Trump does not make all of his products in America.</p>"
