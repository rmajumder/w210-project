  "<p>The first two user tutorials are pretty stock standard but, from there, things escalate dramatically. After mastering How to Sign Up and How to Recover Your Password, users are apparently ready to advance to lesson number three: How to Create a Democracy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As it turns out, on <a href=\"http://democracyos.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DemocracyOS</a>, this is a relatively straightforward matter \u2013 no overthrowing the previous regime nor exterminating the last traces of the royal lineage in order to pave the way for a new world order. Instead Argentinian developers Democracia en Red have made it a simple matter of clicking a button to form a group and thrash out the policies voters wish to see enacted.</p> <p>It is one of a range of digital platforms for direct democracy created by developers and activists to redefine the relationship between citizens and their governments, with the powers that be in Latin American city councils through to European anti-austerity parties making the upgrade to democracy 2.0.</p> <p>Reshaping how government works is a difficult enough pitch by itself but, beyond that, there\u2019s another challenge facing developers \u2013 the online trolls are ready and waiting. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/20/is-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-bad-news-for-migrants-and-refugees\">Is the fourth industrial revolution bad news for migrants and refugees?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain alone this year offered up two examples of what impact trolls could have on online direct democracy \u2013 there was the case of \u201cBoaty McBoatface\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/17/boaty-mcboatface-wins-poll-to-name-polar-research-vessel\">famously winning a Natural Environment Research Council poll</a> to determine the name of a multimillion-pound arctic research vessel, and then there was the more serious case of trolls <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/petition-for-second-eu-referendum-may-have-been-manipulated\">adding the signatures of thousands of residents of countries such as the Cayman Islands and Vatican City</a> to a formal petition calling for a second Brexit referendum, in order to have the entire document disregarded as an online prank. </p> <p>In the US presidential election even the politicians are getting in on it, with a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC (political action committee) hiring <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-digital-trolling-20160506-snap-htmlstory.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an army of online commenters to defend the candidate in arguments on social media</a>, while the Republican contender, Donald Trump, is himself engaging in textbook trolling behaviour \u2013 whether that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">urging the hacking of Clinton\u2019s emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/22/donald-trump-reveals-republican-rival-lindsey-grahams-phone-number-on-tv\">revealing the phone number of a Republican rival during the primaries</a>, or unleashing a constant stream of controversial statements as a means of derailing conversations, attracting attention and humiliating his targets. </p> <p>So what does this mean for digital platforms for direct democracy? By merging the world of the internet with that of politics, will we all end up governed by some fusion of trolls and Trumps promising to build Wally McWallfaces on our borders? And will the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution also usher in a revolution in how democracy functions? </p> <p>Richard D. Bartlett, the cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.loomio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loomio</a> \u2013 the platform of choice for numerous direct democracy initiatives including Spain\u2019s Podemos party \u2013 says setting boundaries is key to safeguarding against trolls.</p> <p>\u201cAt Loomio we developed our community moderation policy in collaboration with our community, so our moderators have an explicit mandate to act,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout clear boundaries, you immediately exclude everyone that doesn\u2019t want to expose themselves to harassment. It\u2019s like saying \u2018we only want jerks here please\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Shefali V Virkar, the author of the University of Oxford study Trolls Just Want To Have Fun: Electronic Aggression Within the Context of e-Participation and Other Online Political Behaviour in the United Kingdom, says direct democracy initiatives have largely avoided trolling problems partly due to their heavy moderation of disruptive behaviour but also because, to date, such platforms have been considered too small and irrelevant to be worth targeting.</p> <p>If such initiatives grow as large as their developers envision, however, effective moderation will become increasingly challenging to maintain and Virkar suggests the employment of stricter registration criteria to stop trolls joining in the first place. </p> <p>\u201cThere is little much else that platform owners can do to curtail trolling and the chief challenge here is now for platform owners to balance website security with freedom of expression,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/14/why-teaching-graduates-to-be-flexible-is-more-important-than-worrying-about-jobs-that-dont-yet-exist\">Why teaching graduates to be flexible is more important than worrying about jobs that don't yet exist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An example of how this balance might be difficult for developers to achieve can be found in perhaps the world\u2019s most successful direct democracy party, Italy\u2019s Five Stars movement, which in six years of existence has risen to become one of the country\u2019s major political forces. </p> <p>In his 2015 book, Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement: Organisation, Communication and Ideology, the Italian political scientist Filippo Tronconi analysed the content of a random sample of comments removed from the party\u2019s policy sounding board website between 19 September and 10 November in 2013. He found that, while the comments deleted by the comedian-turned-party leader Beppe Grillo were almost all critical, many were communicated in a calm and polite manner.</p> <p>\u201cBy describing dissenters as trolls, Grillo exploits web culture to implicitly gain censorship authority over the debate: according to the ethics of online communities, \u2018flames\u2019 [i.e. deliberately provocative comments) can be legitimately deleted by the administrators for the sake of the conversation,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>In Australia, the <a href=\"https://voteflux.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">app developer-cum-political party Flux</a> is looking to bitcoin for answers.

France and the UK concluded the Treaty of Le Touquet on 4 February 2003. The bilateral agreement places part of Britain\u2019s border with France in Calais, meaning that British border forces can carry out passport checks in Calais rather than in Dover.</p> <p>Political rhetoric around Calais has heightened in recent months following British voters\u2019 decision to leave the European Union. Following the vote, Xavier Bertrand, head of the Hauts-de-France region that includes the camp in Calais, insisted the bilateral agreement had to be \u201cdenounced\u201d \u2013 in other words, unilaterally terminated. \u201cThe British people have chosen to take back their freedom, they must take back their borders,\u201d the former centre-right minister told the Telegraph at the time.</p> <p>But in August British and French interior ministers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\"> confirmed they would continue with the treaty</a> under which British border checks are carried out on French soil. A joint statement issued by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, said they would work together to strengthen security around the \u201cshared border\u201d in Calais and \u201cstrongly diminish\u201d the migratory pressures that have attracted at least 7,000 migrants to the Channel tunnel port.</p> <p>The resurgence of Nicolas Sarkozy \u2013 who is one of the frontrunners to be the election candidate for Les R\u00e9publicains \u2013 has added pressure upon the French socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>During a visit to the camp in August, Sarkozy \u2013 who as interior minister signed up to the treaty in 2003 as part of a deal to close a former migrant centre in Sangatte \u2013 suggested migrants should be processed across the Channel. \u201cThose who are here in Calais and who want to cross to England should be processed in England by the English,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In September, Hollande took a harder line on Calais saying that Britain had to accept more migrants and warned that it could not avoid its \u201cresponsibilities to France\u201d.<br></p> <p>In his first visit to Calais since he was elected in 2012, the French president promised to \u201ccompletely and definitively\u201d close the Calais migrant camp by the end of the year but warned that Brexit did not mean that the UK could \u201cwaive its obligations\u201d and must \u201cplay its part\u201d in resolving the crisis.</p>",

Under Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has not hidden its preference for Donald Trump, and has sought \u2013 through cyber-attacks and leaks aimed at embarrassing the Democratic party \u2013 to help his campaign. </p> <p>As Trump has faltered, Russia has hurried to use the remaining months of the Obama administration to achieve its military aims in Syria. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/aleppo-could-be-destroyed-by-christmas-warns-un-envoy-for-syria\">The UN has warned that eastern Aleppo will reduced to rubble by December</a>, leaving an incoming president little or nothing to defend, and paltry options in the rest of Syria.</p> <p>There is much in Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state to suggest Putin has reason to hurry. When it came to some of the most critical foreign policy decisions made during her four years at Foggy Bottom, Clinton was consistently on the more hawkish side of the argument, frequently taking a more forceful line than her president.</p> <p>In Libya, she helped convince a reluctant Obama to take part in a military intervention being championed by European and Arab states. On Iran, she had ridiculed him during the primary campaign for saying he would meet the Islamic Republic\u2019s leader unconditionally. It was \u201creckless and naive\u201d, she had said.</p> <p>Once she arrived at the state department, she took the lead in building a high wall of sanctions around Tehran, playing \u201cbad cop\u201d to the outstretched hand of Obama\u2019s \u201cgood cop\u201d. </p> <p>And towards the end of her time as secretary of state, as the Syrian civil war grew ever more horrific, Clinton advocated a robust train-and-equip policy in support of the armed opposition, although she eventually lost that argument with the White House.</p> <p>Those instincts were on clear display when it came to the biggest foreign and security dilemma facing the Obama administration in its first year in office: what to do about the US entanglement in Afghanistan. </p> <p>In 2009, the defence secretary, Robert Gates, and the US generals were calling for a surge in troop levels aimed at pushing the Taliban back and stabilising the security situation before the government of President Hamid Karzai could be left to stand on its own. </p> <p>Ranged against them were the vice-president, Joseph Biden, and Obama\u2019s inner circle, who doubted the value of yet more deployments, arguing for a much smaller military presence to conduct counter-terrorist operations against al-Qaida, rather than counter-insurgency against the Taliban. Clinton sided with the generals.</p> <p>\u201cClearly she had very good relations with Secretary Gates and the senior military leadership at the time and so was inclined to support their arguments,\u201d said Derek Chollet, who served as principal deputy director of Clinton\u2019s policy planning staff. </p> <p>Clinton had appointed a veteran diplomat and one of her most fervent supporters, Richard Holbrooke, as her envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He had a memorably acerbic, hard-charging manner but on this argument he was a dove, dubious of the generals\u2019 faith in quick military fixes. Clinton stayed personally loyal to Holbrooke \u2013 but she did not follow his advice.</p> <p>\u201cThe American military and the White House campaigned to get Holbrooke fired,\u201d a former western diplomat said. \u201cOn two occasions she saved Holbrooke, but she didn\u2019t back him much beyond that, and in particular she backed the American military against Holbrooke\u2019s advice. She was consistently hawkish.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d93eb6c0066d2e0edc7434deeb1deeb44e2e9edb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d93eb6c0066d2e0edc7434deeb1deeb44e2e9edb/0_63_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pakistani soldiers pay tribute to their colleagues who lost their lives in a Nato attack, during their funeral in Peshawar, Pakistan on 27 November 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pakistani soldiers pay tribute to their colleagues who lost their lives in a Nato attack, during their funeral in Peshawar, Pakistan on 27 November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammad Sajjad/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Holbrooke\u2019s advice, she helped persuade Congress to be more generous to Pakistan, in a bid to placate its fears of being abandoned and so hopefully moderate its support of the Taliban.</p> <p>But in the midst of that effort, when US and Pakistani military leaders were on the brink of carrying out major joint counter-insurgency operations, disaster struck.

The exchange would eventually help persuade Clinton to acknowledge the US error publicly \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/pakistan-dispute-nato-hillary-clinton\">apologise for the loss of lives</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAfter that I was convinced she had wisdom that was missing in many parts of the US foreign policy world, where there is too much bravado,\u201d Khar said. \u201cShe could step back from the US position because she understood the long-term repercussions. She had a much more realistic perspective.\u201d</p> <p>David Miliband, who as UK foreign secretary overlapped with Clinton for her first 16 months at secretary of state, called her \u201cthe best listener in politics\u201d and argued that her mix of personal skills and beliefs defy easy categorisation.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018hawk\u2019 does justice to her world view,\u201d said Miliband, now president of the International Rescue Committee. \u201cThe fact that she is willing to use force \u2013 and sees the value of the threat of using force \u2013 doesn\u2019t make it the only tool in her kitbag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, I would say she has a lot of commitment to diplomacy and development, lubricated by personal relationships, which are sometimes called dovish \u2013 which shows that the hawk versus dove is not a very satisfactory set of boxes to put people in,\u201d Miliband said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f8ea31bd558c6059a53387112637e908607faec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8ea31bd558c6059a53387112637e908607faec/0_8_3720_2231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton chats with her British counterpart, David Miliband, at the state department in Washington on 3 February 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton chats with her British counterpart, David Miliband, at the state department in Washington on 3 February 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton\u2019s faith in the power of personal diplomacy is demonstrated by the nearly one million miles she travelled while secretary of state, to a total of 112 countries. John Kerry recently surpassed her mileage, but has not so far broken Clinton\u2019s record for countries visited. That, her supporters say, is testament to her commitment to addressing diplomatic challenges that do not regularly make the front pages.</p> <p>She spent a great deal of effort in the autumn of 2009 trying to help heal one of the deepest wounds in the Caucasus: the historic rift between Turkey and Armenia, which had not had diplomatic relations since Armenian independence in 1991. </p> <p>After a year of talks, both sides had settled on an accord designed to normalise relations and open their shared border. On 10 October, with prodding from Clinton, the two countries\u2019 foreign ministers, Ahmet Davutoglu and Eduard Nalbandian, flew to Zurich to sign the document.</p> <p>Lavrov, his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, and the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and other dignitaries from around Europe were gathered at Zurich University to witness the event. But at the last minute, Nalbandian balked.</p> <blockquote> <p></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>The Armenian foreign minister had heard that Davutoglu was going to lard his speech with a distinctly Turkish spin on the two nations\u2019 painful history.</p> <p>He went to consult Clinton and she sought to repair the rift from the back seat of her official black BMW, calling Davutoglu and Nalbandian alternately. For three hours neither foreign minister budged.</p> <p>Back at the university hall, the other foreign ministers had taken to watching football on television. Lavrov threatened to walk out. </p> <p>In the end, Clinton clinched a deal by which neither Davutoglu nor Nalbandian would deliver remarks, leaving Clinton to do the talking. Nalbandian still seemed nervous, so to ensure he did not try to bolt the Americans drove to the venue with him wedged between Clinton and her undersecretary, Gordon.</p> <p>Despite all preparation and the frantic effort in Zurich, the accord was never ratified by either country as Turkish-Armenian relations were once again soured by conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. But for Gordon, the episode demonstrated Clinton\u2019s strategic patience.</p> <p>\u201cThe illustrative point is: even though this was a long and complicated trip and she had gone the extra mile to be there, she didn\u2019t get mad. She didn\u2019t blame her staff. She didn\u2019t blame the parties. She rolled up her sleeves and said: all right, how can we fix this?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Over four years at the vast state department headquarters in Washington, Clinton won the loyalty of her staff by the same attention to detail. She ordered showers installed, for example, after a chance encounter with a young female diplomat who cycled to work each day.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been completely easier for her to say forget it. It\u2019s too far beneath me,\u201d a former state department legal adviser, Harold Koh,<strong> </strong>said. \u201cBut she checked in on it and made sure it happened.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton left the state department in January 2013 as the most popular member of the administration, though without any dramatic achievements to her name. The chronic foreign policy problems remained unsolved and unchanged.</p> <p>\u201cShe did an extraordinarily good job of making the world like America again,\u201d a former senior European diplomat said. \u201cShe was sky high in terms of popularity and air miles, but we all knew at the time that the tricky policy issues were still there. When Kerry came charging in, trying to settle all these issues, it was a reminder that she had rather stayed above the fray.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s supporters say that is an unfair assessment. Kerry\u2019s signature achievement, the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, benefited from good timing. Any such agreement would have been impossible until the reformist Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, came to office in June 2013 \u2013 five months after Clinton had left.<br></p> <p>With the new international crises thrown up by the upheaval in the Arab world, Clinton was very much in the fray, though the question of whether she took the right approach in dealing with them \u2013 and in particular the chronic foreign policy dilemma of whether and when to conduct humanitarian interventions \u2013 is still fiercely debated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be8d5d7aaf23b7db951926343d8842e4b467d643\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be8d5d7aaf23b7db951926343d8842e4b467d643/0_70_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton arrives in Naypyidaw on 30 November 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton arrives in Naypyidaw on 30 November 2011.

Usually the US speaks first but we didn\u2019t have a policy from the White House yet and she had been in listening mode, listening to the French, the Italians and Brits, saying we have to act and \u2026 that I think that had an impact on her and led her to support action,\u201d Gordon said.</p> <p>At the UN, Clinton and the US permanent representative, Susan Rice, were able to secure a Russian abstention to a UN security council resolution that allowed \u201call necessary measures\u201d to protect civilians from their own leader, Muammar Gaddafi.</p> <p>The population in question in the spring of 2011 were the civilians in rebel-held Benghazi, threatened with extermination by Gaddafi. Led by France, coalition aircraft struck Libyan government columns as they approached the eastern city. The problem then was when to stop bombing in a situation where a government offensive arguably represented a potential threat to civilians.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about protecting civilians and looking for a solution but over time as that solution didn\u2019t materialise, it was kind of clear where this was going to end,\u201d Gordon said.</p> <p>According to former aides, Clinton herself described the Libyan intervention as a limited humanitarian action in the first few weeks, and only changed her use of vocabulary as the conflict entered a stalemate in the early summer of 2011.</p> <p>To some in the administration, however, it seemed self-evident from the start that the logic of defending civilians would ultimately draw the US and its allies into an ever deeper conflict that could only end with Gaddafi\u2019s removal.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>The idea of it being a limited humanitarian operation was a genuine one but it was a naive one,\u201d Jeremy Shapiro, who served as an adviser on north Africa and the Levant on Clinton\u2019s policy planning staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that you are going to intervene in a civil war to save a bunch of people and then walk away while<strong> </strong>the civil war goes on and while a genocidal mass murderer still has the upper hand in armaments seems untenable. We tried that once before in walking away from Iraq after the first Gulf war and it was a disaster politically and operationally.\u201d</p> <p>With the fall of Tripoli and then the death of Gaddafi in October 2011, American, British and French leaders were initially hailed as liberators. It was only when the precarious post-revolutionary peace imploded into factional strife \u2013 culminating in the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi in September 2012 \u2013 that the conventional wisdom in Washington on the intervention changed from triumph to disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ee472ee8d88aae1b6010ce26729dfe76114129\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ee472ee8d88aae1b6010ce26729dfe76114129/276_0_2949_1770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton participate in a transfer ceremony of the remains of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans killed in Benghazi, at Andrews air force base near Washington in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton participate in a transfer ceremony of the remains of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans killed in Benghazi, at Andrews air force base near Washington in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton came under sustained attack in Congress for the failure to provide adequate security for her diplomats, but broader questions were raised as well about the intervention as a whole and the handling of its aftermath.</p> <p>Former aides deny that her attention drifted elsewhere, saying that new authorities in Libya either spurned offers of help or were not sufficiently organised to take advantage of them. Some have also argued that Libya\u2019s chaos should be measured against the humanitarian catastrophe of Syria, in which the US opted not to play a significant part militarily. The death toll, estimated to be approaching half a million, reflects the costs of non-intervention.</p> <p>In her last year at the state department, Clinton developed a plan with the then CIA director, David Petraeus, to arm Syrian rebels, as a means of holding both the Assad regime and the jihadists at bay. The scheme was initially rebuffed by the White House but then taken up after she left on a very small scale. </p> <p>Clinton supporters argue that if the administration had taken her suggested route, a vacuum would not have been created on the opposition side, into which Gulf-funded extremists have poured in. The vacuum left by the absence of US leadership, they say, has also allowed Russia to intervene on the side of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime with murderous consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0149209854f601abd7976b7037cdf54244363e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0149209854f601abd7976b7037cdf54244363e5c/0_142_2499_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton speaks after the opening session of the second \u2018Friends of Syria\u2019 conference at the Istanbul Congress Center on 1 April 2012, in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton speaks after the opening session of the second \u2018Friends of Syria\u2019 conference at the Istanbul Congress Center on 1 April 2012, in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere were many of us who early on thought we should have done more than we did on train-and-equip,\u201d said Wendy Sherman, who was Clinton\u2019s undersecretary of state for political affairs. \u201cThat said, I understand the president\u2019s reluctance, not least because the American people were reluctant but because it is a slippery slope, and you don\u2019t know where it will lead. I understand why the decisions were so hard. I think we had a moment some years ago where it might have made a substantial difference.\u201d</p> <p>The no-fly zone Clinton has advocated in her presidential campaign as a means of saving civilian lives, is widely seen as unfeasible given the heavy Russian air presence and the high likelihood that it would lead to head-on US-Russian confrontation. The time for a no-fly zone was while Clinton was at the state department, her critics say.</p> <p>Some of her former officials say they could not recall the option being seriously discussed, but Sherman insists it was properly considered. </p> <p>\u201cIt was absolutely seriously discussed,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Even if the \u201chawk\u201d epithet does not do justice to Clinton\u2019s worldview, her record as secretary of state leaves little doubt that if elected, she will be more at ease in deploying US military might than her predecessor. </p> <p>But in the nearly four years since she left the state department, the world has changed rapidly, and arguably not in US interests. Broadly speaking, US allies have grown weaker and its enemies stronger. Those adversaries are now acting with some haste to make sure that, by the time she does arrive in the Oval Office, her room for manoeuvre has shrunk further still.<br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 October 2016.

  "<p>That proverbial wall of worry? With the election approaching, the Federal Reserve keeping investors on edge and the stock market emerging (possibly) from an earnings recession, it seems to be getting taller every day. Can stock market investors scale it? Will they even be willing to make the attempt?</p> <p> If you listen to at least one group of investment pundits, they should. Armageddon is not on the horizon, the argument goes, and we should all be taking advantage of this uncertainty to load up on US stocks. Not that many people are thinking that way.</p> <p> \u201cYou\u2019d have more investor interest in a water purification plant in Botswana than in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, CEO and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, at a luncheon held in New York by Eaton Vance Investment Managers. </p> <p>Eaton Vance, a mutual funds firm for which Bernstein manages two funds and provides investment insight, is one of several firms that every so often puts its top money managers in front of financial journalists, to opine on the global markets. </p> <p>Last week, part of Bernstein\u2019s mission, and that of his fellow speaker Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, was to get out word that the odds of a stock market meltdown are minimal, or at least far, far lower than the fears of investors.</p> <p>Those fears seem to be at astonishingly high levels. </p> <p>Eaton Vance released its fourth-quarter <a href=\"https://funds.eatonvance.com/advisor-top-of-mind-index.php\">Advisor Top-of Mind Index</a>, a quarterly survey of more than 1,000 financial advisers which captures how they and their clients are thinking. And they <em tabindex=\"-1\">are</em> worried: 76% responded that their clients were motivated by fear and 89% said clients viewed market volatility as a risk rather than an opportunity. </p> <p>Anxiety ahead of any presidential election is hardly unusual. Even without a change in leadership, elections bring change or its prospect at the congressional level. For investors, change is a Bad Thing. </p> <p>When you can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen next, it is nearly impossible for analysts to pin a future value on a stream of corporate earnings, on which mutual fund managers and others base their buy and sell decisions. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to find a more complex backdrop than this election. Will the Fed raise interest rates? When? By how much? How will Britain and its European soon-to-be-former partners handle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/anniversary-of-big-bang-on-the-lse-tinged-with-post-brexit-anxiety\">their divorce</a> and what will that mean for global trade and the value of the dollar, on which depends the prosperity of US exporters? </p> <p>Throw into the mix angst about trade policy, foreign affairs and all the other stuff a new president will concern herself or himself with, and it\u2019s little wonder that investors are scurrying to cash. </p> <p>Cash holdings by portfolio managers are at the highest levels recorded by one survey since the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/10/18/fund-managers-cash-hoard-returns-to-15-year-high/\">15 years ago</a>. In October, global fund managers have been keeping an average of nearly 6% of their assets in cash. That\u2019s more than they had in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. </p> <p>Other bearish indicators are flashing red lights. Some are esoteric, like one tied to the options market and known as the \u201cskew\u201d. It rises in price along with the cost to buy options that will pay off when stocks fall, relative to the cost to purchase options that rise in price when stocks gain ground. That metric <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-12/docile-vix-masks-surging-prices-for-stock-hedges-before-election\">has hit record highs</a> this month. </p> <p> Add to that the perennial worries that stocks are overvalued \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-baml-survey-idUSL8N1BP2G6\">perhaps more so than they have been since the beginning of the 21st century</a>. The trailing price/earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 index is now about 24, meaning that investors are paying about $24 for every $1 of profits generated by the companies in the index in the last 12 months. </p> <p>The prospective P/E ratio, which is forward-looking, is about 18, meaning you would pay about $18 for every $1 of earnings. It\u2019s a quick and easy valuation metric that gives you a way to tell how important the market sees those earnings as being, and how hard it would be to get that income anywhere else. For context, the long-term average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 index is about 15, so by that measure, you\u2019d have to say current valuations are above average. But are they excessive?</p> <p> Not if you\u2019re asking Richard Bernstein and his colleagues at Eaton Vance.</p> <p> True, those <a href=\"http://www.barrons.com/articles/punk-profit-growth-wont-kill-this-bull-market-1476508326\">profits have been more meager recently</a>, raising questions about whether lackluster growth in earnings was enough to fuel even modest expansion in share prices.</p> <p> But that ignores two facts. The first is that the profits recession <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/10/the-profit-recession-on-wall-street-is-coming-to-an-end.html\">may be drawing to a close</a>. The second is interest rates, which remain near historic lows. The market seemed fine with lofty valuations when the interest rate on the 10-year Treasury note was at 6.5%. Today, with the 10-year Treasury trading at only 1.7%,<strong> </strong>investors shouldn\u2019t find those market multiples terribly unnerving<strong>. </strong>When investors can get such meager returns from bonds, stock-market returns become much more valuable and it makes sense to be willing to tolerate higher valuations.</p> <p> Meanwhile, investors refuse to take on higher levels of risk.</p> <p> \u201cFind me an investor who is [borrowing] to get more exposure to equities,\u201d Bernstein said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/us-money-blog/2016/jun/26/us-stock-market-reaction-uk-leave-vote-brexit\">US stock market and Brexit: a toxic blend of uncertainty and complacency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact is, he says, that while investors may grumble about volatility and lackluster returns \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 is ahead only 4.8% so far this year \u2013 their logic is flawed. </p> <p>\u201cWith volatility comes opportunity,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually in the second-largest bull market of the postwar period and the opportunity cost of being fearful is high.\u201d </p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s time to climb the wall of worry. Or, to translate that old investment cliche, to take all your extra cash and invest it. Bonds certainly aren\u2019t going to generate much income and sitting on cash isn\u2019t remotely useful if you want to retire with a nest egg that has grown in size. </p> <p>You shouldn\u2019t ever allow yourself to be distracted by short-term events, however major they appear at the moment. Remember the Iraq war(s)? The terrorist attacks of 9/11? Even the financial crisis of 2008? Eventually, after all of them, the market snapped back to life and investors with a long-term time horizon didn\u2019t have to try to make the tricky or even impossible decision of when to jump back in after fleeing in terror. </p> <p> That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019ll want to buy everything in the market, the Eaton Vance pundits argued. Instead, it\u2019s time to become a little more picky. </p> <p>If the stock market itself isn\u2019t overvalued, some corners are, such as consumer staples (think packaged foods): you\u2019ll pay $19 to $20 for every dollar of earnings they produce and their earnings aren\u2019t growing very rapidly, noted Perkin. He also noted that there has been a rotation away from defensive stocks, like utilities, and that investors will need to start taking a look at cyclical companies.</p> <p> It may even be time to revisit gold mining companies, Bernstein suggested, companies that have performed so badly in the last few years that they have fallen off most investors\u2019 radar screens completely. Now they are <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/13851452/1/here-s-what-to-know-before-trading-volatile-gold-stocks.html\">starting to revive</a>.</p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re heading into a new market stage: the recovery phase of the profits recession,\u201d he says. </p> <p> Election or not, this is no time to be running for cover, he insists.</p>",

Even very funny and talented people can struggle to match that. </p> <p>The cold open was, of course, a parody of the final presidential debate. Hanks stepped in as moderator Chris Wallace, doing an excellent deadpan of a man desperately trying to give Donald Trump a chance. Kate McKinnon continued to develop her inspired Hillary Clinton, beginning literally with the knives out. </p> <p>\u201cIn the first debate I set the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the second debate I fired up the grill, and tonight\u201d \u2013 rubbing two knives together \u2013 \u201cI feast.\u201d </p> <p>Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump remains mostly crazy faces and verbal tics, but he did score with a line about Trump having the support of \u201cthe best Baldwin brother \u2013 Stephen Baldwin\u201d. </p> <p>Once again, the show seemed to be willing to play fast and loose with tradition, using a rare cutaway to show the entire world laughing at Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cno one has more respect for women\u201d than he does. None of this year\u2019s debate sketches will go down in SNL<em> </em>history, but they were funny enough. </p> <p>Like last week, when Emily Blunt sang about puppies and cake, Hank\u2019s monologue was framed as a reaction to the terrible state of the world. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Favorite Dad\u201d switched to a cardigan for a \u201clittle chat\u201d about anxiety in a country getting \u201ca little darker\u201d and \u201ca lot gayer\u201d, and about dealing with debt. It was a pep talk about the good in America that can overcome these dark days: cute and fairly clever, if not uproariously funny. </p> <p>After the monologue, the show returned with one of its best in a while, a \u201cBlack Jeopardy\u201d with Kenan Thompson as host and Hanks as Doug, an older white man in a Make America Great Again hat who favored \u201cGit R\u2019 Done\u201d as a catchphrase. Everything about the sketch worked: the writing was tight and topical, the performances were great and Hanks really sold it as an older, working class guy with suspicions about the Illuminati and who thinks skinny girls can do \u201cnot a damn thing\u201d for you. </p> <p>Game show sketches are old-fashioned and can tend towards lazy, but this one was incredibly well done, making solid points about current affairs and taking advantage of the show\u2019s now diversified cast. </p> <p>There were a few more hits. A clever parody mimicked dramedies like Transparent with a promo for a show about \u201ca family of adjunct professors who are all diagnosed with depression on the same day \u2026 but it\u2019s 30 minutes so it\u2019s a comedy\u201d. Hanks as the oddball David Pumpkins in a haunted house worked for fans of absurdity and deliberate nonsensicalness. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/no-groping-for-laughs-as-alec-baldwin-nails-trump-on-saturday-night-live\">No groping for laughs as Baldwin nails Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As was the case last week, Weekend Update\u2019s political jokes felt a bit tired, though Colin Jost got in one good jab about Mike Pence accepting the results of the election \u201cunless they\u2019re gay\u201d. Update has being relying more on characters for flavor, though, and this time it worked: Leslie Jones came on to talk about email hacking, a thin but welcome excuse for her to do some stand-up material about her own leaked photos that was as funny and in-your-face-as as she always is.</p> <p>Cecily Strong also returned as \u201cthe girl who wish you hadn\u2019t started a conversation with at a party\u201d, a reliable enough Update character who was amusing while rambling about \u201cJillian Assange\u201d and sheeple. </p> <p>Hanks also got to reprise the role of Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger for a brief sketch with Baldwin, and to play his frequent director Ron Howard hosting a pet bloopers show with two dreary French commentators. Neither sketch was extraordinary, but they were an indication of how excited the writers were to write for Hanks. </p> <p>Perhaps the writers took comfort in knowing they, too, could rely on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Favorite Dad\u201d to deliver. </p>",

However, Paxman was on fine form, as though spraying linguistic lava from a permanently erupting volcano. \u201cThis year\u2019s presidential election has shaped up rather like a reality TV contest,\u201d he scoffed. Later, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s ascendance: \u201cMany conservatives still thought he was a spiv wearing spray-tan Republicanism.\u201d</p> <p>The documentary made a goodish fist of impartiality, with references to Hillary\u2019s emails, her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">deplorables</a>\u201d outburst, the fact that she\u2019s a Clinton and the embodiment of the \u201cpolitical class\u201d (\u201cHillary reeks of Washington\u201d) and everything else that apparently turns off \u201cangry white voters\u201d so much that they would rather elect a sexist, racist, narcissistic halfwit with hair like demonically possessed candyfloss and the political acumen of a deep-fried whoopee cushion.</p> <p>However, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Clinton</a>\u2019s toxicity was dealt with (some disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters prefer to vote for Trump), Paxman reserved his main scalpel cuts for a non-anaesthetised dissection of the Trump phenomenon. Washington strategist Jim Messina related how he\u2019d initially prayed for the Republican nominee to be Trump, as he\u2019d be the \u201ceasiest to beat\u201d. The irony was not lost on Paxman, who stood by the grave of the acerbic commentator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/26/biography.features\">HL Mencken</a>, paraphrasing his line: \u201cOn some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.\u201d Quite.

Anthony Anderson plays Dre Johnson, father of an upper-middle-class black family, with a mixed-race doctor wife, Rainbow, played by Tracee Ellis Ross (\u201cI\u2019m not really black? Could somebody tell my hair and my ass?\u201d), deadpan grandad, played by Laurence Fishburne (\u201cI can smell a group hug coming on\u201d), and the requisite brood of cute, wisecracking kids.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the curse of the pharaohs still lingers because the dialogue in Tutankhamun was shocking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect (a black <em>Modern Family</em>?), but <em>Black-ish</em>\u2019s strengths soon emerged in its confident vision, whip-smart writing and knowing absurdist flourishes, such as a sightseeing tour driving past the Anderson abode: \u201cIf you look to your left, you\u2019ll see the mythical and majestic black family, out of their natural habitat and yet still thriving.\u201d</p> <p>Later episodes will deal with everything from racist language to police brutality, but the pilot mainly focused on the challenges of the family\u2019s blended (black-ish) reality. Pilot episodes can be clunky, and <em>Black-ish</em> was no exception, with an overzealous \u201con-message\u201d feel. However, by the second episode it was hitting its stride, with a defiantly silly parental sex talk theme. Meanwhile, grandad advised his eldest granddaughter about some peer group problems, later telling Rainbow: \u201cI listened to her, gave her some generic advice in a deep soothing voice \u2013 I \u2018Morgan Freeman-ed\u2019 her.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/tutankhamun/2a3150a0001\"><strong>Tutankhamun</strong></a> appears to have been conceived for the ITV Sunday night slot still haunted by the ratings ghost of <em>Downton Abbey</em>.

Ultimately, <em>Tutankhamun</em> was pleasant enough, a kind of underpowered sand-and-trowel affair, but it won\u2019t be enough to bury BBC rival <em>Poldark</em>.</p> <p>One of my all-time favourite films is Brian De Palma\u2019s <em>Carrie</em>, so I was intrigued by the opener to the three-part supernatural thriller <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/him/2a4266a0001\"><strong>Him</strong></a>, written by Paula Milne (<em>The Politician\u2019s Husband</em>, <em>The Night Watch</em>). The eponymous, otherwise unnamed Him, ably portrayed by Fionn Whitehead, is a troubled, truanting, spliff-smoking 17-year-old whose telekinetic powers (from tying shoelaces with no hands to exploding water tanks) give him nosebleeds. His situation is exacerbated by the disappointing, warring adults surrounding him, most notably his divorced parents (tensely portrayed by Katherine Kelly and James Murray) and their hostile new partners (Lucy Liemann and Patrick Robinson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8c9e6e004714dfa9710537ead0c4c240ff5550d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c9e6e004714dfa9710537ead0c4c240ff5550d/0_211_5168_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fionn Whitehead as the teen with telekinetic powers in ITV\u2019s Him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fionn Whitehead as the teen with telekinetic powers in ITV\u2019s Him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Genower/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any telekinetic drama worth its salt, <em>Him</em> centres on adolescent misery, isolation, fury and sundry other powerful emotions: Him was seen falling for his stepsister (Simona Brown), whose voiceover runs through the tale. There were times when it all got a bit too daft (sharp tools hovered <em>Tom and Jerry</em>-style above the stepfather\u2019s unwitting head), but I, for one, rather enjoyed the novelty of it all. The performances were universally strong, and there was a determined sense of artistry to Andy De Emmony\u2019s direction, birds flocking in the skies with Hitchcockian menace. The first episode climaxed with Him becoming aware of the dark potential of his powers and not seeming all that upset about it. If I were one of the parents, I\u2019d be considering confiscating any school prom tickets.</p>",

We can\u2019t vote. But we can listen to people who know more than us. And no, I don\u2019t mean the comedians on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been tuning into Monocle\u2019s Trump v Clinton podcast, <a href=\"https://monocle.com/radio/shows/the-global-election/4/\"><strong>The Global Election</strong></a>. Presented by Steve Bloomfield, this half-hour weekly programme brings in high-level experts on foreign policy, international terrorism, City finance, Europe and China to discuss what might happen in countries that are not the US after the US election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We listeners are like the waiters at a grownup dinner party, earwigging on the high-end conversations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once you\u2019ve got over the weird disconnect of hearing well-informed people offer considered views on Donald Trump and what his presidency might entail, this is really interesting. (It is strange at first, like having a professor of logic analyse the rantings of an angry toddler.) In the most recent episode, Chris Phillips, former head of the UK\u2019s counter-terrorism office, points out that Trump is aiding Isis \u2013 playing into their hands \u2013 by trying to split the US along racial and religious lines. In the show on Europe, there are a few really fascinating points about how Trump\u2019s admiration for Putin means that the Baltic states are suspicious of him, but also how his (US) nationalism chimes with many of them, too.</p> <p>In the same episode, Yanis Varoufakis (Greece\u2019s ex-finance minister) compares Trump to Mussolini, but he also calls Clinton a \u201cthoroughly dangerous prospect for geopolitical peace\u201d. And all this is done with impeccable politesse. We listeners are like the waiters at a grownup dinner party, earwigging on the high-end conversations.</p> <p>As a side point, it was <a href=\"https://monocle.com/radio/\">Monocle radio</a>\u2019s fifth birthday last week, so congrats and bumps and happy birthday etc. The shows on Monocle \u2013 there are loads, covering urban living, culture, finance, news \u2013 have always been of an immensely high standard. They\u2019re like the magazine: clever, international, but also a teensy bit smug and sans jokes. Lovely antidotes to the ramblings of unprepared podcast \u201cpersonalities\u201d.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another Trump-ish podcast. <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/whoisneil\"><strong>#WhoisNeil</strong></a> is an odd story. About eight months ago, computer coder Nathan Bernard started wondering why and how a tweeter called Neil Turner was always the first to comment on Donald Trump\u2019s tweets.</p> <p>Was Turner a Trump-bot? Kind of. He turned out to be a real person who uses a computer program to make sure his replies were first. Bernard found all this out and created his own bot to respond first to \u201cNeil\u201d whenever he tweeted. Then Bernard started talking to \u201cNeil\u201d on social media. And then he made a podcast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"39cd58db86d4728e2b28d9a2b83cee7a0185dbb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39cd58db86d4728e2b28d9a2b83cee7a0185dbb7/0_0_1338_1672/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rich Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Always a delight\u2019: Rich Hall on the US election trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Parker/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight episodes in and the podcast is\u2026 OK. Not brilliant. Bernard speaks slowly, without much dynamism and he\u2019s not the world\u2019s best storyteller. The use of music is odd and there is much techy chat that leaves me cold. It gets better when Bernard starts delving into the alt-right movement. God, they are odd, these people, blethering on about how \u201cthe US is supposed to be whites only\u201d and other vile rubbish. There is interesting stuff here, but listening makes you long for a presenter like Jon Ronson or Louis Theroux.</p> <p>And on Wednesday, comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rich-hall\">Rich Hall</a> began his new series, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b080z2zd/broadcasts/upcoming\"><strong>Rich Hall\u2019s (US Election) Breakdown</strong></a>. I could listen to Hall for ever. His laconic, hilarious intelligence and beautiful use of language is always a delight. And this standup show, recorded in front of an audience in Washington DC, didn\u2019t disappoint. He dealt his blows even-handedly.

  "<p>Theresa May has been accused of \u201craiding the budgets\u201d set aside by local authorities to help disadvantaged children in order to fund the government\u2019s manifesto pledge to double the amount of free childcare for working families.</p> <p>Local authorities currently receive government funds for 15 hours of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds. This will increase to 30 hours from next September.</p> <p>Under the present system, local authorities have been able to pay extra cash to schools with nurseries from that budget because they employ qualified teachers and are disproportionately used by poorer families. They have also been able to set aside extra funds to ensure children from the most disadvantaged families get more than 15 free hours.</p> <p>However, local authorities will now no longer be able to offer additional funding above a set hourly rate per child, it is claimed. Instead, there will be a requirement to pass on 95% of centrally provided funds directly to childcare providers. Those affected by the new policy will include 17 local authorities that now offer some of their families extra hours, including Wandsworth, Redcar, Surrey and Nottingham.</p> <p>The new offer of 30 hours of free childcare, which was part of the Conservative manifesto at the general election, is available only to working families, so any child from an unemployed family currently getting more than 15 hours will lose that extra support. About 80% of three-year-olds from the most disadvantaged areas currently attend childcare with a qualified teacher or early years professional.</p> <p>By preventing local authorities from paying \u201cquality supplements\u201d it is likely that schools will either need to reallocate funds from the main school budget or relegate the status of their school nursery.</p> <p>Dr Kitty Stewart, associate professor of social policy at the London School of Economics, said the policy threatened to move cash away from disadvantaged children to pay for the childcare costs of better-off families. \u201cThe significance of these restrictions cannot be overstated,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s that they are desperately trying to deliver the 30 hours of free childcare pledge. They need more money, otherwise they can\u2019t provide it, and are having to raid the budgets that are currently going to non-working families or those who are disadvantaged.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy PowellMP, chairwoman of the all-party group on nursery schools and nursery classes, said: \u201cInvesting in early years is not just about childcare for working parents, important as that is. It\u2019s also critical to closing the education inequality gap that can already be very wide before children arrive at school.\u201d A DfE spokesman said councils could still offer additional cash to child care providers from their wider budget. He said extra support for disadvantaged families was provided through universal credit and the pupil premium.</p>",
