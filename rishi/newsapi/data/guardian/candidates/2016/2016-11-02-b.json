  "<p>Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has called for the government to halve the migration intake and reconsider the refugee intake or face the further rise of anti-establishment parties including One Nation.</p> <p>Speaking from New York where he is on secondment to the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/02/australian-senators-cory-bernardi-and-malcolm-roberts-pledge-support-for-donald-trump\">Bernardi reiterated his support for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>, praising his populist anti-immigration policies.</p> <p>Bernardi told Sky News he had warned of the rise of anti-establishment parties for years and said it was reflected in Australia by the rise of One Nation and, before that, the Palmer United party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Economic difficulties around the globe \u201cgive rise to strong leaders that promise to change the system\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, told 2SM Radio on Thursday he thought Clinton would win but he was not sure now polls had tightened. He suggested the FBI\u2019s release of an email revealing it had found further emails relating to Clinton\u2019s private server was not useful.</p> <p>Bernardi said the election was \u201ca referendum on Hillary Clinton\u201d and that whatever flaws and failings Trump had, voters were \u201ctired of the status quo\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor every flaw that Donald Trump\u2019s got, I think you can magnify for Hillary by two.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bernardi said Trump was the only candidate discussing policy, nominating immigration, tax reform, term limits for politicians and \u201cfixing Obamacare\u201d as his strengths.</p> <p>Bernardi claimed he was \u201cnot a cheerleader for Donald Trump\u201d, and noted he had backed Ted Cruz to be the Republican nominee because he was a constitutional conservative.</p> <p>\u201cBut when you compare the two candidates, I think Donald Trump has more opportunity and a better chance to fix what\u2019s wrong with America, and the American political system than Hillary Clinton does.\u201d</p> <p>Bernardi said he believed \u201canyone other than Hillary Clinton would clean up in this contest\u201d.

  "<p>A former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/10/iran-prisoners-abuse-jail\">prosecutor general of Tehran</a> described by activists as a serial human rights abuser has been sentenced to 135 lashes for financial corruption.

He was linked to the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/05/iran.worlddispatch\">who died in Evin prison in 2003</a>. <br></p> <p>Tara Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said Mortazavi was linked with \u201cthe most flagrant human rights abuses committed in recent years\u201d, including \u201ccredible allegations of torture and deaths of protesters detained in the crackdown following the 2009 presidential election\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhile this verdict shows that figures such as Mortazavi are not immune from prosecution for ever, justice should first and foremost prioritise addressing his role in Iran\u2019s darkest recent history,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, he also should be treated humanely, something that was denied to Iranians during his time as a prosecutor, and not be subjected to corporal punishment or other inhuman treatment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/nov/02/iran-new-wave-repression-says-akbar-ganji\">Iranian writer Akbar Ganji</a>, a victim of Mortazavi\u2019s targeting of journalists, told the Guardian the sentencing was a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. \u201cIt means that he is not being punished. It is not surprising \u2013 one could not expect anything else from the Iranian judiciary. Mortazavi is protected by the most powerful people in Iran. He acted on their orders,\u201d Ganji said.<br></p> <p>Mortazavi came under scrutiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/10/iran-prisoners-abuse-jail\">from the Iranian parliament</a> and judiciary soon after allegations surfaced about his role in the deaths of protesters imprisoned at the Kahrizak detention centre. Mortazavi has since been acquitted of charges relating to this. <br></p> <p>Hadi Ghaemi, of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \u201cThis sentence is yet another example of rampant impunity in Iran. No justice is being delivered here, given the extent of graft and corruption committed by Mortazavi, and his involvement in the torture and deaths of protesters in custody in 2009. Also, sentencing him to flogging, if meant to demonstrate a serious punishment, is just physical barbarity that does nothing to hold him accountable in any meaningful way.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmadinejad went to great lengths to protect Mortazavi after the Kahrizak scandal, appointing him head of Iran\u2019s social security organisation, which provides insurance to many government and private employees. <br></p> <p>In 2013, Mortazavi\u2019s name was mentioned in the Iranian parliament in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-ayatollah-ali-khamenei\">hugely embarrassing public row</a> between Ahmadinejad and the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani.

The statement comments that \u201dthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u201d while adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the line that it wants to \u201cwait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u201d. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.</p> <p>Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news.

When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time.

Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 are down 2-3%. </p> <p>There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56.</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0f8ee4b029b92ca44c77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:12:51.686Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar continues to weaken against the pound.</p> <p>Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high.</p> <p>The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at \u20ac1.1078.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0bc3e4b07ceadb3a1abb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:52:41.324Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with oil:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Back to Algiers<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brent?src=hash\">#Brent</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTI?src=hash\">#WTI</a> crude <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oil?src=hash\">#oil</a> have now lost all gains made after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a> agreed output limits with other producers Sept 28<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OOTT?src=hash\">#OOTT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xb3NZzdBKN\">pic.twitter.com/xb3NZzdBKN</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Johnson (@chris1reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">November 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a09fae4b07ceadb3a1aae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:48:40.140Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries.</strong></p> <p>The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.</p> <p>Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.</p> <p>However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u2019s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u201cshock\u201d from the Fed later on today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5819fcc5e4b029b92ca44c01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T14:48:42.158Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/793825218724782080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">$50 fading fast.

  "<p>When I read the headline \u201cBono named as one of Glamour\u2019s women of the year\u201d I wondered if it was a joke. Women often wonder about jokes as we rarely understand them. Laughing at anything is also illegal if you are a feminist (but tittering isn\u2019t, so I had a titter). Bono is apparently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37845314\">Glamour\u2019s first male woman of the year</a>. In these days of gender fluidity, this is the smallest of details. But guys, really?</p> <p>The decision to give poor old Bongo an award \u2013 ever since I heard Dr John Cooper Clarke call him that, I have been unable to think of him as anything but Bongo \u2013 is apparently some sort of stab at equality. Awards ceremonies of all kinds have become increasingly unhinged and self- adulatory. Everyone must have prizes, and hopefully goodie bags. too. Everyone must make forgettable speeches and be papped on the red carpet. No one ever really knows who else won or why. It\u2019s all an absolute nonsense unless you win something yourself, in which case you step inside the madness by saying it\u2019s a judgment of one\u2019s peers.</p> <p>Bono\u2019s peers have given him all sorts: from a knighthood (honorary knight commander of the British empire) to a Philadelphia liberty medal, but according to the doublethink of Glamour\u2019s editor-in-chief Cindi Leive, giving awards to actual women at the actual women of the year ceremony \u201cmight be an outdated way of looking at things. There are so many men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, men doing things for women! It\u2019s what the struggle has been all about. Give that man a round of applause for <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/dads-caring-for-their-kids-its-parenting-not-babysitting/267443/\">\u201cbabysitting\u201d his own children</a>. A medal and a paper hat for any man who thinks things should be better for girls! I don\u2019t doubt Bono has done loads of charity work that he does like to talk about: the <a href=\"https://www.one.org/us/take-action/poverty-is-sexist/\">Poverty is Sexist campaign</a>; the work around girls\u2019 education and HIV, for instance. He is described on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono\">his Wikipedia page</a> not only as a rock star but as a philanthropist and venture capitalist. There is, though, controversy both about some of his work in Africa and his band\u2019s tax arrangements. U2 have been criticised for avoiding their full share of tax by channelling some of their income to a finance house in the Netherlands. Since Bono has been vocal about big companies such as ExxonMobil not being transparent about their taxes, with many African economies suffering as a result, this seems a tad hypocritical. But let that go. A lot of people are hypocritical about U2 because they used to like them and now it is not cool to do so.</p> <p>Bono has basically irritated everyone by hanging out with popes and presidents but maybe his heart is in the right place even if his taxes are not. Maybe he could be offered a daft award and do the right thing: decline to line up with the likes of US Olympic gymnast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/simone-biles\">Simone Biles;</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/10/iraqi-activist-nadia-murad-wins-human-rights-prize-for-yazidi-campaign\">Nadia Murad</a>, the Yazidi woman who got away from Isis; or Emily Doe, the student who was raped by Brock Turner and wrote a shattering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/campus-sexual-assault-university-colorado-austin-wilkerson\">letter</a> about her experience. He could have politely declined but carried on his work on HIV, as so many of his colleagues do. He could have said that poverty is a key feminist issue and passed the prize on to one of the many brilliant female campaigners. But no, he said he is very grateful because this is a chance to say: \u201cThe battle for gender equality can\u2019t be won unless men lead it along with women.\u201d</p> <p>Of course! This must be where women have gone so badly wrong. We need more men to show us how to do feminism properly. Bono is not alone in this patronising attitude. Most of the male voices on the left continue to see gender as some kind of afterthought and are not interested in the bodily politics of flesh and blood and women. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/21/wonder-woman-un-ambassador-staff-protest\">new UN ambassador for women is Wonder Woman</a>, a bleedin\u2019 cartoon. Everyone fell over themselves to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/caitlyn-jenner\">Caitlyn Jenner</a>\u2019s womanhood, ignoring her <a href=\"http://time.com/4268422/caitlyn-jenners-politics/\">dubious politics</a>. The misogyny around Hillary Clinton is unmissable. The one bit of sexual politics that the \u201cradicals\u201d embrace is often a denial of biological difference. Yet some of the most hard-won campaigns have been around rape, FGM, sexual violence, childbirth and HIV, where women\u2019s experience is absolutely embodied.</p> <p>Alongside this strange disappearance of womenhood has been the rolling back of tokenism: the assumption that everything is already a level playing field. Where many used to feel a public discussion should involve more than just white men, we are back to a position where it is now permissible to have all-male panels and comedy shows. Formats in which men thrive are too often seen as the only way to do things. This is a very simple and easy thing for men to address. When asked to take part in something, ask who else is involved. Ask who you will sit beside.</p> <p>Otherwise, we go full circle, into hilarious gong-giving stupidity. Why bother with actual women when you can have a cartoon to represent us, or a man? Because however extraordinary a man Bono may be, he is not a leader I will follow.</p>",

It\u2019s no wonder his poll numbers have steadily declined since he\u2019s hit the trail.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Green party candidate Jill Stein \u2013 an alternative to the alternative. \u201cI will have trouble sleeping at night if Donald Trump is elected,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/17/politics/jill-stein-ajamu-baraka-green-party-town-hall/\">Stein said</a> earlier this cycle at a CNN town hall. \u201cI will also have trouble sleeping at night if Hillary Clinton is elected. And as despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling.\u201d</p> <p>But a cursory look at <a href=\"http://www.jill2016.com/platform\">Stein\u2019s platform</a> reveals she\u2019s living in an alternative universe from most American voters. While most voters fear the growth of Isis, she\u2019s calling for cutting military spending by 50% along with closing more than 700 US military bases abroad. This may be why her longshot bid keeps her hovering at around the 2% mark in national polls.</p> <p>In Utah and 11 other states, voters will see Evan McMullin on their ballots. The former CIA operative and Republican congressional staffer is taking advantage of Trump\u2019s repugnance to many Mormons and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/evan-mcmullin-independent-election-230615\">is angling to win just one state</a> in order to have his name thrust before the all-important electoral college. </p> <p>McMullin makes sense for many Utah voters who say their faith prohibits them from supporting either Trump or Clinton. But barring deep religious conviction, in other states the notion of casting a protest vote is just too dangerous in this cycle.</p> <p>The Grand Ole Party is having a grand ole food fight for all to see. The Tea Party wing of the party has morphed into a Trump-fueled alt-right populist movement that <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/the-voice-in-donald-trumps-head-austins-alex-jones/nst9F/\">trusts Alex Jones conspiracy theories</a> more than facts and data. And Trump himself has even lashed out at the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and other congressional Republicans in recent weeks.</p> <p>But in a sign of the times for the GOP, Ryan <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/donald-trump-gop-hillary-clinton.html\">abandoned Trump</a> last month only to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-votes-donald-trump-house-freedom-caucus-2016-11\">cast his vote for him</a> this week. It\u2019s that kind of unprincipled, even feckless, leadership from the Republican party that led to the rise of the misogynistic and racist Donald Trump. Republican leaders have stoked fear in their base since President Obama was elected and now they have lost control of their own narrative and voters.</p> <p>That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t the year to mess with a third-party vote \u2013 since no third-party candidate is going to win, all those votes might do is prevent a Clinton victory, putting the GOP meltdown front and center in global governance. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/us-election-green-party-jill-stein\">Don't settle for the lesser of two evils in this election.

Clearly given the importance of Anglo-Irish relations, the border with Northern Ireland, the billions in trade across the Irish Sea, the government in Dublin is worried about the prospect of a fresh diplomatic war breaking between the EU and the UK whenever Theresa May triggers article 50.</p> <p>Another significant part of the Taoiseach\u2019s contribution today during the all-island summit on Brexit in Dublin was Kenny suggesting that his British counterpart might press the exit button before the spring. Was Kenny hinting that pressure to get to an earlier Brexit from within the Tory Party was pushing the UK out the EU door before the Spring of 2017? Or indeed was the Irish premier sending a warning signal to London about the perils of doing so without negotiations having been properly started and exit strategies properly thought out?</p> <p>The main absentees from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, a former military hospital and now the museum of modern art in Ireland, were the unionists. Neither the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionists or the pro-remain Ulster Unionists attended. Both parties have argued that today\u2019s conference went beyond the remit of the agreements that established devolution, power sharing and north-south bodies under the island of Ireland: the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the 2006 St Andrews Agreement. In a sense they are right because the main business between all the political traditions on the island regarding Brexit will be done at the next North-South ministerial council, which will take place on 18 November in Armagh city. </p> <p>Away from the rhetoric there appears to be a willingness between unionism and nationalism to hatch a pragmatic deal that will not destabilise peace or plunge the island economy into the abyss. This cross-border body was established under the Good Friday peace deal and brings together ministers from Dublin to Belfast to discuss all island matters. Which obviously would include how do both states on the island cope with Brexit.</p> <p>Another important meeting takes place next week in Downing Street when Theresa May again invites the leaders of the devolved parliaments in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff to Number 10 to discuss Brexit negotiations and plans ahead to deal with the 26 EU states.</p> <p>Today\u2019s conference now seems to have been a means by which Dublin sent out two messages to London and the other EU capitals. It was a warning to Britain that exit-talks with Ireland\u2019s European partners are going to be messy and perhaps even a little brutal. To their fellow Europeans, Kenny\u2019s suggestion that the other EU states should not get obsessed over what Britain gets is also a warning that if other countries start to issue specific demands of their own as pay-off to London then the entire European project could be put in peril. In both scenarios the entire political establishment in Dublin acknowledges Ireland has a lot to lose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723/0_162_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0e5be4b07ceadb3a1ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:04:45.970Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing has adjourned for at least 15 minutes because the MPs have to take part in a vote.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0cb2e4b029b92ca44c69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:57:43.054Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chilcot says the cabinet should have received formal written advice from the attorney general about whether the war was legal.

It is probably fair to say that a British politician can never go wrong whacking Fifa - with left or right, tabloid or broadsheet - and May milked this for all it was worth. It was an easy hit, but you can\u2019t blame her for taking it.</p> <p>Should Jeremy Corbyn have asked about Fifa? If Alastair Campbell was in charge of his PMQs planning, doubtless it would have been question number one. But this is not Corbyn\u2019s style and, if he had tried to set himself up as a Fifa-bashing poppy patriot, it would probably have sounded phoney.</p> <p>Instead Corbyn focused on welfare, highlighting cuts to universal credit, benefit sanctions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/benefit-sanctions-food-banks-oxford-university-study\"> the research showing their link to increased demand for food banks</a> and Ken Loach\u2019s film, I, Daniel Blake. Some of his questions were quite effective, but others, less so. (For example, given that he was asking about universal credit, why didn\u2019t Corbyn point out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/28/iain-duncan-smith-challenge-theresa-may-universal-credit-cuts\">even Iain Duncan Smith wants these cuts to be reversed?) </a></p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s best moment was probably when, referring to sanctions, he urged May to stop \u201cthis institutionalised barbarity against often very vulnerable people\u201d. But May seemed comfortable with Corbyn\u2019s questions because she was able to condemn Labour\u2019s stance on welfare. She told the Labour leader:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have a view that there should be no assessments, no sanctions and unlimited welfare. I have to say to you that the Labour party is drifting away from the views of Labour voters. It\u2019s this party that understands working-class people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The moment Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader probably became inevitable in 2015 was when he was the only candidate to vote against the welfare bill. The other three candidates abstained on the bill, which included welfare cuts, in line with the Labour whip. But abstention was Labour\u2019s official position because Harriet Harman, the acting leader, took the view that being seen as soft on welfare spending had contributed to the party\u2019s election defeat. PMQs today confirmed that Corbyn does not accept this view, but it remains to be seen whether he has found a way of selling Labour welfarism to the electorate. May sounded like someone who thinks that he hasn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5afng\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2865607\"            data-video-name=\"May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5819f826e4b0d073c27d0b04\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\">May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:37:04.209Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819e361e4b029b92ca44b61\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:02:20.448Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May tells Fifa to 'sort their own house out' before giving orders to UK over poppies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on football\u2019s governing body Fifa, which has turned down a request from England and Scotland players to wear armbands featuring poppies when the sides meet on Remembrance Day.</p> <p>Speaking at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, May said the stance taken by Fifa was \u201cutterly outrageous\u201d and said the strength of feeling across the House of Commons was clear.</p> <p>\u201cOur football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Her response was prompted by a question from Steve McCabe, Labour\u2019s MP for Birmingham Selly Oak who was born in Inverclyde. \u201cWill she tell the respective associations [England and Scotland] that in this country, we decide when to wear poppies and they\u2019ll be wearing them at Wembley?\u201d</p> <p>May said the decision should lie with the respective associations but said \u201ca clear message is going from this House.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa, has been mired in a long-running corruption scandal, should be more concerned with its own affairs, May went on. \u201cI should say to Fifa before they start telling us what to do they jolly well ought to sort their own house out.\u201d</p> <p>The footballing body normally bans any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts.

Corbyn used all six questions to ask about welfare, but he moved from one topic to another, with varying success. May was at her weakest at the start, when Corbyn asked about cuts to universal credit which are coming down the line, which will effectively undo the tax credit cuts U-turn announced by George Osborne, but these calculations are complex, and hard to explain, and although May did not address the point at all, Corbyn did not drive his point hard home. He was more passionate, and effective, on benefit sanctions, but at this point May may had a solid response which involved accusing Labour of being opposed to any form of sanction or fiscal discipline in welfare spending. Corbyn finished with a dignified plea on behalf of parents who had difficulty affording funeral costs for children who die, and this prompted a semi-consensual response from May, who said funding was already available. So, overall, a bit of a draw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgxEglC73aA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MgxEglC73aA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:16:40.063Z\">at 1.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819d814e4b029b92ca44b1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T12:15:03.482Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says the housing benefit bill is going up.

  "<p>The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appears to be getting even closer with just six days left before the election. An <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average of six different polls</a> shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But there\u2019s still a lot of variation \u2013 one poll finds that Clinton is three points ahead, another finds that she is six points <em>behind </em>Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to Clinton\u2019s emails, before which her lead was already shrinking. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nevada-voters-women\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aj3x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2867968\"            data-video-name=\"Nevada's women stand divided over Trump and Clinton on eve of election \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581aee5ae4b029b92ca45061\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/03/161026Awbwvegasv2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/03/161026Awbwvegasv2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/03/161026Awbwvegasv2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nevada-voters-women\">Nevada\u2019s women stand divided over Trump and Clinton on eve of election</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That variation between polls isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, includes one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">19-year-old black male</a> respondent who consistently said he\u2019ll vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">weighting</a> (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters). </p> <p>So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? Historically, the answer is \u201cnot bad\u201d, although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton\u2019s email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an \u201c<a href=\"http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/\">October surprise</a>\u201d, a last-minute news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html\">which have included Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 2000</a> \u2013 typically don\u2019t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the morning of with the final voting outcome. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e48888fd374a891b6e8016e12c159f33c62a32a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e48888fd374a891b6e8016e12c159f33c62a32a/0_0_640_373/500.jpg\" alt=\"ABC polls\u2019 past success\" width=\"500\" height=\"291\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ABC polls one week before the election v the result.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn\u2019t just ABC and the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win \u2013 polling averages also showed the Republican <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/\">three points</a> ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular vote, that\u2019s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=2000\">48.4%-47.9%</a>. Bush ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in his favour \u2013 he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are needed to win). </p> <p>The map looks a little more daunting for the 2016 Republican candidate, though. Even if Trump can win <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_trump_vs_clinton-5634.html\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5981.html\">Iowa</a> (three important states where he is in a close race with Clinton), <em>and </em>all the other states where he is leading (including those where it\u2019s close), he would still need to secure at least one state with a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">decent number</a> of electoral college votes like <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/va/virginia_trump_vs_clinton-5542.html\">Virginia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">Pennsylvania</a> or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_clinton-5533.html\">Michigan</a>. But Clinton is ahead in all three of those states by a pretty safe margin of five to seven points. </p> <p>The Trump campaign may take solace in the fact that history might not be a great guide in this election. The accuracy of polling is now in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">doubt</a>. More importantly, in this election, Americans are faced with a choice between two of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">most disliked</a> presidential candidates in living memory, where media reporting on polling data is continually shaping their choices. If would-be Democratic voters think a Clinton win is inevitable, or dislike both candidates in equal measure, they might just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">stay at home</a>. And if there are enough of those voters in the right states, Trump could still become the 45th president of the US. </p>",

According to a CNN a focus group, this moment was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07nb_lqF2d4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;app=desktop\">most favored</a> of the entire debate. That is because seven out of 10 Americans support Roe v Wade, and a majority of voters, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/abortion-poll-hyde-amendment-230349\">half of Trump supporters</a>, agree that Planned Parenthood shouldn\u2019t be defunded. And yet, reproductive health is not only on the line but on the ballot this election. </p> <p>For those millions who continue to believe women should have the right to make their own healthcare decisions, Hillary Clinton is the best \u2013 and only \u2013 choice. She not only trusts women to make their own decisions; she will stand up to politicians who try to take those decisions away from them. She has been a fierce supporter her entire career and we know, with her in the White House, reproductive rights advocates will have an important ally on their side.</p> <p>Bold leadership from activists, health advocates and others brought us this far - 100 years after Planned Parenthood started, women have made enormous progress. We\u2019ve won the right to use birth control, to safe and legal abortion. We are half the workforce, half of college students and doctoral students. And we will not go back. </p> <p>Today, we need that kind of bold leadership in the White House to make the progress of the last 100 years a reality for all and continue to build on it.</p> <p>Because the reality is that access to birth control, cancer screenings and abortion is not equal in this country. Eighty-seven percent of counties in the United States do not have an abortion provider. </p> <p>In 2016, black and Latina women continue to face enormous systemic barriers to reproductive healthcare, resulting in higher rates of death from breast and cervical cancer and higher rates of uninsurance.</p> <p>Many immigrants are excluded from healthcare coverage or face other hurdles to getting care for themselves and their families. And LGBTQ communities face major barriers to access to reproductive healthcare, from lack of culturally competent training of providers to meet their healthcare needs to outright discrimination.</p> <p>There are steps we can take to level the playing field for those left behind by uneven progress. Right now the discriminatory <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/hyde-amendment\">Hyde amendment</a> forces women who rely on Medicaid to pay out of pocket for abortion, a financial hurdle that makes their right to safe and legal abortion meaningless. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton will work to overturn it. Because she understands the experiences of women, she\u2019s committed to building on the progress of the Affordable Care Act, which covers preventive care for women, maternity care, and bans insurance companies from charging women more for the same coverage as men. She has plans for expanding <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/\">access to care</a>, especially where it\u2019s needed most, for ending HIV/Aids, for women\u2019s health, and more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-insult-hillary-clinton\">'Nasty woman' is an insult we know all too well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership because politicians like Donald Trump and Mike Pence do not trust women to make their own healthcare decisions. They have promised over and over to drag reproductive rights back decades by punishing women who get abortions and appointing justices to overturn Roe v Wade. They want to block access to birth control and cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood, and undo the progress toward equality for women\u2019s health under the Affordable Care Act by repealing it. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Trump and Pence\u2019s attitude toward women is not a rarity in politics. In race after race this cycle, we have seen candidates pretending to embrace policies that support women while voting repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood and restricting access to birth control. And in many states, including my home state of Texas, anti-women\u2019s health politicians hold the majority. In the first half of 2016 alone, these politicians introduced <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2016/07/laws-affecting-reproductive-health-and-rights-state-trends-midyear-2016\">445 provisions</a> to restrict access to safe and legal abortion. </p> <p>Deciding when and whether to have children is one of the most important decisions anyone makes in their lifetime, and it\u2019s not the government\u2019s role to interfere.</p> <p>The week she clinched the nomination, Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://time.com/4364631/hillary-clinton-planned-parenthood-speech-transcript/\">spoke</a> to Planned Parenthood Action Fund members, saying, \u201cLife is freer, fairer, healthier, safer, and far more humane when women are empowered to make their own reproductive health decisions.\u201d</p> <p>She knows this from her own life, as a woman, mother and grandmother, and she has made it one of the central themes of her career as a public servant. She made it clear as first lady when she traveled to Beijing, against the advice of those who told her it would rock the boat, with the message \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights, once and for all\u201d.</p> <p>She put it into action as secretary of state, prioritizing education, health and opportunity for women and girls. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton is the fiercest champion for women and reproductive rights to ever be within reach of the presidency. For her, these are not fringe issues \u2013 for women, they touch every aspect of our lives. </p> <p>This election is a choice between someone who will divide and insult us, and set us back decades in ensuring equality and economic security for ourselves and our families, or someone who has set a new precedent for bold leadership on behalf of women\u2019s health and rights. </p> <p>There is no contest. There is only one choice. We need Hillary Clinton in the White House.</p>",

  "<p>With the presidential election one week away, a handful of Republicans are already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by Hillary Clinton should she be elected.</p> <p>At least three Republican senators have voiced support for indefinitely blocking Clinton from filling the supreme court vacancy left by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/antonin-scalia-dead-us-supreme-court-justice-obituary\">the late justice Antonin Scalia</a>, thus breaking with a 150-year precedent for having nine justices serving on the nation\u2019s highest bench.</p> <p>Senators Ted Cruz, of Texas; John McCain, of Arizona; and Richard Burr, of North Carolina have all suggested leaving Scalia\u2019s seat open if Clinton reaches the White House. Cruz, in particular, argued there was a \u201clong historical precedent\u201d for having fewer than nine justices on the supreme court.</p> <p>Senate Republican leaders have yet to hold a hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\">was nominated by Barack Obama to replace Scalia in March</a>. Republicans justified their refusal to move forward on the Garland nomination by saying the next president should fill the vacancy. But as Donald Trump\u2019s path to the White House narrows, a potential split is emerging within the party ranks on how to proceed when Congress returns after the election for a lame duck session.</p> <p>Florida senator Marco Rubio, for example, was not willing to go as far as Cruz and his other colleagues when asked by the Guardian if he supported an indefinite blockade under a prospective Clinton presidency.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that we should do that if they propose nominees that are good,\u201d Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, said in an interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go and predispose them that way.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio\u2019s response came with the caveat, however, that he found it unlikely Clinton would nominate an individual who shared his view of the role of the court.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s someone good who understands that their job is to apply the constitution, according to its original intent, then that will be a welcome surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut barring whether it\u2019s Republican or a Democrat, if they appoint someone who I believe doesn\u2019t meet that standard I\u2019ll oppose that nominee.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio, facing a tighter than expected re-election battle in Florida, has not met with Garland and has expressed his opposition to Obama\u2019s nomination.</p> <p>Burr, who is locked in a dead heat for his own re-election in North Carolina, made a far more declarative statement on how he would treat a supreme court nominee under Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cIf Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the supreme court,\u201d Burr told Republican volunteers in a private meeting, according to leaked audio <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/richard-burr-hillary-clinton-gun-owners/index.html\">first reported by CNN</a>.</p> <p>McCain, another vulnerable incumbent Republican, similarly vowed to oppose any nominee under Clinton last month, stating in a radio show interview: \u201cI promise you that we will be united against any supreme court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up.

Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said such an approach was \u201cthe same kind of dysfunction that has infected Washington for the last six years\u201d.</p> <p>Public opinion of the supreme court reveals a fairly even ideological split in its favorability and how it should interpret the constitution. But a majority of the American public has expressed <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/26/5-facts-about-the-supreme-court/\">disagreement</a> with the decision by Republicans to not hold a hearing on Garland\u2019s nomination.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t after you,\u201d wrote Joseph Heller in the novel Catch 22. But it is doubtful he envisaged that algorithms used by search engines, social media platforms and websites would be after you to \u2018personalise your experience\u2019. Consequently, perhaps, personalisation and privacy have taken a new direction with the shift to messaging as the go-to communication platform.</p> <p>Search and social media platforms derive their income from advertising, so it makes sense for them to tailor what users see. Facebook\u2019s presentation at the <a href=\"https://theaisummit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Summit</a> in San Francisco explained how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to personalise the pages of each of its 1.7 billion users. </p> <p>How accurate \u2013 or intrusive \u2013 this is will be determined by our online activity. Connected devices and location data add context; Google\u2019s DoubleClick (which develops internet ad serving systems) take this further by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/how-to-disable-google-ad-tracking-gmail-youtube-browser-history\">combining personally identifiable information from Gmail</a> with browsing data.</p> <h2>Slaves to the algorithm</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/slaves-to-algorithm-machine-learning-hidden-bias\">Machine learning: why we mustn\u2019t be slaves to the algorithm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have little or no control over the multiplicity of algorithms using our data, particularly as more devices become connected.

Tailoring content to user preferences potentially compromises online research. Search engines and ad networks are fingerprinting devices in real time, so it is impossible to know how neutral your search results are. And because search results are based on browsing history, we are less likely to see something new. Added to this is the platforms\u2019 own bias. The past few weeks have seen reports of Facebook\u2019s selective news curation and <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/us/201609121045214398-google-clinton-manipulation-election/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google\u2019s perceived political bias</a> towards Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy.</p> <p>Josh Sutton, global head of data and AI at Publicis Sapient, believes that transparency is the key as it enables people to make a well-informed judgement call. \u201cTrust is enabled by transparency\u201d he explains. \u201cThere has been an implicit bias in our communications since the invention of the printing press, and we accepted this because we could assess the people who were creating and curating content. I believe that a similar opportunity must be provided in the age of machine learning by enabling people to understand the sources of the algorithms and the training data that powers them.\u201d</p> <p>But we cannot blame the personalisation phenomenon entirely on algorithms. It is also a conscious choice. As social media has matured \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/twitters-woes-signal-end-social-wars/?mbid=nl_101116_p2&amp;CNDID=43693487\" rel=\"nofollow\">and perhaps peaked</a> \u2013 we have become adept at blocking what we don\u2019t want to see \u2013 or don\u2019t agree with. Elections and referendums have seen social media users divide into tribes rather than engage in political debate.</p> <h2>A new kind of privacy</h2> <p>While voice is the obvious interface for human-machine conversation, with chatbots on many websites and virtual assistants on multiple devices \u2013 human-to-human conversation has shifted to messaging platforms. Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc allow us to have rapid, private interactions with selected parties. </p> <p>This is a new kind of privacy because we don\u2019t know the extent to which the platform can read or understand our messages. WhatsApp, a secure messaging system with end-to-end encryption, still includes in its terms the option of sharing our account information with Facebook to improve ads and product experiences.</p> <p>In 2015 mobile messaging platforms <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/messaging-apps-have-completely-overtaken-social-networks-to-become-the-dominant-platforms-on-phones-2015-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">overtook</a> social networking platforms in terms of monthly active users (MAU). This has not been lost on investors \u2013 or advertisers. eMarketer forecasts that Snapchat will generate $367m (\u00a3300m) in advertising revenue this year, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Snapchat-Ad-Revenues-Reach-Nearly-1-Billion-Next-Year/1014437\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising 155% to $936m</a> in 2017.</p> <p>A large part of the appeal of messaging is that it\u2019s \u201cfriction free\u201d \u2013 WhatsApp\u2019s brand promise is \u201cno ads, no games and no gimmicks\u201d. So how do brands join the conversation?</p> <p>\u201cThe responsibility of brands is changing,\u201d says Sutton. \u201cHistorically, the goal of advertising was to make people aware of a product and its merits.

  "<p>My how far we\u2019ve come in less than eight years. We have seen happen what those of us in the climate and energy fields knew could happen. The US has become a world leader on climate change, dramatically increased our production of clean and renewable fuels, reduced our emissions of greenhouse gases, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">signed major international agreements</a> to continue progress into the future, and have done so without cost increases or power disruptions that the denial community proclaimed would occur.</p> <p>As we in the United States get ready to elect a new president, it is helpful to think about the impact a president can have. Particularly since we transitioned from the worst climate president ever (Bush) to the best (Obama). I am going to detail what I think are Obama\u2019s signature accomplishments.</p> <p>In my mind, the most important part of President Obama\u2019s legacy on climate is that he changed the conversation. He showed that not only should the US play a role in reducing emissions, but we can do just that. He showed that this problem isn\u2019t too big to solve. In fact, most of the solutions are subtle enough that we don\u2019t even notice them. He showed that we can change our future for the better.</p> <p>With respect to specific actions, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jun/25/climate-change-carbon-emissions-president-obama-epa\">Clean Power Plan</a> is one of his biggest accomplishments. By working with the EPA, he created the first ever carbon pollution standards for the largest source of pollution \u2013 power plants. He did this in the midst of a do-nothing congress that fought him every step of the way.</p> <p>Under his presidency, we made huge investments in clean energy, which are paying off already. Jump starts to the wind and solar industry have led to enormous cost decreases \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/03/doe-charts-show-why-climate-doom-and-gloom-isnt-needed\">dirty energy isn\u2019t cheaper anymore</a>. It is really astonishing \u2013 wind power has tripled and solar power has increased by 30 times since he took office. <br></p> <p>Under his presidency, we improved standards for fuel economy of our vehicles, which not only reduces pollution but also saves money. Furthermore, Obama set targets to reduce the federal government\u2019s emissions by nearly 20% by 2025. He has worked to reduce other types of greenhouse gases such as methane and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\">hydrofluorocarbons</a>, not only within the US but through international agreements.</p> <p>And those aren\u2019t the only international efforts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/nov/14/fact-check-china-pledged-bigger-climate-action-republican-leaders-wrong\">Obama made a joint plan with China</a> that is almost unbelievably ambitious. It will reduce our emissions by approximately 27% by 2025 and puts major limits on Chinese emissions as well. He also forged an agreement with India to help low-income countries transition to modern economies that are not as polluting as current developed nations.</p> <p>There are many more items which would be too numerous to mention but I wanted to know how his presidency is viewed within Washington DC. I mean, among climate scientists, he is the president we\u2019ve been waiting for, but what do legislators think? I asked representative <a href=\"https://mccollum.house.gov/\">Betty McCollum</a> from Minnesota for her view. Ms. McCollum has a long history of focusing on the environment in general and climate change in particular \u2013 long before it was popular. She told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>President Obama has acted boldly to address the threat of climate change at home and abroad. He has demonstrated American leadership on the world stage in forging the Paris agreement and the Kigali amendment, steps that would have been unthinkable under his predecessor. And, using existing law, President Obama has helped shape a new approach to domestic carbon emissions with the Clean Power Plan. Sadly, Republicans in Congress have consistently put polluters ahead of our planet and attempted to stymie every administration initiative on climate change. That has made President Obama\u2019s job tougher \u2013 and it makes his accomplishments on climate even more impressive.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We are certainly not out of the woods yet on climate change. We cannot stop climate change entirely. But, what the last eight years have shown is that we can do really meaningful things that will reduce the impact. If the US can go from world laggard to world leader in just one presidency, imagine what else is possible.</p>",
  "<p><strong><em><br></em></strong>A key confidante of Donald Trump has provided new details about the \u201cmutual friend\u201d of Julian Assange who served as a back channel to give him broad tips in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 releases of emails to and from key allies of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Roger Stone, a longtime unofficial adviser to the Republican presidential nominee, was briefed in general terms in advance about the sensitive and embarrassing leaked Democratic emails by an American libertarian who works in the media on the \u201copinion side\u201d, he told the Guardian in an interview. </p> <p>Stone claims his American source, whom he declined to identify, has met with Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, in London and is a \u201cmutual friend\u201d of Stone and Assange. The WikiLeaks source, Stone said, is not tied in any way to the Trump campaign but has served as a back channel for Stone, who is an outside adviser to the Republican presidential candidate, allowing the adviser to tweet and comment very broadly prior to some key WikiLeaks disclosures.</p> <p>A source close to Trump Tower also told the Guardian that Stone once boasted to him of meeting with Assange himself and told the source, who is active in GOP political circles, that WikiLeaks would be \u201ccoming down like a ton of bricks\u201d on Clinton. Stone adamantly denied meeting with Assange (\u201cYour source is bullshitting u\u201d he wrote in an email) or having any direct contact with Assange or anyone with WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Despite Stone\u2019s advance tweets and comments about some major WikiLeaks disclosures \u2013 including recent ones in October relating to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Clinton Foundation \u2013 the self-styled \u201crabble rouser\u201d and onetime Watergate dirty tricks operative<strong> </strong>said the FBI had not contacted him in its investigation into the illegal computer hacking of private Democratic emails, and he was not worried.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing to investigate,\u201d Stone said.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton is throwing everything she has got at Florida to try to change the national conversation.<br></p> <p>It was gone 10.30pm when she finally finished the third rally of a gruelling flying visit on Tuesday, the fifth day spent here in the last week alone.

On Thursday, Barack Obama returns to Florida as well. On Friday, Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, will head back here for two days. Trump himself lands on Wednesday. </p> <p>Many states matter in the jumbled up electoral map of 2016, but few more than this. Democratic campaign staff regard it as their biggest firewall. Without securing its 29 electoral college votes, it is almost impossible for Trump to assemble the 270 votes he needs to become president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida factbox\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida factbox</a> </figure>  <p>They also think it is going to be tight.

A senior campaign aide told reporters on her plane \u201cthere is no state that is more important\u201d.</p> <p>So at each spot, Clinton tries a different approach to fire up disgust about her opponent.

More of that shortly.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the first thing we can say.</p> <p>It is clear there have been concerns in the government about the Kent Town electorate office leasing arrangements since the get-go, from the time Day first entered parliament in July 2014.</p> <p>How do we know this?</p> <p>We know because the newly elected Abbott government allowed the Family First senator to remain in situ only if various conditions were met, including ending his personal connection to the building.</p> <p>The other conditions imposed on Day at the time were: he had to pay for the refit of the new office, and the government would pay no rent until the Labor man Don Farrell (who lost his seat in that election) vacated his electorate office in the Adelaide CBD.</p> <p>Fairfax further revealed on Wednesday that bureaucrats in the finance department <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-approved-bob-days-office-deal-despite-departmental-advice-not-to-20161102-gsg8rf.html\">recommended clearly against Day</a> situating himself in Kent Town, but the then special minister of state, Michael Ronaldson, ultimately ticked the arrangement.</p> <p>Politicians are certainly not obliged to follow the advice of their bureaucrats, although in this instance it would have been prudent to do so. This isn\u2019t a hindsight judgment \u2013 the potential pitfalls were pretty clear at the time.</p> <p>The why of Ronaldson\u2019s conditional approval of Day\u2019s preferred office arrangements is reasonably obvious if we consider the contemporary political context.</p> <p>The new Abbott government, looking at a fractious Senate (everyone remembers the band of crossbenchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/17/tony-abbott-tells-party-room-its-time-to-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life\">Tony Abbott dubbed \u201cferal\u201d</a>, right?) would have doubtless been at pains not to irritate any reliable supporters in the red place, and Day was certainly that. </p> <p>Now we need to roll forward to 1 December 2015. By then, a new special minister of state had taken possession of Day\u2019s office arrangements \u2013 Mal Brough \u2013 and a lease was signed covering the Adelaide office.</p> <p>As Day puts it in a statement he released on Wednesday: \u201cThe government is in possession of a legal opinion which says from the day the department of finance signed a lease with Fullarton Investments Pty Ltd \u2013 the owner of the building in which I had my Senate office, a company I am neither a director nor shareholder of \u2013was the day I became ineligible to be a senator.</p> <p>\u201cThat day was 1 December 2015.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/02/challenge-election-one-nation-senator-rod-culleton\">Government challenges election of One Nation senator Rod Culleton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Government people familiar with the case say Day provided a guarantee on the mortgage for the building through his company B&amp;B Day Pty Ltd, so there was a financial exposure, which arguably triggers the constitutional issue. As Day characterises it: \u201cBecause Fullarton Investments owes me money, the department\u2019s legal opinion says I have an indirect interest in the lease.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the lease being signed with the commonwealth last December, no rent was paid on the building.</p> <p>After months passed, Day went looking for the payments. On 4 August, he approached Scott Ryan, who is the current special minister of state. This contact happened a month after the election, and immediately after Day was returned to the Senate after the marathon count.</p> <p>Day\u2019s inquiry to Ryan about the rent (which apparently included an assurance to the minister that there was no constitutional problem, just in case anyone was wondering) then triggered a process where Ryan sought advice about precisely what was going on with the building in Adelaide, and whether there was any constitutional problem with the arrangement.</p> <p>The next relevant date is 7 October.</p> <p>On that day, Ryan told the Family First senator he intended to terminate the lease on the building and seek external legal advice about whether Day had an indirect interest in the lease, which could fall foul of section 44.</p> <p>The legal advice came back to the government last Thursday, and it was conveyed to the Senate president, Stephen Parry, on Friday.</p> <p>While the correspondence and the legal advice was flying around behind the scenes about whether the Family First senator was validly elected, Day was also facing significant problems with his construction empire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/family-first-senator-bob-day-quits-after-business-collapses\">The building business was put into liquidation on 17 October.</a></p> <p>Bizarrely, rather than just accepting the sum of the parts and moving on from politics to deal with the practical consequences of his various compounding imbroglios, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/labor-presses-coalition-to-rule-out-accepting-bob-day-vote-on-abcc-bill\">Day remained in public view, prevaricating about whether to stay or whether to go.</a></p> <p>The reason cited for Day\u2019s prevarication was he wanted to be present for critical votes coming up in the parliament. Maybe that was the reason, maybe it wasn\u2019t. Whatever it was about, it has complicated the political appearances for the government.</p> <p>While the available evidence suggests Ryan has made a priority of getting clarity on Day\u2019s arrangements post election, and working through the sequence required to clean up the mess, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/what-did-you-know-and-when-labor-wants-government-answers-on-bob-day-fiasco\">Labor, naturally, has pounced, and reasonably so</a>.</p> <p>It is more than reasonable to ask who knew what when, and why it took such a long period of time to follow the trails of smoke diligently back to the fire.</p> <p>The Day problem was hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious the Coalition has relied heavily on Day\u2019s vote, both in this parliament and the last one. That\u2019s a matter of record. So it is reasonable to ask why the government continued to rely on Day\u2019s parliamentary vote when the government was, in fact, fully aware there were serious legal questions about whether he was eligible to sit in the Senate.</p> <p>And then there is Culleton. The One Nation senator has faced persistent questions about his eligibility since he arrived in Canberra.</p> <p>The solicitor-general, Justin Gleeson, said two weeks ago (in the middle of the high-octane slugfest between himself and the attorney general, George Brandis) that he had provided advice on an urgent legal matter about the composition of the Senate, which Brandis confirmed on Wednesday was about Culleton.</p> <p>Brandis said he received Gleeson\u2019s opinion late on Friday, 28 October, and forwarded it to Culleton.</p> <p>This problem relates to proceedings in the high court against Culleton by Bruce Bell. Bell is alleging Culleton was incapable of being chosen as a senator because at the time of the last election he had been convicted convicted of an offence punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for one year or longer.</p> <p>So now, Senate willing, Culleton will be joining Day in the high court. Far from the Senate being a sleepy hollow, it is all happening.</p> <p>Regardless of how the current case studies end, it\u2019s clear the government needs to look at new measures to ensure that would-be politicians are forced to comply with their constitutional requirements, as Australian Electoral Commission veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/25/tighten-up-political-system-to-stem-birther-controversies-aec-veteran-says\">Michael Maley has already suggested to a current parliamentary inquiry.</a></p> <p>That\u2019s just a basic integrity measure.</p> <p>To give voters some confidence, it is also incumbent on the government to come clean about everything it has known about either matter.</p> <p>And that means everything.</p> <p>Anything less than full disclosure, and concrete steps to ensure greater integrity in the process in the future, will be marked down as a failure by the Turnbull government \u2013 and this is a government which is already chalking up too many failures in the minds of the voting public.</p>",

The leaders of the leave campaign faced the nation with the solemn indignation of children whose Christmas present arrives in fiddly parts, batteries not included. Years of pester power had delivered a cherished gift to the Tory right, but they wanted someone else to make it work before they could play with it.</p> <p>In the absence of British leadership, it fell to a Canadian technocrat to calm nerves. Carney told the world the UK economy was \u201cresilient\u201d, but that \u201ca period of uncertainty and instability\u201d could be expected. The Bank of England was making \u00a3250bn of funds available to cushion the shock. As the first grownup on the scene, Carney made the Brexiteers look small and weak on their special day. He strode across the fragments of their brittle campaign boasts, and they hate him for it.</p> <p>Some hate him also for having been recruited by George Osborne. The former chancellor occupies a demonic role in the cult of Brexit. He deployed the power of the Treasury to make the case for remain. He activated his network of allies in parliament and brandished his power of patronage to the same end, hinting at preferment for those who stayed loyal to what was, after all, the official government position.</p> <p>The present government is and isn\u2019t the same one that sought to keep Britain in the EU. It has not been supplanted in a general election, but its purpose has been overwritten by plebiscite. So the prime minister has a misshapen mandate. She is constitutionally entitled to the job as the anointed Tory leader in command of a parliamentary majority, but that majority was won by a predecessor whose political project has burned to the ground. And May was a remainer.</p> <p>To overcome the structural insecurity built into her position, May is embracing not just the goal of Brexit but its revolutionary ethos: the idea that 24 June was Day One of Year One of the New Era. Cameron has removed himself from the purgative line of fire. Osborne has not, which means that his legacy as chancellor \u2013 and his friends \u2013 are viewed with suspicion in No 10.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f6dd489167b1ca8f6d4101a68ef89fb60b87ca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f6dd489167b1ca8f6d4101a68ef89fb60b87ca8/0_198_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Amber Rudd before the ceremonial welcome for Colombia\u2019s president Juan Manuel Santos in London on 1 November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May and Amber Rudd before the ceremonial welcome for Colombia\u2019s president Juan Manuel Santos in London on 1 November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is partly why May took a casual dig at the Bank of England in her party conference speech, fretting about the harmful consequences of low interest rates and quantitative easing, adding \u2013 in the tone of ominous imprecision that is becoming her trademark \u2013 that \u201cchange has got to come\u201d.</p> <p>I doubt she realised that this would be taken as a licence to kill by Carney\u2019s would-be Tory assassins.

South Korean presidents can serve only one five-year term, and it is now unlikely that Park has the political capital she needs to go through with plans to allow the country\u2019s leaders to serve a second term. </p> <p>With a little over a year left in the presidential Blue House, one likely scenario is that she will be allowed to limp on until a new leader is elected towards the end of 2017. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/south-korea-rasputin-like-friend-president-park-geun-hye-returns\">'Rasputin-like' friend of South Korean president returns amid protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite widespread anger over her conduct \u2013 which last week elicited a brief apology that many have criticised as woefully insufficient \u2013 Park has not indicated she is ready to resign, and calls for what could be a lengthy and damaging impeachment have so far failed to resonate. </p> <p>But there is little doubt that Park\u2019s presidency has been irrevocably damaged by revelations about her ties to Choi, who after hiding out in Germany is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/choi-soon-sil-arrested-made-in-south-korean-presidential-cronyism-scandal\">in \u201cemergency detention\u201d in Seoul</a> facing questions over alleged influence peddling and fraud.</p> <h2><strong>Who is the woman at the centre of the scandal?</strong></h2> <p>Until recently, the 60-year-old Choi largely operated under the media radar as Park\u2019s adviser and, according to some media, as her spiritual guru. Those revelations alone would not have invited the opprobrium heaped on Choi and Park had it not been for Choi\u2019s apparent influence on economic, foreign and defence policy \u2013 and allegations she used her position to pocket some of the $70m she solicited from major South Korean companies for two foundations she had set up.</p> <p>Choi was first seen in public with Park in the late \u201970s after the assassinations of the latter\u2019s father. Park has described Choi as a source of comfort during difficult times in her life, but denies granting her the sort of influence that would be unprecedented for a private citizen who has never held public office and does not have security clearance.</p> <p>Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a self-styled Christian pastor who founded a religious cult called the Church of Eternal Life that is now led by his daughter. The older Choi, who died in 1994, befriended Park after her mother\u2019s death at the hands of a pro-North Korean spy in 1974. He reportedly told the young, grieving Park that her mother had appeared to him in a dream and asked him for help. </p> <h2><strong>What has the public reaction been?</strong></h2> <p>The response from South Korean voters has been brutal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/south-korea-president-orders-10-staff-members-to-resign-amid-worsening-crisis\">Thousand of protesters took to the streets</a> of Seoul and other cities at the weekend to demand her resignation. Having exploited her father\u2019s role in developing the South Korean economy \u2013 and deflecting criticism of his human rights abuses \u2013 Park came to power promising better ties with North Korea and progress for the country\u2019s economy. Four years later, she has failed to deliver on both policy commitments, leaving her with little political room for manoeuvre as she attempts to contain the scandal. Park\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted to about 10% \u2013 by far the worst since her inauguration in February 2013.</p> <h2><strong>Where could this go?</strong></h2> <p>Park has attempted to defuse the crisis with a root-and-branch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/new-south-korea-pm-appointed-as-cronyism-scandal-widens\">reorganisation of her embattled administration</a>. Last week she told 10 of her senior secretaries to resign; on Wednesday, she moved again to divert attention from the scandal by appointing a new prime minister and finance minister. </p> <p>The measures failed to have much impact, however, with opposition parties accusing her of shuffling senior staff in a desperate attempt to save her presidency. It isn\u2019t clear how much influence the new prime minister, Kim Byong-joon, will have over policy. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea\u2019s biggest newspaper, last week urged Park to appoint a caretaker premier and in effect end her involvement in governing the country.</p> <h2><strong>Does it have implications outside South Korea?</strong></h2> <p>Early coverage of the scandal was mostly confined to the domestic media, but the lurid details of Choi\u2019s relationship with Park have caught the attention of the international media in recent days. </p> <p>The scandal has caused only minor ripples on the stock and currency markets, but it he will be causing concern in the US and Japan as they seek to put on a united front over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. </p> <p>Amid such low expectations for the rest of Park\u2019s term, it would probably take a dramatic development in inter-Korean relations to gauge just how much Choi-gate has compromised her ability to govern. If Park does survive until the next election, the UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon, is among those being tipped to succeed her.<br><br></p>",
  "<p>Late in the afternoon of 23 July, four white men walked into the middle of a quiet road on the outskirts of Monroe, Georgia, blocking the path of a bright yellow Chevrolet sedan. The leader of the group \u2013 a white-haired, pot-bellied man in his 60s \u2013 approached the car and peered through the front window. Contorting his face into the most menacing grimace he could manage, he surveyed the people inside: a white driver, two black men and two black women.</p> <p>\u201cWe want that nigger Roger!\u201d he shouted, straining to make himself heard over the rain pelting the asphalt road.</p> <p>\u201cGet him out of the car,\u201d he barked.

After all, a handful of people in the audience had been alive on 25 July 1946, when these murders were committed. Some of them had been living just a few miles away from where we were now standing in the pouring rain, feeling the heavy presence of a violent history, and bracing for the brutal end.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the century after the end of the American civil war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/history-of-lynchings-and-racial-violence-continues-to-haunt-us\">lynching became a fixture of life</a> in the United States, especially in the south. Though often remembered as acts of vigilante justice carried out by extremists, these acts of terror were widely tolerated by state and federal officials \u2013 and often attended by large crowds that included prominent local citizens and their elected representatives, all eager to see newly liberated black southerners reminded that white people could kill them with impunity.</p> <p>The exact number of murders will never be tallied, but the most comprehensive recent study has identified at least 4,075 killings between 1877 and 1950. There has been no prominent public memorial or monument to the thousands of black lives taken by white terrorism in America. Plans to build <a href=\"http://eji.org/news/eji-announces-plans-to-build-museum-and-national-lynching-memorial\">the first such memorial</a>, in Montgomery, Alabama, were announced only a few months ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/history-of-lynchings-and-racial-violence-continues-to-haunt-us\">Jim Crow lynchings more widespread than first thought, report concludes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But for the last 12 years, there has been one unique and extraordinary effort to commemorate a single lynching: the infamous 1946 killing of two black men and their wives in Monroe \u2013 a crime that would shock the nation and help spark major changes in the law, even as its perpetrators went unidentified and unpunished.</p> <p>On 14 July 1946, a 24-year-old black farm worker named Roger Malcolm drove a knife into the stomach of his boss and landlord, a prominent white farm owner named Barnette Hester. Malcolm and Hester had both grown up in Monroe, a major cotton-farming town in Walton County, 40 miles east of Atlanta. As children, they had even played together on the Hester family farm. But now they were separated by a vast gulf: Hester was white and owned land, from which he profited handsomely; Malcolm was black and worked the land, from which he eked out a living. Like many black citizens of Georgia, Malcolm was determined to leave soon and head north to Chicago in search of better employment and social mobility.</p> <p>Malcolm, a notoriously short-tempered man, had come to believe that his common-law wife, Dorothy, was having sex with Hester. Drunk and furious, Malcolm confronted Hester in front of his house. In the scuffle that ensued, Malcolm took out a knife and stabbed him. The fight was witnessed by several other members of the Hester family, who were inclined to kill Malcolm on the spot. But they demurred. \u201cYou would have to serve time,\u201d counselled Ida Hester, Barnette\u2019s mother, according to one account. \u201cYou let the others do it.\u201d</p> <p>Hester was sent to a local hospital. Malcolm was locked in the local jail. Eleven days later, when it was clear that Hester would survive his wounds, a white cotton farmer named Loy Harrison came downtown to secure Malcolm\u2019s release, notionally bailing him out in exchange for future labour. Such arrangements were widespread in the south. In Monroe, especially during the cotton harvest, it was common for local sheriffs and police to spend Saturdays making sure the jail was stocked with cheap workers for the week to come.</p> <p>Dorothy Malcolm had a brother, George Dorsey, a veteran of the second world war who lived and worked on Harrison\u2019s farm with his wife, Mae Murray Dorsey. Together, Dorothy, George and Mae Murray had lobbied Harrison to post Malcolm\u2019s bail. He would be safer, they thought, as a source of white profit than as a black man sitting in a poorly guarded jail in the centre of town. Dorothy, George, and Mae accompanied Harrison on the journey to pick up Malcolm.</p> <p>Shortly after he had collected Malcolm from jail and driven out of downtown Monroe with both Malcolms and both Dorseys in his car, Harrison came to a stop just before the wooden slat bridge that crossed the Apalachee River. Up ahead, there was a group of white men blocking the road. They had guns. A few minutes later, the Malcolms and Dorseys were dead, each of their bodies shot multiple times with pistols and shotguns at point-blank range. Either before or after the shooting started, someone tied a noose around Roger\u2019s neck, but he was not hanged.</p> <p>The lynching of black citizens had been common ever since the emancipation of slaves, and the failure of the post-war Reconstruction programme designed to enforce racial equality in the former Confederacy. But the nature of these murders had evolved over the years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d00a86bea9af415384953adfcf2d5f94e5efb7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d00a86bea9af415384953adfcf2d5f94e5efb7a/9_0_1725_1725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loy Harrison (right), Coroner WT Brown (center) and Sheriff JM Bond (left) at Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge in Georgia on 26 July 1946, a day four black people were killed there by a lynch mob.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loy Harrison (right), Coroner WT Brown (center) and Sheriff JM Bond (left) at Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge in Georgia on 26 July 1946, a day four black people were killed there by a lynch mob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RF/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1880s and 90s were characterised by \u201cspectacle lynchings\u201d, as historians came to call them: public events at which white people gathered by the hundreds to watch victims, typically black men, get tortured, set on fire, hanged, castrated and/or dismembered on their way to death. (Often, spectators would get caught up in the frenzy of the moment and join in the violence.) In the early 20th century, as activists and journalists drew attention to the persistence of racist mob justice across the south, national outrage grew. But lynchings did not stop: they decreased in number, and they went underground. Now the murders were carried out quickly and quietly by small groups on lonely back roads, where no one could see. The style was different, but since lynchings were never prosecuted, the message was the same: <em>watch what we can do</em>.</p> <p>The men who lynched the Malcolms and Dorseys in 1946 did not advertise ahead of time in local newspapers, as their predecessors did, or encourage their neighbours to attend with families and picnic baskets in tow. No one cheered or took pictures while it happened. No photographs appeared on the front page of newspapers the following day. Like so many others, they were confident that the protective shield of the white power structure would keep them safe so long as they weren\u2019t too ostentatious.</p> <p>This confidence was more than warranted. Local police did not even launch an investigation into the murder of the Malcolms and Dorseys. On all four death certificates, the coroner wrote the bureaucratic phrase that, for years, had been listed as the cause of death for victims of lynchings across the country: \u201cAt the hands of persons unknown\u201d.</p> <p>FBI agents came to Monroe two days after the murders, looking to see whether a federal prosecution might be possible. But they quickly realised that none of the white residents of Walton County wanted to help them \u2013 some because they were too scared, others because they were helping with the cover-up. Lamar Howard, a black 19-year-old who had witnessed a conversation between the plotters at the ice house where he worked, was brave enough to come forward and testify. In return, two white men beat him to within an inch of his life.</p> <p>From the perspective of the killers, the lynching could hardly have been more successful. News of the deed spread almost instantly through the entire county by word of mouth, searing the threat of extrajudicial violence into the consciousness of all who heard about it.</p> <p>At the same time, its specific details \u2013 who, exactly, played what role; who tied the noose; who pulled the triggers; who lied to protect the guilty \u2013 were already slipping through the fingers of anyone who tried to grasp them. The killers must have been confident that, as time passed, the story would only grow fainter, and the facts of the crime would be forgotten. Only the fear would remain.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>But then something unexpected happened. Two days after the lynching, news of the killings reached Walter F White, the head of the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, who had spent decades investigating lynchings across the country firsthand. White was black, but could pass as white \u2013 something he had used to his advantage over the years while interviewing proud lynchers about their exploits. A canny publicist, he felt that the Monroe lynchers\u2019 decision to kill Dorothy and Mae Murray along with their husbands might mobilise public disgust. (Women were lynched relatively rarely.)</p> <p>White sent graphic briefings on the case to news outlets across the country. Reporters started flocking to Monroe, bringing America news that lynching \u2013 which many white people thought of as a relic of the past \u2013 was alive and well.</p> <p>In cities across the country, people took to the streets in protest. In Atlanta, a teenage Martin Luther King Jr was inspired to write <a href=\"http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_460806_000/\">a letter to the editor of the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. (In his letter, King refutes the commonplace argument that lynchings were an attempt to protect white women from the sexual aggression of black men: \u201cIt is fair to remember that almost the total of race mixture in America has come, not at Negro initiative, but by the acts of those very white men who talk loudest of race purity.\u201d) The Justice Department was flooded with mail expressing shock and frustration that such a crime could go unpunished in 1940s America. At the White House, a deluge of outraged telegrams demanded that President Harry Truman take action.</p> <p>Truman had never displayed much concern for racial justice. But like many other observers of the Monroe lynching, he was particularly disturbed that one of the victims, George Dorsey, had spent more than two years of the second world war fighting for the US in the South Pacific \u2013 risking his life for his country, only to be gunned down by white supremacists at home. In September, Truman invited White to Washington to give a talk on the state of racial violence nationwide, including the case in Monroe. When the presentation was over, the president\u2019s face was pale. \u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea it was as terrible as that.\u201d Three months later, he created <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/pccr.htm\">the President\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights</a>, which played a key role in ending the racial segregation of the federal workforce and the US military.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f6280b60886e81b1c502d631629bbc8d67149f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6280b60886e81b1c502d631629bbc8d67149f9/0_15_8431_5059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The grave site of George and Dorothy Dorsey, who were killed in the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The grave site of George and Dorothy Dorsey, who were killed in the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But back in Monroe, the murders stayed in the shadows. \u201cIf anyone would be fool enough to talk about the lynching, they would also be killed,\u201d one white man told the FBI. Others proudly declared that, even if they did know something, they wouldn\u2019t say so. A grand jury of white citizens, many from Walton County, failed to approve charges against a single suspect. Decades passed. The suspects began to age and die. For as long as he lived, Loy Harrison \u2013 the farmer who had secured Roger Malcolm\u2019s release from jail \u2013 insisted, increasingly implausibly, that he had not been part of the lynching plot, and that he had not recognised any of the killers. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m as mad as anybody, the way they killed my niggers,\u201d he told the FBI during their original investigation. \u201cI need all the nigger hands I can get.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI investigation closed. The reporters went home. In Walton County, people \u2013 white and black \u2013 talked about the lynching behind closed doors or not at all, and those who remembered that it had happened started to die and move away. Some told their children the story, but many preferred to avoid the subject. (Roger Malcolm\u2019s own son from an earlier marriage, who was spirited out of town on the night of the murders, only learned the full story of his father\u2019s killing decades later.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/26/truth-and-reconciliation-is-coming-to-america\">Truth and reconciliation is coming to America from the grassroots | Fania E Davis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, after 45 years of silence, a witness came forward. In 1991, a 55-year-old white man named Clinton Adams walked into the FBI field office in Panama City, Florida. When he was 10, he said, he had witnessed the lynching by the Apalachee River from a nearby field. He had seen some of the lynchers\u2019 faces, he said, and knew who they were. Adams claimed to have been intimidated into silence by a decades-long campaign of harassment that had followed him from state to state. His dramatic story unleashed a wave of media interest, including newspaper stories, television reports, an interview with Oprah Winfrey, and an eventual book.</p> <p>Had Adams not come forward, the case might have fallen even further into obscurity. Instead, it became a symbol of the scars that racial violence had left on the American psyche \u2013 and the ways that rigorously enforced white silence, both past and present, had been integral to distorting and sanitising the history of that violence. The FBI, which had recently reopened a spate of cold cases from the civil rights era, added the Monroe lynching to the pile.</p> <p>The excitement of Adams\u2019s revelations did not last long: the FBI had lost much of the original evidence, and his testimony was riddled with contradictions and chronological errors that made it practically useless. But, whatever his motivations, he had successfully brought the story back to life.</p> <p>A few years later, in 1997, a small group of activists in Georgia, both black and white, began searching for ways to engrave the memory of the lynching on to the history of Walton County. Calling themselves the Moore\u2019s Ford Memorial Committee (after the bridge that crosses the Apalachee River by the site of the lynching), they began to hold community forums in which people could share their memories of the lynchings, and their experiences of racial violence. (For many decades after the end of Reconstruction<strong>, </strong>the county had been among the worst places in the country to be a free black American.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c083c9fa21eccc0c57f20ae6b4758d2802c7a212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c083c9fa21eccc0c57f20ae6b4758d2802c7a212/0_258_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The historical marker sign at the roadside near the site of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The historical marker sign at the roadside near the site of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists pushed the state of Georgia to erect an official roadside sign to mark the site of the killings, which was put up in 1999. They combed through abandoned cemeteries until they found the victims\u2019 graves. That same year, they held an approximation of the military funeral George Dorsey had never received. (Lamar Howard, who had been beaten after daring to testify against the lynchers 53 years earlier, attended the service.) The activists received a steady trickle of death threats and hate mail, but they also slowly won local allies, including some white people.</p> <p>In 2005, Tyrone Brooks, a veteran of the southern civil rights movement who had become a Georgia state legislator, approached the activists in Monroe with a quixotic idea: a re-enactment. Just think, he urged the group, of how much media attention that would bring to the case \u2013 of the pressure it would put on the FBI.</p> <p>In the south, re-enactments are used primarily to commemorate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-civil-war-re-enactors\">the battles of the civil war</a>. They are often imbued, to varying degrees, with nostalgia for the \u201clost cause\u201d of the slaveholding Confederacy. So the suggestion that the activists might perform a lynching instead was \u201ca very mischievous idea\u201d, said Mark Auslander, an anthropologist who studies memorial rituals and has attended the Monroe event several times. \u201cRe-enactments are, in many ways, the prime currency of memorialisation in the south.\u201d But \u201cthey don\u2019t mention slavery, they don\u2019t mention Jim Crow, they don\u2019t mention lynchings\u201d. On the surface, each traditional re-enactment is an exercise in remembering; taken together, they represent a collective forgetting, in which the Confederacy is defined by nothing but the brave spirit of its soldiers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-civil-war-re-enactors\">Civil war re-enactors on the Confederate flag: 'It's complicated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of performing the lynching tore the Moore\u2019s Ford Memorial Committee apart, a split that was particularly painful because it occurred largely along racial lines. Many black members of the group (though certainly not all) found themselves drawn to the re-enactment. Most white members found the idea viscerally repellent: a confrontational spectacle unlikely to serve the cause of reconciliation. \u201cWe thought it was a step too far,\u201d Richard Rusk, one of committee\u2019s founding members, told me. \u201cMany steps too far. Totally inappropriate, too divisive. I mean, can you name one other place in the world where people get together to act out a horrible, disgusting piece of racial violence with absolutely no element of uplift? Can you?\u201d</p> <p>The first re-enactment took place in July 2005, an improvised and emotional performance for an audience that included <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/us/group-lynching-is-recreated-in-a-call-for-justice.html?_r=0\">a reporter for the New York Times</a> and civil rights luminaries such as Jesse Jackson and Joseph Lowery, Martin Luther King\u2019s successor as the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It has been staged every year since.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Among the many logistical challenges of re-enacting a lynching, the greatest might be recruiting white cast members. Based on the available evidence, there were at least a dozen white men involved in the original crime. In recent years, the organisers have been lucky to get five or six. \u201cMost white people just refuse,\u201d Cassandra Greene, a 57-year-old Atlanta minister who has directed the re-enactment for the last eight years, told me. (She is black.) \u201cI ask everyone. I ask my white friends. They all say no. They all say: \u2018Oh, I could never do that.\u2019\u201d In the first year of the re-enactment, the four white men who had volunteered to portray the killers backed out at the last minute; the lynch mob was played by young black men wearing white plastic masks.</p> <p>Casting the black roles is only slightly easier, Greene told me. Some people she approaches act enthusiastic, then never show up for rehearsal. Some rehearse, but then back out before the actual performance. Some perform for a year or two, then drop out. \u201cI mean, I get it,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt hurts. It fills your mind with hurt. I haven\u2019t been on a date in years, and why not? Because I\u2019m thinking about all this instead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b9e11f13b13c555192b1d4ab5ba069fd9cd7647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b9e11f13b13c555192b1d4ab5ba069fd9cd7647/0_319_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cassandra Greene, director of the Moore\u2019s Ford Lynching reenactment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cassandra Greene, director of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching reenactment.

It used me up.\u201d</p> <p>Two nights before this year\u2019s re-enactment, most of the cast gathered to rehearse at <a href=\"http://sightsandsoundsmuseum.org/\">Sights and Sounds</a>, a single-room museum of black American cultural artefacts \u2013 from fugitive slave posters to Jackson 5 records \u2013 housed in a moribund shopping mall in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta about an hour\u2019s drive from Monroe. In its early incarnations, the cast was drawn mostly from Monroe \u2013 today a town of about 13,000 \u2013 and Walton County. But over the years, local participation has steadily declined. This year, every member of the all-volunteer cast was an Atlanta resident.</p> <p>The Malcolms and Dorseys were played by young actors trying to break into professional film and theatre. Only one had participated in the re-enactment before, and none had heard of the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching until Greene contacted them asking for their help. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7747276/\">Darrius Bradshaw</a>, who played Roger Malcolm, told me that during rehearsals \u2013 which, he reminded me, consisted largely of older white men calling him \u201cnigger,\u201d tying a noose around his neck, and pretending to shoot him repeatedly \u2013 he sometimes sank into depression, and sometimes flared into sudden fury. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201clater, out in the real world, I\u2019d find myself back in those feelings, not even realising at first where they came from.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/mike-brown-shooting-jim-crow-lynchings-in-common\">Mike Brown\u2019s shooting and Jim Crow lynchings have too much in common. It\u2019s time for America to own up | Isabel Wilkerson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the actors and the audience alike, it was impossible to ignore the charged significance of re-enacting the state-sanctioned murder of innocent black men and women at a moment when one candidate for president was running a campaign of undisguised racism \u2013 and police across the country were still killing unarmed black men with numbing regularity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even sadder this year,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7551305/\">Lisa Searcy</a>, who played Mae Murray in 2015 and Dorothy this July. \u201cYou read the script, you rehearse, then you go home and turn on the news and you can\u2019t stop the tears.\u201d She did not mean to suggest, she quickly added, that 2016 was the same as 1946. \u201cBut the history really weighs on you hard.\u201d</p> <p>At last year\u2019s re-enactment, Searcy met a woman who introduced herself as a descendant of a man named <a href=\"https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/emorycoldcases/maceo-snipes/\">Maceo Snipes</a>. Five days before the lynching in Monroe, Snipes had been murdered in Taylor County, 100 miles to the south \u2013 for the offence of exercising his right to vote. (The winner of that election, Governor Eugene Talmadge, campaigned on a promise to ensure that Georgia\u2019s black population, then the largest in the nation, would never have access to the ballot box.)</p> <p>Later that night, when Searcy mentioned the story to her parents \u2013 who had family roots in Taylor County \u2013 they suddenly went silent. It turned out that she, too, was related to Snipes; her parents had never told her. At the time, Searcy told me, she couldn\u2019t understand their reticence. \u201cBut the more I thought about it, the more I got it,\u201d she said \u2013 especially once this year\u2019s rehearsals started. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I can understand now. I can feel this part of myself that would maybe turn away and not say anything. It\u2019s just too terrible. You don\u2019t want to touch it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6782d6d3ae3389a79f7f36a8431c45b26662faf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6782d6d3ae3389a79f7f36a8431c45b26662faf3/0_1580_5687_7108/800.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Darrius Bradshaw, who played the role of Roger in the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching reenactment this year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Darrius Bradshaw, who played the role of Roger in the reenactment this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the white cast members were not actors at all. One longtime participant, Bob Caine, is a descendant of <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/08/100-year-anniversary-of-the-hanging-of-leo-frank/\">Leo Frank</a>, a Jewish man who was lynched in Atlanta in 1915, after being sentenced to life in prison for a crime he likely did not commit. Unhappy that Frank had not received the death penalty, a group of prominent white people (including a former governor of Georgia) broke into the prison where he was being held, abducted him and hung him from a tree.</p> <p>Wade Marbaugh, a 67-year-old journalist who for years has played the lynching crew\u2019s ringleader (and whose wife and daughters have also participated), smiled ruefully as he recalled his efforts to recruit his white neighbours and coworkers for the lynch mob. \u201cAt this point, they just ignore me. If it\u2019s email, they don\u2019t respond. If it\u2019s conversation, they cut it just as short as they can. These are people I\u2019ve known for years.\u201d</p> <p>This was frustrating, he said, but not impossible to understand. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not a TV show where the bad guys are the bad guys, and they\u2019re on the screen and you\u2019re in your chair.\u201d While preparing for his first performance, he drove out to Monroe and made his way to the site of the lynching. \u201cIt was just staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt knocked me down. I wept and wept.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A crucial feature of the re-enactment is that, by the standards commonly used to judge realist drama, it isn\u2019t particularly accomplished. The actors are either amateurs or apprentices still finding their way to whatever dramatic powers they might possess. It is hard for them to all get together to rehearse, especially because people drop out so frequently. Often, secondary members will have joined the production just a few days before the re-enactment.</p> <p>The budget hovers reliably around zero dollars, occasionally supplemented by infusions from Greene or other supporters. This means lots of 21st-century touches in the costumes; it means guns that look and sound like the plastic toys they are. The yellow Chevy \u2013 which is more 1950s than 1946 \u2013 is only rented for the day of the performance, so the cast doesn\u2019t get to use it in rehearsals. As a result, the key scene where the Malcolms and Dorseys are pulled from the car is marked by pauses in which the cast tries to pretend it isn\u2019t pausing to figure out who needs to reposition themselves where in order to keep the action moving.</p> <p>In stage plays and films, imperfections such as these can break the carefully cultivated spell of realism, or stop it from being cast in the first place. But as I watched the Malcolms and Dorseys get pulled from the yellow Chevy, I felt a claustrophobic flush of fear and shame more intense than any film could elicit. In the weeks leading up to the performance, I had heard stories of audience members crying, sobbing and calling out in pain. Even fierce critics of the re-enactment had admitted to me that, after attending out of curiosity, they had found it unexpectedly moving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9d7c22a3c26c18d02fcb41c90f496e1493aabc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d7c22a3c26c18d02fcb41c90f496e1493aabc2/0_579_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching re-enactment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As I watched them get pulled from the yellow Chevy, I felt a claustrophobic flush of fear and shame\u2019 \u2026 the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching re-enactment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In conversation after conversation, the same phrases kept popping up: like a dream; like a nightmare; slow-motion; unreal; super-real. And still I was shocked by the ragged intensity of my reaction. The scene in front of me wasn\u2019t a careful or tasteful copy of the past: it was a live, messy attempt to drag a heavy memory up into the light of day. Not so it could be changed or fixed \u2013 the moment was trapped in terrible amber; the Malcolms and Dorseys would not be saved \u2013 but simply to insist it could not be denied.</p> <p>The audience was almost entirely black, with a sprinkling of white people (myself included). Some of those present were old enough to remember the reign of the lynch mobs, and a small handful had actually been in Monroe on the day of the murders. Joseph Hunter, an 81-year-old black man who was visiting relatives near Monroe in the summer of 1946, approached me at a gathering held at Monroe\u2019s First Baptist Church before the re-enactment. What he remembered, he told me, was being suddenly yanked inside by his aunt when she got the news. \u201cShe closed the shades, she locked the door, and she said: \u2018Stay.\u2019\u201d His mother was in Connecticut, more than 800 miles away. As soon as she heard what had happened, she got in the car and drove continuously until she reached Hunter and his siblings the next day. \u201cShe had to have us close,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has attended the re-enactment every year since it started, he said. But he couldn\u2019t always watch the whole thing: \u201cIt\u2019s too easy for me to imagine black people getting shot.\u201d The first few years, as the climax approached, he reflexively turned his back on the scene and walked away. \u201cI know it\u2019s not real,\u201d he told me. \u201cI know. But \u2026 \u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> <p>As the crowd followed the re-enactors off the road for the final scene, I watched Hunter pause and stare at the ground. After a few seconds, he lifted his head and slowly walked toward the river.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The final moments of the re-enactment<strong> </strong>took barely a minute to play out, but they were were its slowest and most excruciating.</p> <p>The lynching crew tied their victims together and forced them onto the patch of fake turf. They stepped back, raised their plastic toy guns, and aimed. The ringleader counted down \u2013 three, two, one \u2013 and then the white men squeezed their triggers. In some past years, people have set off fireworks in the woods to simulate the gun shots; in others, the shooters have yelled \u201cPow! Pow!\u201d This year, there was no sound at all. The victims fell on to the patch of fake turf that had been laid out for this purpose. (In the past, actors who fell directly on the ground were painfully bitten by red ants in the grass.) As they collapsed, they burst bags of fake blood secreted in their shirts.</p> <p>For a moment, everyone \u2013 the shooters, the victims, the audience \u2013 was completely still. The victims, still bound by the ropes that had been tied around them, were pressed together on the ground.</p> <p>In 2005, when the re-enactment began, this was the moment where it concluded. But in the years since, more scenes have been added. Most of the new scenes take place earlier in the day, before the lynching itself, in spots around Walton County. The audience sees Roger Malcolm stab Barnette Hester, listens to gubernatorial candidate Eugene Talmadge froth at the mouth about the disgrace of black suffrage, and visits the victims\u2019 graves. But one addition has been tacked on after the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2f42656209e86764ba42437071debb2d35fc861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f42656209e86764ba42437071debb2d35fc861/0_528_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spectators and camera crew at the final scene of the re-enactment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spectators and camera crew at the final scene of the re-enactment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bob Caine, the white re-enactor descended from Leo Frank, walked over to the dead bodies, and, after peering at them for a moment, bent down over Lisa Searcy and pressed his hands into her abdomen, as if he were cutting her open. When he stood up, he was clutching a plastic doll of a black baby, dripping with syrupy fake blood. A woman in the audience shrieked, and the rest watched \u2013 or kept filming \u2013 as Caine held up the baby for all to see, trying his best to look triumphant instead of sickened.</p> <p>There is no firm evidence that Dorothy Malcolm was pregnant when she was murdered (and strong evidence to suggest that she wasn\u2019t). But the rumour has always lurked around the edges of the story, and similar acts of foeticide have been documented in other lynchings. To many regular participants in the re-enactment, the unborn Malcolm baby has become a rich, central symbol: of the severity of racial violence, of the futures it made (and still makes) impossible, of the particular ways it did and does target black women. To others, though, the role of the unborn child is distasteful, even sickening. Several years ago, a group of white feminists involved in the re-enactment \u2013 including the previous director \u2013 left after failing to convince their castmates that the child should be removed from the script.</p> <p>\u201cThe re-enactment has a very complex relationship to what scholars call historical veracity,\u201d said Mark Auslander. \u201cOn one hand, it appears to be about honouring and remembering exactly what happened in this particular spot in this particular day. On the other hand, it\u2019s about the creation of resonant myths and rituals. Re-enactors might say that they\u2019re doing it to educate, or to push the FBI to prosecute. That\u2019s not untrue, but it\u2019s a partial explanation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe summon up the spirit and presence of the dead for all kinds of reasons,\u201d Auslander continued. \u201cWe do it to get to know the dead, to spend time with them, to continue life in the face of death. That\u2019s what gives the re-enactment its force, its aliveness, and that\u2019s what makes it so draining for everyone who touches it.\u201d</p> <p>Racism in America has always been a matter of power \u2013 to enslave, to kill without consequence, to oppress, to segregate, to silence. But it has also been about the power to determine which memories the country sanctifies and which it discards. White America\u2019s preference \u2013 the preference of power, that is \u2013 has been for stories of progress and redemption, of national injury stitched up and healed over. The re-enactment in Monroe is a different type of story: an open wound that has festered for 70 years of repression and neglect. This what makes it necessary for some people, and unbearable for others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/16/suspects-1946-moores-ford-bridge-georgia-mass-lynching-alive\">FBI investigates claim suspects in 1946 Georgia mass lynching may be alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technically, the case remains open. In 2008, local newspapers reported that FBI agents were digging up land in Monroe to look for guns used in the lynching. As recently as last year, federal agents were conducting interviews in the area. But even the most impassioned activists admit that no charges are likely to materialise.</p> <p>Every year, the re-enactment concludes with a song, performed while the victims lie motionless on the ground. This year, an Atlanta jazz singer, Ja\u2019Naan, sang Strange Fruit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/16/protest-songs-billie-holiday-strange-fruit\">the haunting protest song</a> about lynchings made famous by Billie Holliday. Two days earlier, at the final rehearsal, I watched her deliver the song with practised poise. Now, her voice cracked and her body shook. The victims tried their best to remain completely still. Cassandra Greene, the director, watched from the sidelines, sobbing.</p> <p>On 25 July 1946, just hours after the Malcolms and Dorseys were murdered, white people from Monroe and the surrounding towns started driving to Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge. They had heard through the local rumour mill about what had just happened, and now they wanted souvenirs, like the spectators of lynchings past. Policemen had already snatched up most of the bullets and rope for their own personal collections, but there were still some scraps of clothing at the scene. One college student found a tooth, which he gave to a female friend, who put it on her charm bracelet. Many people took pictures, posing with bloodstains or bullet holes in the trees nearby.</p> <p>When the singing came to a stop, the audience did not turn away. They moved closer, walking toward the victims, holding their phones and tablets aloft, to claim these images as their own.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism like the Long Read is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>Barack Obama has suggested the Dakota Access pipeline could be rerouted around sacred Native American lands in comments that are the president\u2019s first on the controversial oil project since police arrested hundreds of indigenous protesters during violent clashes.</p> <p>After months of pleas from activists in North Dakota to stop construction of a pipeline that the Standing Rock tribe says could contaminate its water supply and threaten its cultural heritage, Obama said in an interview released on Tuesday night that the government was \u201cgoing to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans\u201d. </p> <p>Asked about the high-profile demonstrations against the $3.8bn pipeline, Obama told news website <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/793641140184461313\">NowThis</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring this closely and I think as a general rule, my view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans, and I think that right now the army corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline.\u201d </p> <p>In the wake of a demonstration that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/01/native-american-north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest\">began in April</a> and has grown into an international symbol of indigenous rights and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">climate change activism</a>, the US army corps of engineers announced in September that it would temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">halt permits</a> to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/29/north-dakota-oil-access-pipeline-protest-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjvy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690760\"            data-video-name=\"\u2018We\u2019re not going home\u2019: inside the North Dakota oil pipeline protest \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c48bace4b0396caaf99fd5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906ND_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906ND.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11833768&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/29/north-dakota-oil-access-pipeline-protest-video\">\u2018We\u2019re not going home\u2019: inside the North Dakota oil pipeline protest</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Obama had been silent since the army corp\u2019s announcement, and Energy Transfer Partners, the company operating the pipeline, has rapidly moved forward with construction, in recent days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-last-stand\">approaching the massive protest camps and river</a> where Native American leaders fear significant damage. </p> <p>The pipeline is scheduled to transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago.

I think that my general rule when I talk to governors and state and local officials whenever they\u2019re dealing with protests, including for example during the Black Lives Matters protests, is there\u2019s an obligation for protesters to be peaceful and there\u2019s an obligation for authorities to show restraint.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt.\u201d</p> <p>His comments comes as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-investigation-human-rights-abuses\">group with the United Nations</a> investigates allegations of human rights abuses after jailed Native Americans said they were held in cages and faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">cruel and inhumane treatment behind bars</a>. <br></p> <p>Police have used pepper spray, Tasers and batons against activists who have insisted they are remaining peaceful.</p> <p>Several protesters recently released from local jails told the Guardian at the Standing Rock camps that the Morton county sheriff\u2019s office was not prepared to process hundreds of those arrested, and that they wrote numbers and charges on inmates\u2019 bodies to track them while also temporarily detaining groups in cages that they said seemed like \u201cdog kennels\u201d. </p> <p>Activists have criticized Obama for <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/07/dakota-access-pipeline-fight-grows-where-are-obama-and-clinton\">staying silent</a> and were dismayed when the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, released a short <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates?page=with:block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5#block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5\">statement</a> saying she believed \u201call voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects\u201d.</p> <p>Last week it was also revealed that Republican candidate Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">close financial ties</a> to the pipeline operator.</p> <p>Xhopakelxhit, a Native American activist who has been at the Standing Rock camps for more than a month, said she was disappointed Obama didn\u2019t condemn the police tactics against peaceful protesters.</p> <p>\u201cWhy has he not made a more forceful statement in favor of us? He\u2019s basically trying to cover all his bases without actually doing anything,\u201d said the protester, who is a member of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising but it\u2019s a coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p> <p>Xhopakelxhit urged Obama to say that he finds the \u201cviolence committed by the riot police to be reprehensible\u201d and to have the department of justice investigate the continuing human rights violations.</p> <p>Given how close the pipeline is to the river, Xhopakelxhit also said she was wary of any last-minute efforts to change construction plans. \u201cIt\u2019s completely laughable on every level and utterly ridiculous that they would be able to reroute at this point.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Security forces in the Indonesian capital Jakarta are on high alert in preparation for a Friday rally by hardline Islamist groups against the city\u2019s non-Muslim governor.</p> <p>Thousands of people are due to move into the capital to protest against Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese and Christian nicknamed \u2018Ahok\u2019, who has governed the city since 2014.</p> <p>They accuse him of blasphemy after he criticised his opponents for referencing a <a href=\"https://quran.com/5:51\">verse</a> in the Koran that warns against allying with Christians and Jews.</p> <p>In September, Ahok suggested those who used the passage against him were \u201clying\u201d, leading to outrage from some hardliners who interpreted his comments as criticism of the Islamic holy text.

And later that year, a protest by the FPI turned <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-radicals-in-violent-protest-against-new-jakarta-governor\">violent</a> leaving several police officer injured.</p> <p>On Friday, demonstrators will attend prayers at Istiqlal Mosque and then march to the presidential palace, where armoured personnel carriers have been stationed and the police and military will be deployed.</p> <p>\u201cI appeal to everyone to stay calm.

The Indonesian military will provide a further 500 troops.</p> <p>The rally is the second large demonstration against Ahok in a month. On 14 October, thousands took park in a generally peaceful event outside city hall.</p> <p>As the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, Indonesians largely practice a moderate form of Islam. While the FPI is a relatively small group, the country\u2019s largest Islamic organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, has told its 40 million members not to support the protests.</p> <p>But equally, Indonesia\u2019s Ulama Council, the country\u2019s top Muslim clerical body, agreed that Ahok had committed blasphemy and should be prosecuted. It said a non-Muslim should not become a leader of Muslims.</p> <p>The southeast Asian nation has a history of sporadic and isolated violence against Christian as well as its large ethnic Chinese minority, many of whom are Buddhists.</p> <p>International militant jihadists, some with influence and members in Indonesia, are looking to capitalise on the anti-Ahok sentiment.</p> <p>Last month, al Qaida\u2019s branch in Syria, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, said that Indonesia should sentence Ahok or it would \u201csentence him with bullets\u2019. And ISIS supporters have sent messages to their supporters asking them to use the rally \u2018to fan the flames of jihad\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that everyone is worried about violence, and huge numbers of police and soldiers have been called up for duty,\u201d said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.<br></p> <p>The governor is looking toward a February election and looks likely to win. He is politically close with president Widodo, who also served as Jakarta governor for 18 months before rising to the country\u2019s highest office and handing over to Ahok.</p> <p>But Jones said that supporters of Anies Baswedan, a former minister of education who is second behind Ahok in the gubernatorial race, are exploiting the potentially explosive upheaval to damage him politically.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that there are too many interests involved here: Ahok\u2019s rivals would like to decrease his likelihood of winning; hardline civil society groups want to show that they control the streets; pro-shariah groups want to show massive support for Islamic law; the tiny jihadi groups are urging their members to show their courage by attacking police.\u201d</p>",

According to the ABC/Washington Post tracking <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf\">poll</a> published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent\u2019s 46%. The polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a> calculated by RealClearPolitics, a much better indication of national sentiment, shows Clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points, down from 5 percentage points a week ago.</p> <p>Those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative \u2013 polling won\u2019t neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register\">turnout</a> - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">close in terms of unpopularity</a>. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">revealed</a> last week that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way\u201d intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals and young women.<br></p> <p>Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups \u2013 because more than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">25m</a> ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans are <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election\">predicted</a> to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total.</p> <h2><strong>Higher turnout than at this time in 2012</strong></h2> <p>Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots, North Carolina, California and nine other states report <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">more</a> early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were small.</p> <h2><strong>Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters</strong></h2> <p>The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young voters \u2013 who are much <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/\">more likely</a> than older voters to lean Democratic \u2013 might be staying at home. In 12 states, fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/\">Bernie or bust</a>\u201d sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for Clinton.<br></p> <p>Young voters aren\u2019t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states \u2013 especially in North Carolina, a state that yields <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">15 of the 270</a> electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests Clinton is in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">close contest</a>. If Trump\u2019s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of sense \u2013 those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">Election polls tighten \u2013 but turnout is the real key to Clinton v Trump</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58192559e4b07ceadb3a169c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T23:31:01.602Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Donald Trump predicted \u201can unprecedented constitutional crisis\u201d if Hillary Clinton were to be elected president.</p> <p>\u201cThe work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt,\u201d Trump said, and \u201cshe is likely to be investigated for years, likely to be concluded with a very large-scale criminal trial.\u201d</p> <p>The audience chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d in response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton and have a severe case of buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d Trump said, referring to a few states - Wisconsin included - where early ballots can be reversed before election day. \u201cA lot of stuff has come out since you\u2019ve voted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can change your vote to Donald Trump - we\u2019ll make America great again, okay?

A <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G00563.pdf\">2002 report</a> from the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) details that land agreements were not negotiated with the Amungme until 1974, a year after the mine opened, and with the Kamoro in 1997. </p> <p>The compensation paid for Kamoro and Amungme land has been mainly in the form of communal benefits, such as the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUr8b2k-TPAhWIPBQKHUe-AewQFggiMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpubs.iied.org%2Fpdfs%2FG00563.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUjZwo7-iUrd8snZaSqKjlLsYIKQ&amp;sig2=BAxaiQ1fuUmVgqmofKdxmQ&amp;cad=rja\">building of homes, schools and places of worship</a>. The IIED report notes, \u201cPerceptions of land rights and historic compensation claims are a continuing source of dissatisfaction and conflict in the mining area.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://pacificpolicy.org/2013/06/economic-and-social-indicators-in-west-papua/\">Recent census data</a> shows Papua\u2019s GDP per capita at $3,510, compared to the Indonesian average of $2,452. Yet Papua has the highest poverty rate in the country, nearly three times the national average. It also has the highest infant, child and maternal mortality rates in Indonesia, as well as the worst health indicators, and the poorest literacy rates.<em></em><br></p> <p>The scale of destitution is best observed from the highland Amungme village of Banti, just 20 miles down from the Grasberg mine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc3d38ccd3293fda9e75d4ca1cd1c632658b4acc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc3d38ccd3293fda9e75d4ca1cd1c632658b4acc/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The river Aikwa, near Banti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The river Aikwa, near Banti, is turned thick and silver with the tailings from the mine.

The practice has devastated the environment, according to Earthworks and locals, turning thousands of hectares of verdant forest and mangroves into wasteland and rendering turgid the once-crystal waters of the highlands.</p> <p>The tailings from the Grasberg mine are so rich with ore that Papuans walk for as long as a week to get here. Crowding the length of the river and the delta wasteland, thousands of unlicensed panners shore up small sections to slow the river\u2019s flow and dig into the thick sediment on the side.  </p> <p>Although some of these panners are located within Freeport\u2019s official mining operations, they are not evicted or controlled in any way, they said. Instead, they claim they sell their findings to the police and military who work as security on the mine. (An anonymous Freeport source also confirmed this).</p> <p>One of the panners, Martine Wandango, 25, bends over her pail of water as she filters out rocks and searches for ore. \u201cYou can only survive with money, and you can only find money from gold,\u201d says Martine, who followed her husband to the delta 15 years ago by walking 60 miles over the mountains from their remote highland village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24ebd1b7d8453d418da051945e8268c0a9c5b81d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24ebd1b7d8453d418da051945e8268c0a9c5b81d/0_0_3984_2656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Aikwa river delta, near Timika\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Aikwa river, which used to provide the Kamoro people with the staples of their existence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Schulman/susan schulman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI work really hard as I want to give my children better lives, so they can go to school. But it isn\u2019t enough, so she helps me here mining,\u201d says Martine of her daughter, nine, who swings a gold pan in her hands. \u201cOn a good day, I can get three grammes, which I sell either to the police or [to buyers] in Timika.\u201d</p> <p>A tiny village when Freeport arrived here 40 years ago, Timika is now a boom town dotted with bars, brothels, gold-processing shops and various military personnel. Under Indonesian law, Freeport is a designated \u201cstrategic industry\u201d, which mandates that external security for the mine, its access roads and its pipelines all be provided exclusively by Indonesia\u2019s security forces. Freeport has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">never been implicated in any human rights</a> abuses allegedly committed by the Indonesian military in Papua. </p> <p>Freeport McMoRan, based in Phoenix, Arizona, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </p> <p>The company\u2019s website defends its method of disposal of tailings at Grasberg, managed by PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), an affiliate company: \u201cPTFI\u2019s controlled riverine tailings management system, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the mountainous highlands near our mine to transport tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and other sediments are managed in a deposition area.\u201d </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org/2012/world/global-gold-rush-the-price-of-mining-pursuits-on-water-supply/\">2009 report by the company</a> says it utilises levees to contain tailings in the deposition area, and that the tailings management programme costs Freeport McMoRan $15.5m (\u00a312.7m) each year. According to the report, company monitoring of aquatic life in the rivers found that fish and shrimp were suitable for consumption, as regulated by Indonesian food standards, while water quality samples met Indonesian and US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for dissolved metals. In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">2011 BBC report</a> on alleged pollution in the area surrounding Grasberg, the company says that the tailings management method was chosen because studies showed the environmental impact caused by its waste material was reversible.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere on its website, the company says: \u201cWe are committed to respecting human rights. Our <a href=\"http://www.fcx.com/sd/pdf/hr_policy.pdf\">human rights policy</a> requires us (and our contractors) to conduct business in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to align our human rights due diligence practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles).\u201d</p> <p>The company also emphasises its work with indigenous people in West Papua. A 2015 Freeport McRoRan report on working towards sustainable development said: \u201cPTFI has engaged with indigenous Papuan tribes for decades, including through numerous formal agreements to promote workforce skills training, health, education and basic infrastructure development \u2026 In 2015, PTFI continued to evaluate the effectiveness of alternate options for Kamoro community members whose estuary transport routes are impacted by sedimentation associated with the controlled riverine tailings management system. Provision of smaller sized boats, in addition to 50 passenger vessels, for route flexibility as well as additional local economic development programmes were identified as additional mitigation measures during the year.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the area surrounding the Grasberg mine, many Papuans, struggling for work, find themselves pulled into the bar and sex industries that cater to the miners, particularly around the highland village of Banti. Here brothels and bars line up side by side, allegedly with help from the Indonesian military, who are said to supply sex workers and alcohol, according to a Freeport source who wished to remain anonymous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d89c3b955d48c4b2445d4a472061e1a7be97ebe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d89c3b955d48c4b2445d4a472061e1a7be97ebe8/0_66_3984_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua.

Driven almost entirely by unsafe sex, HIV is also far more prevalent among indigenous Papuans. Yet the existence of only one hospital \u2013 built by Freeport \u2013 means that most people, particularly those in remote highland villages, don\u2019t get the help they need.</p> <p>Late last year, the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, claimed he was willing to work towards a \u201cbetter Papua\u201d: \u201c<a href=\"http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/joko-breaks-silence-security-force-killings-paniai/\">I want to listen to the people\u2019s voices</a>.\u201d</p> <p>However, human rights violations have actually increased since Widodo took power, according to Indonesia\u2019s Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence (Kontras), which has logged <a href=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/301234/indonesian-rights-body-notes-rampant-rights-abuses-in-papua\">1,200 incidents of harassment, beatings, torture and killings of Papuans by Indonesian security forces</a> since his election in 2014.</p> <p>The Indonesian government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
