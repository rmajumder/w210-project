  "<p>The US government confirmed on Thursday it initially withheld a $400m cash payment to Iran in January to maintain leverage over the release of American prisoners.</p> <p>A spokesman for the state department insisted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-attacks-clinton-scandal-us-400-million-iran-nuclear-deal\">payment eventually made in August</a> was not a ransom, and that negotiations over the release of four US prisoners were conducted separately from the settlement of a decades-old account pertaining to a failed arms deal with Iran. </p> <p>The new statement followed a report in the Wall Street Journal stating that the delivery of the cash was contingent upon the American prisoners being freed. The events, which occurred in January, have recently been seized upon by Republicans as evidence that the Obama administration made a ransom payment to Iran in order to secure their release.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the State Department admitted today was the dictionary definition of a ransom payment and a complete contradiction of what they were saying just two weeks ago. Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for this dangerous blunder, which has put a price on the head of every American citizen, shows once again she does not have the judgement to be president,\u201d RNC spokesperson Michael Short said in a statement.</p> <p>The White House has virulently disputed the characterization, pointing out that the transfer was announced in January.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it,\u201d Barack Obama said at a press conference earlier in August.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not pay ransom. We didn\u2019t here, and we won\u2019t in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans have sought to capitalize on recent reports detailing the transaction to undermine the nuclear accord with Iran, to which they remain vehemently opposed. Critics have suggested that the money will be funneled to terrorist groups.</p> <p>The Obama administration has explained that the payment was delivered in a foreign currency because US sanctions restrict the government from dealing with Iran in dollars. There is also a prohibition on banking between the two countries. </p> <p>Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-attacks-clinton-scandal-us-400-million-iran-nuclear-deal\">Donald Trump has also taken advantage of the reports as fodder against Hillary Clinton</a>, the former secretary of state and his Democratic opponent. Clinton played a significant role in initiating early negotiations around the Iran nuclear deal. </p> <p>There has been no evidence, however, to contradict the administration\u2019s claim that the $400m payment was not the result of the longstanding tribunal at the Hague surrounding arm sales as part of an agreement drawn up prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>",

Bannon on Friday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily that Breitbart News was one of the few bright spots in generally dismal media coverage of the Brexit debate.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to think and hope that right across the globe, what we\u2019ve done is to prove that people power \u2014 and we need a few good journalists like Breitbart, writing and talking about these things \u2014 but people power <em>can </em>beat the establishment, if they try hard enough,\u201d said Farage.</p> <p>Bannon congratulated Farage, UKIP, and the rest of the Leave coalition for a hard-won \u201cDavid versus Goliath\u201d victory that seemed impossible at the outset, as portrayed by most U.K. and U.S. media. \u201cIt\u2019s just been extraordinary,\u201d said Bannon, who is the Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it certainly has been,\u201d Farage agreed. \u201cAnd can I just say a massive thanks to Breitbart, on both sides of the pond? Because you guys have been fair with me, and given me a chance to make my arguments. I thank you guys very much indeed for that.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>While Trump has reportedly been receiving Bannon\u2019s counsel for some time, he apparently wasn\u2019t paying too much attention in late June, when he professed ignorance on the Brexit issue but a gut tendency to back Leave.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T16:11:07.585Z\">at 5.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b5d584e4b0c23bfed8ab1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T15:48:33.577Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Long-promised <strong>TV ad buys by the Trump campaign</strong> are finally on the books \u2013 but the numbers aren\u2019t overwhelming:</p> <p>UPDATE: the new numbers are bigger:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mdixon55/status/766328918831992832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> TV buy up to $3.5 million in Fl, NC, OH, and PA. <br><br>$1.3 M of that is Florida.

This morning they have changed their forecast to 348-190 for Clinton, sensing a Democratic drift in the second congressional district in Nebraska, which is one of two states that splits its electoral votes. Do they know what they\u2019re talking about? <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/\">You be the judge</a>. Here\u2019s a bit from their analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are putting Clinton over the 270-mark in the Electoral College (273 electoral votes, to be precise) with states we have classified as Likely Democratic or Safe Democratic. Clinton had previously been at 269 in those categories. To us, this means that Trump has to find a way not just to sweep all Republican states and the remaining states classified Leans Democratic (see our map, below) but to dislodge at least one Likely or Safe Democratic state. Anything can happen over the next dozen weeks, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend betting your children\u2019s college funds on a Trump administration.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sabato map does not detect any tossup states. That judgment is not unique among pros. The map almost exactly resembles FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">polls-plus model</a>, which bakes in polling numbers with other fundamentals such as economic stats and historical data.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a basic version of the map (but visit <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/\">Sabato\u2019s site</a> for subtleties and analysis):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"270\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/Eb4Km&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/presidential_map_new/maps/Eb4Km.png&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/uploads/3rd_party_270_30px.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Click the map to create your own at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/Eb4Km&quot;&gt;270toWin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If you like electoral college maps but haven\u2019t discovered <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">270towin.com</a> yet, <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">visit them</a>, it\u2019s fun.</p> <p>Update: also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/08/18/daily-202-why-florida-is-trump-s-best-swing-state/57b50086cd249a2fe363ba26/?postshare=8261471524775146&amp;tid=ss_tw\">read James Hohman in the Washington Post</a> on why Florida is MR BREXIT!\u2019s \u201cbest swing state\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Florida is the only battleground that moved in Trump\u2019s direction after both conventions. </strong><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136\">Seven states</a> were surveyed by <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist</a> before and after.

  "<p>Oliver Stone looks overwhelmed. It is May 2015, and we are in Munich on the penultimate day of shooting his drama about Edward Snowden. At lunch, the director seems anxious and weary, eyes heavy, shoulders stooped, energy sapped. When the idea of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlSAiI3xMh4\">Snowden</a> was proposed, he explains, he had strongly resisted. Then, slowly and reluctantly, he was drawn in. Today, he sounds as if he might regret that decision. There have been problems with finance, with finding distributors, in portraying something as dull as the cyberworld that Snowden inhabits.</p> <p>\u201cA director has to say everything is great, things are wonderful,\u201d he says, exasperated. \u201cEvery day on a set is a potential disaster. Every day on a film set is the hope that it is turning out well, but the truth is it is just a slog all the way through. It\u2019s the bulldozer going through a treeline. It is not easy. It has never been easy.\u201d</p> <p>This film, in particular, was not easy. \u201cEvery movie I have made is a challenge. But from day one, every day seems to have its obstacles, whether it is computers or the technology being arcane, difficult to understand, or the character of Snowden, who has a strong, robot, nerd quality. It is a drawback. He is not the active type.\u201d As Stone headed back to the set, his final comment expressed his limited ambition for the movie at that time: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt Edward Snowden.\u201d</p> <p>Almost a year later, I meet Stone again, in London. The tiredness is gone. This is a man full of enthusiasm for life and his movie. The editing has gone well, he feels; the previous week a positive reaction had met an early preview in Idaho \u2013 despite his sense of dread.</p> <p>\u201cAs a director, I think the film has a power beyond its details,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cMaybe no one will come. But those people that come will see something they have not seen before. There are no chases. There are no murders. I love tension but there is a different kind of tension \u2026 What Snowden did in history, I believe, will make a difference. I don\u2019t think it is going to go away.\u201d</p> <p>It was a few months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">the story first broke in summer 2013</a> that Stone was approached by Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s lawyer in Russia, about making a movie about his client. It caught him, he says, at a low point. A project about Martin Luther King had failed to come to fruition. He didn\u2019t fancy embarking on another complicated proposition unlikely to make it to the multiplex. Nonetheless, he went to Moscow, met the man himself, and was sufficiently intrigued to do further research and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oliver-stone-options-novel-by-710699\">buy up film rights to Kurcherena\u2019s fictional account of an American whistleblower, Time of the Octopus</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/13/snowden-files-luke-harding-review\">Guardian correspondent Luke Harding\u2019s The Snowden Files</a>.</p> <p>I first met Stone six or so months later, when he visited the Guardian. I was called into the office of the then-editor, Alan Rusbridger, and was pleased at the prospect, never having met a Hollywood director before. This was also one whose films I had enjoyed. There were a handful of us in the room and we chatted for about hour. The reason I was there was that, along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHVO6XL-b7U\">fellow journalists Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald</a>, I had met Snowden in Hong Kong, where he handed over tens of thousands of top-secret US and British documents to us \u2013 one of the biggest leaks in intelligence history \u2013 before going into hiding. Stone wanted to hear the account firsthand. At that point, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the director, but I was impressed by the detail he had already accumulated about Snowden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed9db441ad6e43b5c415785afa78aa8eccfd488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed9db441ad6e43b5c415785afa78aa8eccfd488/0_405_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Stone on the set of his film Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Stone on the set of his film Snowden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J\u00fcrgen Olczyk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I met him next in December 2014, alone over lunch in London. I was half-an-hour late but he did not make a fuss: there was nothing of primadonna to him. Instead, he cracked on with his questions. There were a lot of them. They were followed up with emails and phone calls. I liked this obsessiveness, more journalist than film director; a stubborn pursuit of the unanswered in an effort to complete a picture. In the end, Stone and his co-writer Kieran Fitzgerald interviewed almost everyone involved. He spoke to lawyers, journalists and former members of the NSA. He went to the Ecuadorean embassy in London to talk to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. And he met Snowden\u2019s partner, Lindsay Mills. He went to Moscow at least eight times to meet Snowden.</p> <p>Too much research, Stone says. About 80% had to be ditched. Not time wasted though, he says \u2013 it gave him the clarity he hankered after. We are now back in Munich, two days after the UK general election: a time of great industry and excitement in a newspaper. Filming, by contrast, is boring. I had never been on a movie set before and I am glad I had the chance to see behind the scenes. But I had somehow imagined it might be a bit like a stage performance. It was not. The experience is dull and repetitive. That morning was dominated by Stone shooting Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Snowden, looking out of a hotel window. This was meant to be in Hong Kong; Snowden\u2019s bedroom at the Mira hotel having been recreated in Germany. Gordon-Levitt was filmed looking left to right and then down to the street. Over and over again. Different lighting. Different angles. Different shots. The scene makes it into the movie but only lasts a few seconds. It took four hours.</p> <p>When not looking out of glass, Gordon-Levitt was happy to chat. By then, he had already met Edward and was accurately reproducing his slow, precise speech. The son of west coast liberals, he had fostered an intense interest in Snowden and the arguments around surveillance. Unafraid of public declarations of political intent, Gordon-Levitt was preparing to be an advocate for privacy issues in the press commitments ahead. He has already donated his earnings from the movie to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of whose lawyers is Snowden\u2019s chief representative.</p> <p>Watching the shooting in the mocked-up Hong Kong hotel, I spotted on Snowden\u2019s cluttered table an empty can of Tsingtao beer. But there were never any empties in that room. None of us was drinking at the time; Snowden is teetotal. But I didn\u2019t have the heart to mention it because it was already so far into the shooting and the idea of subjecting them to more hours reshooting felt unimaginable. In the end, though, I can\u2019t remember seeing the stubbie in the final cut.</p> <p>There are other, bigger quibbles. Parts of the film are pure Hollywood. Stone devotes much of the movie to the romance between Snowden and Mills. The way Snowden smuggles data out of the NSA headquarters in Hawaii in a Rubik\u2019s Cube is almost certainly the stuff of thriller fantasy. It is also a straightforward biopic, following Snowden from a failed attempt to join US special forces to a successful career as an NSA computer specialist, through disillusionment and then to being a whistleblower.</p> <p>Yet the broad direction of Snowden is more faithful to the truth than might be expected from Hollywood. Stone is quick to insist he is not a political director or an activist, but a dramatist. A surprise to me, maybe to others also familiar with his work. Yet perhaps what he meant was that he does not want to make anything that would be dull. The film isn\u2019t. But I\u2019m an interested party: I\u2019m depicted in it, and so I hope it does well.</p> <p>I\u2019m most interested in the film\u2019s capacity to shift public opinion about the man whose story it portrays. Attitudes in the US tend to be polarised between those who view him as a traitor and those who see him as a hero. Stone\u2019s film can reach people with little prior knowledge. It humanises its subject, makes complex arguments about the balance between privacy and surveillance immediately understandable. Even those who argue that they are not bothered about potential intrusion into the private lives will likely squirm at a scene in which the central couple are having sex \u2013 but then Snowden hesitates, spotting an open laptop, wondering if anyone might be watching through the webcam. (The incident is based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-interview-rusbridger-macaskill\">an interview with the Guardian</a> in which Snowden said surveillance agencies do engage in such voyeurism.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7942fde07c7fbbf280430de21c40fbdb25a6f5d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7942fde07c7fbbf280430de21c40fbdb25a6f5d9/0_0_2048_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden and Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills in Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden and Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills in Snowden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Open Road Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will Snowden shift opinion? \u201cI hope so,\u201d Stone says, a touch uncertain. \u201cIt is tricky,\u201d he qualifies. In fact, his film may give some of the more zealous anti-surveillance campaigners pause for thought. One of the more unexpected subtleties in the film comes with its portrayal of the NSA, where differing views about the balance between privacy and security are permitted \u2013 embraced, even.</p> <p>\u201cEd never revealed real people to us,\u201d said Stone. \u201cBut he gave us ideas about real people and events from which we could draw and make \u2013 with dramatic licence \u2013 conclusions that would not be too far-fetched. We tried over many drafts to make it as realistic as possible.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSA have human souls,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are not all James Bond villains.\u201d He was not smiling; he meant it.</p> <p>Yet his own allegiances lie with the whistleblower; his undoubted aim is to caution the unaware about what he calls \u201cthe surveillance state\u201d. \u201cI think we are all facing problems of an Orwellian super\u2013organisation that is running the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that is politics!\u201d He is disappointed that the issue has surfaced so little in the US election campaign so far \u2013 its sole appearance at that point was in a Democratic candidates\u2019 debate. Stone backed Bernie Sanders (and is also a fan of Jeremy Corbyn). \u201cHillary Clinton has no mercy in her soul for Snowden,\u201d he says, also murmuring uneasily about her \u201chardcore warmongering tactics\u201d.</p> <p>Snowden will be released in the US two months before a new president is elected, and a day after Stone\u2019s 70th birthday. Its fate will be decided then. But what of the most important opinion, that of Snowden himself? His instinct when he worked at the NSA was to keep a low profile \u2013 presumably he would have been mortified at the prospect of a movie about him. And he remains an essentially private person, happy to talk about technology and surveillance, but guarding details about his own life. The world of the celebrity is not one he would be comfortable with.</p> <p>Stone hints that Snowden liked the movie \u2013 and his cooperatation suggests he is onside. His real pleasure in it, though, may be like mine. In April, the trailer was released. Snowden tweeted: \u201cFor two minutes and 39 seconds, everybody at NSA just stopped working.\u201d</p> <h2>His accent is good, if more Edinburgh than my Glasgow glottal stop</h2> <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill meets Tom Wilkinson, the man who plays him in Snowden</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c86b87fcd5907e9f2b65a471f81697bb3244387c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c86b87fcd5907e9f2b65a471f81697bb3244387c/0_118_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Wilkinson as Ewen MacAskill in Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Wilkinson as Ewen MacAskill in Snowden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Open Road Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After seeing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/16/citizen-four-review-edward-snowden-documentary\">Oscar-winning movie Citizenfour</a>, a Guardian colleague offered up his verdict: \u201cThe guy playing you is rubbish.\u201d It was a joke, I hope; the guy playing me is me, as Citizenfour is a documentary.</p> <p>Released in 2014, Citizenfour recorded a meeting between NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden with three journalists, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and myself, in Hong Kong in 2013. Oliver Stone\u2019s Snowden is different. Actors take most of the roles, including Tom Wilkinson as me.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have been comfortable with a low profile, hiding behind print. That has not survived the Snowden story, which has so far spawned three plays, several documentaries and now a Hollywood movie.</p> <p>My part in all of them is relatively small. Even so, the first time I went to see myself played by an actor \u2013 Jonathan Coy, in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/23/privacy-review-donmar-warehouse-london\"> James Graham\u2019s Privacy at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014</a> \u2013 I felt a mixture of both embarrassment and dread, not least because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/23/relief-portrayal-privacy-new-play-james-graham\">I had to write about it</a>. But Coy did a good job and I began to relax after he delivered the first of his lines. I had met the actor before on what I thought was a social occasion \u2013 in fact, he was scoping me, picking up mannerisms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/23/relief-portrayal-privacy-new-play-james-graham\">Fear, then relief, at my portrayal in new play Privacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It gave me a strange taste for this strangest experience. When I flew to Munich to visit the set of Snowden, two things were uppermost in my mind. The first: would my small role survive the final cut? The second: would I keep my Scottish accent? Stone might have opted for American, or even English.</p> <p>In a break on set during a thunderstorm, I met the man playing me: Tom Wilkinson. He confirmed he stuck with Scottish. \u201cIt is always an accent I have never had any problems with,\u201d he said. \u201cI am good with accents in a way and Scottish is apparently one of them.\u201d And his accent is good, if a little more Edinburgh than my Glasgow glottal stop. Plus, he refers to Snowden in the movie as \u201claddie\u201d. Not a term I would ever employ.</p> <p>One of the biggest differences between being portrayed on stage and on film is that the language in the play was mine, recorded verbatim, while that in Snowden is invented.</p> <p>At one point in the real meeting in the Mira hotel, Snowden covered himself and his laptop with a red hood. He wanted to hide his password from any hidden cameras, he explained later. Even at the time it seemed odd behaviour and myself and Glenn are caught in Citizenfour exchanging puzzled, uneasy glances.</p> <p>In the movie, I offer up a quip as Snowden pulls the hood over his head, something like, \u201cDo we all get under that?\u201d, which I did not say. Stone repeatedly stressed to me he was making a movie and had to make it interesting. Me just taking notes in a chair, he said kindly, just wasn\u2019t particularly exciting. He needed action.</p> <p>There\u2019s another striking line in which I call the Guardian to tell them that \u201cThe Guinness is good\u201d \u2013 a pre-arranged signal that the whistleblower was genuine, not a crank. In fact, I did say that in real life. And, oddly, it was scripted, the brainchild of then-Guardian US editor Janine Gibson, who is played here by Joely Richardson.</p> <p>The film shows me nodding off. This is accurate, too \u2013 but it happened later than the scenes shown. Neither Glenn, Laura or myself got much sleep for a week. It was only when Snowden went into hiding that I began to relax and started falling asleep all over the place.</p> <p>As for Wilkinson, he was less exercised by the themes behind the film than his director or co-star, but he recalled with excitement the coverage in the Guardian when the story broke, and is sympathetic towards the man. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is a traitor,\u201d he says, quiet and considered. \u201cYou need someone like that. I think all people who put themselves out on a limb to the extent to which he has have a simplicity of outlook that eludes the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the summer, I saw a preview of the film with my colleague Luke Harding, on whose book much of the movie is based. Afterwards, I asked him how accurate he felt the Wilkinson portrayal was. A fearless foreign correspondent confronting the powerful forces of the US and British intelligence services \u2013 right? Luke\u2019s verdict: \u201cYou looked a bit dopey.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Snowden premieres at the Toronto film festival on 10 September, opens in the US on 16 September and in the UK later in the year</em></p>",
  "<p>The stakes of Wednesday night\u2019s CNN Green party town hall were high \u2013 third-party candidates are rarely allowed entry into the corporate media universe, which thrives on the false narrative that only two parties exist here in the United States. </p> <p>This was perhaps the only opportunity the presidential candidate I have endorsed \u2013 Jill Stein \u2013 and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, to have the ear of a large portion of the mainstream American electorate. There was little room for error.</p> <p>They spent little time directly criticizing Donald Trump. This was a wise move, since virtually no one among Stein\u2019s potential base of support is considering Trump as a viable option. Instead, she focused on Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>At a moment where the Clinton campaign is still attempting to secure the support of frustrated Bernie Sanders primary voters, Stein demonstrated that Clinton\u2019s brand of liberalism does not represent the tone or spirit of the Sanders campaign. By highlighting Clinton\u2019s pro-corporate politics and active role in hawkish foreign policy, Stein raised considerable doubt about Clinton\u2019s leftist bona fides.</p> <p>\u201cI will have trouble sleeping at night if Donald Trump is elected,\u201d Stein said. \u201cI will also have trouble sleeping at night if Hillary Clinton is elected.\u201d<br></p> <p>Throughout the event, both Stein and Baraka rightly refuted the idea that superficial identity politics are enough to constitute a progressive movement. Stein destroyed the notion that a vote for Clinton is a feminist move, as Clinton\u2019s pro-war stances and neoliberal economic policies have compromised the lives and prosperity of women and families around the globe. Baraka drew from Barack Obama\u2019s presidential record to show that electing a black president has not signaled a turn away from anti-black racism at the systemic or interpersonal levels.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Stein also raised doubts about Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness. While these arguments are not new, they carried a different level of veracity when separated from the hypocritical and sexist \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d rhetoric of the Trump campaign. Drawing from Clinton\u2019s own anti-Trump playbook, Stein used Clinton\u2019s email scandal and missteps abroad as a springboard to question Clinton\u2019s judgment. </p> <p>Of course, such critiques would have been more effective if the possibility of a nuclear armed Trump weren\u2019t lingering in the back of voter\u2019s minds, but they nonetheless focused appropriate scrutiny to the secretary\u2019s actions.</p> <p>But Stein and Baraka did not merely tell voters what to vote against, they also gave them something to vote for.</p> <p>Throughout the night, the candidates used their time to articulate the Green party\u2019s vision for the future. Specifically, Stein talked about workable plans to create peace in the Middle East, a plan that includes nuclear disarmament, a call to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and a loosening of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization\u2019s economic strangleholds on the globe\u2019s most vulnerable nations. </p> <p>Baraka offered a workable vision of a nation without state violence, inner cities without police as occupying forces and vulnerable citizens not viewed as enemy combatants. For the first time since Bernie Sanders stepped out of the Democratic race, the American public was given an opportunity to dream out loud for a few hours about freedom, justice and true democracy.</p> <p>Despite the town hall\u2019s success, the Green party has a long way to go to snag a significant slice of undecided, Independent and Clinton-leaning voters. The challenge of the Stein-Baraka campaign will be to convince voters of a long-term political vision, one that isn\u2019t prisoner to our collective obsession with individual elections or hyperbolic fear of particular candidates. </p> <p>They will have to persuade voters to believe that the two-party system, when underwritten by endless corporate money, does not offer the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d but a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Surely, they have a long way to go to achieve these goals. But they\u2019ve made an incredible start.</p>",
  "<p>Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein has sought to quash a \u201cridiculous\u201d perception that she is anti-vaccines, during a televised town hall meeting where she denounced both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.<br></p> <p>Stein, a Massachusetts physician, has recently been plagued by accusations that she rejects the mainstream scientific view that vaccines are fundamentally safe. She has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/29/jill-stein-on-vaccines-people-have-real-questions/\">said</a> that there are \u201creal questions\u201d about corporate influence over vaccines and that there is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ixbr5/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_candidate_for/d31ydoe\">widespread distrust of the medical-industrial complex</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But in a CNN town hall event on Wednesday, Stein said her statements have been taking out of context and that previous concerns over mercury in vaccines have now been resolved.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s kind of an effort to divert the conversation from our actual agenda, because the idea that I oppose vaccines is completely ridiculous, or that I\u2019m anti-science,\u201d Stein said.</p> <p>\u201cI am certainly not hostile to science. I\u2019m not anti-science. I believe that asking questions is part of our responsibility as scientists. And as physicians, we always need to be asking those questions.\u201d</p> <p>Stein spent much of the televised question-and-answer session lambasting Trump and in particular Clinton, stating that she will \u201chave trouble sleeping at night\u201d if either the Republican or Democratic candidate is elected.</p> <p>\u201cAs despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Donald Trump, you know, bashes immigrants and is a xenophobic and racist loudmouth, but Hillary Clinton, you know, has been promoting these wars that have killed a million black and brown people in Iraq, for example.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democratic Party has become the party of deportation and detentions and night raids with, you know, millions of people deported under Barack Obama.\u201d</p> <p>Stein said Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state violated rules \u201cwith a sense of impunity\u201d, and she accused the Democratic candidate of organizing a \u201csmear\u201d against erstwhile opponent Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cBernie did everything right, and his supporters did everything right, but the playing field was really steeply and unfairly tilted against you,\u201d said Stein, who has actively courted Sanders supporters and the man himself, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/jill-stein-bernie-sanders-green-party\">offering to stand aside</a> as the Green party candidate in favor of him. </p> <p>\u201cMany people have looked to us from Bernie\u2019s campaign as Plan B, so that if they ran into trouble, they could continue building this revolutionary campaign, but now all the stronger for being inside of a revolutionary party that supports the work that you\u2019re doing and will continue to build it until we prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Stein said her campaign is largely aimed at 43 million young people who would benefit from her policy of abolishing student debt through the Federal Reserve. The Green party candidate also wants the US to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030, introduce a single-payer public health insurance program, establish a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage and slash military spending by \u201cat least\u201d 50%.</p> <p>Stein said her running mate, activist Ajamu Baraka, is an \u201cinspirational and passionate advocate for justice and for human rights\u201d. But Baraka, who also appeared at the town hall, was questioned over his previous description of Barack Obama as an \u201cuncle Tom\u201d.</p> <p>Baraka said he used the term to \u201csort of shock people into a more critical look at this individual. And that\u2019s how I did it. And I stand by that, even though it sounds very inflammatory, and provocative, and probably very strange to this massive audience here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Baraka also warned that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to deal with Donald Trump even after the election, win or lose, because he is appealing to a social base that is prepared to continue to embrace some of the darker side of humanity\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHis appeal to folks who embrace xenophobia, racism, his bigotry around religion, the unfortunate reality is that it has resonated with some elements of the society,\u201d Baraka said.</p> <p>Stein\u2019s initial goal is to break through 15% in opinion polling in order to take the stage with Trump and Clinton during the presidential debates. This appears to be an optimistic target, however, given that recent polling puts the Green party candidate <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">under 5%</a>. </p> <p>A new Public Policy Polling survey of Texas voters found that Stein<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/291759-poll-jill-stein-tied-with-harambe-trailing-deez-nutz-in-texas\"> is tied</a> with Harambe, a western lowland gorilla shot and killed at Cincinnati zoo in May, at 2%.</p>",

There are some clues. First, it\u2019s clear that Trump is an ardent supporter of the leave campaign \u2013 or at least, he became one when he finally found out what it was.</p> <p>When Trump was asked by journalist Michael Wolff for a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/donald-trump-conversation-politics-dark-898465\">Hollywood Reporter</a> interview published in June what he thought about Brexit, he was flummoxed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnd Brexit?

Immigration \u201chas been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/donald-trump-brexit-222874#ixzz4HhECYHSg\">a horrible thing</a>\u201d for Britain, he told Fox News. \u201cA lot of that was pushed by the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And after the vote, on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">trip to Scotland</a> to promote his golf course, Trump called the vote \u201ca great victory,\u201d attributing the Brexit vote to immigration and opposition to the \u201cglobal elite\u201d before boarding his gilded private jet to return to the US campaign trail.</p> <p>But why go back to Brexit now? Assuming Trump reads more than his own press cuttings, he may have spotted some news that suggests Brexit has not, as yet, been as catastrophic to the UK economy as first feared.</p> <p>Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve issued the minutes of its latest meeting and mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-brexit\">Brexit 20 times</a>. However, for all its concern the Fed concluded that Brexit had had little impact on the US and global economy. And in the UK, public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\">confidence has rebounded</a> after the Brexit vote, with consumers shrugging off fears of imminent doom.</p> <p>Of course, the consequences of Brexit (or a Trump victory) will play out over years, not weeks. All of Britain\u2019s trade agreements with the EU must now be renegotiated. Top companies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/ford-considers-closing-factories-raising-prices-europe-brexit\">Ford</a> and Goldman Sachs have warned they may cut back or leave the UK following the vote.</p> <p>Back in the US, Trump\u2019s economic policies are under attack and he has been forced to reshuffle his election team in the face of withering polls. But just for a moment this morning, maybe, Trump thought he\u2019d backed a winner. And like the Brexit, he\u2019ll surprise us all come November.</p> <p>Go ahead, call him MR BREXIT.<br></p>",

There\u2019s the sense that the glitz and the hits overshadow the breadth of her songwriting talents \u2013 her back catalogue may be waist-deep in schmaltz, but it\u2019s also studded with lesser-known gems, from 1976\u2019s country-rocker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7sNWMvLLl4\">Shattered Image</a> to 1971\u2019s masterpiece of pass-aggy vitriol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJoU3EkO51A\">She Never Met a Man She Didn\u2019t Like</a> \u2013 and the vague sense that her latterday albums exist mostly to give her a reason to tour. In 2014, Blue Smoke went platinum in the UK, but you do wonder how much that had to do with the 20-track Best of CD bundled with it over here in the wake of her Glastonbury appearance.

Only in the world of Dolly Parton could Forever Love \u2013 a song so laden with sugar that Jamie Oliver may shortly get up a campaign to have it banned \u2013 be considered a thing of classy understatement.</p> <p>That said, the band on Head Over High Heels is tougher sounding than you might expect, and there are moments where things are noticeably pared back: to solo piano on Mama or acoustic guitar and fiddle on Say Forever You\u2019ll Be Mine. You don\u2019t want to spend too much time concentrating on the former\u2019s lyric, which seems designed to bring the men\u2019s rights activists out in a standing ovation \u2013 \u201cshe cooks and cleans and sews \u2026 she\u2019s daddy\u2019s lovin\u2019 wife\u201d \u2013 but the sparse sound gives you a close up look at Parton\u2019s voice, which is in remarkable shape for a 70-year-old, and as idiosyncratic as ever: a quivering, breathy flutter that can variously sound wide-eyed innocent and conspicuously filthy, occasionally in the same song. Kiss It (And Make It Better) starts out as a typical bit of sepia-tinted childhood nostalgia, but ends somewhere else entirely, the title delivered with a knowing wink to camera.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVc07KydYSI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VVc07KydYSI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/12/dolly-parton-tour-hillary-clinton-lgbt-community\">Dolly Parton on the election: 'We could use more boobs in the race'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also shows off her songwriting abilities: the title track, Say Forever You\u2019ll Be Mine and Can\u2019t Be That Wrong are all superior examples of Nashville songcraft. But the latter also reveals the album\u2019s big failing: Parton\u2019s inability to, as she once put it, \u201cleave no rhinestone unturned\u201d. It starts out as a raw cheating ballad, flipping between wracked and defiant, its impact sharpened by being performed by just Parton and a guitar. Then, midway through, there\u2019s a sudden sweep of chimes and the band comes in and the mood changes from flinty and sparse to syrupy and sentimental. It\u2019s frustrating: if Parton would just dial down the kitsch a bit more, she\u2019d have a genuinely fantastic album on her hands.</p> <p>But then Dolly Parton has never done that. Even at her mid-70s peak, the tougher songs were always separated by a sea of slush: on Jolene, the album that produced her two greatest songs, I Will Always Love You and the title track, still had to share space with pretty mawkish filler. Some great songs, some not-so-great songs, an impressively sharp realism that gets submerged beneath corn and goo: perhaps this album does offer pure Dolly Parton after all.</p>",

As framed by Clinton\u2019s campaign, it is a battle for the principles upon which America was founded, in which the question facing voters is whether they would hand the Oval Office to a candidate deemed by members of his own party as fundamentally unfit to lead the nation.</p> <p>It was precisely this message that Biden and Clinton brought with them to a sports facility in Scranton this week, with the vice-president telling more than 3,000 supporters Trump was \u201ctotally, thoroughly unqualified\u201d to assume the role of commander-in-chief.</p> <p>Down the road, at a local coffee shop often frequented by Sanders supporters, a pair of young voters debated whether the anti-Trump missive was enough for them to cast their ballots for Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my issues is she tries to appeal to both left and right at the same time, and that\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s so polarized right now,\u201d said Anna Salerno, a 20-year-old native of Scranton who attends college in New York.</p> <p>Seated across from her was Willie Demyan, a 21-year-old college graduate who characterized Clinton as embracing \u201cmore of a political strategy\u201d that left him questioning whether she was committed to a liberal platform.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I liked about Bernie, he might seem monotonous,\u201d he said, before Salerno completed the sentence for him: \u201cBut you knew he wasn\u2019t going to waver on it.\u201d</p> <p>Salerno nonetheless said she planned to vote for Clinton to shut Trump out of the White House, while Demyan had yet to be convinced.</p> <p>While laying out her agenda at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia last month, Clinton vowed to champion many of the issues injected into the race by Sanders and his progressive base of supporters.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign-shakeup-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v8z9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2663694\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton: Trump's campaign shakeup won't change who he is \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b4ba41e4b0178756b5da27\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/17/160817clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/17/160817clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/17/160817clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign-shakeup-video\">Clinton: Trump\u2019s campaign shakeup won\u2019t change who he is</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>From campaign finance reform and raising the minimum wage to providing debt-free college and regulating Wall Street, the blueprint she provided while accepting the Democratic party\u2019s nomination \u2013 and has carried with her to the stump \u2013 remains very much in line with promises made while tacking left in the primary.</p> <p>If there is any movement toward the center, it appears to be less in substance than it is in tone.

We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere, released last month, is the product of a team of collaborators \u2013 producers, songwriters, a label (<a href=\"http://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/\">Big Machine</a>) also home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jan/13/tim-mcgraw-traditional-country-music-diamond-rings-old-barstools\">Tim McGraw</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPRjqnOjVTc\">Rascal Flatts</a> \u2013 who are helping relaunch Tyler as a modern country newcomer deserving of a place on the charts alongside <a href=\"http://www.dierks.com/\">Dierks Bentley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jasonaldean.com/\">Jason Aldean</a>. Why? Because that\u2019s where the fans are.</p> <p>Country music is presenting new opportunities to artists who once enjoyed non-stop airplay on rock radio playlists but who now have fewer outlets since the format eroded. Besides Tyler, Don Henley, Sheryl Crow, Sammy Hagar, Uncle Kracker, Kid Rock and Aaron Lewis of Staind have all rebooted their fanbase. <a href=\"http://www.dariusrucker.com/\">Darius Rucker</a> of Hootie and the Blowfish launched an entirely new career by turning to Nashville. Within the city lie the publishing houses, major labels and studios that work with collective precision to create and market hits.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IIgzZpuv6A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4IIgzZpuv6A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The county music industry is an insular world which understands its market like a science: by contrast general pop music has no geographic base and therefore is more prone to interruptions in sound, message and cultural quirks. In Nashville, traditions are set from years past. As other genres have splintered into relying on niche platforms such as satellite radio and podcasts, mainstream country music has remained reliably consistent. </p> <p>One reason is down to the city itself. It is an industry town that has done very well in protecting its No 1 asset. The promotional machinery \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.cmaworld.com/cma-music-festival/\">CMA Music Festival</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cmt.com/\">CMT</a>, multiple television awards shows throughout the year, the <a href=\"http://www.opry.com/\">Grand Ole Opry</a> and, of course, terrestrial radio (AM or FM stations) \u2013 is built to create and market stars as well as keep their careers humming for years to come. </p> <p>As one of the most recognizable voices in rock, Tyler doesn\u2019t need respect. But he does need to be heard, which for an artist nearing 70 can be difficult. (He\u2019s 68.) Baby boomers, those aged 52 to 70 in 2016, no longer represent the demographic that advertisers want to reach via terrestrial radio, which has forced many older artists to settle for reaching their fans through alternative media or online. There exists a yawning gap for rock formats on the dial, now controlled largely by three companies: Cumulus Media, CBS Radio and iHeartMedia, the former Clear Channel. Pop, EDM and hip-hop continue to be viewed as the cutting edge and the population surge in Latinos over recent years has resulted in far more stations catering to them, creating more competition for airwaves\u2019 ad dollars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905181428e6cf6ea2d6a454e81b98fad73b95140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905181428e6cf6ea2d6a454e81b98fad73b95140/0_182_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Room for one more on the bandwagon?

Tyler on the Tonight Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So to get on the radio often means jumping the fence to country. The numbers make sense: terrestrial radio still remains the number one way people discover new music, according to <a href=\"http://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2016/\">a 2014 report by research and polling firm Edison Research</a>. Thirty-five percent of US listeners rely on the radio for new music, giving it the edge over streaming services such as Spotify and satellite radio giant Sirius XM. Among listeners aged 12-24, that percentage nearly doubles to 65%, making it a second choice only to YouTube. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Red, White and You sums up the glaring problem with the plug-and-play of Nashville songwriting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But older listeners have discovered country music and are sticking with it. A 2015 report by Nielsen discovered that country is the second-most preferred radio format among listeners aged 25-54 (contemporary pop is first). The same goes for millennial-aged listeners. Overall, terrestrial radio loyalists, regardless of age, prefer country music as their third choice, preceded by news/talk and contemporary pop. Classic rock is a distant seventh.</p> <p>So when Tyler wants the challenge of making a solo record, he is also challenging his fans who tend to be loyal only to the hits. Classic rock radio, the only rock-oriented radio format in the Nielsen top 10, has conditioned them that way, making it difficult for marquee artists to get new music on the air because they\u2019re forced to compete with their old songs. </p> <p>But country radio <em>adores</em> new songs. If anything, the format is criticized for its short attention span because of its churning demand for fresh faces and hit songs that catch fire with audiences.</p> <p>To make the leap to country, Tyler signed with the Big Machine Label Group, the company best known for breaking Taylor Swift. From the start the company put him on the rounds of country music awards shows and he was spotted hanging out at the Bluebird Cafe, the incubator for Nashville songwriters. The connection also helped place his music in areas where he would find a friendly audience, such as events produced by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pbr.com/\">Professional Bull Riders</a> where a song off Tyler\u2019s new album is now aired in arenas before the main attraction and in advertising campaigns.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0n40GVcj64\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d0n40GVcj64?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The credits for the new album are lined with familiar names in modern Nashville. Co-producers T Bone Burnett, Dann Huff and Marti Fredericksen are all veterans from the rock and pop worlds who have crossed over to country while co-producer Jaren Johnston has co-written hits for Tim McGraw and Keith Urban. Providing co-writes with Tyler are also a group of current hitmakers: Hillary Lindsey (Carrie Underwood), Rhett Akins (Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan), Brad and Brett Warren (Tim McGraw, Toby Keith), Chris DeStefano (Jason Aldean, Miranda Lambert) and Alyssa Bonagura, a 28-year-old singer-songwriter whose 2012 ukulele hit <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUFDFePer_c\">I Make My Own Sunshine</a> was first popularized on a Lowe\u2019s commercial that year. </p> <p>Tyler covers that song and doesn\u2019t change a great deal \u2013 the ukulele and handclaps suggest he too wants a piece of the feel-good vibe that permeates much of modern country radio. In fact, much of the album is faithful to that calculation. The acoustic ballads Love Is Your Name and It Ain\u2019t Easy are refreshing new turns for the singer, and for songs with rougher edges like My Own Worst Enemy (\u201cI could play Seagram\u2019s for all the whiskey/And for the tipsy that\u2019s still here on my breath\u201d), Tyler\u2019s vocal rasp suggests a life experience that younger singers are forced to fake.</p> <p>The album fails when it sounds too greased for chart jockeying. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly &amp; Me is the worst of generic southern rock and Sweet Louisiana sounds nothing like it ever came from that state musically \u2013 and no, adding a few seconds of accordion before the bridge won\u2019t do it.</p> <p>But maybe the dumbest song Tyler has ever recorded in his 46-year career is Red, White and You, a song that sums up the glaring problem with the plug-and-play of Nashville songwriting. Here are all the cliches \u2014 name-checking a southern state (Georgia), southern food (sweet potato pie), a classic rocker (Tom Petty), a summer holiday (Fourth of July), an awkward sexual euphemism (\u201cbang, bang baby like the Fourth of July!\u201d), girls in cut-off jeans, jingoistic patriotism and, of course, trucks. Always the trucks. In a different context, this is satire.</p> <p>You can imagine the committee that put Red, White and You together rubbing their hands in anticipation of a summertime smash. Especially with Tyler committing to sing the wink-wink lyric about him \u201cfree-falling into your yum-yum\u201d.</p> <p>Except summer is almost over and the song has already fallen off the charts. Which brings us to a big lesson all classic rock icons need to learn when they blindly go all-in for modern country: Nashville may be the pipeline to the people, but that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t benefit from a great big flushing now and then.</p>",
  "<p>France\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen below 10% for the first time since 2012, offering a boost to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/francois-hollande-vows-to-stand-firm-on-labour-reforms-amid-strife\">staked his political future on creating more jobs</a>. </p> <p>The French statistics body Insee said unemployment on mainland France and its overseas territories fell to 9.9% in the second quarter, from 10.2% in the previous three months. </p> <p>It was the lowest level since the third quarter of 2012, just after Hollande took office.

  "<p>The protest that interrupted Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) on Wednesday was perfectly pitched.

He doesn\u2019t mention the blatant xenophobia that figures like Hanson and Trump invoke in scapegoating minority groups, and the heightened racial tension that this produces. </p> <p>In a way, that makes sense. The Liberal party has shown, at least since the Tampa election of 2001, that it is more than happy to recalibrate the Hansonist message to its own ends. It has been populist on immigration, and ruthlessly orthodox on economics. </p> <p>It has been far more concerned with departures from neoliberal doctrine than with the fate of those \u2013 including children \u2013 who have been imprisoned for seeking asylum in Australia. </p> <p>Since 2001, at crucial moments, it has run on platforms that scapegoat refugees, while doing nothing to ameliorate the economic system that produces a feeling of \u201cdisenfranchisement\u201d among those who have been \u201cleft behind\u201d, and drives some of them into the arms of racist parties. </p> <p>In particular, in 2013, when Tony Abbott won the majority that Malcolm Turnbull has all but lost, he ran a relentlessly negative and cynical campaign that could almost be a prototype for Trumpism. </p> <p>Where Trump promises to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d; Abbott said he would \u201cstop the boats\u201d. Where Abbott promised to \u201cend the waste\u201d, Trump promises to \u201cdo better deals\u201d. While Abbott pandered to climate change denying crackpots, Trump peddles conspiracy theories about his primary opponents. Each energised the rightward edge of his party. </p> <p>And both men have projected hypermasculine public images while prosecuting intensely personal, sexist campaigns against female opponents. While Trump talks about \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d, Abbott yelled about Julia Gillard\u2019s \u201ccriminal government\u201d. </p> <p>Granted, Tony Abbott and Donald Trump have different relationships to their parties\u2019 establishments, but the fact that the Liberals promoted Abbott is not to their credit. </p> <p>Turnbull served as a cabinet minister while all this was going on, and when the opportunity arose to knock off Abbott, he was happy to swoop on the fruits that the 2013 campaign bore. He is complicit in the further entrenchment of racially-inflected scapegoating as the Australian right\u2019s way of doing politics. </p> <p>In office, Turnbull may have wound back the rhetoric, but he hasn\u2019t changed refugee policy at all, and seems unable or unwilling to rein in those members of his party who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/13/senator-cory-bernardi-wins-inquiry-into-halal-and-kosher-certifications\">obsess about halal food</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/17/hell-will-freeze-over-before-i-pull-out-of-reclaim-australias-rally\">attend Reclaim Australia rallies</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/if-malcolm-turnbull-cant-fix-this-mess-tony-abbott-is-available\">If Malcolm Turnbull can't fix this mess, Tony Abbott is available | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he deserves any credit at all, it arises from the fact that his lack of evident enthusiasm in administering these policies has led the likes of <a href=\"http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/malcolm_turnbull_you_are_finished/\">Andrew Bolt to criticise him</a> relentlessly. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Liberal party has been the principal agent in embedding an immigration system, and a kind of ambient public racism, that acts as a <a href=\"http://www.ukipdaily.com/how-australia-stopped-mass-immigration/\">model for populist right wing groups</a> in Europe and elsewhere. (Labor\u2019s craven accommodation of this \u2013 after having initiated mandatory detention in the first place \u2013 is a discussion for another day.)</p> <p>And Turnbull\u2019s solution to the social and economic dislocations that far-right parties exploit is \u2026 more of the same. More free trade agreements, more tax cuts for business, and some vague noises about \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d. </p> <p>None of this suggests that Malcolm Turnbull understands what gives rise to populist revolts. And anyway, no one needs to take his pronouncements on rightwing populist ideas seriously until he stops profiting from them, and closes the bloody camps. </p>",

addresses reputational damage as well as the protection of free speech, a fair trial, and the effectiveness of the CCC\u201d.</p> <p>Media organisations have argued the public airing of corruption complaints to the CCC is instrumental to transparency and the public interest.</p> <p>The Queensland police commissioner, Ian Stewart, in one of the few other submissions backing the status quo, noted that it was a \u201ccomplex issue \u2026 however, the Queensland police service holds the view current practices are appropriate\u201d.</p> <p>This was because they allowed for transparency and there were existing laws and policy around the release of information about complaints, \u201cnotably defamation and public interest disclosure legislation\u201d, Stewart said.</p> <p>He noted that \u201cchanges may impact on the number of complaints (with complainants able to remain anonymous)\u201d and questioned the \u201cimpact of investigations and or enforcement of any breach of new legislation\u201d for police and the CCC.</p> <p>The Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales \u2013 which has a history of holding many more public corruption inquiries than the CCC \u2013 said it had \u201cno recent experience\u201d of the problem of corruption complaints aired during election campaigns.</p> <p>Past concerns about politically motivated complaints appeared to have been dealt with by Icac raising the issue directly with MPs and parties in 1999, and then issuing a brochure during local government elections in 2004. </p> <p>\u201cIt does not appear from Icac records there has been a need to repeat these exercises for subsequent state or local government elections,\u201d the commissioner, Megan Latham, said.</p> <p>The LNP in its submission said similar efforts in Queensland had failed to prevent \u201crepeated abuses of the corrupt conduct complaints and notification system in the pursuit of short-term political advantage\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTime and again persons and entities involved in the politics of Queensland have made complaints alleging corruption on the part of a political opponent for the purpose \u2026 of being able then to disseminate the fact that the complaint had been made, often without details or an analysis of its merits,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Media reporting of such cases \u201cwill usually lead to great reputational harm to the impugned person, and will often yield significant political advantage for the proponents of the complaint\u201d.</p> <p>The LNP argued changes to stop CCC complaints or investigations being publicised would not stifle public debate, as complainants could still make their allegations public, if not the fact of their complaint.</p> <p>The referral of Campbell Newman to the corruption watchdog during the 2012 state election campaign by the then premier, Anna Bligh, was a bitter bone of contention for the LNP. </p> <p>The watchdog, examining allegations about Newman\u2019s dealings while Brisbane lord mayor with an office in a building linked to his family, ruled there was no evidence of official misconduct and he went on to become premier.</p> <p>The Council for Civil Liberties said defamation laws were an expensive and time consuming remedy for targets of vexatious complaints. It supported a sanction similar to South Australia, where an individual faces a fine of up to $30,000 for breaching the confidentiality of official corruption complaints.</p> <p>The secrecy obligation is waived once the South Australian corruption watchdog finishes investigations, holds public hearings, finds sufficient evidence to charge or discipline targets of complaints, or the supreme court or the targets themselves authorise disclosure. </p> <p>The former LNP opposition leader Lawrence Springborg, in a submission as chair of the parliamentary crime and corruption committee, noted the \u201cpractical difficulties involved in enforcing an obligation of confidentiality, especially in relation to complaints made anonymously\u201d had been highlighted previously by the committee and the CCC .</p> <p>Springborg said if the proposal for binding secrecy was to be effective, changes needed to be considered to the Public Service Act and Local Government Act to put the same obligations on complainants. </p> <p>\u201cUnless this is done, the potential for abuse of the complaints system will remain,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Queensland Law Society said publicity of corruption complaints \u201cmay result in irreversible damage to individuals\u2019 reputations if the complaints are found to be baseless or vexatious\u201d.</p> <p>Requiring confidentiality in \u201cthe assessment stage of complaints will assist in deterring baseless or politically motivated complaints\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The office of the information commissioner said \u201cin most cases\u201d complaints to CCC or their investigation \u201cshould not be disclosed [as] it may unfairly impugn a person\u2019s reputation and/or may compromise [an] investigation\u201d.</p> <p>But this secrecy would also require changes to the Right To Information Act around the notification of decisions \u201cincluding reasons [for] refusal of access to documents\u201d which would reveal investigations were under way, it said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/21/unions-say-eric-abetz-a-hypocrite-over-concerns-a-federal-icac-would-harm-reputations\">Unions say Eric Abetz a hypocrite over concerns a federal Icac would harm reputations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cynthia Kardell, a solicitor and national president of Whistleblowers Australia, said it would be \u201ca mistake to allow the potential for reputational damage to the subject of the allegations to constrain how the CCC operates because it would open it up to being manipulated by equally powerful players in private\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf the subsequent public debate wrongly tends to elevate the credibility of the complaint or the complainant, then that should not influence what the CCC does either.
