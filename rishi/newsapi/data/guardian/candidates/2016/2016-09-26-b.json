  "<p>Something crazy is going on with Will &amp; Grace. After posting <a href=\"http://www.newnownext.com/will-and-grace-cast-reunion/09/2016/\">a flurry of pictures</a> on Instagram of the old cast hanging out, all four principals \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricMcCormack/status/780217838292258817/photo/1\">Eric McCormack</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeanHayes/status/780204464590368768/photo/1\">Sean Hayes</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DebraMessing/status/780224449664737280/photo/1\">Debra Messing</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeganOMullally/status/780214386120011777/photo/1\">Megan Mullally</a> \u2013 posted pictures of themselves revisiting the set that made the show famous. Then there was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeanHayes/status/780480101750218752\">the shot of all four of them</a> on the couch that said: \u201cWe\u2019re baaaaaaack.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DebraMessing/status/780455578934050816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/L24cLigaTH\">pic.twitter.com/L24cLigaTH</a></p>&mdash; Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DebraMessing/status/780455578934050816\">September 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The most leading tweet came from Messing, who said that something \u201cBIG\u201d was about to be announced. That seems to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DebraMessing/status/780455578934050816\">a video</a> both she and Hayes shared on Twitter. It appears to be an action movie trailer that says: \u201cA band of heroes will assemble. To protect the world from aliens and destruction. Only an act of grace can save them. In their battle for what is right. Only they can bring America back from the brink.\u201d This contains the hidden message \u201cWill &amp; Grace is back\u201d, with each of those words highlighted in red through the 20-second trailer. </p> <p>While this would appear to be teasing another season of the classic sitcom, which ran for eight seasons starting in 1998, that might just be fans\u2019 wishful thinking. Considering how successful each actor\u2019s career has been post-sitcom, their dedicating themselves to another season of the show seems unlikely. </p> <p>If we look at both the language of the trailer Messing posted and at her Twitter feed in general, it seems more like the cast is reuniting to help Hillary Clinton in her bid to become the next US president. Messing has been very vocal about her support of the candidate on Twitter. As with most liberals these days, Messing\u2019s support also involves bashing Clinton\u2019s opponent Donald Trump. </p> <p>With the language in the trailer, using Trump\u2019s keyword \u201caliens\u201d and the talk of bringing America back from the brink, it seems as though Messing and company are reuniting to make some sort of video or campaign spot for the former secretary of state. Also, the final seconds of the trailer feature Mullally using her signature Karen Walker squeal to say, \u201cLet\u2019s make America bueno again,\u201d a spin on Trump\u2019s slogan and a swipe at his anti-immigrant rhetoric. </p> <p>These days, 90s nostalgia is one of the most powerful forces on the world, or at least on the internet. If these four actors can harness that energy for the past to get someone elected, then there might be hope for us \u2013 and Clinton \u2013 yet. </p>",

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader and lifelong campaigner against nuclear weapons, has agreed to put to one side any attempt to reverse Labour\u2019s support for renewing Trident in a bid to reduce tensions with unions and rebel MPs.</p> <p>Clive Lewis, the shadow defence secretary, told the Guardian that Labour would continue to scrutinise moves to build a replacement for Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent \u2013 clarifying the leadership position hours after an apparent row on the issue.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI won\u2019t be coming back to conference between now and the next election to try to undo the policy we have on Trident as things stand.\u201d </p> <p>The statement came after a bizarre episode at the party\u2019s annual conference in which Lewis appeared to react angrily after a senior Labour figure altered his speech to delegates at the last minute.<br></p> <p>Seumas Milne, director of strategy and communications, was said to have used the autocue to remove the suggestion that Labour \u201cwould not seek to change\u201d the party\u2019s formal pro-nuclear policy before a general election, in a move that critics claimed was an attempt to tone down the announcement. </p> <p>Sources close to Lewis and Corbyn tried to play down the suggestion of a row, saying instead there were last-minute tweaks to the text of the speech and insisting that there was no divide on policy. </p> <p>They said that Labour\u2019s collective position would remain in support of Trident renewal, but revealed that Corbyn would continue to speak out in opposition in line with his longstanding support of unilateral disarmament.</p> <p>The leader\u2019s closest ally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell</a>, also waded into the debate by insisting that the deal to \u201cpark\u201d any changes on Trident policy was meant to \u201csteady the ship\u201d but insisted that neither he nor Corbyn would be silenced on the issue.<br></p> <p>\u201cOn the Trident issue, as we did with Syria, there are strong differing views so there is always going to be a free vote. Jeremy and I and others will keep on campaigning and arguing the case but we recognise that these are really strong conscience issues,\u201d he told the Guardian. </p> <p>A source suggested that Corbyn had been persuaded because he knew that the renewal had already been passed by a vote in parliament. </p> <p>However, the leader also took the opportunity to pass a new policy through Labour\u2019s national executive committee promising to \u201chonour our international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament\u201d, something that he believes would be breached by the renewal of Trident. </p> <p>\u201cJeremy has not changed his view at all and will not be under any obligation to do so but this is a collective position for the party, it gives us a way forward,\u201d they said. <br></p> <p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC the party\u2019s overarching defence review was continuing.<br></p> <p>It is understood that the issue has been discussed with trade union leaders who fear that Labour\u2019s position will endanger their members\u2019 jobs.</p> <p>But the pledge drew an angry response from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, of which Corbyn is a vice-president and long-term supporter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fc8de4dc8ce7549e9d49758ee77439adca8356f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc8de4dc8ce7549e9d49758ee77439adca8356f/0_199_3676_2206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Labour Party Member of Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn, speaks at Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) event in central London, England, 06 August 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaks at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) event in central London, August 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The organisation accused Lewis of \u201cabandoning the defence review\u201d and defying the democratic wishes of the majority of Labour members.</p> <p>\u201cThere is enormous opposition to Trident replacement within the Labour party and there will be huge disappointment at this U-turn by Clive Lewis,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no doubt that Labour members will work to oppose this disastrous announcement and bring a democratic debate to Labour\u2019s conference next year. This issue is too important for Britain\u2019s future to be left to questions of political tactics.\u201d</p> <p>On the question of Milne\u2019s eleventh-hour intervention, sources suggested that all speeches had to be agreed with the leader\u2019s office, and it was not unusual for there to be last-minute changes. It is understood that Lewis was \u201ca bit frustrated\u201d by the number of late tweaks, although sources insisted that his anger was not linked to the content of the deletions. </p> <p>It is understood that GMB reps, who support Trident renewal, were unaware of the ongoing row within Corbyn\u2019s office over defence policy. Delegates were expecting to hear a speech which would reinforce Lewis\u2019s position of \u201cwait and see\u201d as the party\u2019s defence policy review was concluded. Union insiders were pleased to hear a policy which appeared to reinforce the party\u2019s current policy of calling for the renewal of Trident.</p> <p>In his platform speech, Lewis, a former army officer who served in Afghanistan, said he was \u201csceptical about Trident renewal\u201d along with many of those at conference.</p> <p>\u201cBut I am clear that our party has a policy for Trident renewal,\u201d he added.</p> <p>He said Labour would put multilateral disarmament at the forefront of its defence policy, committing to making headway on the international stage.</p> <p>\u201cWe will make our longstanding multilateralism reality, not rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be working with international organisations, including the UN general assembly first committee on disarmament and international security, within the spirit and the letter of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.\u201d</p> <p>John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow in Furness where the replacement submarines will be built, said: \u201cThis policy is unchangeable now so if this unfortunate behind-the-scenes t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate has made Labour\u2019s leadership confront that reality then I suppose that\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis also used his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">party conference</a> speech to mount a staunch defence of Nato, saying it was in keeping with Labour\u2019s values of \u201ccollectivism, internationalism and the strong defending the weak\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\">Corbyn has been lukewarm about Nato</a> and in the past has called for its membership to disband. Earlier this year, he avoided answering the question of whether he would automatically come to the defence of a Nato ally under attack.</p> <p>However, Lewis, an ally of the leader, made plain he was an outright supporter of the organisation and in a speech to the conference floor earlier in the day pledged as shadow defence secretary to commit the party to the 2% defence spending target met by the Conservatives.</p> <p>\u201cEvery Labour government since Attlee\u2019s has met Nato\u2019s spending target of at least 2% of GDP, every single year. And I confirm today that the next Labour government will do the same, including our UN and peacekeeping obligations,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/calais-migrant-camp-must-go-by-end-of-year-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">visited Calais</a> on Monday, his first visit since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/francois-hollande-wins-french-election\" title=\"\">he came to office</a> in 2012. He promised that the sprawling, inadequate refugee camp would close \u201cby the end of the year\u201d. Last week, President Hollande\u2019s predecessor in the Elys\u00e9e palace, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37428424\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy, also went to Calais</a>, making the kind of radical statements he believes will earn him the sympathy of far-right voters in the run-up to rightwing presidential primaries due in November. French politics is swerving towards populism; identity politics is overtaking most public discourse. And humanitarian concerns for the fate of the migrants in Calais risk being swamped by electoral politics.</p> <p>On his visit, Mr Sarkozy said France risked being \u201coverrun\u201d by migrants, the kind of rhetoric that sits squarely with the views of Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National, Europe\u2019s largest far-right party, whose ideology is increasingly becoming the reference point in France\u2019s political battles. Mr Sarkozy has also suggested that anyone holding a French passport should accept that their ancestors were \u201cthe Gauls\u201d.</p> <p>France is still reeling from the impact of terrorism. Old tensions between ethnic or religious communities have been exacerbated by a wave of paranoia about minorities and migrants, and it is being cynically amplified by politicians. The left is not entirely innocent. President Hollande, who has yet to announce whether he will seek re-election, recently tried to cast himself as the republic\u2019s bulwark against xenophobia by trying, and failing, to rewrite the constitution to introduce measures to strip dual nationals of their citizenship. One far-left presidential candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/11/jean-luc-melenchon-leftwing-enters-french-2017-presidential-race\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,</a> has suggested refugees would do better to stay in their own countries.</p> <p>In this dive to the bottom, Ms Le Pen is the winner: polls indicate she is a racing certainty for the second round of the 2017 elections, while so severely is the left divided, its chances of reaching the second round currently appear close to zero. Like the rest of European social democracy, France\u2019s centre-left sees its base fast eroding. Centrist votes are now being courted by an outsider, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the 38-year-old ex-banker who resigned last month as economics minister to launch the En Marche! (Forward!) political movement. He certainly fascinates the media, but his programme, like his intentions, remains vague.</p> <p>So the main battle is being waged on an increasingly populist right. The exception is Alain Jupp\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/alain-juppe-from-cold-grey-automaton-to-saviour-of-france\" title=\"\">prime minister in the 1990s</a>, whose moderation could be the antidote to Mr Sarkozy\u2019s polarising postures. Mr Jupp\u00e9 believes a steady, principled and inclusive message is the best way to counter the Front National. Elsewhere in Europe, when mainstream politicians have pandered to anti-migrant sentiment, it\u2019s often the populist parties that have gained. That Mr Jupp\u00e9, a 72-year-old Gaullist, looks the best bet against Ms Le Pen says a lot about the weakness of the French left. The stakes have never been higher: and all Europe is watching to see if France\u2019s slide into populism can be averted.</p>",

He was speaking on behalf of Fight for $15, which started off as a campaign for a $15 an hour minimum wage in the fast food sector but which is now <a href=\"http://fightfor15.org/why-we-strike/\">a global minimum wage campaign.</a></p> <p>The international speaker rarely receives much attention, and you won\u2019t see any clips from the speech on the news. But it was the probably best speech anyone has delivered so far from the conference platform, and it explained why support for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda on the left is so strong better than John McDonnell\u2019s speech did.</p> <p>Unfortunately there isn\u2019t a text, but here are some key quotes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a completely different type of economy today, and you can see it in many industries that once gave people a real shot at the middle class.</p> <p>If you look at the airports, it used to be if you worked at an airport, you worked for one of the two or three airlines in the US, no matter if you were selling tickets, or taking tickets, or driving the airplane, or serving drinks on the plane. Today, instead of working for those three or four airlines, you work for a contractor of a contractor of a contractor of the airline. You are four or five or six steps removed the real boss and where the real money is and as a result of that those jobs that in 1975 in the airports, those jobs were union, decent wages, had health insurance, today they make $7.25 an hour, no pension, no health insurance, no nothing.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s worse than that in airports. If you push one of the wheelchairs around, you are not allowed to ask for a tip, but you are allowed to accept them, so because of that you\u2019re only paid two bucks an hour. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like in the US in an industry that was 100% union, where people had decent jobs.</p> <p>Truck drivers, the same story. 1975, virtually every truck driver in the United States was in the Teamsters union. They weren\u2019t rich, it was hard work, but they had a decent life. They had a fair wage. They could hope, if they did everything right, they played by the rules, they could get their kid into school and their kid would live a better life. Today, because of deregulation, the union has been busted. Almost no truck drivers in the United States are in the Teamsters union today. </p> <p>These did not happen by accident. They did not happen because we lack money and it did not happen because it was some false choice. These are choices and priorities that our country made. Last year, just to give you a few examples of some of our choices, the money given out in Wall Street bonuses - not pay, bonuses - was more than the total earnings of every American making the minimum wage. That\u2019s a choice. </p> <p>Today corporate profits make up the largest ever share of the United States economy and wages make up the lowest share. That\u2019s a choice. Today the pay of the average fast food CEO is more than 1,200 times the average fast food worker. That\u2019s also a choice.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1dcd944a39f85ea867983fa862d341d7fa51e57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1dcd944a39f85ea867983fa862d341d7fa51e57/0_91_3459_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Courtney of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Courtney of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94657e4b08ee6d0d2f04f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:03:59.160Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ian Lavery,</strong> the shadow minister for trade unions, appealed to delegates in his speech to the conference to contribute to Labour\u2019s Workplace 2020 consultation on what the world of work will look like in the future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Workplace 2020 ... will be the biggest discussion with working people and employers in a generation.

This means Labour is supporting nuclear rearmament.</p> <p>Lewis has clearly signalled that the Labour leadership will not seek to change Labour policy and appears to have abandoned its defence review conducted extensively over the past year. The majority of Labour members oppose Trident replacement, so where is the democracy in that?</p> <p>Lewis made it clear that this was a decision designed to avoid political attack by the prime minister - but it has merely handed Theresa May support for one of her most controversial projects.</p> <p>There is enormous opposition to Trident replacement within the Labour party and there will be huge disappointment at this U-turn by Clive Lewis.

Some of it sounded a bit technical and dull (or \u201cone for the business pages\u201d, as political reporters would put it) but that level of seriousness is a bonus in a speech from a shadow chancellor. And McDonnell does have a governing philosophy, which he has lifted from Mariana Mazzucato, the economist who sits on Labour\u2019s economic advisory committee. She wrote a well-regarded book called <a href=\"http://marianamazzucato.com/the-entrepreneurial-state/\">The Entrepreneurial State</a>, which now seems to be McDonnell\u2019s routemap.</p> <p>But, given the amount of substance in McDonnell\u2019s speech, it was surprising that the party decided to push the \u00a310 minimum wage as his big announcement. Why? <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/15/story_n_8138900.html\">Because McDonnell announced this a year ago, in what was described as his first policy announcement as shadow chancellor</a>. There was a tiny bit more detail this year, and the policy plays well with a Labour audience, but it was an old one, and it is already generating significant criticism from business.</p> <p>Although some of Corbyn\u2019s individual policies are popular, Labour still polls badly compared to the Tories on the issue of economic credibility.

It was a speech that contained various surprises. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis said Labour would make multilateral disarmament a priority.</strong> Emily Thornberry said the same thing earlier (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8ef7ee4b0831a514026de#block-57e8ef7ee4b0831a514026de\"> 11.01am)</a> and glossed over what this meant for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to commit Labour to unilateral disarmament too. Lewis was a bit more forthcoming, admitting that Labour is divided on this.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As you know, I am sceptical about Trident renewal, as are many here.</p> <p>But I am clear that our Party has a policy for Trident renewal.</p> <p>But I also want to be clear that our Party\u2019s policy is also that we all share the ambition of a nuclear-free world.</p> <p>So we will take steps to make that ambition a reality.</p> <p>So we will make our long-standing multilateralism reality, not rhetoric. We will be working with international organisations, including the United Nations General Assembly First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, within the spirit and the letter of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p> <p>That will stand in stark contrast to the Tories\u2019 lip service on nuclear disarmament; they have not brought forward a single proposal as to how they intend to achieve it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is interesting for two reasons. First, some of Corbyn\u2019s allies have argued that Labour effectively does not have a policy on Trident, because it is subject to review. They made this argument around the time of the Commons vote on Trident. But Lewis is saying that the party does have a policy, and that it is to renew Trident.</p> <p>Second, by stressing Labour\u2019s commitment to multilateral disarmament, as Thornberry did, Lewis may be pointing to a possible compromise that would enable the party to go into the election with a policy backed by Corbyn and the pro-Trident unions. (A policy that says achieving multilateral disarmament is the priority, allowing Corbyn to say he is still committed to getting rid of the UK\u2019s nuclear weapons, and Unite and the GMB to say that the party would not scrap Trident?)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis praised Nato, saying it was a body that embodies Labour values. </strong>(It was set up partly at the behest of Ernest Bevin, Labour\u2019s post-war foreign secretary.) Lewis said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, when I look at our key military alliance \u2013 NATO \u2013 I see an organisation that springs directly from our values: collectivism, internationalism and the strong defending the weak. Its founding charter \u2013 a progressive charter \u2013 includes standing up for democracy and defending human rights. These are values that I believe go to the core of our political identity. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because in the past Corbyn has been very sceptical about Nato. During the Labour leadership contest last year he was initially reluctant to commit to keeping the UK in Nato, although he firmed up his support for Nato after his suggestion that Britain could leave the organisation left him exposed to criticism.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis said that Labour would fulfilling its commitments under Nato, including its collective defence obligations under article 5.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, of course, a Labour government would fulfil our international commitments, including those under Article 5. But let\u2019s be clear: that means both our military and our diplomatic obligations. We cannot have one without the other, and nor should we.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sounds like a rebuke to Corbyn who, at a hustings in August, was reluctant to give this commitment. Asked what the UK would do if Russia invaded a fellow Nato member, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/08/jeremy-corbyns-nato-stance-first-labour-leader\">Corbyn replied:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t wish to go to war. What I want to do is achieve a world where we don\u2019t need to go to war, where there is no need for it. That can be done.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour would maintain defence spending at at least 2% of GDP.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every Labour government since Attlee\u2019s has met NATO\u2019s spending target of at least 2 per cent of GDP, every single year. And I confirm today that the next Labour government will do the same, including our UN and peacekeeping obligations.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is quite a significant commitment. Even David Cameron was unwilling to make this promise before the 2015 election - although the Tories did make the commitment after the election was over. When Liz Kendall (seen as a dreadful Blairite by many Corbynites) launched her (very unsuccessful) leadership campaign in 2015, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32838024\">she also made spending 2% of GDP on defence one of her key proposals.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis, a former soldier who served in Afghanistan, said there was no contradiction between being a socialist and serving in the military.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve found there are some who are surprised to find an Army veteran serving as a Labour MP, as if it was somehow against the values we collectively believe in.</p> <p>But I see no contradiction between my service and my socialism. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd4da515b5ba4ce49c694e1295c0e853d2003e2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4da515b5ba4ce49c694e1295c0e853d2003e2e/0_137_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clive Lewis speaking to the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clive Lewis speaking to the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/26/clive-lewis-labour-committed-to-multilateral-disarmament-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54nv8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2752712\"            data-video-name=\"Clive Lewis: Labour committed to multilateral disarmament \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"YouTube\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e91a7ce4b0f55a9f403605\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/26/26092016CliveLewis_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/26/26092016CliveLewis.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/26/26092016CliveLewis_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/26/clive-lewis-labour-committed-to-multilateral-disarmament-video\">Clive Lewis: Labour committed to multilateral disarmament</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T13:42:36.574Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e8f5d8e4b0831a51402705\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T10:19:38.156Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"102fa89e7b0d7a1b92bf14bc73351573ca43d7a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102fa89e7b0d7a1b92bf14bc73351573ca43d7a0/0_131_5472_3285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Prescott and Dennis Skinner (who used to share a flat in London) together at the Labour conference this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Prescott and Dennis Skinner (who used to share a flat in London) together at the Labour conference this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e8f4bbe4b0f55a9f403520\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T10:16:42.748Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour would 'expand' international aid, says Osamor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In her speech to the conference<strong> Kate Osamor, </strong>the shadow international development secretary, launched a particularly sharp attack on her Tory opposite number which went down well in the hall.

Here is the key extract:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is almost 60 years since a Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary demanded that, when it came to negotiations over nuclear weapons, he not be sent naked into the conference chamber. But people forget what Nye Bevan said beforehand in that famous speech.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is not a question of who is in favour of the bomb, but what is the most effective way of getting the damn thing destroyed. It is the most difficult of all problems facing mankind.\u201d</p> <p>What would Bevan think of the fact that six decades on, we are now further than ever from solving that problem, and that the conference chamber he spoke of lies empty and silent.</p> <p>We all know how irresponsible it would be to ignore the problem of climate change, allow it to get worse, and leave our children and grand-children to worry about the consequences.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we say the same about nuclear weapons which have the power to destroy the world we live in within minutes, not just over decades?</p> <p>So a future Labour government will not just revive talks on multilateral nuclear disarmament among the world\u2019s great powers, we will make the success of those talks the test of our success on foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thornberry was talking about multilateral nuclear disarmament. Corbyn is also committed to unilateral disarmament (getting rid of Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent regardless of what other countries do) but he has not yet persuaded the party to adopt this policy and at the moment the issue is still under review. Thornberry\u2019s speech did not say anything about how the party would resolve this issue.</p> <p>Her speech was also noteworthy for what she said about Corbyn. No other shadow minister speaking from the platform has praised him so lavishly. She told delegates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, I\u2019m so proud to stand here today in Liverpool: a loyal member of Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet in what is now again Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party ...</p> <p>When I was selected for the neighbouring seat [to Corbyn\u2019s] in 2005 we were behind to the Liberals in every poll.</p> <p>On election day, without anyone asking him to, Jeremy left his own constituency and went round by himself knocking on doors in mine, telling voters: \u201cI know you disagreed with Iraq and so did I, so did Emily, we were on the marches together; you\u2019ve got to get out and vote Labour.\u201d I won by 484 votes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got to know Jeremy very well since then and there\u2019s many words I know that sum him up: kindness, generosity, courage. But there\u2019s one above all and that word is integrity.</p> <p>From the constituents he represents in Ronalds Road to the Labour members he represents throughout this country, he is someone we believe in and someone we trust.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> The Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon says this passage went down particularly well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelPDeacon/status/780332568721887232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Emily Thornberry speech at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/lab16?src=hash\">#lab16</a>.

Here are the key points he has made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell ruled out an early shadow cabinet reshuffle.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8cd20e4b03598d1ce8ada#block-57e8cd20e4b03598d1ce8ada\">8.31am.)</a></li> </ul> <p><em>UPDATE AT 3.35PM: </em>A Labour source has been in touch to say that, when John McDonnell ruled out an early shadow cabinet reshuffle on the Today programme this morning, he was not intending to give out that message. So it is possible that we might get a shadow cabinet reshuffle soon after the party conference after all.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that Jeremy Corbyn did campaign hard for a remain vote in the EU referendum - but that he deliberately avoided being \u201cEurophile\u201d.</strong> Alan Johnson, the chair of Labour In Britain, and others have accused Corbyn of adopting a half-hearted approach to campaigning. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/marieleconte/leaked-emails-raise-more-questions-for-corbyn-team-over-eu-c?utm_term=.jeOMVa1ROd#.gevK8DwY72\">Leaked emails have shown that Corbyn\u2019s office repeatedly toned down the pro-EU content in Corbyn\u2019s campaign speeches. </a>Asked about this, McDonnell said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the accusation that Corbyn did not campaign properly for a remain vote.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was really shocked at that ... Not just Alan ... There was this view Jeremy didn\u2019t do enough during the campaign. I saw what he did. He travelled hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles, meetings all around the country. We were knocking on doors all round the country, holding mass meetings as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about why draft speeches were altered, McDonnell said he and Corbyn met Hilary Benn, the then shadow foreign secretary, and Angela Eagle, the then shadow business secretary, last September to explain his approach to the referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We explained to them our view was that the best way of campaigning was to remain, but reform as well, because of the criticisms [of the EU]. If we went solely on a Europhile basis we never stood a chance, particularly in areas outside of London and the south east that felt left behind in the economy overall. So our argument was remain but reform, and create a reform agenda.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell said that Labour wanted the UK to retain \u201caccess\u201d to the single market, casting doubt on the extent of Labour\u2019s opposition to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit</strong>. Yesterday Corbyn told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that he was opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, implying the party would fight to retain full single market membership. When asked about this, McDonnell just said the party wanted \u201caccess to the single market\u201d. When pressed why he would not commit to opposing a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t want to restrict ourselves at the moment in the discussions that we are having with our European colleagues.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell dismissed David Blunkett\u2019s critique of Jeremy Corbyn (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8d4a4e4b0f55a9f4034a8#block-57e8d4a4e4b0f55a9f4034a8\">9.07am),</a> saying Blunkett was \u201ccompletely out of touch\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a lot of time for David but I just think he\u2019s completely out of touch. He should come here and talk to us about the policies we are debating at conference, all of which I think have really mass popular support. In addition to that, he should come, just feel the vibe here, because we\u2019ve got a massive new party now with over 600,000 members wanting to get out on the streets campaigning.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell suggested Labour would be willing to legislate to ensure better conditions for Uber driver. </strong>Asked if Labour supported Uber, as an example of a new, disruptive business start-up, McDonnell said he was concerned that drivers for the company did not have proper job security (because they are self-employed). He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So what you try to do is work with that company to ensure that they do abide by basic standards and employment conditions. If they don\u2019t, then you need to legislate. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour planned to invest \u00a3250bn in the economy.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are setting up a national investment bank. We are putting into that bank \u00a3100bn. Yes, that will be borrowed, but it will be borrowed at the cheapest rates in our history. That will lever in, at the average leverage rate, another \u00a3150bn. And we will use that to invest in our infrastructure, in our skills and we will be working with entrepreneurs. </p> </blockquote> <p>During his leadership campaign Corbyn talked about <a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/economy\">a \u00a3500bn investment programme. </a>He confirmed this figure on the Marr Show yesterday. Asked why McDonnell was just highlighting the proposed \u00a3250bn investment, a spokesman for him said that he was only talking about one aspect of the Corbyn plan. The investment programme has not been cut by \u00a3250bn overnight.</p> <p>McDonnell also insisted his investment plans would not lead higher taxes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Short term interventions like that do pay dividends pretty quickly. We think we can get growth growing very quickly in this economy and it will then pay for itself. So in the short term, yes there will be some increased costs, but borrowing at the moment is extremely low-cost.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said business backed Labour\u2019s general approach to the economy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been meeting with the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Chambers of Commerce, and we are all on the same page. You need government working with the private sector hand in hand, looking at where investment\u2019s needed - particularly in research and development - and then you develop the products and the markets that enable us to compete effectively with our European and other global competitors. I think that\u2019s the modern way of how you do business in government.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to apologise for calling Esther McVey, the Conservative former disabilities minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/mcdonnell-defends-calling-female-mp-stain-of-inhumanity-esther-mcvey\">a \u201cstain of inhumanity\u201d.</a> </strong>He said he was expressing the anger that people felt about McVey\u2019s disability cuts when he used the phrase in the Commons.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not apologising for the words I used in parliamentary debate.

There has to be a credible opposition party, one that the wider public can trust. </p> <p>If not, there will be a permanent Conservative majority in the Commons, with nobody to keep the government honest and accountable.</p> <p>And even for the most dyed-in-the-wool Tories that is very bad news.

He has been giving interviews this morning and is about to appear on the Today programme. I will be covering that in detail.</p> <p>Overnight McDonnell and <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, have announced that a future Labour government would compensate deprived regions for any funding they will lose when the UK leaves the EU. The government has promised to make good this shortfall up to 2020, but not beyond that. Labour would continue to compensate them \u201cinto the 2020s and beyond\u201d.</p> <p>Making the announcement, Thornberry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the period 2014 to 2020, the UK was allocated \u20ac10.8 billion in structural funding for our most deprived regions and communities. The Tories have given an undertaking hedged in conditions that funding up to 2020 will be protected.</p> <p>For the period after, they have said nothing. That is not good enough. Without long-term certainty over funding, our most deprived regions and communities cannot plan ahead. They cannot attract other investment. They cannot make progress.</p> <p>So thanks to John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, we can guarantee that a future Labour government will make up any shortfall in structural funding into the 2020s and beyond. And the same will go for the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell has already given three interviews this morning.

  "<p>Donald Trump is winning his war on reality, and can thank America\u2019s biggest news outlets for it. Ahead of tonight\u2019s presidential debate, Trump\u2019s campaign has taken umbrage at the idea that NBC Nightly News anchor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/lester-holt-debate-moderator-trump-clinton-fact-check-election\">Lester Holt</a> might fact-check him, or venture to ask follow-up questions. \u201cAll that we\u2019re asking is that, if Donald Trump lies, that it\u2019s pointed out,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, modestly proposed on ABC\u2019s This Week yesterday. \u201cA lot of people,\u201d Trump warned in response, \u201care watching to see whether or not [Holt] succumbs to that pressure.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In terms of fact-checking, the bar to doing my job is currently higher than for a man looking to lead the free world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even more bizarre than Trump\u2019s bullying is that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/presidential-debate-fact-checking-228653\">networks have caved in to it</a>, rejecting calls for live, on-screen fact-checking (with the exception of Bloomberg TV). That task will now fall entirely to Holt, who\u2019s already facing pushback on the idea that he should intervene in the all-too-likely event that Trump spews nonsense.</p> <p>The Commission on Presidential Debates head, Janet Brown, told CNN that, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica,\u201d adding that it\u2019s the \u201ccandidates\u2019 job to fact-check each other \u2013 not the moderator\u2019s job to fact check them\u201d.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, Brown\u2019s argument might hold up: like Lincoln and Douglas did in 1858, two candidates could come together and \u2013 with some loose facilitation \u2013 hash out their visions for America\u2019s future. But this is no normal election, and Trump is no normal candidate.</p> <p>Any journalist with half any eye toward the future of their profession should have more than a few concerns about what Trump\u2019s authoritarianism and aversion to basic accountability will have on their industry. Worth remembering here is that his campaign has seen a reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-battery-charges\">forcibly grabbed</a>, the Washington Post banned and sexist insults launched at women journalists who dare cross him. If Trump does become president, it isn\u2019t too hard to imagine the White House press corps shrinking to Sean Hannity, Milo Yiannopolous and a handful of misogyny-fueled alt-right Redditors.</p> <p>Still, Trump isn\u2019t an aberration so much as an extension of the Republican party\u2019s toxic last 50 years. Even if he loses in November, the racist myth-making that Trump has brought to the mainstream\u2019s surface will linger on \u2013 and it will be the media\u2019s job to call it for what it is.</p> <p>As a young journalist who\u2019s spent most of her career writing for small progressive outlets, the bar to do my job \u2013 fact-checking myself, and being subject to fact-checking from others \u2013 is currently higher than the one set for a man looking to lead the free world. The bar for a Trump success coming into this debate, in fact, might be the lowest of any set for a presidential candidate in history.

  "<p>The shadow defence secretary has said he has no intention of trying to reverse Labour\u2019s policy of supporting the renewal of Trident before the next general election, despite Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opposition to nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Clive Lewis told the Guardian that the party\u2019s existing pro-renewal policy would remain in place unless there were significant changes, such as spiralling costs.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be coming back to conference between now and the next election to try to undo the policy we have on Trident as things stand,\u201d he said, adding that he did, however, plan to \u201cscrutinise and hold the government to account\u201d over the issue.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s remarks came after claims that Corbyn\u2019s chief strategist, Seumas Milne, altered his speech on the autocue before he delivered it, taking out a suggestion from Lewis that he \u201cwould not seek to change\u201d the party\u2019s existing policy. </p> <p>Some reports suggested the shadow minister also reacted angrily after finishing his delivery. </p> <p>A source close to Corbyn said all speeches delivered to conference were agreed by the leader\u2019s office, and did involve some alterations in both directions. But they categorically denied a last-minute change was made on the autocue of which Lewis was unaware.</p> <p> A decision not to challenge Labour\u2019s position over Trident will be seen by some as a concession by the leadership towards the GMB union, which is strongly opposed to any shift in policy.</p> <p>The pledge drew an angry response from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, of which Corbyn is a vice-president and long-term supporter.</p> <p>They accused Lewis of \u201cabandoning the defence review\u201d and defying the democratic wishes of the majority of Labour members.</p> <p>\u201cThere is enormous opposition to Trident replacement within the Labour party and there will be huge disappointment at this U-turn by Clive Lewis,\u201d it said. </p> <p>\u201cWe have no doubt that Labour members will work to oppose this disastrous announcement and bring a democratic debate to Labour\u2019s conference next year. This issue is too important for Britain\u2019s future to be left to questions of political tactics.\u201d</p> <p>The Green party also seized the opportunity to position itself as the only UK-wide party that is anti-Trident.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s co-leader, said: \u201cWhile there are some in the Labour party who are concerned about jobs in the nuclear industry it is crucial that the Labour leadership put forward a post-Trident plan for decent jobs, rather than back down from the principled and practical position of ridding Britain of these weapons.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we must use our position on the international stage to encourage other nations to disarm, but those negotiations should not be at the cost of Britain leading the way by ditching these weapons of mass destruction.\u201d</p> <p>The decision not to challenge Labour\u2019s position on Trident comes alongside a move by Corbyn to get the party\u2019s national executive committee to sign up to 10 policy principles including a commitment to honour the UK\u2019s international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament.</p> <p>Some within the Labour movement argue that this means Trident could not be replaced on a like-for-like basis because it involves the renewing the submarines for nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Lewis, a former army officer who served in Afghanistan, also used his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">party conference</a> speech to mount a staunch defence of Nato, saying it was in keeping with Labour\u2019s values of \u201ccollectivism, internationalism and the strong defending the weak\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\">Corbyn has been lukewarm about Nato</a> and in the past has called for its membership to disband. Earlier this year, he avoided answering the question of whether he would automatically come to the defence of a Nato ally under attack.</p> <p> However, Lewis, an ally of the leader, made plain he was an outright supporter of the organisation and in a speech to the conference floor earlier in the day pledged as shadow defence secretary to commit the party to the 2% defence spending target met by the Conservatives.</p> <p> \u201cEvery Labour government since Attlee\u2019s has met Nato\u2019s spending target of at least 2% of GDP, every single year. And I confirm today that the next Labour government will do the same, including our UN and peacekeeping obligations,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Lewis also said a Labour government would fulfil the UK\u2019s international commitments, including those under Article 5, which would entail coming to the military aid of another Nato country facing attack.</p> <p> He went on to emphasis a policy of multilateral rather than unilateral nuclear disarmament - referring broadly to the party\u2019s pre-existing policy.</p> <p> Lewis said he was \u201csceptical about Trident renewal, as are many here\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBut I am clear that our party has a policy for Trident renewal,\u201d he added.</p> <p> He said Labour would put multilateral disarmament at the forefront of its defence policy, committing to making headway on the international stage.</p> <p> \u201cWe will make our longstanding multilateralism reality, not rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be working with international organisations, including the UN general assembly first committee on disarmament and international security, within the spirit and the letter of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.\u201d</p> <p> Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, had a similar message, saying a future Labour government \u201cwill not just revive talks on multilateral nuclear disarmament among the world\u2019s great powers, we will make the success of those talks the test of our success on foreign policy\u201d.</p>",

Adding in all proposed reforms, to areas such as building codes, emissions standards for trucks and fertilizers, would still see a shortfall of 356m to 924m tonnes by 2025.</p> <p>While the US still has time to close this gap, the study warns that additional measures will probably be required at a time when action on climate change is anathema to Republicans whose presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has called global warming a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/\">hoax</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en\">bullshit</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Greenblatt said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to set ambitious targets, it pushes us to be creative and find ways to meet them.

This is a call to action to ensure we close the remaining gap.\u201d</p> <p>The US has been overtaken by China in recent years as the world\u2019s largest emitter but still expels more than 6.8bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year from energy, transportation and agriculture. While US emissions have <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=26152\">edged downwards</a> over the past decade, Obama\u2019s linchpin climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/10/us-clean-power-plan-setback-will-not-affect-paris-climate-change-deal\">enmeshed in a legal battle</a> waged by leaders of 27 American states. Court hearings over the legality of plan, which would place emissions limits upon each state, begin on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Paris climate deal, which Trump has said the US will exit should he win the presidency, calls for emissions reductions from 195 signatory countries in order to prevent global temperatures rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>However, a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/13/august-ties-with-july-as-hottest-month-on-record\">record-breaking months of heat</a> in 2016 has raised concerns that a more aspirational target of a 1.5C limit is already out of reach.

But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a>. </p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45.9% of the vote while Trump has 43.8%, meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2.1%. </p> <p>Notice how Democrats aren\u2019t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing. </p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck. </p> <p>But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">pointed out</a>, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004).

  "<p>\u2018It has been draining because of my character,\u201d Darren Clarke says as he prepares to captain Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team in a vociferous sporting competition they have dominated recently. The United States are desperate to end a miserable run after losing six of the past seven events and, on home turf this week, at Hazeltine in Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/ryder-cup-us-europe-darren-clarke-davis-love\" title=\"\">the US are favourites against a team</a> in which Clarke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/darren-clarke-ryder-cup-captains-picks-thomas-pieters\" title=\"\">has picked six rookies</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve put my heart and soul into it,\u201d Clarke says intently when we meet a few days before the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-dies-87-peoples-champion-the-king\" title=\"\">Arnold Palmer</a> and on an afternoon when golfing fervour swarms through him. \u201cAm I sleeping well? No \u2013 because I want to give my guys the best opportunity to play well and win. I wake up in the middle of the night and think: \u2018Did I do that? Did I do this?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-dies-87-peoples-champion-the-king\">Arnold Palmer: the people\u2019s champion with an unmistakable aura of greatness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke once told me the biggest flaw in his game was his perfectionism \u2013 and an exhausting pursuit of ideal circumstances that are usually impossible to attain. \u201cVery much so,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cHave I been the same way this time? Totally. I go into great detail to ensure everything possible has been done.\u201d</p> <p>There is a fanatical streak in Clarke \u2013 and he admits readily to having obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder \u2013 but his team are fortunate that their captain is also aware of the vast difference between sport and real life. He has a reputation for being tetchy to some interviewees but Clarke\u2019s layered past is far more interesting than whether or not he is in the mood to be charming. Of course it helps that he is relaxed and hospitable today and we can talk about him growing up amid the Troubles and his reaction to personal devastation.</p> <p>Ten years ago this month he produced one of the most memorable displays of Ryder Cup golf when, only weeks after losing his wife Heather to cancer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/25/rydercup2006.rydercup10\" title=\"\">Clarke won all three of his matches at the K&#xa0;Club</a>. His steely performance was followed by a very human reaction at its tearful conclusion, as victory was tempered by grief. After such tumult, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/nov/28/golf.comment\" title=\"\">which we addressed in an interview that year</a>, Clarke should control his emotions in a mere sporting arena.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the big difference. Ten years ago was incredibly testing. The most pressure I will ever, ever feel is on the first hole of that 2006 Ryder Cup. Walking to that first tee, hitting that first shot, the world watching so soon after losing Heather, was like nothing else. Nothing compares to that intensity. Down the stretch at the Open in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/17/open-2011-darren-clarke-wins\" title=\"\">when Clarke won his only major</a>], did that experience help me win? I guess it did. The Ryder Cup first tee is a place where very few people get to stand and, in 2006, the pressure was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke smiles at the tears that followed \u2013 when he said men from County Tyrone were not meant to cry or hug one another. But his emotion was uncorked after his singles opponent Zach Johnson conceded the putt that gave Clarke the win. \u201cIt was a lovely gesture which meant so much. I will cherish forever the support I got from my team and the Americans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All I ask for is etiquette when our team hit their shots. Home support is an integral part of the Ryder Cup</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This week a fevered home crowd will provide partisan support but Clarke is suitably sanguine. \u201cAll I ask for is etiquette when our team hit their shots. Home support is an integral part of the Ryder Cup and creates its unique atmosphere. It\u2019s going to be loud because Davis Love III [the USA captain] and his team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/10/davis-love-iii-ryder-cup-wildcards-darren-clarke-hazeltine\" title=\"\">want to win it back</a>. But it\u2019s a huge compliment to Europe that America have formulated a taskforce to figure out how to win.</p> <p>\u201cThe atmosphere is going to be right on the edge. But Davis and I have been friends a long time and if anyone moves over that line I\u2019m sure he will step in. If roles are reversed I\u2019ll do exactly that. It\u2019s not life or death. It\u2019s sport \u2013 a game of golf.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s illuminating to meet Clarke in Belfast and to reflect on how far Northern Ireland has moved from sectarian violence. Hearing him talk about a conflict as bloody and tangled as the Troubles underpins his emphasis that the Ryder Cup, which can carry a militaristic jingoism in the US, is nothing more nor less than sporting theatre. \u201cBelfast has a wonderful feel about it these days. There are great restaurants and bars. We\u2019re so far along the peace process that people are too used to it to ever let it go back to how it was.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke grew up 40 miles away in Dungannon and he grimaces when asked if the worst of the Troubles reached his home town. \u201cOh, they did. They were all over the place. Dungannon was right in the middle of an area where lots of dark stuff happened. There was trouble everywhere. Thankfully we\u2019ve come a long way from those dark old days but we didn\u2019t give in to fear. People in Northern Ireland are very resilient. Throughout the Troubles they battled on to live as normally as they could.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup-darren-clarke-hazeltine\">Rory McIlroy excited at prospect of helping boyhood hero Clarke win Ryder Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems incredible that, in Belfast in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/18/carl-frampton-jeremy-parodi-barry-mcguigan\" title=\"\">boxers from Republican areas would be embraced on the Loyalist Shankill Road</a> \u2013 and amateur fighters from fiercely unionist territories were proud to box for Ireland. \u201cGolf was another mixed one,\u201d Clarke stresses. \u201cA few sports were untouched and we all played for Ireland. There is no Northern Irish golf team. Same with boxing, rugby and swimming. I was fortunate to be in two unifying sports. I played rugby and golf and they were inclusive. I was Protestant but it was no problem playing for Ireland. I was lucky because my parents got me travelling around Ireland playing in boys\u2019 tournaments. My eyes were opened to a big and different world and I wasn\u2019t here day in, day out, while the Troubles were raging.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s love of the Ryder Cup coincided with the advent of a European team to replace Great Britain and Ireland as the USA\u2019s opponents. \u201cI was born in 1968 and swept up in the Ryder Cup as a teenager. Seve [Ballesteros] changed everything when Europe became part of the Ryder Cup [in 1979] and it\u2019s grown massively.\u201d</p> <p>The 2016 Ryder Cup is being held only weeks before a US election where, disturbingly, Donald Trump harbours hopes of becoming president while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/21/ryder-cup-donald-trump-brexit-usa-europe\" title=\"\">Britain and Europe are still absorbing the Brexit fallout</a>. Clarke, unsurprisingly, does not indulge in Brexit discussions. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d he&#xa0;stonewalls.</p> <p>Surely the European players talk about Brexit? \u201cNo. Our game is global. At the end of the day we will stand proudly under the European flag. Whether or not the UK is going to be part of the European Union is irrelevant because we\u2019ll always be on the continent of Europe. The Brexit thing is a complete irrelevance.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s final wild-card pick, having added the experience of Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/thomas-pieters-impresses-tiger-woods-darren-clarke-europe-ryder-cup\" title=\"\">boiled down to a choice between Russell Knox</a>, a Scot who is the world No19, and Thomas Pieters, a young Belgian who is 42 in the rankings. Clarke chose Pieters.</p> <p>\u201cRussell is a great player and it was a very difficult phone call. I don\u2019t like letting people down but I go back to 2008 and Nick Faldo didn\u2019t pick me. I was upset but I understood I hadn\u2019t done enough as a qualifier. That was me being philosophical and, maybe, thinking at some stage I might be lucky enough to have to make the same decision. But I understood exactly how Russell was feeling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c578ef5cd498438510e72f8487e454b1cb91e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c578ef5cd498438510e72f8487e454b1cb91e67/38_348_4835_2902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Darren Clarke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Clarke: \u2018Am I sleeping well?

He sent me a really nice text afterwards and massive respect to him for doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke and Pieters played together for the first two days in a Danish tournament \u2013 where the Belgian shot an astonishing opening-round 62. \u201cHe played phenomenally but I\u2019ve been keeping my eye on him a long time because he\u2019s a rare talent. But I hadn\u2019t made my mind up until I watched the way he finished that tournament with birdie, birdie, birdie on the last three holes to win. To do that when you need it most to give yourself the best chance to make the Ryder Cup was very&#xa0;impressive.\u201d</p> <p>He underlines his belief that Pieters has a talent that warrants comparison with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. \u201cYes. Thomas is the same. He\u2019s heading to the very top.\u201d</p> <p>The art of Ryder Cup captaincy resides in selection \u2013 especially in terms of pairings. \u201cI am 90% there in knowing my Friday morning foursomes,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cThe afternoon fourballs are trickier. Midway through those morning matches I\u2019ve got to pick the afternoon pairings. I will have my ideas but I have to be fluid.\u201d</p> <p>The US team are under immense pressure but Clarke will also feel a weight of expectation \u2013 after sustained European supremacy. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way,\u201d he insists. \u201cEach Ryder Cup is a new event. Yes, it would be unprecedented for Europe to win four times in a row. Yes, I would love to add another European victory to the list. If they play the way in which I know they can we\u2019ll have a great chance of winning again. But the past is past.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/ryan-moore-united-states-final-wild-card-ryder-cup-golf\">Ryan Moore named as United States\u2019 final wild card for Ryder Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two years ago, Europe\u2019s captain Paul McGinley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/sep/23/alex-ferguson-ryder-cup-europe\" title=\"\">invited Sir Alex Ferguson</a> to address his Ryder Cup team. Clarke, an ardent Liverpool fan, also met Ferguson at the Masters this year. \u201cI sat down with Fergie for an hour and had a wonderful conversation. To have the opportunity to talk to one of the best managers \u2013 if not the best manager of any sport in the world \u2013 meant an awful lot. I had all my questions ready and taped the whole thing. Some of the answers were expected and some were definitely ones I learnt a lot from. I\u2019ve done the same with lots of people \u2013 from Rory Best at Ulster Rugby to lunch with Michael Vaughan last week. It would be stupid if I wasn\u2019t taking advice from people who\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p> <p>Will he ask a famous character to talk to his team? \u201cI do have someone in mind. I obviously can\u2019t tell you who it My five vice-captains have also been fantastic. I\u2019ve got the experience of Sam Torrance, the straightforwardness of Paul Lawrie, the political correctness of Thomas Bjorn, the passion of Poults [Ian Poulter] and thinking on a different level from Padraig Harrington. It\u2019s a special combination.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years ago, after his emotional victory at the K&#xa0;Club, Clarke apparently drank 24 pints of Guinness on the Sunday night. Does that number seem feasible? \u201cTotally! But this time I will be very reserved in my captain\u2019s role. On Sunday I\u2019ll have a few drinks but I will have commitments on the Monday, so I have to be sensible. But after Monday I get my life back.\u201d</p> <p>It is a life that has been scarred by division and loss, by obsession and death. But now, wrapped up in a consuming sporting drama, Clarke looks as hopeful as he is driven. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very close,\u201d he says, \u201cbut another win for Europe would be wonderful.\u201d</p>",

The supplementary homicide data includes a racial breakdown of murder victims submitted by most, but not all, law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>In 2015, black men were about nine times more likely to be murdered than white men, and black women were three times more likely to be murdered than white women, according to the analysis. </p> <p> Compared with the early 1990s, when the biggest contributors to the crime increase were the country\u2019s largest cities, \u201cit\u2019s slightly smaller cities that are having the biggest impact on rising murders\u201d, said John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor who studies criminal sentencing and incarceration.

Last year, 143 of the city\u2019s murder victims were black men and boys killed with guns, according to data from the police department. Local residents were not optimistic that a debate over a national murder increase would make them safer.</p> <p>\u201cHow do we use that data to elevate the consciousness of our community? How do we use that data to provide the opportunity for people to get meaningful jobs, with livable wages?\u201d said Jeffrey Boyd, a St Louis alderman who has lost three young male relatives to gun violence since 2003.</p> <p>\u201cI have no confidence in our federal government that they will provide an extra dime for anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-update/\" data-alt=\"Murders since 1960\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-update/\">Murders since 1960</a> </figure>  <p>Advocates for criminal justice reform said they worried the one-year uptick would fuel calls for a return to damaging, tough-on-crime policies. The US has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/07/yes-u-s-locks-people-up-at-a-higher-rate-than-any-other-country/\">one of the highest incarceration rates</a> in the world, and both violent crime and mass incarceration disproportionately affect black Americans. </p> <p>The human cost of an overreaction to the murder increase could be \u201ca lot bigger\u201d than the toll of the rising violence itself, Pfaff said. He said he expected the increase to prompt calls for more arrests and more prison time. </p> <p>The wealthier white Americans whose votes help determine crime policy \u201cdon\u2019t tend to be those who feel the costs\u201d, Pfaff said. </p> <p><strong></strong> </p> <p>Early data from large cities this year suggests that 2015\u2019s uptick in murders may not be a single-year increase. A <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/crime-2016-preliminary-analysis\">report from the Brennan Center</a>, analyzing murders in 30 large cities this year, projected an additional 13.1% increase in the murder rates for those cities in 2016, with most of that increase being driven by just three cities: Chicago, Baltimore and Houston. Together, the national large city increases in 2015 and 2016 were projected to drive a 31.5% increase in the murder rate compared with 2014. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence of a national murder wave, yet increases in these select cities are indeed a serious problem,\u201d the Brennan Center report concluded. Chicago alone has seen a close to 50% increase in shootings and murders this year. </p> <p>The FBI director, James Comey, has repeatedly drawn a connection between increasing violence and \u201ca change in how the police are doing their work\u201d due to the continuing nationwide protests over police killings of black citizens. </p> <p>\u201cIn today\u2019s YouTube world, are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime?\u201d he asked in 2015, describing \u201ca chill wind that has blown through law enforcement over the last year\u201d.</p> <p>In May, he suggested the increasing violence could be related to \u201cmarginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers\u201d, and said that police leaders across the country had seen a change in how their officers do their jobs. </p> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s administration has repeatedly rejected any connection between protests over police violence and increasing murders. But a Justice Department-funded report on the 2015 murder increase concluded that there <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/ferguson-effect-homicide-rates-us-crime-study\">might be some connection</a> between public anger over police killings and an increase in community violence. </p> <p>Criminologists caution that crime and violence are highly local, and driven by a tangle of so many different factors that it is nearly impossible to say exactly what causes a given increase or decrease. Crime statistics are also easy to over-dramatize. Murder numbers in a small town, for instance, can be dramatically distorted by a single incident with multiple casualties. A town that typically sees a murder a year will see a 100% increase in murders if it ends the year with two. </p> <p>New York City, which saw more than 2,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, saw just 352 last year, according to New York police department data. Los Angeles, which saw more than 1,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, has seen fewer than 300 in recent years. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e56e37e8dcb6826254bcb9285a380f860fd29d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56e37e8dcb6826254bcb9285a380f860fd29d67/0_176_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"donald trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has attacked the Obama administration for a \u2018rollback of criminal enforcement\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara D Davis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">blamed Obama</a> and his administration for a \u201crollback of criminal enforcement\u201d that has made the country less safe. </p> <p> This criticism is not supported by the FBI\u2019s murder data. Murders have declined through most of Obama\u2019s two terms, with a serious uptick only in his second-to-last year in office. Between 2008, the year before Obama took office, and 2014, murders dropped, with 2,000 fewer Americans murdered in 2014 than in the last year of George W Bush\u2019s administration. </p> <p>Crime experts also cautioned that a single-year uptick was not a trend. \u201cIt\u2019s the curse of success. Because we\u2019re doing better, a similar absolute change will look worse,\u201d Pfaff said.</p> <p>Despite a general downward trend over the past decades, nationwide murder numbers have increased in some recent years. In 2005, for instance, murders increased by 3.67%, according to FBI data, then increased a further 3% in 2006.</p> <p>In October 2006, the Police Executive Research Forum released a <a href=\"http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Critical_Issues_Series/a%20gathering%20storm%20-%20violent%20crime%20in%20america%202006.pdf\">report </a>warning the country about \u201ca gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cViolent crime in many of the nation\u2019s cities, from one coast to the other, has begun to spike upwards,\u201d the report argued. \u201cThe percentage of violent crime in America had the largest single-year increase in 14 years.\u201d</p> <p>The next year, murders resumed a downward trend.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone started freaking out. It was a two-year thing,\u201d Butts said.</p> <p>Criminal justice reform is \u201cone of the greatest civil rights efforts of our time\u201d, said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, the nation\u2019s largest online racial justice organization. <br></p> <p>Trump and other politicians, he said, \u201chave started us down a path to undo long-fought gains in criminal justice reform, and we should not let the positive momentum be derailed by a lack of facts, by fear, by racism and by demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>Even Heather Mac Donald, a conservative crime analyst who saluted Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d focus, said in July that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">inaccurate</a> to blame federal crime policy for murder increases. </p> <p>In general, the president and the federal government have very little power to determine the country\u2019s response to crime and violence. The country has 18,000 local law enforcement agencies of different kinds, including more than <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd13ppp.pdf\">12,000 local police departments</a>, which are largely independent from federal control. Most power to determine crime policy is in the hands of state legislators, and local mayors, police chiefs and prosecutors. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump and Clinton have outlined competing visions of violence prevention,<strong> </strong>with Trump touting a tough-on-crime approach, and Clinton focusing on the need to reform police treatment of black Americans and reduce gun violence through tougher gun control laws. </p> <p>These contrasting views have symbolic importance, but neither Trump nor Clinton would have much direct influence, as president, over how cities and states address violence. The justice department can use federal funding as a carrot or stick for local departments to adopt different policies, but this is a fairly limited tool for pushing top-down changes.</p> <p><em>Jamiles Lartey contributed reporting from St Louis</em></p>",
  "<p>Stephen King has said that listening to Donald Trump\u2019s speeches \u201cis like listening to a piano fall down stairs\u201d, as he admitted that the Republican presidential candidate has a \u201creal shot\u201d of winning this November\u2019s presidential election.</p> <p>The horror novelist was speaking <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/libraryofcongress/videos/10153921112813059/\">at the National book festival in Washington DC</a> on Saturday, where he was being honoured by the Library of Congress for his lifelong work promoting literacy.

Reading is for fun and for me that\u2019s a big deal, but it also sharpens the nose for the unmistakable odour of bullshit,\u201d said King.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in a society where many believe that libraries and other cultural endeavours, everything from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_the_Park_festivals\">Shakespeare in the Park</a> to poetry slams and free concerts, are of minor importance. As if learning to think is a thing that just happens naturally, like learning to walk. Believe me, it\u2019s not. Learning to think is the result of hard work and steady effort.\u201d</p> <p>This \u201cdisregard\u201d for culture, said King, leads to \u201cilliteracy or semi-literacy in a national population where large numbers of people are lazy thinkers without any of that nose for bullshit\u201d.</p> <p>This means, he said, that politicians \u201care allowed to slide by with generalities rather than specifics\u201d, and \u201celected officials who are supposed to be the best, the smartest, often resort to outright misinformation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNote the way that Donald Trump falls back on saying this-and-such is going to be huge or this-and-such is beautiful. Any writer or reader worth his salt will say those words by themselves mean absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump makes me wince not as a Democrat, which I am, but as a writer and reader. Listening to his speeches is like listening to a piano fall down stairs. It\u2019s all dissonance and no music. God, I\u2019m going to miss Obama \u2026 There was poetry, always music, in what he said.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with Ron Charles at the Washington Post, also this weekend, King admitted to being frightened that Trump might actually win this November.</p> <p>\u201cA Trump presidency scares me more than anything else,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/24/master-of-horror-fiction-stephen-king-says-trump-presidency-scares-me-to-death/\">he told Charles</a>. \u201cI would have laughed three or four months ago, but I think that Trump has a real shot. I think that Hillary Clinton has been a lacklustre candidate, frankly, and there\u2019s been a sense of entitlement about her campaign like: \u2018Ah, it\u2019s my turn and I\u2019m running against a buffoon therefore I am already president.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>King, author of novels from It to The Shining, said he believed that the key to the situation was fear. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid the government is going to take away our guns, we\u2019re afraid that Mexico is going to invade the United States, we\u2019re afraid of this, we\u2019re afraid of that, we\u2019re afraid of taxes, we\u2019re afraid of transgender bathrooms \u2013 the whole thing,\u201d he told Charles. \u201cAs long as people are fearful, it\u2019s hard to have a rational discussion.\u201d </p> <p>Speaking at the festival, King also singled out the governor of Maine, his own state, Paul LePage, for criticism. LePage <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-lepage-ziki-fly_us_56c4eaf1e4b0b40245c8e429\">said earlier this year that asylum seekers were bringing the \u201cziki\u201d [LePage\u2019s words] fly to Maine</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/paul-lepage-maine-trump-like-governor\">Paul LePage: is this one outburst too many for Maine's Trump-like governor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe statement is mind-boggling in its own right. That governor LePage might have believed it is more so. That many accept it as a fact is the most mind-boggling of all,\u201d said King, urging his listeners to support reading and libraries, because \u201cthe ability to think clearly and logically leads to good decision-making, and I believe that the ability to think clearly grows along with the ability to read.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor my wife and me, libraries were a lifeline at a time when we could rarely afford books \u2026 and the same is true for others today. We live in a rural state where many, most even, small-town libraries are flat broke. It\u2019s because the small towns can\u2019t afford to support them; and the reason they can\u2019t is because the people in those towns vote for the dough to go to other places. Libraries are not seen as a priority when there are potholes in the road. Sure, cash is tight but it always is,\u201d said King. \u201cThe question becomes how to grow literacy in America, and supporting those small-town libraries is the way my wife and I chose to do it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is a curiously grotesque image. While a tightly packed crowd all took selfies with the Democratic party\u2019s US presidential candidate, a sly photographer slipped around the side. The resulting view is unflattering \u2013 not only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> but the crowd. They all have their backs turned to her while they hold up phones to take pictures of \u2026 themselves, with the blue-suited HRC in the background. No one seems to want a picture just of the candidate. It\u2019s a selfie or nothing. Meanwhile, waving and smiling, Clinton cuts an eerily isolated figure on her little stage, up against the wall, separated from the selfie-shooters by a railing, like a <a href=\"http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2013/february/08/the-truth-behind-francis-bacons-screaming-popes/\">Francis Bacon Pope</a> in his glass booth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-presidential-debate\">Hillary: here\u2019s what you need to do to ace the debate | Carla Sorey-Reed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cue <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/StephenMangan/status/780321160508628992\">jeremiads on Twitter</a> against our stupid, selfish, vacuous age.

It may not quite be the hellish vision of democracy\u2019s death in the echo chamber of digital self-regard that it superficially appears to be.</p> <p>At least I hope so, because Hillary Rodham Clinton is currently the last best hope for western civilisation, the final wall against the coming Age of Trump. If the image this picture seems to present is true, we\u2019re all damned. Looking lost and ignored as people turn their backs on her to preserve their own faces for posterity \u2013 me with that politician! \u2013 the only sane choice in the 2016 US presidential election is visibly lost in trivial-mindedness. What hope of getting her arguments across if the crowd is too distracted by selfies to listen? And if the criterion of victory is going to be celebrity impact in a low-attention-span culture, the horrific truth shows its orange face: in a race to the bottom of modern culture, Trump cannot lose.</p> <p>Yet this picture may not be as bleak a comment on the modern world as all that. It takes a side-view that reveals the comedy of contemporary mores \u2013 but are these people really behaving so very badly? Imagine a photograph of the same scene taken from a different angle, facing the crowd of selfie-seekers full-on. It might be rather moving and impressive. It would show Hillary Clinton in the distance, with a mass of admirers who all face the camera as they take their pictures with her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/millennials-presidential-debate-trump-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54cce\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2745023\"            data-video-name=\"What millennials want to hear from the first presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e57a1fe4b03598d1ce7f96\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/23/160922hofstra_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/23/160922hofstra.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/23/160922hofstra_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/millennials-presidential-debate-trump-hillary-clinton-video\">What millennials want to hear from the first presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For who are we actually seeing here?

Every single photographer in that crowd may be a PhD in political theory who is taking a selfie ironically to send to fellow faculty members at Princeton.

This American election may produce hell or hope. It may leave the entire world in the grip of a very dangerous man, or it may mean that the US gets its first female president to follow its first black president. Our digital age is also being tested. Has the escalation of social media, including the endless sharing of selfies, degraded and destroyed proper political debate?

As Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), points out, it is unusual for trade agreements such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/internationaltrade\">Trans Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) to take center stage in a presidential election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

Public statements by both nominees on key issues, as well as their publicly available lobbying records, have been documented by the Washington DC-based Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and its Opensecrets.org site, which together provide a rich trove of data about the issues major technology companies care about in the context of this year\u2019s elections. </p> <h2>Google: anti-competitiveness, labor issues and copyright</h2> <p>According to CRP, the number one technology company spender on lobbying is Alphabet, the parent company of Google. So far in 2016 (up to the last CRP update on 9 August), Alphabet has already spent $8.04m on lobbying \u2013 putting it on pace to spend a little less than the $16.66m it spent for the whole of 2015. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/google-lobbyists-congress-antitrust-brussels-eu\">Revealed: how Google enlisted members of US Congress it bankrolled to fight $6bn EU antitrust case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The top issues Alphabet attempted to tackle with that money were copyright, patent and trademark issues (a common item for all the tech companies on the list), labor, antitrust and workplace issues, consumer product safety, science and technology \u2013 and homeland security.

The company used that money to lobby on issues around computers and technology, taxes, consumer product safety, transportation and trade. </p> <p>It was also no surprise to see Amazon lobbying on issues related to aviation, airlines and airports \u2013 given its involvement in both the use of drones and shipping goods by air. </p> <h2>Facebook: national security, intelligence and patent law</h2> <p>Facebook is the third-largest lobbying spender, according to CRP, spending $4.97m so far this year. And it has a lot of government issues to care about. </p> <p>Homeland security, intelligence, computers and information technology, copyright, patent and trademark issues \u2013 and taxes \u2013 make up the top five issues on which it has chosen to lobby. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/us-tech-firms-visas-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-immigration\">Facebook, Apple and Amazon to lobby next president over tech worker visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amongst the bills on which Facebook has offered comment is the \u201cRequiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act\u201d \u2013 which the Washington-based Center for Democracy &amp; Technology criticized as requiring \u201call providers of Internet communications services to report to government authorities when they obtain \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of apparent \u2018terrorist activity\u2019 on their services\u201d. </p> <p>Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has also been very active in lobbying for immigration reform.

David Axelrod, the former chief strategist and senior advisor to President Barack Obama, has a great story in his 2015 memoir, <em>Believer,</em> in which he describes a phone conversation with the late Apple cofounder, Steve Jobs \u2013 one in which Jobs appeared to be deeply unimpressed with political media consultants, despite Jobs having requested the meeting after a personal visit from then Senator Barack Obama to Apple\u2019s offices in Cupertino. </p> <p>Axelrod quotes Jobs as saying: \u201cWhat your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

Not surprisingly, its top five issues for lobbying were tied to taxes, copyright, patent and trademark, telecommunications, computers and information technology \u2013 and trade. </p> <p>The copyright issues are understandable given the huge legal battles that Apple has engaged in \u2013 most notably with Samsung \u2013 to preserve the unique elements of its products (a case is before the US supreme court this month).</p>",

Shrink the room.</p> <h2>Use the power of storytelling</h2> <p>In a memorable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUV4Ha_Tf_4\">video</a>, shown at the Democratic national convention, you spoke of your mother being left home alone overnight at age four and walking by herself to a corner cafe to get food. You took your time, you allowed the details of the story to unfold, your emotion was contained yet visible, and through the natural pauses and silences of storytelling, you were able to transfer ownership of the universality of the emotion to the audience \u2013 all in 30 seconds.</p> <p>That story is the cornerstone of my understanding of who you are. You created something more meaningful and stickier than any sound bite \u2013 a story bite. Practice concise stories about yourself or specific individuals that you\u2019ve met on the campaign trail that you can share during the debate to dovetail back into your message. And a bonus: stories are very hard to interrupt.</p> <h2>Put Trump in a trick bag </h2> <p>At Trump\u2019s first interruption, turn to him and graciously say, \u201cI think the audience would appreciate it if we could agree not to interrupt one another. Can we agree on that?\u201d If he agrees, then you have successfully managed him. If he doesn\u2019t, he looks like an uncivilized bully.</p> <p>This one\u2019s a little harder, but it would be a thing of beauty if you could provoke Trump into putting his thin-skinned quick temper or flip-flopping on full display. Perhaps in response to a question about gun control: \u201cWhat kind of person brags that he could shoot someone and not lose voters?\u201d</p> <p>If Trump accuses you of playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d \u2013 own it! We want to see the \u201cgrace and grit\u201d that Meryl Streep referred to when speaking of you at the convention. Seize control of the game: \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Donald, it\u2019s the hand I was dealt. I\u2019ve played it all my life, sometimes with long odds, which makes the victories won even sweeter\u201d.</p> <h2>Do eye contact \u2013 well</h2> <p>During the 3 October 2012, presidential debate, Barack Obama assumed he was off-camera and could safely study his notes while Mitt Romney was answering a question. Instead, Obama was televised non-stop on a split screen. That night, we learned that looking down, even when not speaking, does not inspire confidence. </p> <p>During the primary debates you occasionally fell into the trap of holding \u201cschool teacher\u201d eye contact \u2013 characterized by sharp eye movement intended to rein in an undisciplined class. Darting eyes crack like a whip and smack of an older, judgmental disciplinarian \u2013 a look that\u2019s probably not endearing to millennials. Instead, smoothly and slowly, first turn your head and your eyes will follow.</p> <p>Respond with your head up and with steady eye contact. In the primary debates, Bernie was a master at this. He rarely, if ever, looked down. If he didn\u2019t have an immediate answer, with his head up and eyes steady, he would first validate the question, then hedge with a bit of context while he thought about his answer.</p> <p>Looking down only rarely suggests humility or gathering one\u2019s thoughts. Instead, when the stakes are high, looking down is more likely to be interpreted as a lack of confidence or commitment to what you\u2019re saying \u2013 or condescension, remorse or guilt. None of that is what you\u2019re aiming for in the debate, so keep your head up. Head up, not chin up \u2013 there\u2019s a difference.</p> <h2>Remember who this is about</h2> <p>Most of all, Hillary, remember that the debate is not about Donald. It\u2019s not even about you. It\u2019s about us. Just talk to us. And let us see that you\u2019re enjoying the conversation. </p>",
  "<p>Leading shares are falling back on a cocktail of concerns.</p> <p>Investors are nervous ahead of the debate later between US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as well as uncertain over the state of play of Brexit.

[It] has an attractive and resilient business model, with an attractive 5.6% free cash flow yield, and M&amp;A is a theme, but it has historically traded at a discount to peers, partly as its RevPAR and net system growth have underperformed. </p> <p>... meanwhile there are multiple red flags over the US hotel cycle ... US RevPAR growth has been slowing for some time (2014 8.3%, 2015 6.4%, year to date 2.7%), and we think it will weaken further given declining occupancy, anaemic rate growth, accelerating supply growth, one-fifth of submarkets in RevPAR decline, \u2018compression nights\u2019 analysis suggesting Airbnb now having an impact, and independent hotels outperforming brands. If we match these occupancy/RevPAR trends to the last two cycles, IHG shares are holding up much better. </p> <p>IHG is a quality operator, but when RevPAR turns, all hotel stocks de-rate sharply, which in the last downturn was to 8-9 times EBITDA (versus IHG currently on 12 time 2017e).

UK mortgage approvals came in at their lowest level since January 2015 in August, while in Europe Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low after costly US litigation claims and reported comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel ruling out state aid.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> is 4.9p lower at 166.5p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is down 3.5p at 179.1p.</p> <p>In addition <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong>, down nearly 3% at 54.34p, was hit by a sell note from Goldman Sachs which said it faced increased competition from HSBC and challenger banks with a decline in its mortgage market share.</p> <p>The mortgage approval figures have also left housebuilders lower, with <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> down 6p at 149.5p and <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> 17.4p lower at 479.8p.</p> <p>Moving higher is <strong>Micro Focus</strong>, up 18p to \u00a321.42 as UBS raised its target price from \u00a320.90 to \u00a324.20.</p> <p>Commenting on the market, Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European markets have started the week lower, following Asian markets down, despite a slight recovery in oil prices. The rally in markets started to come unstuck on Friday after investors became significantly more bearish about the prospect of any OPEC deal, with short positions escalating sharply. While oil prices have bounced slightly this morning, on hopes that Saudi Arabia may be prepared to cut output at a later date, fears are growing that oversupply in the oil market will subdue prices for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Possibly the most significant risk event for markets this year, the US election is already compelling and tonight\u2019s first televised US Presidential debate is likely to prove must-watch TV. So far, the only markets and sectors to pay much attention to the upcoming election are US healthcare stocks and Mexican assets - but with a little over a month before November\u2019s vote, investors need to start trying to establish what the result might mean for markets more widely.</p> </blockquote>",

She defended her pro-Israel bona fides in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/donald-trump-israel-aipac-hillary-clinton\">March speech to AIPAC</a>, saying: \u201cI feel so strongly that America can\u2019t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel\u2019s security or survival.\u201d In July 2015, she wrote a public letter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/07/hillary-clinton-anti-israel-boycott-bds-movement\">condemning</a> the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.

In the meeting, Clinton \u201cstressed her commitment to countering attempts to delegitimize Israel, including through the BDS movement\u201d.</p> <p> However, unlike Trump, Clinton did support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">controversial Iran nuclear deal</a> that the US reached in 2015 as a part of an effort to prevent the Iranian regime obtaining nuclear weapons.

  "<p>A lot has been written about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/startups\" title=\"\">startups</a>. It usually involves devoted employees working long hours to deliver explosive growth via ping-pong tables while the head of fun publishes another piece of thought-leadership about inspirational, values-led culture. Some startups are like that, but the amount of coverage they receive is inversely proportional to their number. There is another type of startup \u2013 rudderless, pointless and stuffed with clueless children \u2013 about which we\u2019ve heard little.</p> <p>Over the past five years I\u2019ve worked at two companies, both startups when I joined. One still is, the other has been bought by a multinational giant and just about coughs out a profit. While they could hardly be more different, both were fertile ground for all the qualities listed above \u2013 and more.</p> <p>One of the first problems experienced by fast-growing startups is the need to hire quickly. Ordinary companies have human resources departments with policies and protocols. Startups often have no need for an HR person because they don\u2019t have enough employees to warrant one. So you end up with people hiring their mates without interviews; staff knowing that their friends are going to be made redundant before their friends know; and line managers having to conduct performance reviews of the person they\u2019re going out with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton-working-presenteeism\">Presenteeism is rising fast \u2013 and only bosses can stop it | Peter Cheese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Startups that become successful are also beset by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/jan/16/paula-principle-part-time-holding-women-back\" title=\"\">Peter principle</a> \u2013 the idea that people are promoted to the level of their incompetence. High-growth startups don\u2019t need brilliant employees; they just need employees who don\u2019t screw up. They are like the governments of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state\" title=\"\">rentier states</a> \u2013 in the short term at least, the money is guaranteed. Just don\u2019t accidentally have sex with someone you manage, or invade another country, and you\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>The clueless people in this stratum are then rapidly promoted by the founders because they see them as the loyal veterans who were \u201cthere when we had no office, you guys, remember? Eh! Am I right! Super cool.\u201d</p> <p>I was one of them. In three years I went from an entry-level position to head of department, managing a team of more than 40 people and spending the entire time trying to look as though I knew what I was doing, with a varying degree of success. It\u2019s not that those of us in management were incapable, but any capabilities we had were a happy coincidence rather than justification for our positions.</p> <p>This particular company outgrew its startup label and the adults soon arrived, only to stumble upon the most almighty mess: hundreds of terrible decisions, many of them irreversible, made by people who think <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\" title=\"\">Ebitda</a> is a grime artist. It turns out that adults sometimes have children so they tend not to join startups until they perceive the risks to have lessened. Unless they are the ones who start them, in which case they invariably start yacht shopping and quoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/elon-musk-tesla-space-x-paypal-hyperloop-simulation\" title=\"\">Elon Musk</a>.</p> <p>That leads us to the second big problem of startups, which is the people who start them. A startup without leadership is just a group of people. You might as well be standing at a bus stop. The founder or founders have to understand the product or service, have a vision for where the company is heading, and a strategy to get it there. I\u2019m still not sure how it is possible to start a company and receive millions of dollars in funding without any of those things, but I am here to tell you that it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19e310b231cd48047dd1659a8e8f628d6a21d321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19e310b231cd48047dd1659a8e8f628d6a21d321/238_458_3238_1943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man\u2019s hands on keyboard of laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hunched over a computer, the boss in question would assault the keyboard as though his intended target was the desk beneath it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PhotoAlto / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a normal company, the personality of the boss is usually diluted by the fact that the question of how to successfully run the business was answered a long time ago. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve worked with your fair share of infuriating people, but they are rarely running the whole show \u2013 and if they are, the show rarely consists of 15 people and no audience.</p> <p>It\u2019s very unlikely that the chief executive of an established company would see an advert on the way to work and immediately decide to use it as the basis for an entirely new go-to-market strategy, work on which must begin the second they arrive at the office. In a startup, all it takes for that to happen on a regular basis is for the person in charge to be a capricious narcissist with terrible <a href=\"http://performance-appraisals.org/faq/biasrecency.htm\" title=\"\">recency bias</a>: which, as luck would have it, our chief executive was.</p> <p>A startup founder\u2019s personality problems can manifest themselves in a variety of ways: pathological lying to interviewees and customers about the product; wildly contradictory decision-making; and the voicing of a million ridiculous ideas, every single one of which demands a response. (And because all the ideas are generally so hysterically unworkable, pointless or illegal \u2013 or all three \u2013 the response tends to be no, which of course means that you are the problem.
