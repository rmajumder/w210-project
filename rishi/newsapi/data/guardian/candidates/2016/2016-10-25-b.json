  "<p>A few weeks ago I got a message from a university friend in Ohio. He sent me a <a href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/01-the-lady-vanishes\">podcast interview</a> with Julia Gillard in which she detailed the misogyny she experienced as Australia\u2019s prime minister, and asked, \u201cIs it really like that over there?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Not always. But, unfortunately, yes.</p> <p>As Americans contemplate their first female president, they are curious about how a 21st century, first-world, English-speaking nation handles its first female leader. Understandably, America is looking to Australia\u2019s very recent experience with Gillard. Culturally, the two countries share much. Also, Gillard is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/julia-gillard-from-australias-first-female-prime-minister-to-international-superstar\">good friends</a> with Hillary Clinton and appears in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/julia-gillard-backs-hillary-clinton-us-presidential-campaign-video\">campaign material</a>. Furthermore, Gillard is also often in the US, speaking publicly, and is able to give the American media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/julia-gillard-urges-americans-of-all-parties-to-defend-hillary-clinton-against-sexism\">direct insight</a> into her time in office.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/593xf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836581\"            data-video-name=\"'Nasty women vote': Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e6205e4b0219a00d38178\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024warren_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024warren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024warren_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\">\u2018Nasty women vote\u2019: Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This trend has picked up pace since Clinton was endorsed at the Democratic national convention in July.

She calculated that she didn\u2019t need to confront it because it would fade. Instead, the misogyny grew stronger, louder and uglier. </p> <p>Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, Gillard didn\u2019t recognise the environment around her was growing hotter until it boiled over. Neither did most of us \u2013 as Gillard points out now, no one was seriously calling out the insinuations, insults and jibes, and as a result the pattern of sexist attacks grew bolder and were adopted and legitimised by her political opponents. </p> <p>My university friend also asked if I, as first female premier of New South Wales, experienced the same kind of sexism that Gillard did. The answer is yes: it was different, but yes. </p> <p>For example, my Liberal opponent Barry O\u2019Farrell often described me as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-45695\">the Kim Kardashian of state politics</a>\u201d. Apparently my shared gender and initials with Ms Kardashian meant the TV reality star and I were one and the same, never mind what policies or experience or qualifications I brought to the job of MP, minister and premier. (Mr O\u2019Farrell also used parliament to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-46338\">compare</a> Carmel Tebbutt to a whining puppy and <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barry-ofarrell-accused-of-racial-slur-against-indigenous-labor-frontbencher-linda-burney-20130820-2s93s.html\">to tell Linda Burney</a> she hadn\u2019t achieved her positions on merit, that she could play a hooker on a rugby league team, and to describe her as \u201ccasting her spells\u201d.) </p> <p>When I finally stood up to his Kardashian bullying, the media \u2013 who had said almost nothing about his constant belittlement \u2013 went into <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/keneally-keeps-up-with-kardashians-by-turning-the-jibe-on-ofarrell-20120214-1t49p.html\">meltdown</a> about how I handed it back to him.</p> <p>But I tell you what, he never did it again.</p> <p>Frankly, Australia, that we didn\u2019t stand up for our first female prime minister when the ugly strain of sexism reared its head: that\u2019s on all of us. We deserve the reputation we are gaining in America.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihd7ofrwQX0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ihd7ofrwQX0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julia Gillard labels Tony Abbott a misogynist in 2012. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Weirdly, though, Clinton might be less likely to face Gillard\u2019s fate, because of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s public comments, tweets and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">recorded private conversations</a> are so egregiously disrespecting of women that almost no one can overlook them.

America is acrimoniously divided and she remains an unpopular figure.

She will also have Republican opponents who will find it politically necessary between now and the congressional mid-terms to convince voters, women and men alike, that they aren\u2019t all misogynistic thugs. In short, unlike Gillard, Clinton will be able to call out the sexism when it happens.

In a year that seems ripe for third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.</p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents and a majority (54%) of Republicans took this position, while less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation across class or race.</p> <p>Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican standard bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump\u2019s low rating is more consistent with the Republican party\u2019s own favourability (36%).</p> <p>The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him. Less than half the public (43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.</p> <p>Party affiliation shapes perception. About two in three Republicans believe voter fraud is a bigger problem than voter disenfranchisement, whereas two in three Democrats say eligible voters being denied access is the greater concern. Studies have found cases of voter fraud to be minuscule.</p> <p>The PRRI found that pessimism about the direction of the US is significantly higher today (74%) than it was at this time during the 2012 presidential race, when 57% of the public said the country was on the wrong track.</p> <p>Indeed, there is hankering, at least on one side of the aisle, for a perceived golden age. The 1950s might have been the decade of Soviets launching Sputnik, of anti-communist witch-hunts and of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/28/usa-barack-obama-race\">persistent racial segregation</a>, but 72% of Trump\u2019s likely voters say American culture and way of life has changed for the worse since then. Some 70% of Clinton\u2019s supporters say things have changed for the better.</p> <p>Robert Jones, chief executive of PRRI, said: \u201cThis election has become a referendum on competing visions of America\u2019s future. Donald Trump supporters are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/donald-trump-on-terror-mccarthyism-for-new-age\">nostalgic for the 1950s</a>, an era when white Christians in particular had more political and cultural power in the country, while Hillary Clinton supporters are leaning into \u2013 and even celebrating \u2013 the big cultural transformations the country has experienced over the last few decades.\u201d</p> <p>A majority (56%) of white Americans \u2013 including three in four (74%) of white evangelical Protestants \u2013 say American society has changed for the worse since the 1950s, while roughly six in 10 of black (62%) and Hispanic (57%) Americans say it has improved. </p> <p>Critics have described Trump as an authoritarian figure who poses a fundamental threat to democracy. In a hint of what might have been possible if he had avoided numerous scandals and feuds during his campaign, the research found that 46% of people, including 55% of Republicans, believe the US needs a leader willing to break some rules in order to set things right.</p> <p>There was a modest racial divide on the appeal of a strongman but a clear class divide. A majority (55%) of white working class Americans endorsed the idea whereas less than a third (29%) of those with college degrees agreed.</p> <p>Jones told an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PRRIpoll/videos/vb.38428034839/10154587865909840/?type=2&amp;theater\">audience at the Brookings Institution</a> thinktank in Washington on Tuesday: \u201cIt fits very well with this portrait of Americans who see a very non-responsive political system to their situation. So when you feel parties aren\u2019t attuned to you, government\u2019s not attuned to you, nobody\u2019s got your back, this kind of sentiment is, I think, what you get.</p> <p>\u201cIf you get a strong leader who\u2019s coming in to shake things up \u2013 someone who\u2019s said, \u2018I\u2019m the guy. Only I can solve this problem\u2019 \u2013 I think it\u2019s appealing to this kind of sentiment. It\u2019s people who feel like the system\u2019s largely failed them. They don\u2019t see any paths working within the current channels to change things.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eppc.org/author/henry_olsen\">Henry Olsen</a>, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, added: \u201cIt gets to the importance of listening. When people feel excluded from the normal process of society, they will endorse extreme measures in order to ensure they get part of that society. There is a segment that we don\u2019t often come into contact with except through data that very much feels that way and they find Trump\u2019s authoritarian demeanour reassuring rather than frightening.\u201d</p> <p>Olsen argued it is incumbent on the election victors to listen to the views of people who think differently from them, comparing the situation with Brexit. \u201cIf the answer to our future is lean in without listening, we will eventually see a violent revolt that will shock everyone, in the way that [the leave vote] shocked Britain.\u201d</p> <p>People name terrorism as the most important issue and are closely divided on the benefits of free trade. Some 58% oppose building a wall along the Mexican border, while 41% are in favour.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign was rocked earlier this month by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">the release of a 2005 video</a> in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women. But the PRRI\u2019s findings suggest its impact on the electorate might be less than supposed. Some 61% of people say an elected official who commits an immoral act in their personal life can still behave ethically and fulfill their duties in their public and professional life.

Such a move would risk the lives of US pilots \u2013 and dare confrontation with a Russian military which is more aggressive than it has been in years. </p> <p>Critics of the plan also question how using US military power to establish and police a safe space for beleaguered Syrian civilians would contribute to the downfall of President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 the explicit goal of US policy in Syria.</p> <p>\u201cIf she is not politically posturing, it\u2019s going to be a disaster. I hope it\u2019s political posturing,\u201d said John Kuehn, a retired navy officer who flew no-fly zone missions over Bosnia and Iraq. Kuehn who called denying an adversary its airspace \u201cthe cocktail party military application of power of choice\u201d.</p> <p>David Deptula, a retired air force lieutenant general who commanded the no-fly zone operations over northern Iraq in 1998 and 1999, said the Russians were a \u201ccomplicating factor\u201d but considered the problems with a no-fly zone to be more fundamental. </p> <p>\u201cUntil a strategy that defines the desired end-state is clearly laid out in a comprehensive way, it\u2019s difficult to advocate for a no-fly zone,\u201d said Deptula.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, the way it\u2019s being discussed, it\u2019s a solution in search of a strategy. Until coalition powers define what it is they wish to accomplish, banding about a solution like a no-fly zone is a non-starter.\u201d</p> <p>The challenges for a no-fly zone over Syria outstrip those the US has faced over Libya, Bosnia and Iraq. Assad\u2019s surface-to-air missiles, protecting the Mediterranean coast and southern regions the regime still controls, were<a href=\"http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Syria-SAM-Deployment.html\"> formidable</a> before the recent Russian addition of what Clapper, a former air force general, called \u201cvery advanced\u201d S-300 and S-400 systems that can blanket the majority of Syrian airspace with missiles. </p> <p>Staging a no-fly zone requires either the assent of regional allies \u2013 Turkey is the nearest potential partner to Syria, but it has concentrated in recent months on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2016-07-20/russia-and-turkeys-rapprochement\">improving ties with Moscow</a> after Turkish forces shot down a Russian jet in November 2015 \u2013 or an expensive, open-ended and risky deployment of aircraft carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean.</p> <p>But the most distinguishing feature of a Syria no-fly zone in 2017 would be the aerial presence of another great-power air force with an objective which is diametrically opposed to Washington\u2019s. </p> <p>Russia and the US currently share the skies above Syria and maintain a military-to-military communication channel to avoid confrontation. </p> <p>But since they operate over different parts of the country and with different objectives \u2013 the US in the east against the Islamic State, Russia to the west against Assad\u2019s opposition \u2013 a US-imposed no-fly zone would put their objectives into conflict. No one knows how either side would respond if Russian aircraft violated a US air cordon, nor how to de-escalate a clash before it spiraled into extended combat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/aleppo-residents-syria-russia-airstrikes\">'Is this civilisation?' ask residents as Aleppo reels from relentless shelling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Russia said on Tuesday that it would continue a moratorium on air strikes in the besieged city of Aleppo, but local sources said that rebel-held neighbourhoods had been struck in recent days. </p> <p>Kuehn, now a professor of military history at the US Army Command and General Staff College, said that escalation could occur by accident, either through a direct confrontation in the air, or through a Syrian or Russian capture of a downed US pilot.<br></p> <p>\u201cI see almost nothing positive that can come from implementing [a no-fly zone] at the current time over Syria. Conversely, the potential to make a bad situation worse is very, very high,\u201d Kuehn said.</p> <p>For years, senior US military officers have expressed reluctance to intervene in the Syrian civil war. In 2013, Martin Dempsey, then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said that even a limited safe zone would cost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/us-military-intervention-syria\">over $1bn a month</a> and require substantial air assets and ground troops to maintain. His successor, Joseph Dunford, told the Senate last month that a no-fly zone would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4621738/dunford-tells-wicker-controlling-airspace-syria-means-war-russia-mccain-throws-tantrum-dunford\">require us to go to war against Syria and Russia</a>\u201d before walking his assessment back under pressure from proposal advocate John McCain. </p> <p>Clinton, who has long backed a no-fly zone as the Syrian bloodshed has accumulated, acknowledged those concerns in last week\u2019s third presidential debate. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cbut to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.\u201d</p> <p>But strategists have a hard time understanding how a no-fly zone provides the US with a large enough leverage to trade with Assad or Russia, given their objective is, respectively, self-preservation and the preservation of a client. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how a no-fly zone gets you to a political settlement. There\u2019s no history supporting that.

  "<p>Tony Abbott\u2019s local campaign director, Walter Villatora, has called on Malcolm Turnbull to ensure there are genuine plebiscites for all New South Wales party members rather than pandering to lobbyists and party powerbrokers.</p> <p>Villatora, the Warringah conference president who has long been campaigning for changes to the rules governing Liberal preselections, is maintaining pressure following the state council meeting last weekend which saw the prime minister\u2019s motion for wider democratic reforms defeat Abbott\u2019s motion for plebiscites.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s motion passed unanimously and resolved to reform the NSW division based on the Victorian branch, which introduced plebiscites.<br></p> <p>It also resolved to increase female participation, improve training for candidates and improve policy participation.

The right wing has generally been more supportive of plebiscites, though leading moderates Turnbull and Baird are key supporters. </p> <p>A former NSW president, North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, said after the conference there had to be safeguards on plebiscites to ensure branch stacking did not occur.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to stop people who will join the party just to influence the preselection, never be seen at a branch meeting, never to be seen working on election campaigns and never to be seen again after we have had a preselection,\u201d Zimmerman told Sky News.</p> <p>Villatora said he would be looking to the party leadership to ensure the state council motion was not a delaying tactic.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe only acceptable model is a true plebiscite, not the attempt to maintain the control of lobbyists and powerbrokers of 40% central control and an arbiter to judge other members to determine who is a genuine member,\u201d Villatora said.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to look to leadership to ensure that Saturday\u2019s motion was not an obvious ploy to kick the can down the road as another delaying tactic but is a binding convention all genuine members can look forward to, a binding \u201cone member, one vote\u201d convention that will unite the party.\u201d</p> <p>Villatora described the momentum for change in the party as \u201cunstoppable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason we have seen this progress is due to the pressure rank-and-file members have exerted on party and the leadership of the prime minister, Tony Abbott, John Howard, NSW premier Mike Baird, Angus Taylor, and General Major (rtd) Jim Molan,\u201d Villatora said in a statement. </p> <p>NSW party president Kent Johns would not comment on issues up for discussion at the convention but he said the resolutions ensured that \u201ceverything was on the table\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is to arrange the convention and make sure everyone has a say and out of it, we will become a stronger party and a better party,\u201d Johns said. </p>",

Schilling briefly alluded to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/espn-fires-curt-schilling-transgender-facebook-comments\">dismissal from ESPN</a> a quarter of the way through the show and only spoke about the World Series when callers specifically asked him.

Our writers' predictions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of the more than a dozen callers who filled the show\u2019s two hours, all but one sounded like they shared the same world view as Schilling and Breitbart Media as a whole. It was preaching to the choir or, if you prefer: throwing BP to your team-mates. The second caller, a man named Brian from New Jersey, brought up Schilling\u2019s recent question to Jake Tapper on CNN in which the retired pitcher wondered how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRkVXegRX88\">any Jewish Americans could support the Democrats</a>. Brian from New Jersey insisted there are many possible reasons and that it is a very \u201cnuanced issue.\u201d Schilling responded: \u201cNo, I agree.\u201d But the final hour and 45 minutes of the show did not exude a particular appreciation of nuance from Schilling or his callers. Even the call-in number itself, <a href=\"tel:%28877%29%20240-1776\">(877) 240-1776</a> \u2013 that\u2019s right: 1776 \u2013 was square on the nose.</p> <p>One woman promoted a YouTube video she made about Benghazi, something she said \u201cmillions\u201d of people don\u2019t know about. A man named Patrick, who said he is a regular caller to Breitbart shows, referenced \u201ctypical Liberal retardation syndrome\u201d and talked about a world in which we are \u201csurrounded by a bunch of animals\u201d Patrick was calling from Indianapolis. </p> <p>Erica in Massachusetts said she sensed the election is going Trump\u2019s way because \u201cI see more Trump signs in the yard than Hillary signs. Where I live is more conservative, but definitely more Trump signs.\u201d And Scott in Alabama started off with \u201cRoll Tide. If you come down here to try to take our guns, you\u2019re going to get more than you bargained for,\u201d before seguing into: \u201cThere\u2019s no more racism. You still got pockets, but there\u2019s no more racism directly.\u201d </p> <p>But Schilling gave as good as he got when it came to takes. On racism he echoed Scott: \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely right. Great call.\u201d Schilling stressed that racism is absolutely just \u201cin pockets,\u201d adding that while prejudice does still exist, there are no ways to enact laws that end prejudice: \u201cYou can\u2019t pass laws that to make people believe in something that they don\u2019t believe. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d (He did not say how this viewpoint fits with his feelings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/espn-fires-curt-schilling-transgender-facebook-comments\">on transgender bathroom laws</a>.) Colin Kaepernick and other athletes are \u201ckneeling for a lie,\u201d Schilling continued. \u201cThe 75 most violent cities in this country, 52% of the murders are committed by black criminals, though they make up just 13% of the population.\u201d</p> <p>Schilling also brought his fastball for issues of faith, referencing the bible and then urging listeners to not allow themselves to be \u201cbrought down and dragged down by this horrific group of agenda-driven, liberal, socialist I-want-the world-to-live-in-peace people. We live in the real world.\u201d Unfortunately, the next caller was Ryan in South Carolina and not Jesus. It would have been interesting to hear Christ\u2019s thoughts on that peace take.</p> <p>On and on it went as Schilling served the red-state meat that Breitbart promises its core audience. His delivery featured a calm, practiced tenor developed from years as a broadcaster in the mainstream media \u2013 anyone hoping for Alex Jones-style tirades would be disappointed \u2013 and he closed his debut with thoughts on why more athletes don\u2019t come out as conservative: \u201cThese athletes are more worried about a brand than a flag.\u201d No streaming figures were listed on the site, but the number of callers alone made the debut broadcast undoubtedly more successful than Schilling\u2019s Trump rally this past weekend. The show will be back at 9am ET tomorrow and every weekday.

When it becomes clear on the timing of Article 50 and the market\u2019s perception on the relationship between UK and EU. It\u2019s a bit early to determine that.

It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year.</p> <p>If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities.

If a stranger tells you to smile as you walk down the street. When someone calls you a bitch because you turned them down at a bar. The decision of whether to speak up or push back is made in a split second, and for a lot of women, it\u2019s just not worth it.</p> <p>The person that just harassed you might get even more aggressive if confronted. Besides, what difference will it make, you think. Why spend energy on a person like this?</p> <p>As the election looms closer and women continue to come forward to accuse Donald Trump of assault, I\u2019ve noticed a shift in the way women are <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/laughing-until-we-cry-conversations-about-getting-groped.html?mid=twitter-share-thecut\">talking</a> about dealing with these all-too-common indignities. They\u2019re not just fed up with the harassment itself, but with the resigned feeling that this is just the way things are.</p> <p>More and more, women are sharing stories of speaking up in those moments \u2013 and crediting Trump\u2019s misogyny with what they did. Carolina Siede, writing at Quartz, described <a href=\"http://qz.com/816565/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-how-trumps-creepiness-inspired-me-to-fight-back-in-my-own-life/\">being leered at</a> by a man one evening and changing her usual tactic of not \u201crocking the boat\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we sat in uncomfortable silence, I began to think again about Donald Trump. I thought about the women he\u2019d groped. I thought about the men who, through their ignorance or denial, enable this behavior to happen. I thought about Michelle Obama telling women and girls that they deserve dignity and respect too. And I decided enough was enough.</p> </blockquote> <p>Writer Rebecca Solnit <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebecca.solnit/posts/10154469650640552\">shared a similar story on Facebook</a> from a woman who was called a \u201ccunt\u201d by a stranger and decided to confront him. \u201cAre you going to tell me it was just locker room talk?,\u201d she asked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/truth.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/truth.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s more talk, too, of the less obvious kinds of harassment and assault. A woman on Twitter this week described <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aardvarsk/status/790003295200903168\">a man caressing her calf</a> as she walked by him on an airplane, for example. When we think of groping what comes to mind is someone grabbing \u201cprivate\u201d areas. But if it\u2019s another person\u2019s body \u2013 it is private.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks about women \u2013 his bragging about assaulting women without consequence and his continued insistence that every accuser is lying \u2013 have brought us to a sort of national tipping point. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clinton-nasty-women-donald-trump\">Elizabeth Warren said about Trump to tremendous applause this week</a>, \u201cWomen have had it with guys like you\u201d.</p> <p>Women are tired. Tired of being told that this is just the way men talk or act. Tired of looks or touches that we\u2019re expected to deal with because they\u2019re not \u201creal\u201d assault. Tired of saying nothing in the face of unrelenting sexism and slights. Why should we have to live like this?</p> <p>Perhaps when the election is over, the anxiety and anger women are feeling right now will subside and many of us will go back to saying nothing in those scary moments. Maybe the national conversation around assault will wane. But I doubt it. When you start to speak up, it\u2019s hard to stop.

That was a test ground for more winnable seats like Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith\u2019s constituency), party sources said. </p> <p>Recalling the byelection after the resignation of Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne, one senior Lib Dem source said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never mind Witney, this is going to be a bigger campaign than Eastleigh. In Witney we were going for a really strong second, which we achieved, this time we will be going to win.</p> </blockquote> <p>The party expects 4,000 of its members in Richmond and neighbouring seats to campaign in the west London seat if Goldsmith resigns later on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>If a byelection is triggered, the party will face an uphill battle for recognition in the seat. Vince Cable, the former business secretary who was rumoured to be standing in Richmond Park having lost the neighbouring seat of Twickenham, will not run in the byelection. <br></p> <p>Instead, the candidate is a relative unknown, local accountant Sarah Olney who only joined the party in May 2015.<br></p> <p>Olney told the Guardian she had initially expected just to be delivering a few leaflets, but now faces the prospect of fighting a tough by-election within months, having only been selected in July. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This has been a bit unexpected. But I\u2019m ready to go to the voters, and our activists are really fired up by the result in Witney, and want to get stuck in to another byelection.</p> </blockquote> <p>The party was united in opposition to Heathrow, unlike the Tories, Olney said. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A Conservative government has approved the expansion, and it shows how he has been ineffective in fighting it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brexit will be the party\u2019s other major talking point in west London too, with high numbers of EU citizens living in Richmond Park. Olney said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a strongly remain area and Zac has let down a lot of his constituents in supporting the leave campaign. He is not representing their opinions at all, and it creates a great deal of uncertainty for residents.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T14:28:46.375Z\">at 3.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580f6035e4b08d944ba4a635\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T13:39:20.441Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SNP\u2019s Westminster transport spokesperson, Drew Hendry, has called on the UK government to ensure that Scotland gets a \u201cfair deal\u201d from Heathrow expansion.<br>  Welcoming the decision, Hendry said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is still a long way to go before parliament even gets to vote on it - and the Tories are deeply and bitterly divided about it -so for businesses and travellers there will still be frustration.</p> <p>Whilst expansion at Heathrow can and must benefit Scotland, there will be disproportionate benefit to the south east of England and London. The UK government must ensure that when this does eventually get approval Scotland gets a fair deal from the process. We should see a commitment on route investment, guarantees to Scottish cities and an equitable share of any public spending that might be accrued coming to Scotland.</p> <p>For the wider benefit they must also make a proper commitment to supporting new airspace plans, bio fuels for aircraft and the use of carbon reduction technology.</p> </blockquote> <p>But his counterpart for the Scottish Greens, John Finnie MSP, criticised the SNP\u2019s support for today\u2019s decision, insisting that \u201cit does nothing to advance social justice\u201d.<br></p> <p>Finnie said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wealthy frequent fliers will benefit, as they will from Scottish Mmnisters\u2019 desire to cut air passenger duty.

Months of apprehension over the outcome of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US election</a> seemed to have given way to discussion about how comprehensively, rather than if, Hillary Clinton will win the presidential vote on 8 November.

  "<p>In recent weeks many people have behaved as though Theresa May has discretion to call a general election at any time. Apparently it is very easy to forget about obscure constitutional rules such as the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted\">Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</a>, which the coalition government passed in 2011. Just as Odysseus had his hands tied to the mast so that he could listen to the sirens, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/12/fixed-five-year-parliamentary-term\">coalition passed a law</a> to prevent an early election before 2015. They did so by allowing only two paths to an early election. The prime minister, and the queen, no longer have a say on their own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-election-pm-owen-smith-corbyn\">Theresa May rules out snap UK election after \u2018shock\u2019 of Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way is for parliament to vote for an early election, if two-thirds of all the members of the House of Commons (434 MPs) agree. The other way is for a simple majority, 51% of those voting, to pass a motion of no confidence in the government. The no-confidence motion has to take a specific form. A government cannot force backbenchers to agree to a bill, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_vote_of_confidence_in_the_government_of_John_Major\">as John Major did on the EU</a>, by making a vote on the bill one \u201cof confidence\u201d. If a no-confidence vote is passed, and a new government cannot be formed within two weeks (and approved in a new vote of confidence), then a general election occurs.</p> <p>Parliament can evade the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act in two ways. It can repeal the act altogether, or it can pass a new act dictating that there will be an election on a certain date and that the act will not apply. But like the no-confidence option, this also requires the vote of a majority of the House of Commons. And unlike the no-confidence vote, it has to happen on three readings of the new law. None of these scenarios is attractive to May, and none may be possible in the current parliament.</p> <p>The power dynamic in the current House of Commons and the Conservative government is shaped by the act. May has a working majority of 16 (26, if the Democratic Unionist party and Ulster Unionists are included). Therefore, any 27 Conservative MPs can ensure that this parliament remains in place until May 2020, when a general election is due under the terms of the act.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56p8f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793759\"            data-video-name=\"Ed Miliband: MPs should vote on Brexit terms \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb9f5fe4b03b4fd4fa5f5b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\">Ed Miliband: MPs should vote on Brexit terms</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Current Conservative members have a number of incentives to oppose a new election. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2015/05/generation-2015-introducing-the-74-new-conservative-mps.html\">Seventy-four new Conservative MPs</a> were elected in 2015. They have only had 18 months to prove that they will be good constituency MPs by holding surgeries, solving constituents\u2019 problems, voting on legislation and generally building up a record to show that they can do the job.</p> <p>Older MPs may oppose a new election on ideological grounds, either anti- or pro-Brexit. Anti-Brexiters may believe that given sufficient time, the government will find that negotiations are difficult and that the economy does not perform well under conditions of uncertainty, so they will be able to campaign for a soft Brexit in the next election. Pro-Brexit MPs may fear that there will be short-term economic dislocation that becomes obvious before an election can take place, so that remainers from other parties will be able to challenge them successfully.</p> <p>There is another element of risk. Many Conservatives\u2019 constituents voted in strong opposition to the position that the MP took in the referendum. Numerous Conservatives who campaigned to leave represent strong remain constituencies, according to the estimates of <a href=\"https://www.uea.ac.uk/ppl/people/profile/c-hanretty\">Chris Hanretty of the University of East Anglia</a>. These include <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000692\">David Burrowes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000600\">Charlotte Leslie</a>, who have majorities of less than 5,000. More numerous are the 70 MPs who campaigned to remain in the 100 strongest leave constituencies, including <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000879\">Johnny Mercer</a>, with a majority of only 1,026 and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000995\">Jackie Doyle-Price</a>, whose majority was 536 in 2015. Any of these 70 could be vulnerable to a challenge from a revitalised Ukip or even from a Labour candidate who supported Brexit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Numerous Conservatives who campaigned to leave represent strongly remain constituencies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The next election in 2020 will take place with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37337175\">new constituency boundaries</a>, and 50 seats will be eliminated. That means the current legislative game is being played inside a game of musical chairs: 50 members will lose their seats when the music stops. This increases MPs\u2019 risk-aversion still further.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn claims he supports the idea of a new election, but with his current polling that cannot be a rational position. Labour will vote against it. And smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party are in the delicious position of watching the Conservatives trapped in place, no matter what happens. Unless circumstances become so dire or the political culture changes sufficiently that broad, cross-party agreements are possible, the situation seems almost certain to continue. The coalition did tie hands to the mast \u2013 and the hands they tied were May\u2019s.</p>",

The Republican nominee, who has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/living-in-hell-milwaukee-segregation-donald-trump\">compared inner cities to war zones</a> and suggested African Americans and Latinos \u201chave no education\u201d and \u201cno jobs\u201d, attacked Clinton\u2019s outreach to those communities. \u201cShe has abused the African American community, she has abused the Hispanic community,\u201d he proclaimed.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is in the middle of a three-day swing across Florida, a key election state where Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">currently holds a four-point lead</a>, according to the RealClearPolitics aggregate of public polling.

Well, in 1876, the election actually was rigged, and the aftermath of that contest sheds light on what could happen in America in the next few years.</p> <p>The 1876 election pitted New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Samuel J Tilden, against Rutherford B Hayes, the former Republican governor of Ohio. On election night, some southern states, including Florida and Louisiana, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wUMiCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;f=false\">tried to throw the election to Hayes</a>, even though it was clear that Tilden was winning. Moreover, when the electoral college met in December, three states submitted fraudulent returns, which meant that neither candidate had a majority. Ultimately, a special Election Commission voted 7-6 along party lines to appoint Hayes to the presidency.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, there was widespread <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=tshkbytuaM4C&amp;lpg=PT62&amp;dq=disgust%201876%20election&amp;pg=PT62#v=onepage&amp;q=disgust%201876%20election&amp;f=false\">disgust</a> both with the election and \u201cthe seemingly endless procession of scandals emanating from the nation\u2019s capital\u201d.

The party hoped to reform both the American financial system and the country\u2019s labor laws. While 13 congressmen doesn\u2019t seem like many, it was nearly 14% of the national vote. Not only did both Democrats and Republicans lose seats \u2013 the rise of the Greenbacks meant any hope Hayes had of gaining traction in congress was lost.</p> <p>More recently, look at the reaction in 1964 after Lyndon Johnson cruised to an unprecedented victory over Barry Goldwater. Republican stalwarts complained that the press had been <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=v5X0PYgrjc4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=bias%20against%20goldwater%201964%20shaffer&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=bias%20against%20goldwater%201964%20shaffer&amp;f=false\">biased against Goldwater from the start</a>, and many pundits saw LBJ\u2019s victory as the death knell for the Republican party. </p> <p>But a funny thing happened in the midterm elections of 1966. Rather than repudiate Goldwater conservatism, the Republicans used it to increase their power in Congress.

But that\u2019s only true if his goal was to return to being a real estate developer/reality TV host after the election. </p> <p>Imagine a Trump Party that first makes significant inroads in 2018 in congress, and then runs a presidential candidate in 2020 \u2013 could this third party candidate restrict Hillary Clinton to just one term? Both Rutherford Hayes and Lyndon Johnson declined to seek renomination. Could a Trump Party make it so difficult for her to govern that she simply throws in the towel?</p> <p>If that\u2019s the case, Trump will have vaulted himself from being a New York City real estate tycoon to a major figure in American political history.

  "<p>\u201cI thought there\u2019d be snacks,\u201d RNC strategist Sean Spicer said to the hosts of the debut installment of what the media is generously referring to as Trump TV.</p> <p>We were all in a bit of a frothy lather over this being the long-awaited rollout of Donald Trump\u2019s real 2016 endgame \u2013 a 24-hour news empire to go toe-to-toe with Fox News for the eyeballs of America\u2019s far right. At last, Trump would reveal his true intentions. </p> <p>Instead, we got a grown man asking where the craft services table is.</p> <p>This is not Trump TV, declared the hosts \u2013 Trump advisers Boris Epshteyn and Cliff Sims.

In lieu of any good news, the gang falls back on the reliable and the battle-tested: Trump is a popular public figure. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of like a rock star in a way,\u201d Spicer says. Rock stars pack houses, after all, just like Trump. Isn\u2019t that all that matters? Shouldn\u2019t we decide our elections based on fleeting computerized social interactions or the number of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/789647564983373826\">Halloween costumes sold</a>? If I had to choose a rock star to be president, I might go with a more benevolent, coffeehouse option \u2013 say, Dave Matthews or one of the Indigo Girls. </p> <p>The thing is, Spicer is right. Trump is a rock star, of a sort. He feeds off a cult of personality, sells merchandise with his name on it, spouts easy-to-remember catchphrases and plays to the crowd. Instead of humping a mic stand or destroying a guitar, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/15Qc8h38Rb4?t=22\">hugs the flag</a> or demands his opponent be arrested for treason. </p> <p>As potent as that brand is, Trump cannot be on Trump TV all 24 hours of the day. At most, he\u2019ll be a mascot for the channel, not unlike Oprah on OWN \u2013 hosting a show or two and appearing in adverts. The viewership dipped to 35,300 people at 7pm, once people realized the show would be people agreeing with each other for a half-hour. </p> <p>The main event, a Trump rally in Florida, ended the grand experiment, and, slowly, viewers came back to see their spray-tanned hero pontificate. Instead of CNN or Fox News, Trump TV might want to take a cue from another infotainment outlet taking advantage of their viewers\u2019 fears and prejudices: the Trinity Broadcasting Network. </p> <p>Paul and Jan Crouch of TBN made millions of dollars allowing sweaty people like Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker scream about sin and redemption, the wrath of the lord and the literal price of salvation. TBN lasted after Jim Bakker was arrested and convicted of fraud, because the message has to be more important than the man. One day, Trump and his media empire will face the same challenge he\u2019s issuing to Fox News \u2013 someone more extreme, more charismatic and more willing to incite their followers, unless Trump can check his ego and hire that person instead. Not likely.</p> <p>I tuned out after Trump\u2019s sensual massage of Old Glory, but I\u2019m happy to report that Spicer got to eat. \u201cI did see there\u2019s food coming,\u201d Epshteyn said, glancing over at the room behind him. On the walls of that room were multiple mounted televisions, which the hosts said were always tuned to cable news, the target of their scorn. If they intend to join them on that wall, they might want to try harder. Start by feeding the guests.</p>",

He said: \u201cA new runway at Heathrow will be devastating for air quality across London \u2013 air pollution around the airport is already above legal levels of NO2.<br></p> <p>\u201cHeathrow already exposes more people to aircraft noise than Paris CDG, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Munich and Madrid combined. A third runway would mean an extra 200,000 people impacted, exposing 124 more schools and 43,200 more schoolchildren to an unacceptable level of noise.\u201d</p> <p>John Stewart, one of the leading campaigners against a third runway, said the decision had been made with \u201clegal conditions\u201d that the airport would have to meet.<br></p> <p>Stewart, chair of the campaign group Hacan, said: \u201cCountless residents will be dismayed and distraught by this decision. Some will lose their homes. Some face the daunting prospect of living under a noisy flight path for the first time. And many others will get yet more planes over their heads. But real doubts must remain whether this new runway will ever see the light of day. The hurdles it faces remain: costs, noise, air pollution and widespread opposition including an expected legal challenge from the local authorities.\u201d</p> <p>A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the news that Heathrow is government\u2019s preferred site for a new runway and look forward to hearing the full details later from the transport secretary.</p> <p> \u201cExpansion of Heathrow is the only option that will connect all of the UK to global growth, helping to build a stronger and fairer economy. We await the full details, but Heathrow stands ready to work with government, businesses, airlines and our local communities to deliver an airport that is fair, affordable and secures the benefits of expansion for the whole of the UK.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/local-residents-on-heathrows-third-runway-kids-love-the-planes\">Local residents on Heathrow's third runway: 'I would lose my house, community and friends'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government stipulated that the third runway \u201cmust be delivered without hitting passengers in the pocket\u201d. Although charges to airlines are expected to rise substantially at an expanded Heathrow, the government said that the Airports Commission and CAA were clear that keeping fares steady was achievable.<br></p> <p>Airlines said the cost of expansion would be crucial. Airline trade body BATA said: \u201cWe will be scrutinising this decision and future, more detailed, plans. Heathrow is the most expensive hub airport in the world \u2013 and airports are not funded by the taxpayer but by passengers. Today\u2019s passengers must not pay for capacity that will not be operational until the mid-2020s.\u201d</p> <p>British Airways, the airline that operates around half the flights at Heathrow, said it welcomed the recognition from government that passengers should not pay more for a third runway. <br></p> <p>Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s owning group IAG, said: \u201cThe cost of this project will make or break it. The Government\u2019s directive to cap customer charges at today\u2019s level is fundamental. Heathrow want it, argued for it and now must ensure it\u2019s the UK and the travelling public who get the benefits from the runway not the airport\u2019s owners.</p> <p> He added: \u201cWe will be vigilant in ensuring that Heathrow does not raise charges to benefit its shareholders to the detriment of the travelling public.\u201d</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s is owned by a range of sovereign investment funds, including Qatar, Singapore and China\u2019s, a consortium led by Spanish firm Ferrovial, and Canadian pension funds.</p> <p>Business leaders welcomed the decision. The president of the CBI, Paul Drechsler, said it was \u201can enormous relief to firms in every corner of the country\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will create the air links that will do so much to drive jobs and unlock growth across the UK. With contracts to tender for, apprentices to recruit and supply chains to build, this decision must be taken forward swiftly, giving businesses the confidence to invest.\u201d</p> <p>The chair of the transport select committee, Louise Ellman MP, said: \u201cThis decision will boost business, create training opportunities and new jobs and open the UK to new markets.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have had to wait a long time for this. We recognise it won\u2019t be an easy journey. We urge the government to have the courage of their convictions and press ahead so that the timetable to deliver the additional capacity by 2030 can be delivered.\u201d</p> <p>But Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green party, said: \u201cThe decision to expand Heathrow tramples over the concerns of local people and puts a wrecking ball through the government\u2019s claim to be concerned about climate change. The truth is that the government went into this process with their eyes shut to the only sensible option: stopping airport expansion.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Campaign to Protect Rural England said it was \u201cmadness\u201d. Ralph Smyth of the CPRE said: \u201cThe north-south divide has been increasing: by giving the go ahead to yet another runway in the south the Prime Minister has effectively pulled the rug on her own flagship policy of rebalancing our nation\u2019s economy. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s madness to be promoting domestic flights at the same time as investing in alternatives like high speed rail.\u201d <br></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>A well-funded international campaign to counter the influence of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire on climate change has been planned, emails to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman reveal.</p> <p>The plan to use \u201cguerilla tactics\u201d, civil disobedience and targeted advertising appears to have been hatched by David Fenton, founder of <a href=\"http://www.fenton.com/\">Fenton Communications</a>, a US public relations agency. </p> <p>The proposal aimed to \u201cmake Murdoch\u2019s climate denial a major issue,\u201d and \u201cbring the scientific facts on climate change to his audiences directly in print and on television\u201d. It would involve adverts in his and other publications, and the creation of websites that disseminated facts about climate change, and directly challenged the reporting in Murdoch media.</p> <p>The goal was to put Murdoch \u201con the defensive on climate change,\u201d and make it possible for conservative politicians to support action on climate change. Part of the plan involved \u201cpublic shaming\u201d of Murdoch so that his children, who have more progressive views on climate change, would have \u201cleverage with their father\u201d.</p> <p>On 19 February 2015, David Fenton thanked Clinton\u2019s chairman, John Podesta, for a meeting earlier that day, and sent him two emails. WikiLeaks has published a series of emails hacked from Podesta\u2019s account, and Clinton\u2019s campaign has neither confirmed or denied their authenticity but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/clinton-campaign-wikileaks-hack-russia-donald-trump\">has attacked what it said were Russian state actors involved in obtaining them</a>.</p> <p>One email said: \u201cHere is the plan to go after [the Wall Street Journal] and Fox [the TV network] on climate. I have 500,000 [dollars] of this pledged if I can raise another million. It\u2019s a real pledge from Graeme Wood in Australia. I sure hope something like this can happen it\u2019s long overdue.\u201d</p> <p>Graeme Wood is the founder of travel website Wotif and an internet entrepreneur who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/15/guardian-launch-digital-australia-edition\">provided a loan to help launch Guardian Australia</a>. Wood told the Guardian: \u201cIt sounded like a good idea at the time but in the end I didn\u2019t proceed with any funding.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the strategies discussed in the plan in 2015 went ahead this year, with <a href=\"http://www.partnershipforresponsiblegrowth.org/press-release/\">an ad campaign designed and written by Fenton\u2019s company</a>. A group called <a href=\"http://www.partnershipforresponsiblegrowth.org/pricecarbon/\">Partnership for Responsible Growth</a> ran ads in the Wall Street Journal and Fox in June and July this year. They were created by Fenton\u2019s agency and contain many of the same messages outlined in the email to Podesta.</p> <p>It is unclear who funded the campaign. </p> <p>The plan, attached to the email and dated 1 December 2015 said: \u201cUnless and until Murdoch is put on the defensive on climate change, opening political space for conservatives to come forward, it is unlikely that bipartisan efforts on climate change will be achieved in time.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cFox News is the biggest single factor keeping almost 40% of Americans from believing humans are changing the climate, while only 10% know that 97% of climate scientists agree we are warming the earth at our peril.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways, the effect of the Wall Street Journal is even worse, as it sows regular confusion among its 3 million daily subscribers \u2013 business leaders and investors among the most influential people in the country.\u201d</p> <p>The plan also mentioned the role Murdoch papers played in Australia and the UK.</p> <p>It outlined and costed a $2m plan with six main steps and 12 \u201ccampaign elements\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"796badf3572d65ec7e5f5504ce6e9f6a02e9ef12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/796badf3572d65ec7e5f5504ce6e9f6a02e9ef12/583_0_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The plan to use \u2018guerilla tactics\u2019, civil disobedience and targeted advertising appears to have been hatched by David Fenton, founder of a US public relations agency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The plan to use \u2018guerilla tactics\u2019, civil disobedience and targeted advertising appears to have been hatched by David Fenton, founder of a US public relations agency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the plan, $600,000 would be spent advertisements in the Wall Street Journal and $350,000 would be given to other groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace to conduct \u201cgrassroots and social media activism\u201d.</p> <p>Plans for a campaign outside the US were not costed but Fenton said: \u201cWe would be happy to work with counterparts in Australia and the UK to create proportional budgets for similar campaigns there, adapted to local conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Fenton concluded: \u201cWe have let Rupert Murdoch get away with this atrocious behavior for too long.

Democrats have their eye on taking back the Senate, and losing Warren would have hurt their chances. In Massachusetts, the governor appoints the temporary replacement if a senator steps down, and he is currently a Republican, Charlie Baker.</p> <p>Instead, Warren and her deep bench of allies are working to push the progressive agenda both publicly and privately, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.</p> <p>\u201cElizabeth Warren is an agenda-setter and she\u2019s shown during the election that she\u2019s a very powerful ally to have on your side,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut she\u2019s also a powerful person to have against you and therefore all the incentives point towards partnering with Elizabeth Warren on key appointments and setting the policy agenda so that everybody\u2019s fighting in the same direction.\u201d</p> <p>There was no initial response to Clinton and Warren\u2019s remarks from Trump, who spoke later in Florida, but there are increasing signs of panic within his campaign, which is now up to 12 points behind in some polls since the Access Hollywood tape emerged.</p> <p>Instead, the Republican nominee added opinion pollsters to the long line of people to blame for his ailing presidential campaign, accusing Democrats of \u201cmaking up phony polls\u201d and the press of refusing to highlight the handful of less reputable pollsters still showing a tighter race.</p> <p>\u201cWe are winning and the press is refusing to report it. Don\u2019t let them fool you \u2013 get out and vote!\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cMajor story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump [sic]. We are going to WIN!\u201d</p> <p>Even the Republican\u2019s campaign manager has acknowledged he is \u201cbehind\u201d and facing a number of structural disadvantages against the well-organised and well-financed Clinton campaign.</p> <p>But Trump himself has struck a defiant tone, refusing to say whether he would accept the result on 8 November if it shows him losing and claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that voter fraud is widespread. </p> <p>With just two weeks to go until polling day, campaigning hit a new intensity on Monday.

  "<p>Donald Trump may have shocked the American political establishment with his refusal to say whether he will accept the results of next month\u2019s presidential election, but he is far from the only candidate for high office in the United States who has cast serious doubt on the integrity of the system and the campaign tactics of his opponents.</p> <p>Over the past 16 years \u2013 ever since the epic, 36-day presidential showdown in Florida in 2000 that was resolved not by a full recount of the votes, but by a supreme court split along partisan lines \u2013 accusations of vote-rigging and out-and-out theft have become increasingly common among partisans on both sides, and the electoral process has become ever more politicized, rancorous and fraught with mistrust.</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you at the time,\u201d Trump said at last Wednesday\u2019s debate when asked if he would accept the election result on 8 November. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d The Republican candidate has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/man-who-cried-rigged-problem-with-trump-election-claims\">that the election is \u201crigged\u201d against him</a>. \u201cOf course there is large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,\u201d he tweeted last week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter\">All available evidence shows</a> that in-person voter fraud is exceedingly rare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">What would happen if Donald Trump refused to concede this election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opinion polls suggest that Trump\u2019s charges of a \u201crigged election\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/republicans-reject-us-election-result-hillary-clinton-win\">have struck a nerve</a>: 41% of voters believe him when he says the election could be <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/poll-41-percent-of-voters-say-the-election-could-be-stolen-from-trump-229871#ixzz4NyQ6BbyQ\">stolen</a>, according to one survey.

The 2004 election, which saw George W Bush re-elected despite the mounting unpopularity of the Iraq war, saw an explosion of unfounded conspiracy theories that Republicans were in cahoots with the manufacturers of electronic voting machines and would never lose an election again. (The theory fell apart as soon as Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives two years later.)</p> <p>This year, a hard core of Bernie Sanders supporters remains convinced that the senator from Vermont was cheated out of the Democratic presidential nomination by the underhanded maneuvering of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2013 despite the fact that Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/\">won 3m more primary votes</a>.</p> <p>American history is hardly lacking in examples of real voter manipulation and electoral skullduggery, especially in the segregation-era deep south. To this day, the US electoral system is widely viewed as an <a href=\"http://kimalex.blogspot.com/2004/12/jimmy-carter-on-npr-air.html\">anomaly</a> in the western world because of persistent problems with the reliability of its voting machinery, frequent bureaucratic incompetence, the lack of uniform standards from state to state or even county to county, the systematic exclusion of <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/\">more than 6 million felons</a> and<strong> </strong>ex-prisoners, and the tendency of election officials to adopt rules that benefit their party over democracy itself.</p> <p>Until 2000, though, these issues were not widely aired in public. Then the battle over Florida ripped a veil off a dysfunctional system and offered an opportunity not just for meaningful electoral reform \u2013 a slow and frustrating process \u2013 but also for new forms of political warfare unseen since the darkest days of the segregation era in which the electoral process itself became fair game, particularly for the Republicans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began, perhaps, when the hand recount of punch card ballots requested by Al Gore and the Democrats \u2013 something both parties had routinely pressed for in previous contested elections \u2013 was recast by many leading Republicans in their talking points as a form of \u201c<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0011/22/ip.00.html\">slow-motion grand larceny</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Then, in Missouri, Republican Senator Kit Bond took one look at African American voters in overcrowded precincts in St Louis casting ballots beyond the official poll closing time \u2013 something that has since become standard practice in many states \u2013 and denounced what he called a \u201c<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122543\">major criminal enterprise</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Soon, a narrative took hold that Democrats were habitual vote-stealers \u2013 something that was indubitably true in the days of Boss Tweed in 1860s New York but now took the form of a racist dog-whistle because the voters under most suspicion were black or Latino. Within a few years, politicians such as Sarah Palin were openly distinguishing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/10/rep-says-liberals-hate-real-americans-014797\">real Americans</a>\u201d \u2013 meaning white Republicans \u2013 from the rest, and states under Republican control were passing voter ID laws to crack down on a problem \u2013 voter impersonation fraud \u2013 that experts have repeatedly found to be <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/2016/10/18/analysis-heres-why-vote-fraud-is-less-likely-than-being-struck-by-lightning/\">rare to non-existent</a>.</p> <p>As the federal courts have now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/north-carolina-voting-rights-law-republicans-november-elections\">begun to find</a>, the effect of these laws has in fact been to discriminate against groups of voters \u2013 the transient, the elderly, students and the poor \u2013 who are much more likely to support Democrats.</p> <p>Given the level of mistrust, rank-and-file members of both parties have increasingly come to define democracy by the elections their side wins, and any other outcome as prima facie evidence of theft and corruption.</p> <p>Royal Masset, a former political director of the Texas Republican party, once described how he would receive <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2007/04/a-republican-his-mother-and-voter-id/\">dozens of calls</a> from disappointed candidates after election day complaining about some unsubstantiated outrage, usually involving illegal immigrants or lightning-rod political figures such as Jesse Jackson. \u201cHuman beings do not accept defeat easily,\u201d he observed in 2007.</p> <p>If Trump is different, it is only because he began complaining about vote-rigging months before election day and because he threatens to depart from the tradition that says you fight as hard and as dirty as you want, but only until the final results come in.</p> <p>The sheer volume of his complaints, however, may be doing his prospects little good: a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/21/trumps-election-rigging-claim-will-backfire-heres-the-evidence/?tid=pm_politics_pop_b\">fascinating</a> American National Election Study survey conducted in 2012 shows that people are less likely to vote when their faith in the integrity of the system has been shaken, and much more likely to vote if they think the ballots are counted fairly. In other words, Trump\u2019s rhetoric may just be depressing his own turnout and making defeat all the more likely.<br></p> <ul> <li><em>Andrew Gumbel is author of Down for the Count: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America</em></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Not since the communist era has a Polish government faced as much criticism from the west as the one in charge today. It is now exactly a year since Law and Justice (PiS), a socially conservative, Eurosceptic and nationalist party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/poland-law-justice-party-wins-235-seats-can-govern-alone\" title=\"\">swept to power</a>, winning a parliamentary majority with 37.5% of the vote. This followed the triumph of PiS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/andrzej-duda\" title=\"\">Andrzej Duda</a> in the earlier presidential election, giving the party full control over Poland\u2019s executive arm of government.</p> <p>Since then, the ruling party has come under <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/poland-democracy-failing-pis-law-and-justice-media-rule-of-law/\" title=\"\">heavy fire</a> from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/rule-no-1-for-polands-new-right-wing-government-ignore-the-critics/2016/02/14/d3e5124a-c9bb-11e5-b9ab-26591104bb19_story.html\" title=\"\">western media</a> and institutions, which have accused it of dismantling democracy with policies designed to limit civil liberties, control media, politicise the civil service and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-11/polish-government-battles-to-blunt-critical-rule-of-law-report\" title=\"\">neuter judicial independence</a>. In July this year, the European commission issued Warsaw with a three-month ultimatum to address threats to the rule of law or face potential sanctions. PiS reacted scornfully, with party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski calling the <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/polish-leader-commission-criticism-amuses-me-jaroslaw-kaczynski-beyong-eu-treaty-power/\" title=\"\">commission\u2019s ultimatum \u201camusing\u201d</a>.

There are several reasons for this, revealing dynamics observable not only in the wider eastern European region, but further west as well.</p> <p>While PiS is strongly rightwing on social issues, its economic approach can be described as leftist. It emphasises the need to tackle inequality and propagates strong welfare policies. It introduced unconditional monthly cash payments equivalent to \u00a3100 for all parents who have more than one child towards the upkeep of each subsequent child until he or she is 18. So if you have three children, you get \u00a3200 per month and so forth. For parents with one child, the payment is conditional on low income.</p> <p>No previous government ever embarked on such a generous social programme. PiS\u2019s approach puts many Polish leftists in a bind. On the one hand, they deplore the party\u2019s unashamedly xenophobic rhetoric; on the other, they like its economic views, especially in comparison to the main opposition parties, Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, both dominated by folk still enamoured with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek\" title=\"\">Hayek</a>. In effect, some on Poland\u2019s left are not as mobilised against PiS as they could be.</p> <p>While the west may have considered post-communist Poland a model of free-market success, many Poles felt marginalised in a society where successive governments espoused a \u201csink or swim\u201d attitude towards citizens, irrespective of whether it was the left or the right in power. Individual success was emphasised above all. PiS\u2019s more communitarian approach is appealing to many Poles who feel they now have a government interested in more than just macro-economic indicators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"877a7f5cf416e0a7e6c164c42dcb0473106b7a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877a7f5cf416e0a7e6c164c42dcb0473106b7a6f/0_0_2211_2497/885.jpg\" alt=\"A poster of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\" width=\"885\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski has been widely criticised in Europe for claiming migrants arriving on the continent could cause \u2018epidemics\u2019.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A second factor in PiS\u2019s continued popularity is that western Europe, where most criticism of the ruling party stems from, is now viewed far more critically than before by many Poles. PiS and its&#xa0;rightwing media allies are successfully&#xa0;portraying it&#xa0;as a den of politically correct madness, where hopelessly naive policies have put Europeans at increased risk of Islamic terrorism and being overrun by migrants.&#xa0;</p> <p>EU elites are portrayed as fanatical multiculturalists and secularists who are furious that a traditionally oriented, non-politically correct government is in control of Poland. Meanwhile, Kaczy\u0144ski insists: \u201cIt is completely untrue that to achieve western levels of development, we have to adopt their social models. That is hogwash.\u201d He insists Poland can achieve western-level economic development while maintaining age-old traditional Polish values and remaining a homogenous white Catholic country. In an age when much of Europe is facing an identity crisis, this message is resonating.</p> <p>A few years ago, no Polish government would have been able to get away with openly defying EU institutions without losing credibility domestically. But western opinion no longer has that kind of influence in Poland, especially among the numerically dominant conservatives. This is one of the most significant mental shifts in contemporary Poland and signals a new era in societal attitudes towards the west, one in which its economic development remains admired, but its cosmopolitan liberal values are largely rejected.</p> <p>PiS also remains popular because while Kaczy\u0144ski is highly controversial and generally disliked, the official faces of the government, Beata Szyd\u0142o, the prime minister, &#xa0;and Duda, the president,&#xa0;are both personable unassuming types who help the party maintain a folksy image. There is currently no leftist party in parliament and the liberal opposition is weak and divided. Moreover, both opposition party leaders, Grzegorz Schetyna of Civic Platform and Ryszard Petru of Nowoczesna, are nauseatingly opportunistic, the kind of politicians who won\u2019t take a public stance on any issue till they\u2019ve seen at least half a dozen opinion polls. People are sick of sly, calculating politicos; these days people value authenticity, even if they disagree with their views. PiS employs crude rhetoric, but comes across as authentic.</p> <p>Barring any major political or economic earthquakes, PiS will likely rule Poland for a while to come, providing momentum to the generally Eurosceptic, illiberal and authoritarian tendencies currently triumphing in eastern Europe. Its success should serve as a warning bell to liberals and leftists in the whole of Europe. A growing number of people are becoming increasingly willing to tolerate authoritarian and xenophobic tendencies from parties that offer them a sense of community and security.</p> <p>Ignoring this reality won\u2019t make it go away. On the contrary, if we don\u2019t respond adequately to this dynamic, we might all soon wake up in a Europe where parties similar to PiS have suddenly become the mainstream.</p>",
  "<p>Green energy accounted for more than half of net electricity generation capacity added around the world last year for the first time, leading energy experts have found.<br></p> <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the milestone was evidence of a rapid transformation in energy taking place, and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years.</p> <p>But the analysts said the outlook in the UK has deteriorated since the Conservative government took power last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\">cut support for wind and solar</a> power.

They are now getting a bit tired, and some others are overtaking Europe slowly but surely,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The IEA said Asia will be the \u201cengine of growth\u201d, led by China and India. \u201cChina is a completely separate chapter,\u201d said Birol. \u201cChina alone is responsible for about 40% of growth in the next five years. When people talk about China, they think about coal, but it is changing.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 153GW of net renewable electricity capacity was installed globally in 2015, a record high, equivalent to Canada\u2019s capacity and up 15% on the year before.

  "<p>Labour has been fined \u00a320,000 by the Electoral Commission, the largest imposed by the body in its history, for undeclared election spending during the 2015 campaign, including more than \u00a37,000 on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/21/ed-stone-destroyed-after-general-election\">so-called \u201cEd Stone\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The commission launched an investigation into two payments totalling \u00a37,614 missing from the party\u2019s election return that were spent on the stone tablet on which then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, had carved his six key election pledges, promising to display it in the Downing Street rose garden if he won the election.</p> <p>The problems with the party\u2019s spending came to light when the commission published the return in January, and journalists immediately contacted the commission because they could not find any reference to the 8ft 6in, two-tonne slab of limestone. The commission then found the item was indeed missing from the return, and began a full inquiry.</p> <p>After the commission launched its investigation, the party undertook an internal review, unearthing 24 other undeclared election expenses totalling \u00a3109,777.</p> <p>However, the commission\u2019s investigation then identified 49 further missing payments totalling \u00a311,357 that related to the transport of the party\u2019s activists on the Labour Express tour and Labour Students tour during the election.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s infamous pink bus, which toured the country speaking to female voters, was also investigated by the commission, which found that all its spend was in order. The Women to Women bus had been the subject of a complaint to the commission by Conservative MP Charles Walker, after his own party came under a similar, and highly publicised, investigation into transport of election activists. </p> <p>The commission also found invoices were missing from the Labour party\u2019s return, with 33 bills totalling \u00a334,392 absent from the accounts. </p> <p>The commission said Labour\u2019s general secretary, Iain McNicol, who is also its registered treasurer, had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-concludes-investigation-into-labour-partys-2015-general-election-spending\">committed two election offences</a>, involving missing payments of \u00a3123,748 from the campaign spending return and for failing to deliver invoices and receipts of more than \u00a3200 for payments totalling \u00a334,392.</p> <p>The \u00a320,000 fine, which has been paid by the party, is the largest fine the commission has imposed since it began operating in 2001. The commission said the party\u2019s cooperation had been taken into account but called on the government to grant it the ability to impose even larger fines, given the scale of the underreporting. </p> <p>Bob Posner, the commission\u2019s director of party and election finance, said: \u201cThe Labour party is a well-established, experienced party. Rules on reporting campaign spending have been in place for over 15 years and it is vital that the larger parties comply with these rules and report their finances accurately if voters are to have confidence in the system.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, the commission said it was pushing the government for an increase to the maximum \u00a320,000 penalty available to it for a single offence \u201cto an amount more in proportion with the spending and donations handled by large campaigners\u201d.</p> <p>A Labour party spokeswoman said: \u201cLabour has cooperated fully with the Electoral Commission during its investigation into general election 2015 campaign spending by political parties.</p> <p>\u201cThe commission\u2019s investigation found that internal procedural errors led to a relatively small number of items of expenditure not being declared properly. The party regrets these administrative errors. However, these amounted to just over 1% of our total spending of over \u00a312m during this election.</p> <p>\u201cWe accept the findings of the report and have already tightened our internal recording procedures to address the commission\u2019s concerns.\u201d </p> <p>Other parties could still be in line for fines or legal action because of general election spending. In May, Conservative activists were claimed to have misallocated expenditure for their \u201cBattlebus 2015\u201d campaign and hotel rooms for activists. The bus appears to have cost more than \u00a32,000 a day to run, but the expense was deemed to be a national campaigning cost, rather than constituency costs.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission had applied to the high court for documentation about the Conservatives\u2019 election spending \u2013 which trended on Twitter as #ToryElectionFraud \u2013 but then withdrew the action when the party provided the information. Its investigation is continuing and police forces across the country are also investigating in individual constituencies.</p> <p>Other campaigns have also faced similar accusations, including the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum, which had undeclared expenses of about \u00a357,000, and was fined \u00a32,000. </p>"
