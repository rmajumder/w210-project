  "<p>Following their meeting on Wednesday, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, insisted he told Donald Trump, during their meeting in Mexico City, that Mexico would not pay for a border wall between their two countries.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPN/status/771118159654891520\">tweeted</a>. A spokesman for the Mexican president later told the Guardian that there was no discussion of paying for the wall because Trump did not respond to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s statement. \u201cThe president told him clearly and the matter was not discussed further.\u201d </p> <p>Trump had told reporters after the meeting that while the pair had discussed a border wall, the topic of who would pay for it did not come up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That\u2019ll be for a later date,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign later released a statement that did not directly address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto. It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>A Trump source with knowledge of the meeting later added to the Guardian, \u201cboth parties knew each other\u2019s positions going into today, and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to start negotiating during this meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto had faced a wave of domestic criticism for inviting Trump to see him at Los Pinos, the residence of the Mexican president. The controversy came just hours after Trump left Mexico City for Arizona, where he was due to hold a major policy speech on immigration that same evening. </p> <p>The two met for an hour and then appeared before reporters to make separate statements about their unusual summit.</p> <p>Speaking at a podium next to Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump did his utmost to appear presidential on his second trip abroad and first meeting with a head of state as a candidate. However, in doing so, Trump seemed to continue <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-pena-nieto-immigration-arizona\">the \u201csoftening\u201d of his rhetoric</a> on immigration in advance of his policy speech on the topic, which he was to deliver later on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Speaking at the podium in restrained and almost subdued tones, Trump described undocumented immigrants as those entering the United States \u201cwithout legal authorization\u201d, praised first-, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans as \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and talked about keeping jobs \u201cin our hemisphere\u201d. This was in addition to Trump\u2019s concession to reporters afterwards that while he had discussed building a border wall with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, he did not even bring up his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\">signature proposal that Mexico would pay for such a wall</a>. </p> <p>This served as a major contrast to Trump\u2019s fiery and often bombastic tone on the campaign trail. </p> <p>He launched his candidacy in June 2015 by accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the US and has since claimed that a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, could not do his job impartially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\">because of his Mexican heritage</a>. At almost every campaign rally since then, Trump has held a call and response with his rambunctious crowds, asking: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The shouted answer has invariably been: \u201cMexico.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee has also repeatedly bashed free trade agreements, like Nafta, which he has said allows US workers to lose their jobs to Mexicans; as well as attacking specific companies for shifting their operations to Mexico. </p> <p>While it was speculated that Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has a 23% approval rating in his own country, might berate Trump for political gain, the Mexican president took a rather restrained stance speaking before his guest. </p> <p>He praised Trump for the \u201copen and constructive\u201d conversation they had. The Mexican president also did not directly criticize any of the controversial and racially charged remarks Trump has made since launching his campaign last year. Rather, Pe\u00f1a Nieto rebutted them indirectly by praising Mexican Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThey are honest people, working people \u2013 they are people that respect family, they respect the life in the community and they are respective of the law. As such, Mexicans deserve everybody\u2019s respect.\u201d Although Pe\u00f1a Nieto pointedly defended Nafta, a longstanding target of ire for Trump, he concede the free trade agreement \u201ccould be improved\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b/0_472_5362_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Mexico City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold placards during a protest against the visit of Donald Trump in Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Bravo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mexicans reacted with outrage to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s perceived deference and refusal to be tough with Trump. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time in the last 50 years when a Mexican president was so thoroughly humiliated in his own home,\u201d said Esteban Illades, editor of the intellectual and current affairs magazine Nexos. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto managed to make Trump look presidential while making himself look incredibly small. He ended up accepting an apology from Trump, even though Trump never even offered a half-hearted one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c@EPN reinforced in the US the stereotype of the docile Mexican, who you can insult and mock without consequences. The damage is done,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgesuarezv/status/771090300102184961\">tweeted</a> author Jorge Su\u00e1rez-V\u00e9lez.</p> <p>On Wednesday evening, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruizmassieu/status/771140787891384320\">tweeted</a> in Spanish that the president had, during the meeting with Trump, \u201cexpressed the grievance and outrage of Mexicans at insults and offenses\u201d.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto entered the meeting as Mexico\u2019s most unpopular president since polling on presidential approval started in the mid-1990s. Analysts expect the encounter to diminish Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity even further, especially since many Mexicans were expecting a robust response to a presidential candidate whose protectionist policies could cost Mexico economically. </p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto claims he is just trying to protect Mexicans. How, by welcoming to Mexico the candidate who has portrayed them as the enemy?\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a journalism professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. \u201cThis is more than a diplomatic blunder. This is a mistake of global proportions.\u201d</p> <p>The event was held just hours before Trump\u2019s scheduled speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, and came as the Republican nominee is trying to pivot to appeal to moderate suburban voters that he alienated during his primary campaign. </p> <p>In recent days, Trump has shifted away from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">his calls for \u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/donald-trump-deportation-immigration-plan-meeting-latino-leaders\">deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants</a> in the US within two years of taking office. </p> <p>Instead, he has flip-flopped in the past week about a potential path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and attacked the media for even focusing on the issue. </p> <p>\u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,\u201d Trump told voters in Iowa on Saturday.</p> <p>The campaign heralded Trump\u2019s trip, where he was accompanied by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Trump\u2019s statesmanship. </p> <p>In a statement, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mike Pence, said: \u201cWhat the American people are seeing today is the kind of decisive president Donald J Trump will be. This meeting begins a relationship where we can talk about the issues we\u2019ve got to resolve between the United States and Mexico, as well as the issues we have in common.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t publicize this statesmanship as much as it could have. Trump\u2019s campaign intentionally left the traveling press corps in the United States and prevented reporters from coming along, something the campaign treasurer, Jeff DeWit, bragged about at the campaign rally in Phoenix on Wednesday night.</p> <p>John Podesta, the chair of the Clinton campaign, mocked Trump for not pressing for Mexico to pay for the border wall in his meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign,\u201d said Podesta. \u201cBut at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate \u2018deal maker\u2019 is that he doesn\u2019t have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he\u2019s not in front of a friendly crowd.\u201d</p> <p> After Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s tweet, Podesta revised his statement: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn\u2019t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s more than a photo op.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">shock trip to Mexico</a> has the potential to shake up the US presidential election as the Republican candidate continues in an attempt to \u201csoften\u201d what has been one of his most hardline and controversial policy areas \u2013 immigration.</p> <p>Scheduled to take place just hours before Trump will finally spell out a definitive immigration policy after 14 months on the campaign trail, it will mark the first time that Trump has met with a head of state since becoming the Republican nominee and only his second foreign trip as a candidate. The first was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">his trip to Scotland</a> in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.<br></p> <p>The visit was announced in characteristic fashion by Trump, on Twitter. Just minutes before the Republican candidate was due to take the stage at a campaign rally in the safe Democratic state of Washington on Tuesday night, he tweeted: \u201cI have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting marks a shift in tone for Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who compared Trump to Mussolini and Hitler <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexican-president-pena-nieto-compares-donald-trump-to-hitler-and-mussolini/\">in a March interview</a> with a Mexican newspaper. \u201cI believe in dialogue to promote the interests of Mexico in the world and to protect Mexicans wherever they are,\u201d he tweeted early on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>It comes as the Mexican president is facing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611\">historically low approval ratings</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">a plagiarism controversy</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">ongoing corruption scandal</a> over a house purchased by his wife from a government contractor. </p> <p>Trump touched down in Mexico City shortly after 1pm local time and is scheduled to meet with Pena Nieto for roughly 90 minutes at Los Pinos, the presidential residence. Afterwards both the Mexican president and the Republican nominee are expected to give statements to the press. It is unclear if either will take questions although Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, insisted Wednesday that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a press availability\u201d in an interview with Fox News.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-visit-greeted-with-hostility-online\">has not been well received south of the border</a>. \u201c@realDonaldTrump you are not welcome in Mexico,\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MBarbosaMX/status/770822727510822912\">Miguel Barbosa</a>, of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution. \u201cGet out!

The pledge is a staple of his campaign rallies, at which he frequently asks the crowd: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The response is loudly shouted: \u201cMexico.\u201d<br></p> <p>Within minutes of announcing his presidential campaign in June 2015, Trump claimed that the Mexican government was deliberately sending criminals and rapists across the border to the United States. The Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/487316463204986880\">tweeted</a> that Mexico is an \u201cenemy\u201d of the United States and that the country is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/570384640281870337?lang=en\">\u201ccorrupt.\u201d</a> Despite all this, he has long maintained: \u201cI love the Mexican people.\u201d</p> <p>The trip is only Trump\u2019s second visit abroad as a candidate. Although presidential candidates often travel overseas to boost their foreign policy credentials, Trump has kept almost entirely to the United States. The only exception was his June trip to Scotland for the opening of his golf course there. Then, Trump held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">a self-congratulatory press conference</a> only hours after the UK had voted to leave the EU, at which the Republican nominee praised himself for correctly predicting the result. </p> <p>Unlike his trip to Scotland, Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico is intended to promote his campaign, not his personal business interests. It underscores the messaging in Trump\u2019s immigration speech scheduled for Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. There, the Republican nominee is expected to try to strike a balance between the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary and the need to deflect charges of racism in order to win a general election in November. </p> <p>The Republican nominee has struggled in the past two weeks to clarify his position on immigration, specifically whether he is undergoing \u201ca softening\u201d on his past call for the deportation of all 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Trump, who previously backed \u201ca deportation force,\u201d seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for undocumented immigrations and then reversed himself in the past week. The resulting lack of clarity forced prominent rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit to</a> his audience on Monday: \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration.</p> <p>In a statement, Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Trump\u2019s television show The Apprentice and senior advisor to his campaign, insisted that Trump would stay tough on immigration in his speech on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cThroughout his presidential campaign, Donald J Trump has been consistent in his calls to end illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border. He is the only candidate in this race who will stop illegal immigration, secure our border, end sanctuary cities, enforce our existing laws and stop American employers from hiring illegal workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThese reforms will not only put an end to our illegal immigration epidemic \u2014 they will promote safe communities and good-paying jobs that will make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>The move on immigration follows rhetorical attempts to reach out to African American voters following a shakeup of his campaign team and the hiring of pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of rightwing website Breitbart</a>, as his campaign CEO. </p> <p>Trump is not the only presidential candidate who has received an invitation from Pe\u00f1a Nieto. In a statement from senior campaign official, the Clinton campaign told the Guardian: \u201cWe have received a letter from President Pe\u00f1a Nieto requesting an opportunity to meet. Secretary Clinton last met with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials. She looks forward to talking with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto again at the appropriate time.\u201d</p> <p>Trump reportedly went to Mexico accompanied by two close advisers, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama. However, the Republican nominee was not accompanied by his traveling press corps, who have been stranded in the United States in an unprecedented step. The Trump campaign has been historically combative towards the press and refused to credential a number of outlets for his events, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">the Guardian in one instance</a>, on his trip to Scotland. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones\">Sam Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-agren\">David Agren</a> in Villahermosa, Mexico</em></p>",

This country\u2019s practice of anti-black racism coupled with official denial of institutional racism and collective amnesia regarding the horrors and crimes inflicted on black people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/15/black-american-culture-movement-identity-racism-political-art\">nurtures white resentment against black advancement</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/trump-trying-to-woo-black-voters-not-buying-it\">Trump is trying to woo black voters. We're not buying it | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White supremacist groups rose in the civil war\u2019s aftermath, organized by southern white people determined to use violence to deny Reconstruction-era promotion of black citizenship. The Ku Klux Klan is the most famous of these groups, whose numbers steadily increased at the end of the 19th century. By the early 20th century the Klan\u2019s worldview helped shape the racial nativism \u2013 marked by anti-immigrant fervor, antisemitism and anti-Catholicism \u2013 that gripped the nation.</p> <p>The Klan practically joined the American mainstream during the 1920s, proudly marching by the tens of thousands in the nation\u2019s capital, their very presence giving weight to the pseudo-science of eugenics being popularized at the time.</p> <p>Fewer white hate groups dotted America\u2019s political landscape after the second world war, the result of both the success of racial segregation and the pushback from anti-racist groups during WWII\u2019s freedom surge. The 1954 Brown v Board of Ed supreme court desegregation decision resurrected these groups with a vengeance, one of the most notable being the White Citizens Councils opposing public school integration that gained traction throughout the south.</p> <p>By the late 1960s, the political energies of hate groups reached their apex in the candidacy of former Alabama governor George Wallace, who received nearly 10m popular votes as a segregationist candidate for president in 1968. And the Republican party\u2019s now infamous \u201csouthern strategy\u201d further cultivated disgruntled white voters, sometimes called \u201cDixiecrats\u201d, with naked appeals to racism.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the inheritor of this complex history, is playing a most dangerous game. His calls to \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2013 which many view as thinly veiled code for white nationalism \u2013 has inspired millions of disgruntled and economically insecure white people, unleashing barely controlled furies that have roiled and embarrassed the nation. <br></p> <p>White Lives Matter proponents gained national attention when they <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/houston/article/White-Lives-Matter-group-protests-outside-NAACP-9176142.php\">staged a protest</a> outside of NAACP offices in Houston that prominently featured the Confederate flag. An outgrowth of a social media meme that spread among white people in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests, the group traffics in the fiction that white Americans are under assault from an onslaught of illegal immigration, reverse racism and political correctness. </p> <p>With ties to the white nationalist Aryan Front Coalition and a self-described mission to preserve the white race, White Lives Matter joins the Southern Poverty law Center\u2019s list of 892 active hate groups in the US. America\u2019s racial Pandora\u2019s box, once thought to have been closed by Obama\u2019s watershed presidential election, has been reopened with a vengeance.</p> <p>As our third consecutive summer of racial discontent comes to an end, white and black Americans remain <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/27/key-takeaways-race-and-inequality/\">split</a> over what might be called our collective racial reality. Blacks are more likely than whites to perceive racial discrimination, advocate for substantive policy changes, document unfair treatment by the criminal justice system and other institutions and to support Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Yet these differences merely scratch the surface of the pernicious effect of groups such as White Lives Matter. Buoyed by Trump\u2019s campaign and the capitulation of mainstream Republicans, groups like White Lives Matter have helped anti-black racism to once again be normalized. And its activists form the latest beachhead in the racial archipelago that contours a nation that twice voted overwhelmingly to elect a black president.</p> <p>The devastating takeaway from allegations of reverse racism, the promotion of the Confederate flag and the demonization of Black Lives Matter is the surreal picture by many aggrieved whites that they are the most discriminated-against group in America. </p> <p>Even as social economic indicators reveal the exact opposite, the racial grievances and resentment emanating from such hate groups have successfully captured the imagination of a sizeable portion of the American electorate. White Lives Matter\u2019s designation as a hate group confirms what we already knew about not just one organization, but the iconic demagogue who has breathed life into racial furies that we recently thought were facing extinction. </p>",
  "<p>Outside of their respective hairstyles, questionable real estate dealings and plagiarism scandals, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Donald Trump don\u2019t seem to have much in common. So why then would Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2013 seemingly out of the blue \u2013 invite Trump to Los Pinos? At first glance, the timing of it might seem strange.

He later promised to erect a border wall (which Pe\u00f1a Nieto has publicly refused to build) while also pledging to deport 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, on the other hand, has gone so far as to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/enrique-pena-nieto-trump-hitler-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">liken</a> Trump to Hitler and Mussolini for that kind of rhetoric. </p> <p>And yet, those spats aren\u2019t getting in the way of a meeting. It\u2019s reported that neither the US embassy in Mexico nor the Mexican government were given advance warning about the visit. And though Pe\u00f1a Nieto did extend invitations to both Hillary Clinton and Trump to meet with him in Mexico City, it\u2019s easy to see that both Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trump have something to gain from this particularly timely visit.</p> <p>Trump stands to bolster his ever-loosening grip on his campaign\u2019s trademark issue, immigration, ahead of his big speech in Arizona on Wednesday. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, meanwhile, stands to salvage his waning poll <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visit-a-big-gamble-for-mexicos-president-1472652442\">numbers</a> \u2013 now hovering around 23% according to one recent survey \u2013 by looking like he is standing up to Trump. The visit is also a timely distraction from embarrassing reports, which have dominated recent headlines, that he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">plagiarized</a> his law degree thesis. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This week\u2019s bad press, which includes the <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20160830-mexico-federal-police-chief-sacked-drug-cartel-executions-michuacan\">sacking</a> of Mexico\u2019s police commissioner following allegations of cartel executions, follows months of looming scandals plaguing his own administration. These include large teacher strikes, allegations of the use of torture on ordinary citizens and most recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/mexico-first-lady-florida-property-government-contractor-documents-reveal\">reports</a> that the Mexican first lady\u2019s home is owned by a potential government contractor. All of the above have sent Mexican confidence in its president plunging.</p> <p>The embarrassing thing is that we can actually see Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s logic at work in real time as this disaster unfolds. The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy. There\u2019s only one problem with this plan. Trump may well hijack that narrative, frame the meeting to his advantage and then straight-up lie about the details in Arizona with a straight face. </p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto, with his credibility already weakened internationally, would be easy prey. His name is almost synonymous with the brand of poor Mexican governance that Trump rails against in his anti-immigrant tirades all over the country. And even if Pe\u00f1a Nieto does a good job in standing tall to Trump\u2019s xenophobic, anti-Nafta, pro-wall rhetoric, the president risks everything should the Republican candidate choose to exploit his numerous political weaknesses. That would not just be damaging to him, but to Mexico\u2019s international reputation at large. </p> <p>That\u2019s why many fear this gamble can only go well for Trump. And if this meeting teaches us anything it\u2019s that Pe\u00f1a Nieto is willing to risk Mexican ire and possible geopolitical consequences if only to save his own political career. </p>",

  "<p>The UK has become a laughing stock abroad since the vote to leave the EU, the Liberal Democrat leader has said.</p> <p>Giving a speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in Manchester on Wednesday, Tim Farron said \u201cmalevolent forces\u201d were seeking to hijack the result of the referendum and that the vote had not been an endorsement of Ukip\u2019s politics.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been made a laughing stock abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to watch the shaming pictures of Nigel Farage sneering on our behalf in the European parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian after the speech, Farron said people abroad were increasingly associating the UK with figures like Farage, the former Ukip leader. \u201cWhen Nigel Farage gets up to speak in the European parliament it\u2019s noticed by very few people here, but it\u2019s noticed by pretty much everybody on the continent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week, Hillary Clinton, the US Democratic presidential hopeful, condemned her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, for sharing a platform with Farage, whom she described as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s most prominent rightwing leaders\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that that is how we are seen overseas and that\u2019s not something I want for my country,\u201d said Farron, in reference to Clinton\u2019s comments. \u201cIf we end up going down the road of Brexit \u2026 we do need nevertheless to be a country that is open, outward-facing and utterly engaged with the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t allow the faces of Farage, and [foreign secretary Boris] Johnson, [Brexit secretary David] Davis and [international trade secretary Liam] Fox to represent Britain.

  "<p>Clashes between opposition supporters and security forces broke out in the capital of Gabon on Wednesday after Ali Bongo, the incumbent president, was controversially declared the winner of Saturday\u2019s election, extending the rule of one of Africa\u2019s longest political dynasties to more than 50 years. </p> <p>Three people were apparently shot dead by security forces and many more wounded after crowds tried to storm the offices of the electoral commission in Libreville shortly after authorities announced Bongo\u2019s re-election by a narrow majority.</p> <p>There were reports that protesters had set fire to part of Gabon\u2019s parliament building.

Bongo Junior, as Ali is known, has tried to distance himself from the sins of his father, but the apparent manipulation of the vote in at least one province has attracted much criticism.</p> <p>Many Gabonese ventured out early on Wednesday to stock up on groceries, anticipating the violent clashes between protesters and the armed forces, which were deployed to the streets of Libreville on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>The army fired stun grenades and teargas at a crowd of people outside the headquarters of the electoral commission shouting \u201cAli must go!\u201d According to Ping, they also fired live bullets, which he said killed three and wounded many. Bongo\u2019s aides denied this and accused the opposition of fabricating rumours.<br></p> <p>The first battle was not fought on Libreville\u2019s potholed streets, however, but in an obscure corner of Wikipedia.

Then it was changed back.<br></p> <p>In Gabon\u2019s election, much rested on how many voters there were in Haut Ogoou\u00e9, the last province to be counted, and which way they voted.<br></p> <p>According to the electoral commission, 99.9% of the province, Bongo\u2019s home region, took part in the vote, and 95% of them voted for him. The question on the lips of many Gabonese citizens was why there was such a high turnout in Haut Ogoou\u00e9, when nationally it was 59%.<br></p> <p>However, Bongo scored lower than his father, who famously won 100% of the national vote in the 1986 election, with a 99.9% turnout, when Gabon was still a one-party state.<br></p> <p>Ping, a half-Chinese diplomat who was previously one of the Bongo family\u2019s most trusted cronies, rejected the result and demanded a recount in Haut Ogoou\u00e9.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cThe citizens of Gabon peacefully and respectfully exercised their right to freely and fairly choose our country\u2019s next president. The current president, Ali Bongo, did not approve of their choice, so he substituted his will for theirs. <br>  \u201cAli Bongo wants the Gabonese people and the entire world to believe his \u2018results\u2019 that he took three days behind closed doors to concoct. The Gabonese people and the world can clearly see the fraud, lies, and manipulation behind a \u201899.9%\u2019 voter turnout in the areas where he \u2018won\u2019 \u2013 also by a truly unbelievable \u201895%\u2019 \u2013 including thousands of voters who don\u2019t even exist or are currently alive there. <br></p> <p> \u201c\u2018Results\u2019 like Ali Bongo\u2019s are the hallmarks of dictators and tyrants who refuse to give up power \u2013 not the cornerstones of democracies, nations, and peoples who respect fairness and the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>Ping added: \u201cTo use one province to impose a coup in the country could have serious consequences for national unity.\u201d</p> <p>Opposition parties united behind Ping just a week before the election. His party claimed victory very early on, as did Bongo.<br></p> <p>The national election commission (Cenap) was due to announce the result on Tuesday afternoon at 5pm local time. As the nation held its breath and turned on its televisions to learn its fate, however, Cenap failed to appear, and nervous voters were instead treated to reruns of Hannah Montana, the American TV series that made Miley Cyrus famous. Cenap officials surfaced nearly a full day later.<br></p> <p>Many Gabonese also pointed out that five days to count 600,000 votes \u2013 Gabon is a country with vast rainforests but a tiny population \u2013 was excessive.<br></p> <p>Ping had been expected to win, according to Fran\u00e7ois Conradie, an analyst from NKC African Economics.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe think, based on what the opposition has reported and on what sources have told us about people\u2019s voting preferences in Gabon, that Mr Ping won more votes than Mr Bongo,\u201d Conradie said.<br></p> <p>A smiling Bongo said the election had been \u201chotly contested, strong and democratic\u201d, adding that he \u201cdeplored the excesses of the campaign and the attempts at destabilisation that we have, partly, been able to thwart\u201d.<br></p> <p>Ping painted a less rosy picture for the future of the Bongo dynasty. \u201cTheir ship is sinking \u2013 even the rats are starting to leave it.

To tackle the food shortage, last month Maduro appointed Venezuela\u2019s top general, defence minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, to oversee the \u201cgrand mission of sovereign supply\u201d, which aims to secure the supply of basic goods. Last week Padrino named one general for each of the most crucial goods. </p> <p>\u201cThe gradual expansion of military powers in response to the regime\u2019s loss of legitimacy is starting to resemble a slow-motion coup,\u201d wrote Phil Gunson, analyst for the International Crisis Group thinktank.</p> <p>Smilde said Maduro\u2019s decision to involve generals in government was like \u201cbecoming blood-brothers with the military\u201d. \u201cMaduro has made the military a stakeholder in the government so when things go bad, it\u2019s not that people will be rebelling against the government, they will be rebelling against the military, too,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, Venezuela is under increasing international pressure and scrutiny. Last month, the US filed trafficking charges against the former head of the Venezuelan drugs agency, whom Maduro then promptly named interior minister. At the same time regional groups such as the Organisation of American States, and the Mercosur trading block have questioned the Venezuelan government\u2019s democratic credentials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b0e7ac226ff3d2bfb8a63d339b98b9194ccd74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b0e7ac226ff3d2bfb8a63d339b98b9194ccd74/0_0_1881_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers stand guard as university students stage an anti-government protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"759\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers stand guard as university students stage an anti-government protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSince they know the world is watching, the military should respect the manifestation of the people and understand they want change,\u201d says Luis Alberto Butt\u00f3, director of the Latin American Centre for Security Studies at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University in Caracas.</p> <p>Maduro took office after narrowly winning an election to succeed the controversial and charismatic Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who set his country on the path toward \u201c21st-century socialism\u201d with enormous popular support. Under Maduro, however, Venezuela has sunk into an ever-deepening economic and social crisis. </p> <p>Many Venezuelans complain they are eating only once or twice a day amid chronic food shortages. Even standing in long queues for hours to enter supermarkets does not assure shoppers they will go home with anything. Medicines for life-threatening conditions are nearly impossible to come by. The economy is expected to contract by 8% this year after the GDP dropped 5.7% in 2015. Inflation hovers around 700% and violent crime is skyrocketing.</p> <p>A poll by Venebar\u00f3metro found that 88% of \u201clikely\u201d voters in a recall referendum would choose to oust Maduro.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff55ee5033c397b5b223fb89243e1e14710f002d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff55ee5033c397b5b223fb89243e1e14710f002d/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman with a sign reading \u201cThere is no food\u201d protests against new emergency powers decreed by President Maduro in front of a line of police officers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman with a sign reading: \u2018There is no food\u2019 protests against new emergency powers decreed by President Maduro in front of a line of police officers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the 1 September marches will be a show of force for the opposition, the protest is unlikely to sway electoral authorities \u2013 widely considered to do the government\u2019s bidding \u2013 to move towards a recall referendum this year. </p> <p>And timing is key. The opposition managed to collect enough signatures earlier this year to set in motion a series of steps to force a recall vote. They are now waiting for election authorities to set a definitive date to launch a second drive to get 3.9 million people \u2013 20% of registered voters \u2013 to sign the recall petition in three days to formally trigger the referendum. Officials said the date would be at the end of October. </p> <p>That, according to the opposition, would give officials enough time to organise the referendum on Maduro before he reaches the mid-point of his six-year term on 10 January 2017. A recall before that date would mean new elections. After that, his vice-president would simply take over and most likely continue the policies that critics say have brought the country to its knees. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40070f0d124767e3f098162e522bd6e7194ba933\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40070f0d124767e3f098162e522bd6e7194ba933/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-government protester with the word \u2018freedom\u2019 painted on his fists in the colours of the Venezuela flag.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-government protester with the word \u2018freedom\u2019 painted on his fists in the colours of the Venezuela flag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Gutierrez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

This week, people are asking. </p> <p>The Maine Council of Churches, which represents Catholic and mainline Protestant denominations, denounced the governor\u2019s \u201cvitriolic personal attack and disrespect\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe words he chose to use in the message and interview were unspeakable \u2013 and yet, he spoke them, disgracing the office of governor and dishonoring our state in the eyes of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Fellow Republican Amy Volk, a state senator, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about his behavior, \u201cwhether it is due to substance abuse, mental illness, or just ignorance\u201d.</p> <p> LePage\u2019s political career may run aground, but he has been navigating uncharted waters for six years in this rural New England state of 1.3 million, previously known for its civil political discourse and the election of moderates such as US senators Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Bill Cohen (Republicans), George Mitchell and Ed Muskie (Democrats), and Angus King (independent).</p> <p> Within days of taking office in 2011, LePage was generating news headlines for telling the NAACP, on television on the eve of the annual Martin Luther King Jr holiday, to \u201ckiss my butt\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s since told the public that a Democratic senator liked to \u201cgive it to the people without Vaseline\u201d, that the Internal Revenue Service is akin to the Gestapo, that the state government he oversees is corrupt, and that he\u2019d like to bomb the state\u2019s largest newspaper, the Portland Press Herald. </p> <p> He\u2019s tangled with legislators of both parties, refusing for months to allow his commissioners to testify before legislative committees and, last year, suddenly issuing hundreds of vetoes of bills to retaliate against them for declining to take up his initiative to eliminate the state income tax. (Lawmakers of both parties overturned most of the vetoes.) </p> <p>There were calls for his impeachment last year over an incident in which LePage threatened to cut off state funding to an educational not-for-profit group unless its board reconsidered a decision to hire the outgoing Democratic house speaker, Mark Eves, to lead the organization. Ultimately, legislators took no action and Eves had to find work elsewhere.</p> <p>In a racially charged preamble to the current controversy, LePage told a crowd in January that \u201cguys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty \u2013 these types of guys\u201d come to Maine \u201cfrom Connecticut and New York\u201d to try to sell heroin and \u201cimpregnate a young white girl before they leave\u201d. Maine is the whitest state in the country, at 96.9%.</p> <p>The state\u2019s top Republicans \u2013 and many Republican voters \u2013 stuck with him after a turbulent first term. He was re-elected with 48% of the vote in a three-way race with the endorsement of Senator Susan Collins and campaign donations from former governor John McKernan and the Pac of his wife, former senator Olympia Snowe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a052847fc35a0c83295e2513cbb346d45349fcb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a052847fc35a0c83295e2513cbb346d45349fcb5/0_133_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People clap during speeches at a rally to protest at recent remarks by Governor Paul LePage in Capital Park in Augusta, Maine, on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People clap during speeches at a rally to protest at recent remarks by Governor Paul LePage in Capital Park in Augusta, Maine, on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Phelan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LePage has always claimed a personal tie to Snowe, who also grew up in Lewiston-Auburn under difficult circumstances. Snowe was orphaned at a young age. LePage, the eldest of 18 children, ran away from home at 11 after his father broke his jaw in one of his frequent child-beating sessions. </p> <p>Raised through the kindness of several area businesspeople, LePage got into college and had his first year\u2019s tuition paid for by lawmaker and businessman Peter Snowe, who would later marry Olympia and who died in a 1973 car accident.</p> <p>LePage thrived in college and went on to a career in business management, eventually specializing in winding down bankrupt companies. He was mayor of Waterville, a town of 16,000, and was elected governor in a tight three-way race in 2010, promising to crack down on welfare cheats, reduce taxes and regulations, and thereby revive the state\u2019s moribund economy. He has said that welfare dependency undermined some of his younger siblings.</p> <p>In the current presidential election cycle, LePage was one of the first sitting governors to endorse Chris Christie for the Republican nomination, then followed Christie in switching his allegiance to Trump. Trump\u2019s campaign recently hired LePage\u2019s daughter as its coalitions director for the state.</p> <p>In the latest controversy, the governor revealed he collects press clippings of drug dealer arrests and keeps them in a three-ring binder. Over 90% of those pictured, he has claimed, are black and Hispanic. FBI data shows black people account for 14.1% of drug arrests in Maine.</p> <p>On Monday, LePage was sticking to his assertions. At a meeting of New England governors in Boston, he said of heroin dealers arrested in Maine: \u201cThey\u2019re Hispanic and they\u2019re black and they\u2019re from Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts; Waterbury, Connecticut; and the Bronx and Brooklyn.\u201d It was not clear why the race of the drug dealers was important.</p> <p>On Wednesday, LePage said Wednesday he would not resign.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic, and I\u2019m not a drug addict, and I don\u2019t have mental issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have is a backbone.\u201d</p> <p>He said instead he would seek \u201cspiritual guidance\u201d. He also <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-lepage-vows-never-speak-media-227589\">vowed</a> never to speak to the press again, according to Politico. </p> <p>But legislative Republicans might have an incentive to impeach him before the November election, which would make the current president of the state senate, Michael Thibodeau, governor. If Democrats were to recapture control of the state senate, a future impeachment effort could give them the governor\u2019s mansion as well.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 September 2016 to clarify that Peter Snowe was a lawmaker and businessman, not an attorney.</li> </ul>",

To him, New York had always been under attack.</p> <p>At the beginning of his first term, Giuliani gave a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/nyregion/freedom-is-about-authority-excerpts-from-giuliani-speech-on-crime.html\">chilling speech</a> in which he said: \u201cFreedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do.\u201d</p> <p>He proceeded to put his words into action. First, he made good on a campaign promise to clean up squeegee men \u2013 launching the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/criticism-for-giulianis-broken-windows-theory-2014-12\">broken windows\u201d era</a> that would end up disproportionately jailing black people and other minorities. He then embraced the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8551/\">ideas of transit cop Jack Maple</a> and helped launch CompStat, the city\u2019s data-driven crime-fighting system. It can\u2019t be denied that crime fell \u2013 and that\u2019s how Giuliani is today able to claim he saved \u201cmore black lives\u201d than Beyonc\u00e9. <br></p> <p>But despite CompStat\u2019s real successes, it also can\u2019t be denied that crime was already falling when he took office \u2013 and it was happening nationwide. Later, when New York police commissioner William Bratton landed on the cover of Time magazine as New York\u2019s top crime fighter, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-bratton-sounds-de-blasio-policing-policies-article-1.1489351\">Giuliani pushed him out</a> for taking too much credit. </p> <p>There were other clear signs of paranoia during the Giuliani years. Long before the World Trade Center attacks, the front steps of city hall \u2013 a place for public gatherings and protest \u2013 were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/21/nyregion/giuliani-defends-decision-over-access-to-city-hall.html\">sealed off by police barricades</a> that remain in place today. The administration claimed it was a security measure; the mayor\u2019s detractors felt certain it was done to limit access and stifle free speech. <br></p> <p>Giuliani\u2019s city hall was also the subject of constant lawsuits. Some were filed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/22/nyregion/court-tells-giuliani-to-release-budget-data.html\">other city agencies</a> to which he wouldn\u2019t release necessary data; others were brought by individuals whose whose constitutional rights were being violated by the city. Many of those lawsuits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/a-legacy-of-giuliani-years-damage-suits-against-city.html\">were still being settled</a> \u2013 for millions of dollars \u2013 years into the administration of Mike Bloomberg, Giuliani\u2019s successor.</p> <p>In short, Rudy Giuliani wasn\u2019t a great mayor, or even a good one. But on one terrible day, he was a strong, decisive one. He could have faded quietly into history, remembered as the man who kept the city together in its hour of need. Instead, by becoming Donald Trump\u2019s attack dog, the former mayor has instead ensured that his larger-than-life ego and his combative abrasiveness \u2013 the qualities New Yorkers remember all too well, and which kept him from the presidency \u2013 will ultimately define his legacy.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI just say whatever dumb stuff comes into my head, and most of it is disgusting and horrible,\u201d Amy Schumer muses happily, midway through her set. This, of course, is a lie: while Schumer still likes to project an image of herself as a pottymouth who\u2019s just winging it, you don\u2019t become one of the biggest standups in the world by the age of 35 without working your butt off.</p> <p>Schumer keeps her 90-minute show under deceptively tight control, sneaking frequent peeks at her notes while affecting to stroll casually through her mental landscape, which spans all of Americana from the Kardashians to an improbably hilarious section on gun control \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 in the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cSomeone on the suspected terrorist list can buy a gun. So we\u2019re like, \u2018Get the hell out of our country! But before you do, would you like to buy a gun?\u2019\u201d she says, touching on a subject that has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/amy-schumer-renews-call-stricter-gun-control\">cause for Schumer</a> ever since a gunman attacked an audience at a screening of her film, Trainwreck, last summer, killing two young women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer: \u2018I'm not trying to be likable\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is Schumer\u2019s first international tour since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/trainwreck\">Trainwreck</a>, which pushed her out of the category of \u201csuccessful comedian\u201d and into the \u201cbona fide A-list celebrity\u201d golden circle. This shift has not always seemed comfortable for her: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">in interviews</a> she has become increasingly suspicious and monosyllabic and in her forthcoming book, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13467201/amy-schumer-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo-review/\">The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</a>, she appears unsure how to reconcile her celebrity status with her everygirl image. </p> <p>But on stage, which she has always said is where she feels happiest, there are no such troubles. Amid her usual favourite subjects \u2013 sex, women\u2019s neuroses and neuroses about women \u2013 she achieves what few have done before her and makes her tales of newfound fame genuinely funny and interesting. Her riff on what it feels like when near-naked photos of you go viral and you don\u2019t have a celebrity-sized body is done with a light touch, while still making a sharp jab; and her anecdote about her encounter with the American broadcaster Katie Couric made me double over with laughter. While many of the stories she tells are straight out of her book, she is more sure-footed with them on stage and has a better control of the tone.</p> <p>Yet it is hard not to wish Schumer would relax some of her control. Some anecdotes, while amusing, don\u2019t really go anywhere, seemingly said by rote just because they are on her setlist. By contrast, she sparks to life when dealing with a heckler, shooting back whipsmart retorts without pausing for breath. She should trust herself more and not stick quite so rigidly to the plan.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how long Schumer can pull off this trick: affecting normality while hanging out with Hillary Clinton and earning $8m book advances. Going by those who have tried before her, the safe bet is not that long. She is already outgrowing her persona as the chaotic mess who happily blacks out on sleeping pills and wine, to the disgust of her boyfriend \u2013 and she knows it. That shtick is too small for her huge celebrity presence. But for now, at least on stage, she is still acing it. </p> <ul> <li>At the O2 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.amyschumer.com/tour\">Apollo Manchester</a> on 3 September.

  "<p>Immigration has been one of Donald Trump\u2019s signature issues since he announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. From the moment he got off the escalator at Trump Tower in New York and spoke about Mexico deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the United States and the need to build a wall on the southern border, Trump hasn\u2019t stopped talking about immigration. </p> <p>But in his Wednesday speech on the topic in Phoenix \u2013 which will follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">his surprise visit to Mexico</a> \u2013 Trump will need to balance the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary with the need to win a general election in November.<br></p> <p>Trump rode his hardline stance to victory in the primary. While his rivals refused to categorically rule out a path to legal status for any of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States, Trump talked about <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-vows-humane-deportation-force\">\u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> to remove all of them <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">within 18 to 24 months.</a> </p> <p>However, the Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">never worked out his plan in detail</a>. The Trump campaign has divulged little on its actual policy, save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-mexico-economy\">a set of proposals</a> dating back to August 2015. At almost every rally, Trump pledges that he will \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it\u201d, but he has rarely gone into more detail. </p> <p>But, facing a general election where he has major deficits in the polls and is reviled by Latino voters, the Republican nominee has begun what he called a rhetorical \u201csoftening\u201d in recent weeks, raising questions about whether he was ever sincere in his hardline stance. </p> <p>In the past week and a half, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for</a> undocumented immigrants in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity, only to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">reverse himself</a> in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. The back and forth prompted conservative talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit</a>, \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration. Further, he announced late on Tuesday night that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">meet the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a> before the speech on Wednesday to discuss immigration.</p> <p>The ongoing furor has raised the stakes around Trump\u2019s speech and stoked outrage about an apparent flip-flop. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">a speech in Iowa</a> on Saturday, Trump spoke about details from his August 2015 plan that had gone almost unmentioned since, including the implementation of E-Verify (an online system that allows businesses to screen employees\u2019 work eligibility) nationwide as well as an exit-entry tracking system to prevent visa overstays. However, Trump dismissed the question of what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, instead blaming the media: \u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-immigration-plan-deportation-mike-pence\">Trump surrogates: Republican's position on immigration has not changed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mark Krikorian, a leading immigration hawk and head of the Center for Immigration Studies, bemoaned the fact that Trump has spent a \u201cweek and a half meandering\u201d on immigration. Krikorian, who has met with Trump on the issue, said this \u201cwas especially absurd given that it\u2019s a core, key issue. He\u2019s running as \u2018Mr Immigration Control\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Krikorian told the Guardian he thought that Trump can only end up in the place where he actually started, \u201cfocusing on enforcement tools like E-Verify and tracking for visa holders\u201d.</p> <p>The vocal immigration hawk thought \u201cthe question of what happens to illegal immigrants is secondary; [the] primary question is how we stop another 12 million people from coming here.\u201d He noted that Trump was on record saying that some form of \u201camnesty\u201d would always happen but that \u201ca politician has no business talking like that and that\u2019s the one most important thing that I am looking to not see, is some kind of guarantee or commitment of amnesty.\u201d But he said that he was far less concerned about the wall, which \u201cas a policy matter is not that important\u201d.</p> <p>In the meantime, those on the right worried about a rhetorical softening did find some comfort from an interview that Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr, gave to CNN on Tuesday, in which he said that his father\u2019s stance on undocumented immigrants was still the same and that all 11 million had to leave the country. But as longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone once said: \u201cNo one speaks for Donald Trump but Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee is scheduled to give his immigration speech at 6pm local time at the Phoenix Convention Center on Wednesday. </p>",

The rain is coming down in Canberra, there is a coral installation in front of parliament asking pollies to choose the reef over coal and <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> is visiting a building site in a high-vis vest. </p> <p>In the parliament we are preparing for debate and I will give you a full list of legislation in a minute. The reason Turnbull is at a building site is to trumpet that today, children, is all about industrial relations and the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He also wants you to know that he has an economic plan. He says he is willing to compromise on the ABCC bill to get it through. There is your olive branch to the crossbench and specifically <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> and <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>.</p> <p>But there are skirmishes and frolics, both within his party and without. <strong>Cory Bernardi</strong> is introducing his private member\u2019s bill in the Senate to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the Racial Discrimination Act. This does not mean the bill gets debated yet, it just sits there in the queue. <strong>Eric Abetz</strong> has been out defending the case in a sterling effort on Radio National, which I shall also bring you shortly.</p> <p>Turnbull has just been asked about the marriage equality plebiscite.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know that a majority of Australians support a plebiscite. We know if there is a plebiscite a majority will vote yes. How long will Bill Shorten keep playing these political games?</p> </blockquote> <p>Late yesterday, the crossbenchers <strong>Adam Bandt, Andrew Wilkie </strong>and<strong> Cathy McGowan </strong>came out with their own bill on marriage equality. Labor has flagged theirs but not revealed the draft yet. Expect this any time today or tomorrow via suspension of standing orders. If not, the first Monday of the next sitting, when private member\u2019s business is due. </p> <p>From the papers, we now know <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> and <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> argued for changes to rein in generous negative gearing tax concessions but lost the battle. There are rumblings that the Coalition is preparing another bank initiative in order to head off Labor\u2019s expected motion for a bank royal commission. Meanwhile Labor bank warrior <strong>Sam Dastyari</strong> is having his own good times, with revelations <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-senator-sam-dastyari-had-chinese-interests-foot-the-bill-for-travel-entitlement-repayment-20160830-gr4mlh.html\">reported by Latika Bourke</a> at Fairfax that he asked a Chinese donor to pay his travel bills after he exceeded the taxpayer-funded allowance.

Starting in 2008 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/17/brazil-petrobras-scandal-oil-general-election\">ramping up in 2014</a>, federal police, prosecutors and judges have uncovered a multibillion-dollar kickback and bribery scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras, the biggest company in Latin America until the scandal hit.</p> <p>Essentially, contracts were inflated so up to 3% of funds could be channelled to the three parties that previously formed a ruling coalition: the Workers party, the Democratic Movement party of Brazil (PMDB) and the Progressive party. The probe, however, has widened to include other parties and other projects, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/brazil-rousseff-corruption-belo-monte-dam\">Belo Monte hydroelectric dam</a>. Some predict it will lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/brazil-impeachment-economy-crisis-corruption\">greatest jailing of lawmakers</a> in world history.</p> <h2>What has been the impact on the country?</h2> <p>The scandal has paralysed the government because bribes were essential for building coalitions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/rio-olympics-crisis-brazil-zika-athletes-woes-uplift\">It has also choked business</a> because prosecutors ordered the suspension of contracts between Petrobras and its major suppliers, which included almost all of the country\u2019s biggest construction and shipping firms. In more than two years, 61% of Petrobras\u2019 276,000 employees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/brazil-petrobras-scandal-layoffs-dilma-rousseff\">have lost their jobs</a>, according to local media. Many smaller firms that depended on its business have been made bankrupt.</p> <p>Many believe this pain will be worthwhile if the investigation leads to punishment of all corrupt politicians and sets the stage for a new era of clean government. But that future is a long way off, if it comes at all.</p> <h2>Why do Brazilian parties need slush funds?</h2> <p>Politicians all over the world need campaign finance, but it is particularly important in Brazil due to the country\u2019s vast size, plethora of parties, three levels of government (with regular elections for municipal, state and national leaders and legislators) and an open-list election system for lawmakers. No single party has ever come close to a commanding majority in Congress, so support is bought with cabinet posts and/or cash.</p> <h2>Who is making the accusations?</h2> <p>The investigation is nationwide, but the charge is being led by judicial figures in the southern city of Curitiba. Most influential among them is Judge Sergio Moro, who has become something of a cult figure for his willingness to take on the country\u2019s most powerful politicians and business people. Other prominent figures include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/brazil-anti-corruption-prosecutor-deltan-dallagnol-lava-jato-investigation\">Curitiba prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol</a> and police chief Igor Romario de Paula.</p> <p>Not everyone thinks they are heroes.

Prosecutors have found no evidence that she was involved and even her enemies acknowledge that she is one of the few politicians in Brazil not to accept bribes.</p> <p>However, it is widely assumed that Rousseff must have known what was going on because she was a former energy minister and chief of staff at the height of the wrongdoing. Many of her confidants have been arrested or are on trial. Whether she was aware of what was going on or not, she benefited from the campaign funds and failed to halt the corruption. Prosecutors allege she also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-judge-lula-da-silva-appointment-cabinet-wiretap-scandal-rousseff\">tried to obstruct their investigation</a> and protect her ally Lula by appointing him to the cabinet. </p> <h2>Is that why Rousseff was being impeached?</h2> <p>Only partly, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-the-political-system-should-be-on-trial-not-one-woman\">for all the wrong reasons</a>. Rousseff has ostensibly been thrown out of office because she window-dressed government accounts ahead of the last presidential election. The charge is that her government filled holes in its accounts by taking loans from state banks without congressional approval.</p> <p>Opponents say this creative accounting \u2013 accounting sleights of hand known as \u201cpedaladas\u201d (pedalling) \u2013 allowed the administration to fund a program for family farmers using money that was not reimbursed until several months later, bypassing Congress, creating a misleading impression of state finances and adding to economic instability.</p> <p>In her defence, Rousseff said the money was not a loan because it was simply being transferred through the state banks from public coffers. Similar practices had also been used by previous administrations, though not at the same scale.</p> <p>But this is a pretext. The real reasons for impeachment are political. Rousseff is enormously unpopular because she is blamed for the multiple crises facing the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-fight-congress-vote\">has proved an inept leader</a>. But Brazil\u2019s constitution does not allow a no-confidence vote to eject her from office so her enemies are using impeachment to do the job.</p> <p>Some are clearly motivated by a desire to kill the Lava Jato investigation, which Rousseff refused to do. The impeachment process was initiated by Cunha after the Workers party refused to protect him from an ethics committee investigation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/brazil-dilma-rousseff-plot-secret-phone-transcript-impeachment\">Secretly recorded conversations</a> have also revealed that the PMDB leader in the Senate, Romero Juc\u00e1, wanted to remove the president so the Lava Jato investigation could be choked by her successor.</p> <h2>Where does that leave interim president Michel Temer?</h2> <p>Rousseff\u2019s centre-right successor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/brazil-michel-temer-dilma-rousseff-impeachment\">almost as despised</a> as his predecessor after helping lead the campaign to bring down his running mate, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-michel-temer-cabinet\">naming an all-male, all-white cabinet</a> and losing three ministers to the Lava Jato scandal in his first month in office. At the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio, Temer was such an embarrassment that his speech was cut to 10 seconds but still drowned out by boos. He is surrounded by politicians implicated in the corruption scandal and \u2013 as leader of Brazil\u2019s biggest party \u2013 he too has benefited from dubiously acquired campaign financing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85d191aae67b0e2961e5af1db0ff4da1038dfe26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85d191aae67b0e2961e5af1db0ff4da1038dfe26/0_0_5472_3617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Temer\u2019s speech at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio was drowned out by booing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Temer\u2019s speech at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio was drowned out by booing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How has the public reacted?</h2> <p>Polls and street demonstration suggest voters are sick not just of the government, but almost all politicians. In March, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/brazil-anti-government-protests-dilma-rousseff-rio-de-janeiro\">3 million people joined rallies</a> against Rousseff\u2019s government. Since then hundreds of thousands have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/brazil-braces-clashes-dilma-rousseff-lula-corruption-protests-45-cities\">demonstrated</a> for or against impeachment. But none of the alternatives are popular. Temer\u2019s administration has ratings in the low teens. Lula\u2019s popularity is higher, but he is also hated by more people. The biggest beneficiary might eventually be former environment minister Marina Silva, a losing candidate in the last two presidential campaigns.</p> <h2>Where does Brazil go from here?</h2> <p>In a best-case scenario, the economy will pick up next year and Lava Jato will purge the nation\u2019s political canker, allowing Latin America\u2019s biggest nation to concentrate more effectively on social equality, sustainable development and regional integration.</p> <p>Alternatively, the old hierarchy will quietly shelve Lava Jato once Lula and Rousseff are out of the way and restore the conservative policies of the past; or even open the way \u2013 as in Italy after the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/from-clean-hands-to-carwash-brazil-probe-follows-italian-model\">Clean Hands investigation</a> \u2013 for a Silvio Berlusconi-like right-wing populist.</p>",

During the Republican primary, Trump appealed to the conservative base by calling for a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to remove all undocumented immigrants from the country.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">on a recent trip to Iowa, </a>Trump said the policy issue was driven by the media. \u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,\u201d he said at a fundraiser for Republican senator Joni Ernst.</p> <p>In front of a crowd in Everett on Tuesday evening, Trump made no mention of his upcoming diplomatic mission, focusing instead on campaign speech favorites, including a rambling story in rhyming couplets about an ungrateful and poisonous snake, intended as an allegory about Muslim refugees to the US. </p> <p>Also notably absent from the speech was perhaps Trump\u2019s most essential motif: the wall he proposes to build along the US-Mexico border.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s approval ratings among Latino voters are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/republicans-latino-voters-trump-nomination-effect\">historically bad</a>, and his relationship with Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government is even worse.

Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for Hillary for America, said: \u201cFrom the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as \u2018rapists\u2019 and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and US citizens. He has said we should force Mexico to pay for his giant border wall. He has said we should ban remittances to families in Mexico if Mexico doesn\u2019t pay up.</p> <p>\u201cWhat ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">Launching his presidential bid last year</a>, Trump claimed \u201cthe US has become a dumping ground for everyone else\u2019s problems\u201d, pointing the finger at Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re sending us not the right people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems and they\u2019re bringing their problems.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After a long, hot and sorry-looking summer it may look like the game is up for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions.

The recent reshuffle of Team Trump has only fuelled speculation: Roger Ailes, Fox News\u2019s disgraced former chairman, is now advising Trump while he fights off accusations of serial sexual harassment (charges Ailes vehemently denies). And earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Trump appointed Steve Bannon</a>, Goldman Sachs banker turned film-maker and former chairman of the self-identified \u201calt-right\u201d Breitbart News website, as his campaign CEO alongside veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager.</p> <p>The media certainly thinks it\u2019s spotted the upcoming twist. \u201cWhat if Trump and Breitbart could team up, raise some money from outside investors, and bring aboard some of the television executives who built Fox News?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-are-donald-trump-roger-ailes-and-steve-bannon-really-up-to\">asked the New Yorker</a> last week. Vanity Fair <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/donald-trump-tv-network\">recently</a> reported Trump is looking to \u201cmonetize\u201d his \u201caudience\u201d through a possible \u201cmini-media\u201d conglomerate. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/us/politics/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-paul-manafort.html?_r=1\">reported</a> this month that Trump and his son-in-law, New York Observer publisher Jared Kushner, have been mulling over a media holding. CNN\u2019s chief media watcher Brian Stelter recently reported: \u201cWhat he might wanna do is launch a new television channel, or launch a new giant website, a new subscription service, he might be thinking about a media enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s definitely working to cement his brand with an audience,\u201d said NPR media reporter David Folkenflik. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/21/roger-ailes-gabriel-sherman-fox-news-book-rightwing-media\">Roger Ailes biographer: 'The impact could be greater than phone hacking'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s certainly room out there for a Trump media brand. As Fox News expert and New York magazine writer Gabriel Sherman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/21/roger-ailes-gabriel-sherman-fox-news-book-rightwing-media\">told the Guardian</a> recently, the landscape is shifting in rightwing media thanks to Ailes\u2019s fall and Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cFox was this amazing unifier of all the strands of conservatism together \u2026 [Now] it\u2019s kind of a Lord of the Flies situation where everyone\u2019s trying to kill each other.\u201d<br></p> <p>As Trump\u2019s dysfunctional, bare-bones campaign continues to come up short in the polls, a media plan B makes sense. His alt-right base is too small to win an election, but big enough to make him some money afterward.  </p> <p>But this is a plan that has been tried before, and with less than impressive results. </p> <p>The most obvious forerunner was Sarah Palin, seen by many as Trump 1.0. Here was another rightwing \u201coutsider\u201d who, after the 2012 election, attempted to cash in on her stardom with the Sarah Palin Channel, a digital network run with the web-based TV company TAPP.<br></p> <p>Palin charged $10 per month to ride the straight-talk express, with sub-channels <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/sarah-palin-abandons-subscription-based-online-video-channel/\">including</a> New Life TV \u2013 \u201crecharge your relationships and grow closer to God\u201d \u2013 Live with Joan Lunden \u2013 \u201ca vibrant community for women\u2019s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors\u201d \u2013 and K-Love TV \u2013 \u201cChristian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values\u201d.</p> <p>The lineup failed to find an audience and by 2014 the Sarah Palin Channel was <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/07/stuck-in-the-lamestream-sarah-palin-tv-has-two-twitter-followers.html\">racking up</a> a mere 36,000 views a month, considerably less than many gardening blogs. The URL now leads to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sarahpac.com/#modal\">SarahPAC.com</a>,\u201d the home of her political action committee that raises money for conservative candidates.</p> <p>Not far behind Palin\u2019s debacle, and also produced by TAPP, was The Herman Cain Channel \u2013 launched by another Republican presidential wannabe who briefly rose to national prominence. \u201cCainTV\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2013/08/20/cain-tv-is-no-more/\">died</a> in 2013 but then came back as a low-grade news blog framed by ads plugging Cain\u2019s books and radio shows. \u201cCainTV delivers it all in an Informed, Inspirational, and INtertaining way,\u201d goes its slogan. It too has failed to evolve into the conglomerate the former pizza magnate had likely envisioned. </p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most ominously for Trump, there\u2019s the demise of conservative radio and TV star Glenn Beck\u2019s post-Fox News venture, The Blaze. If anyone was likely to pull off a digital media empire targeting the audience of (relatively) young, pissed-off, conspiratorial conservatives, it should have been Beck.</p> <p>The former Fox host wanted to engineer a fresh news channel from digital beginnings, a scrappy upstart with enough populist appeal to challenge the mighty Fox brand with none of the legacy costs of mainstream media. What he produced was significantly less than that, and it\u2019s been bleeding money and staff for years. The Blaze <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/28/40-layoffs-as-glenn-beck-s-blaze-empire-continues-its-decline-and-fall.html\">laid off</a> 40 employees in April, as traffic and advertising revenue continued to wither away.</p> <p>The legacy of new media ventures further to the left is equally awful: onetime Democratic presidential candidate and vice-president Al Gore\u2019s CurrentTV failed spectacularly, burning money to attract an audience it could neither find nor hold. It was taken over and rebranded by the deep pocketed Al Jazeera network in 2013, but after three very expensive years Al Jazeera America closed in April.</p> <p>Trump would certainly argue he could do better. But building a media empire isn\u2019t as easy as burning down a political campaign. It requires serious money and a long-term strategy. These are not major turn-ons for the man who <a href=\"http://gawker.com/a-complete-list-of-donald-trump-s-business-disasters-1764151188\">brought</a> you 12-months of Trump Steaks and less than a year of Trump-brand water.</p> <p>\u201cYou gotta remember that Trump doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money on this,\u201d said Folkenflik. \u201cIt costs a ton of money. Murdoch had to pay cable providers to put Fox on.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Trump does commit to a more upscale venture, who would have the vision to run it? Ailes seems like an obvious choice until one considers that he\u2019s a 76-year-old in legal trouble and visibly poor health; and he wouldn\u2019t be able to start until his noncompete agreement with Fox News expires at the end of 2018. Still, even pushing 80, it\u2019s hard to imagine him mellowing with age. He has scores to settle with James and Lachlan Murdoch, sons of his former mentor and partner Rupert, who were always looking to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?ion=1&amp;espv=2#q=lachlan%20murdoch%20ailes\">knock</a> him off his throne.</p> <p>\u201cI think Ailes would love a chance to once more stick it in the eye of the establishment and the Murdoch sons,\u201d Folkenflik said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s not just that he\u2019s not a young man anymore, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not in good shape. He\u2019s not gonna be the guy in charge.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Bannon, like so many other Trump campaign officials, is in the midst of public and embarrassing scandals, dealing with allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">that he violated Florida\u2019s voting laws</a> and reports of domestic abuse.</p> <p>Still, those charges may not matter to Trump, who is already happily defending and working with Ailes despite his issues. And they certainly don\u2019t matter to Trump\u2019s base, who tend to dismiss charges against Trump and his campaign as \u201cPC\u201d thuggery and liberal media bias.</p> <p>The final decision lies with Trump; he may jump at the chance to make a TV channel in his image, or he may just license his brand and let someone like Bannon or an Ailes-led brains trust take the reins. Trump loyalists like Fox News star Sean Hannity \u2013 who makes enough money from his radio career to leave his perch at Fox News \u2013 could possibly sign up to join a new splinter cell. Or maybe Trump will simply complete the marriage between his campaign and Breitbart News and put some money into an alt-right shop that\u2019s already <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/trump-loving-breitbart-news-having-great-election-year-despite-massive-meltdown-2345760\">doing well</a>.</p> <p>If the Trumps don\u2019t make it to the White House, the family patriarch may indeed start a new \u201cmedia conglomerate\u201d. But business history, not least Trump\u2019s own business history, suggests a low-risk, low-grade propaganda house rather than a sprawling new cable empire. As his buddy Ailes has no doubt warned him, talk is cheap \u2013 but news is expensive. </p>",
  "<p>John Howard has pointed to the lessons of Donald Trump\u2019s rise in the US to argue that buttressing the middle class is fundamental to enduring success in politics and preserving the stability and harmony of societies.<br></p> <p>In an interview before of the broadcast of a new series he has produced with the ABC about Robert Menzies, Howard told Guardian Australia it was during the Menzies period that the \u201cgreat Australian middle class\u201d emerged, and preserving a robust middle class was the \u201ccement\u201d holding societies together.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the greatest strength that Australia has \u2013 we have more, proportionately, in the middle,\u201d Howard said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is one of America\u2019s problems and one of the explanations of the Trump phenomenon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/28/john-howard-says-he-trembles-at-thought-of-donald-trump-becoming-us-president\">John Howard says he 'trembles' at thought of Donald Trump becoming US president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think there is truth in the argument that [Trump] is appealing to people who have suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir incomes have fallen, many of them have lost their jobs, the statistics tell a vivid story \u2013 people are just worse off now, in the middle.\u201d</p> <p>The former prime minister declined to be drawn on contemporary politics, replying \u201cnext question\u201d when asked what Malcolm Turnbull could learn from the person who founded the modern Liberal party.</p> <p>But he made general observations when asked about the lessons contemporary politics could draw from the Menzies prime ministership.</p> <p>Howard noted the bedrock of Menzies\u2019 success, and his own, was an ongoing dialogue with the middle class. \u201cVery much so. It, more than anything else, holds the country together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt reinforces the notion of fairness and egalitarianism. It stands to reason that if you have a large middle class then the nation is more cohesive and people aren\u2019t conscious of gaps.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have people who need to be looked after, we have people who are poor and people who are in need of government assistance and we have some people who are very well off.</p> <p>\u201cMy philosophy is I don\u2019t mind people having a lot of money provided they get it honestly and they pay their tax. I have absolutely no objection. I believe in capitalism.</p> <p>\u201cBut the issue is the great bulk of the people in the middle. The stronger and larger the middle class is, the more stable the country is. History is on the side of that argument. You only have to examine the history of Europe in Australia to understand that.</p> <p>\u201c[Buttressing the middle class] has been very much part of the national cement and it\u2019s very important to keep it. You keep it through a range of policy approaches on a whole raft of policy issues, and obviously fundamental is a stable economy.</p> <p>\u201cA stable economy is produced by a range of policies according to the circumstances of the day, but I don\u2019t want to get into that. It\u2019s not the purpose of the interview.\u201d</p> <p>Howard also nominated consistency and strong cabinet processes as lessons that could be drawn in the modern political era from the success of Menzies, who was prime minister for more than 18 years. He said successful prime ministers understood Australian politics was \u201ca combination of the desirable and the achievable. You are successful if you can achieve the optimum blend of those two things.\u201d</p> <p>Howard said leaders needed ideology and pragmatism. \u201cYou need both. You\u2019ve got to believe in things, and one of his great strengths was he did believe in things and people were in no doubt as to where he stood or where he would jump on issues, but he was also a pragmatist with great political skills.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that Menzies had not been a presidential figure but an \u201corthodox cabinet prime minister\u201d who was very attentive to the views of his backbench. He also understood the \u201ccardinal importance\u201d of a united Coalition.</p> <p>\u201cThat is something that has always been a key element of our success. He understood it, Fraser understood it, I understood it and of course Abbott and Turnbull have practised that as well.\u201d</p> <p>In the series that airs on the ABC on 18 and 25 September, Howard interviews the former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke about the Menzies period. \u201cThe Labor left critique of Menzies is they were wasted years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/america-problems-obama-fault-george-w-bush-election-2016\">America's problems aren't Obama's fault. They're George W Bush's | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Howard said both his book on Menzies, and the television series, were an effort to refute that suggestion. He addresses the major events of the Menzies period and backs the decision to commit Australia to the Vietnam war.</p> <p>Halting the advance of communism through east Asia was an aspiration he would have \u201cprobably\u201d subscribed to in the 1960s, he said. He reasoned you can only ever answer whether a decision was right or wrong by \u201cputting yourself in the shoes of the decision maker at the time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cObviously decisions are taken and then subsequent events might cast a different light on the decision,\u201d Howard said on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I say in the program is if I had been in Menzies\u2019 shoes in the 1960s I would have taken the same decision as he did. And why? He quite rightly judged that involvement in Vietnam was important in relation to the alliance with the US and the maintenance of American interest in our part of the world then.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1960s that was seen as an even higher priority than it is now.

  "<p>Australians must beware of thinking that house prices will never fall because values have risen so consistently over the years, a leading global economist has warned.</p> <p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/20/fewer-than-half-of-all-australians-could-be-homeowners-by-2017-report-finds\">Australian housing market </a>was not yet in bubble territory, Paul Sheard, chief economist at the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, said on Wednesday that the country had to guard against believing that prices would continue to rise.</p> <p>Sheard, an Australian-born economist who is an expert in the asset price bubble seen by Japan in the late 1980s, told the annual AB+F Breakfast with the Economists event in Sydney: \u201cI don\u2019t get the impression that we have a housing bubble here yet ... but I would say that Australia must be beware of the narrative that because prices have never fallen they can never fall again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/josh-altman-real-estate-sydney-property-overpriced\">'Sexy but overpriced': Kim Kardashian\u2019s real-estate agent snubs Sydney property market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Referring to the 34% fall in house prices in the US after the global financial crisis, Sheard added: \u201cIt can happen and when it does it is difficult to reverse.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Australian-based economists on the panel were optimistic about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/21/australian-capital-city-home-prices-fall-for-first-time-since-third-quarter-2012\">house prices</a> because of \u201cstrong fundamentals\u201d such as low interest rates, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/unemployment-at-three-year-low-but-full-time-jobs-decline\">low unemployment</a> and sufficient population growth to support demand. </p> <p>To cause a housing crash \u201chistory tells us that unemployment has to rise substantially or rates increase substantially\u201d, said Su-Lin Ong, the managing director and chief Australian economist at RBC Capital Markets. Neither of those events were likely to happen, she said.</p> <p>Overall the economy was performing well, the panel said, despite noting that consumer and business concern about the possibility of recession \u2013 so-called \u201cdread risk\u201d \u2013 was high and flew in the face of reasons to be positive about growth.</p> <p>Shane Oliver, the chief economist at AMP, said people who had been predicting that Australia would suffer an \u201cinevitable recession\u201d after the mining boom had been proved wrong and were now trying to say the same thing about a housing crash.</p> <p>But he said that the Australian economy had been surprisingly resilient and flexible. The post-mining boom drag was bottoming out and sectors such as education and tourism were benefiting from the lower dollar. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019ll have a recession,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Westpac\u2019s chief economist, Bill Evans, agreed, saying that different regions were seeing different rates of growth but \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be too negative\u201d. He noted that while the $200bn liquid natural gas development boom was tailing off, it was being offset by $90bn of state infrastructure spending. </p> <p>Ong said the weakness in wage growth was a problem for Australia and meant that the headline growth in GDP of 3.1% was \u201cmisleading\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIncome weakness is a soft underbelly in the economy and is why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/rate-cut-on-cards-as-reserve-bank-highlights-australias-part-time-problem\">RBA had to cut rates</a>,\u201d she said. \u201cThe income story is exceptionally weak but the odds of a recession are low.\u201d<br></p> <p>The panel were broadly agreed, however, on the need for more constructive policy making by the federal government.</p> <p>Sheard, who is based in the US, noted that the Coalition\u2019s ability to drive through reforms and \u201cbudget repair\u201d were increasingly reminiscent of the political gridlock in Washington DC, which meant it would be difficult for presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton to make policy changes stick if she won in November.</p> <p>Governments had failed to invest in infrastructure projects during the mining boom because the benefits took longer to see and were therefore less attractive for politicians to pursue, Evans said. </p> <p>He said the federal government had to try to reduce \u201cbad debt\u201d related to recurrent expenditure but also needed to increase \u201cgood debt\u201d to fund capital spending. </p>",
  "<p>Chinese dissidents have urged Barack Obama to confront Xi Jinping over what they called China\u2019s worst human rights crisis since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown when he travels to the G20 economic summit in Hangzhou this week.<br></p> <p>During a meeting at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, prominent Chinese activists told Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, that China\u2019s president had presided over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/25/zhao-wei-mothers-search-for-daughter-caught-china-human-rights\">a dramatic offensive against opponents of the Communist party</a> since taking power in late 2012. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/china-hangzhou-propaganda-facelift-g20-summit\">'Paradise on earth': China's Hangzhou gets propaganda facelift for G20 summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Teng Biao, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/academics-china-crackdown-forces-intellectuals-abroad\">an exiled human rights lawyer</a> who was among those invited to address Rice, told the Guardian he had called on the US president to publicly speak out on what is likely to be his final presidential visit to Asia. </p> <p>\u201cChina is experiencing its worst human rights crackdown since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/01/tiananmen-square-25-years-every-person-victim-massacre\">the Tiananmen massacre</a> in 1989,\u201d Teng said. </p> <p>\u201cEspecially since Xi Jinping came to power, many human rights lawyers and activists were detained and disappeared; many, many NGOs were shut down; and other civil society organisations, universities, media, internet, Christian churches and other religious groups were also targeted. It is obvious that the Chinese government has violated human rights and the current situation is very, very worrying,\u201d he added. </p> <p>World leaders will fly into Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province in eastern China, later this week ahead of the two-day summit which kicks off on Sunday. </p> <p>Obama and Xi are scheduled to meet for the first time on Saturday for what the White House this week called \u201can extensive bilateral meeting\u201d. </p> <p>Officials said the pair would then share a \u201csmall dinner\u201d on Saturday night. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/29/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-deputy-nsa-strategic\">Speaking on Monday</a>, Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said the US president would use his time with Xi to review \u201call of the issues that have been front and centre in the US-China relationship for the last seven and a half years\u201d including flash-points such as the South China Sea, cyber espionage and \u201cour longstanding differences on human rights\u201d. </p> <p>Teng, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/academics-china-crackdown-forces-intellectuals-abroad\">who fled China in September 2014</a> and lives in exile in New Jersey with his family, said White House officials had summoned a small group of activists \u201cto talk about the G20 summit and what President Obama should do when he is in Hangzhou\u201d. </p> <p>Also invited to the meeting were <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-lu-jun-one-of-chinas-most-wanted-social-activists-1441521914\">Lu Jun</a>, a civil society activist who was forced to leave China after security forces targeted his organisation; the Tibetan activist Golog Jigme; the executive director of the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, Alim Seytoff; and Bob Fu, a prominent Christian activist. </p> <p>Zhang Qing, wife of the democracy activist Guo Feixong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/china-democracy-activist-enters-second-week-of-hunger-strike\">who has been on hunger strike in a prison in southern China</a>, is also understood to have been present. </p> <p>Speaking after the meeting, which lasted about 80 minutes, Teng said he had told Rice he hoped Obama would publicly call for the release of a series of \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and activists. They included the jailed Uighur scholar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/salman-rushdie-condemn-china-jailing-ilhan-tohti-paul-auster\">Ilham Tohti</a> and Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/25/china-jails-liu-xiaobo\">Liu Xiaobo</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/childs-heartbreak-li-heping-human-rights-lawyer-china-superhero\">Li Heping</a> and Wang Quanzhang, two civil rights lawyers caught up in a Communist party crackdown on their trade.</p> <p>Teng also urged Obama to highlight the plight of dissidents being held in prisons in Hangzhou, the G20\u2019s host city, and to draw attention to local political activists who have been placed under house arrest to prevent them speaking out ahead of the summit. </p> <p>Rice had not indicated to her guests how Obama planned to handle human rights issues during his visit to China, Teng added. <br></p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about what they are going to do but we did give her a clear message. We know it will be President Obama\u2019s last trip to China and Asia as American president and we hope that the American government can really give a message to China and to the world that human rights are part of American policy.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if she was hopeful that the US might publicly denounce Xi\u2019s crackdown, Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cI don\u2019t see a good reason what they can\u2019t \u2026 It\u2019s a question of whether they really believe that this is an important issue and are wiling to put it out in a very frank and public way while standing in China.\u201d </p> <p>Richardson said Obama \u2013 who received the 2009 Nobel peace prize for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-barack-obama\">\u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples\u201d</a> \u2013 had a particular duty to demand the release of Liu Xiaobo, China\u2019s best-known dissident. Liu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo\">was awarded the same prize a year later</a> after being jailed for 11 years for subversion as a result of his calls for political reform. <br></p> <p>\u201cI do think that it would be unconscionable for the 2009 Nobel peace prize winner to fail to publicly call for the release of the 2010 Nobel peace prize winner. Unconscionable,\u201d Richardson said. <br></p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s done it from Washington. He\u2019s done it from New York. They\u2019ve done it in statements. He needs to stand up in public in China and say that. If Obama is really standing with civil society that\u2019s what he must do. If he is genuinely concerned about the fate of independent organisations and lawyers he cannot do less.\u201d</p> <p>Political opponents also urged Obama to confront Xi over human rights abuses, although an anticipated joint announcement that the US and China <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2008593/landmark-step-china-and-us-ratify-paris-climate-deal\">will ratify the Paris climate agreement</a> makes it unlikely he will be overly critical of his hosts. </p> <p>In a statement, the Republican senator Marco Rubio said: \u201cI am glad the Obama administration is meeting with men and women who can speak authoritatively about the Chinese government\u2019s gross human rights abuses, but I urge the president to meet with these freedom fighters himself and then press President Xi directly at the G20 summit regarding his government\u2019s failure to uphold the rule of law and its violations of the Chinese people\u2019s basic human rights.\u201d </p> <p>Chris Smith, a Republican congressman who chairs the congressional-executive commission on China, said: \u201c[Obama] should consider doing something radically different on his last trip to China, something that will give hope to China\u2019s dissidents and freedom advocates. Mildly raising human rights issues is important, but not enough anymore.\u201d </p>",
