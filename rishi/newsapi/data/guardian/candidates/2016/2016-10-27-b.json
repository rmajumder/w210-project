  "<p>A jury has found that brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy were not guilty of conspiring against the government, a surprising end to the high-profile Oregon standoff trial that sparked national debates about public lands and the rights of ranchers in the American west. </p> <p>The decision, unveiled in federal court in Portland on Thursday, is a blow to the US government, which had aggressively prosecuted the rightwing activists who led an armed takeover of public property to protest American land-use regulations.</p> <p>The Bundy brothers, who orchestrated a 2 January takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge, were acquitted on a number of serious charges, along with five other defendants. Only a day earlier the court dismissed a juror over fears of bias, raising concerns that the trial would drag on for weeks.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are just so excited,\u201d Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, told the Guardian after the verdict was announced. \u201cWe\u2019ve been praying hard, and we knew they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, federal officials said they accepted the decision. \u201cAlthough we are extremely disappointed in the verdict, we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system,\u201d said Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">Rebel cowboys: how the Bundy family sparked a new battle for the American west</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Bundy family\u2019s public fight with the government began in 2014 when the patriarch Cliven, now 70, led an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/nevada-armed-militia-cliven-bundy-victory-federal-government\">armed standoff</a> with hundreds of supporters against law enforcement officials at his desert ranch in Nevada, over his refusal <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/cliven-bundy-standoff-grazing-rights-nevada-ranch\">to pay grazing taxes</a>.

  "<p>Scarred by the 2015 general election and humbled by the Brexit vote, it\u2019s hardly surprising that many in the British political and media class continue to hedge their bets on the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential election</a>, even as the climax of the contest draws near. The instinct for caution is understandable. These have been chastening times in British politics. No one wants to make three wrong calls in a row.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/trump-clinton-news-vote-election-2016\">Michelle Obama campaigns with Clinton as Trump hits Ohio \u2013 election live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the case of the US election, however, there is also an uneasy self-awareness of something close to groupthink. Unlike the UK general election or the EU referendum, where divisions within the political and media class were real and deep, there is something close to unanimity about British antipathy to Donald Trump. You have to be intensely anti-American or anti-Clinton \u2013 which some are \u2013 to positively wish a Trump victory on America and the world.</p> <p>This helps to explain, though not to excuse, the reluctance to face the overwhelming probability about the US presidential contest. That probability is that Hillary Clinton, with all her strengths and weaknesses, is going to win on 8&#xa0;November, and is quite possibly going to win by a very large margin. Unless something quite exceptional and so far wholly undetected is happening \u2013 the instinct for bet-hedging, you see, is hard to shake off even here \u2013 Clinton will be taking over the White House in January.</p> <p>The clearest and most immediate evidence is in the opinion polls, which consistently show Clinton ahead in the popular vote. That process has been strengthened by the televised debates and, in particular by the final debate, which Clinton clearly won, and in which Trump\u2019s hostility to women seems to have had a lasting mobilisation impact.</p> <p>That generally strong Clinton lead is also buttressed by local polling in the states where victory is essential under America\u2019s electoral college system. With&#xa0;occasional exceptions, these polls show Clinton on course for a large electoral college win. Dismiss the polls if you like. But the fact that Trump and his running mate Mike Pence are spending time campaigning in states such as North Carolina and Utah shows that they are having to defend their own territories rather than attack in Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>All this may change, of course. It\u2019s&#xa0;the&#xa0;safest prediction in the book to say that the contest will narrow in the final days. But the general likelihood is surely&#xa0;that it will not narrow much. By this stage in 2012, only 9% of voters had not made up their minds. It seems unlikely that the proportion would be much different in such a bitterly contested election as this one has been. The big unpredictability this time is voter turnout. If Trump brings lots of new voters to the polls, and at the same time&#xa0;Clinton fails to bring significant parts of the Obama coalition to them, then an upset \u2013 which at this stage would be a much tighter Clinton win, not a Trump win \u2013 might just happen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58aff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822379\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump's final face-off \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58086051e4b055209adaf6c9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump\u2019s final face-off \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even in an election as bitter as this one, the claim that lots of states are \u201cup for grabs\u201d is less true than ever. Since 1992, 31 of America\u2019s 50 states have voted consistently in every presidential contest. In most modern US elections, people who consider themselves Democrats vote Democratic, while an equally large proportion of people who consider themselves Republicans vote Republican. A lot is always written at this stage in the campaign about the importance of self-described independents, but these voters tend to lean either Democratic or Republican, and to vote the way they lean too. One estimate puts the proportion of pure independents at only 5%. The veteran poll analyst Charlie Cook says that most voters are already \u201cbaked into the cake\u201d.</p> <p>Part of that is simply because of long-established demographic changes that advantage the Democrats. When Bill Clinton won in 1992, white voters cast 87% of the total vote. By the time of Barack Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, just 20 years later, the white share had fallen to 72%. One prediction says it will be 70% in November. If each demographic group votes the same way in 2016 as in 2012, the Democratic lead will rise by about 1.5%. Trump has done nothing to combat this and plenty to feed it. In light of Trump\u2019s attacks on women during the campaign, it seems likely that an even higher proportion of white women voters will move into the Democratic column too.</p> <p>All this appears to be entirely consistent with the much discussed recent book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\" title=\"\">Democracy for Realists</a> by the American political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels. They argue that elections are not determined by voters\u2019 policy preferences or ideologies, as many of us like to think, but \u201con the basis of who they are \u2013 their social identities\u201d. Certainly the Achen-Bartels thesis chimes with the Brexit vote in Britain. In America, though, where race and ethnicity are such important components of social identities, but not the only ones, Trump\u2019s consistent attempt to appeal to white male voters and alienate minority and female voters does not look like a winning strategy at all; indeed quite the reverse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">The view from Middletown: 'Trump speaks to us in a way other people don\u2019t'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The immediate question, 12 days from the election, is less whether Clinton will win the presidency. It is more whether she can manage to persuade enough voters to elect a Congress that can work with her, not against her, as has been Obama\u2019s fate for the past six years. The Democrats stand a good chance of winning the four seats necessary \u2013 Illinois, Wisconsin and two from seven other toss-up states \u2013 to regain control of the Senate (where 34 of the 100 seats are up for election). However, control of the House of Representatives (where all 435 members are contested but incumbency is frequently decisive) seems likely to remain in Republican hands. All this suggests that Clinton will not have an easy presidency, even in the first two years, unless Republicans allow that to happen. Since Republicans expect to make gains in the 2018 midterms, they have little incentive to do that.</p> <p>The Republican pollster Frank Luntz&#xa0;\u2013 whom Trump described on Twitter as \u201ca total clown \u2026 a low-class slob\u201d \u2013 said that if the campaign this autumn were about Trump, then Clinton would win; if it were&#xa0;about Clinton, then Trump could pull it off. Overwhelmingly, the campaign has proved to be about Trump. But that\u2019s now about to change.</p> <p>Increasingly, Donald Trump looks like&#xa0;a more incidental figure, preoccupied with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\" title=\"\">hotels</a> and his media ambitions. The big question in American politics is not whether Hillary Clinton will be president. It is what kind&#xa0;of president she is likely to be.</p>",

Honey G, as she keeps telling us, is the real deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to know what to make of all this. The X Factor always has a novelty act \u2013 just like it always has a plain-faced Scottish boy, a girl who cries ugly when she goes through each week, a boyband that keeps River Island in business through bomber jacket expenses alone, and an exceptionally talented vocalist who, sadly, is over 25, so can\u2019t win. But G has quietly become something More. She has appeared <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p049vrn8?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campai gn+=\">on Charlie Sloth\u2019s Radio 1Xtra show</a>, edging along a line of irony that is becoming ever more impossible to judge. She has quickly won over the vital <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/x-factors-honey-g-sparks-9012398\">\u201cmums and nans\u201d</a> X Factor audience. She has held effortlessly on as three actual vocalists toppled and fell. And she has done it all while wearing a novelty pair of perma-shades, so nobody <em>really</em> knows what she looks like.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t Wagner, and it\u2019s not even Jedward: this is something else entirely. And it\u2019s getting hard to know what is real any more: where does Honey G end and <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/annagilford\">Anna Gilford</a> begin? Does she even know?</p> <p>The only dull shadow over the moon of Honey G is the fact that nobody can quite decide if she is awful or not, or if the act is racist. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/honey-g-x-factor-blackface-novelty-rapper-post-brexit-uk\">nuanced essay</a> for the Guardian, Lola Okolosie argued that G\u2019s reductive caricature of rap culture is akin to modern blackface (we must again go to 50 Cent for the dissenting voice: \u201cA middle-aged white woman rapping along to Dre and Tupac ain\u2019t even close to being racist.\u201d) Whispers abound that Honey G, a contestant who is surely fake and entered as a joke, might not be as \u201creal\u201d as she is making out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/honey-g-x-factor-blackface-novelty-rapper-post-brexit-uk\">Honey G\u2019s X Factor act isn\u2019t funny. It\u2019s modern-day blackface | Lola Okolosie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Week three of the competition, and the whole exercise feels an awful lot like a prank that has got out of hand, but everyone is committed to it, so they just have to brave through to the bitter end of it.</p> <p>There is another notable public figure who has embarked on a high-stakes competition \u2013 possibly as a joke, but at least as an ego boost \u2013 doing the rounds. Someone who, no matter how much you stare at them, you can\u2019t quite pin what they look like: what is their natural state, without the tan, without the hair combing? There is another person who, we can comfortably say, \u201ckeeps offending minorities while hamfistedly trying to reach out to minorities\u201d. There is another person who has won over just the right numbers of a voting public to keep afloat in a race they are in no way qualified to be running in.</p> <p>Do you see where I am going with this? Honey G, X Factor novelty and the bizarre cultural touchstone we never knew we needed to bring 2016 to a close, is the British Donald Trump. That is the fact we all have to deal with now. And we can map out how G is going to fare in the competition based on how Trump does in the election:</p> <p>Option 1: Trump loses, gives some sort of disgraceful losing speech, yells so much his body turns around on the spot, gets into a helicopter and furiously shoots into the sky while unfurling a banner reading \u201cHILLARY CROOKEDTON\u201d and is last seen sprinting naked around his own golf course in Scotland. This is the option we can reasonably hope for, and see it easily mapped on to Honey G\u2019s X Factor career: she will get cleanly voted out with about six weeks to go, yell \u201cWEEZY\u201d slightly too close to a microphone so much that Dermot O\u2019Leary has to apologise for any viewers offended at home, then fade away into nothing again, recruiting anonymously against the dying of the sun.</p> <p>Option 2: Trump wins, flipping two majestic birds into the air as sparklers erupt around him, gets into a helicopter and furiously shoots into the sky while unfurling a banner reading \u201cHILLARY CROOKEDTON\u201d, gives every presidential press conference from the Apprentice US boardroom, and somehow drives America into the sea. And this is the one we have to fear, for how it will translate to Honey G \u2013 she walks stiff-legged to the X Factor win, her Gilford ego and G id fusing in one perfect moment of victory, and, long story short, this ends with Honey G having her hands on the nuclear code and doing a \u201cWhen I say \u2018bomb\u2019, you say \u2018Russia\u2019\u201d call-and-response to a rapt studio audience. This is the bad path.</p> <p>Trump and G are inextricably linked, now, because they are the same person spread across two mortal vessels. We must work together on this one. None of us can allow Option 2 to happen.</p>",

So what\u2019s her problem with good old American democracy in 2016?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/01/how-algorithms-rule-our-working-lives\">How algorithms rule our working lives | Cathy O\u2019Neil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDemocracy is more than a two-party system. It\u2019s an informed public and that\u2019s what\u2019s at risk,\u201d she says. \u201cThe debates are where you would hope to find out real information, but they\u2019re just talking about their dick size \u2026 The algorithms are making it harder and harder to get good information.\u201d And algorithms, rule-based processes for solving mathematical problems, are being applied to more and more areas of our lives.<br></p> <p>This idea is at the heart of O\u2019Neil\u2019s thinking on why algorithms can be so harmful. In theory, mathematics is neutral \u2013 two plus two equals four regardless of what anyone wishes the answer was. But in practice, mathematical algorithms can be formulated and tweaked based on powerful interests.</p> <p>O\u2019Neil saw those interests first hand when she was a quantitative analyst on Wall Street. Starting in 2007, O\u2019Neil spent four years in finance, two of them working for a hedge fund. There she saw the use of weapons of math destruction, a term O\u2019Neil uses to describe \u201calgorithms that are important, secret and destructive\u201d. The algorithms that ultimately caused the financial crisis meet all of those criteria \u2013 they affected large numbers of people, were entirely opaque and destroyed lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I left disgusted by finance because I thought of it as a rigged system and it was rigged for the insiders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI left disgusted by finance because I thought of it as a rigged system and it was rigged for the insiders,\u201d says O\u2019Neil. \u201cI was ashamed by that \u2013 as a mathematician I love math and I think math is a tool for good.\u201d</p> <p>Among the many examples of powerful formulas that O\u2019Neil cites in her book, political polling doesn\u2019t come up, even though this election cycle has made polling\u2019s power more talked about than ever before. So is it dangerous? Could polling be a weapon of math destruction?<br></p> <p>She pauses \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d \u2013 then she pauses some more. \u201cI think polling <em>is</em> a weapon of math destruction,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody really understands it, it\u2019s incredibly widespread and powerful.\u201d We discuss the success of Nate Silver, the founder and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight (a site I spent almost two years working at). Silver has positioned himself as one of the few people who does understand polling, and as such he\u2019s been christened as a <a href=\"http://www.wweek.com/news/2016/06/29/hillary-clinton-chance-of-beating-donald-trump-in-oregon/\">soothsayer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/donald-trump-iowa-nate-silver\">savant</a>. We\u2019re desperate for math answers, which is part of the reason we ended up here, according to O\u2019Neil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/truth.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/truth.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of skepticism,\u201d she says. \u201cThe algorithms are like shiny new toys that we can\u2019t resist using. We trust them so much that we project meaning on to them.\u201d</p> <p>That desperation is potentially very damaging to democracy. Increasingly the public is informed about polling data, not policy information, when deciding who to elect. \u201cIt\u2019s self-referential,\u201d O\u2019Neil explains.</p> <p>Like so many algorithms, political polls have a feedback loop \u2013 the more we hear a certain candidate is ahead in the polls, the more we recognize their name and the more we see them as electorally viable.</p> <p>O\u2019Neil\u2019s book explains how other mathematical models do a similar thing \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://epic.org/algorithmic-transparency/crim-justice/\">the ones</a> used to measure the likelihood an individual will relapse into criminal behavior. When someone is classed as \u201chigh risk\u201d, they\u2019re more likely to get a longer sentence and find it harder to find a job when they eventually do get out. That person is then more likely to commit another crime, and so the model looks like it got it right.<br></p> <p>And then there are those biases. Contrary to popular opinion that algorithms are purely objective, O\u2019Neil explains in her book that \u201cmodels are opinions embedded in mathematics\u201d. Think Trump is a hopeless candidate? That will affect your calculations. Think black American men are all criminal thugs? That affects the models being used in the criminal justice system, too.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/algorithm-racist-human-employers-work\">Is an algorithm any less racist than a human?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately algorithms, according to O\u2019Neil, reinforce discrimination and widen inequality, \u201cusing people\u2019s fear and trust of mathematics to prevent them from asking questions\u201d. The seemingly contradictory words \u201cfear\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d leap out to me: how many other things do we both fear and trust, except perhaps for fate or God? O\u2019Neil agrees. \u201cI think it has a few hallmarks of worship \u2013 we turn off parts of our brain, we somehow feel like it\u2019s not our duty, not our right to question this.\u201d</p> <p>But sometimes it\u2019s hard for non-statisticians to know which questions to ask. O\u2019Neil\u2019s advice is to be persistent. \u201cPeople should feel more entitled to push back and ask for evidence, but they seem to fold a little too quickly when they\u2019re told that it\u2019s complicated,\u201d she says. If someone feels that they some formula has affected their lives, \u201cat the very least they should be asking, how do you know that this is legal? That it isn\u2019t discriminatory?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But often we don\u2019t even know where to look for those important algorithms, because by definition the most dangerous ones are also the most secretive. That\u2019s why the catalogue of case studies in O\u2019Neil\u2019s book are so important; she\u2019s telling us where to look.</p> <p><em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy is out now and published by Crown</em></p> <ul> <li><em>No billionaire owner, no shareholders.

He also denied that Donald Trump was the Kremlin\u2019s favoured candidate, though he praised the tycoon\u2019s controversial campaign.</p> <p>In a speech to an annual gathering of Russian and foreign politicians and analysts in Sochi on Thursday, Putin attacked the US over its foreign policy in recent years. \u201cDoes anyone seriously think that Russia can affect the choice of the American people?

It\u2019s just a form of manipulating public opinion,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, Russian state media has made no secret of its preference for Trump, and has suggested the election may be rigged in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favour.<br></p> <p>Putin also praised Trump\u2019s style and campaign: \u201cHe chose his own way of reaching voters\u2019 hearts. Of course he\u2019s behaving extravagantly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily without reason. I think he is representing the interests of that part of the American electorate, and it\u2019s a significant part, that is tired of the same elite who have been in power for decades. He is representing the interests of ordinary people.\u201d </p> <p>At the same time, he claimed there was little difference between Trump and Clinton: \u201cIf you look at the programmes of the different candidates, you get the feeling that they are all tailored in the same way, and that the differences between them are insignificant, and in reality there are no differences.\u201d</p> <p>Putin said the US had a number of problems, including huge debt and gun crime, and that politicians had no answers. \u201cThere is nothing to calm society with, and so it\u2019s easier to distract people with supposed Russian hackers, spies and agents of interest.\u201d<br></p>",

Earlier this month, Moscow said it was stationing nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, Russia\u2019s Baltic exclave. This week, two Russian warships armed with cruise missiles slipped into the Baltic sea.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the hulking Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/21/russian-warships-pass-through-channel-watched-by-royal-navy\">belching its way through the Channel</a> en route to Syria. Spain said Moscow had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/spain-reviews-plan-to-let-russian-warships-refuel-en-route-to-syria\">withdrawn a request to refuel on Spain\u2019s north African coast</a>, amid western suspicions the Russian fleet will be used to flatten civilians in Aleppo.</p> <p>Nato\u2019s apparent goal here is to deter future acts of aggression on European territory by Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist Russia. After a period in which Nato has seemed slow to react, and lacking in backbone, the alliance is now sending out a robust message. As the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, put it this week, these deployments are all about deterrence.</p> <p>In particular, Nato wants to signal to Moscow that it is prepared to defend the embattled Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In May, Britain will send an 800-strong battalion to Estonia, supported by the French and Danes. By next summer, about 4,000 troops from Nato countries will face off against 330,000 Russian soldiers stationed on Moscow\u2019s western border. </p> <p>None of this means Europe is on the brink of an imminent east-west conflict. Or - as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/could-hillary-start-a-world-war-sure-as-hell-she-could-and-here-s-how-a7379051.html\">some commentators have suggested apocalyptically</a> - that the world is gearing up for a third world war. It isn\u2019t. Speaking at a conference in Sochi on Thursday, Putin agreed. He told a group of western experts that it was \u201cstupid and unrealistic\u201d to think Russia might attack anyone in Europe. </p> <p>Despite the cold war atmospherics, then, there\u2019s little prospect of Russian tanks rolling across the border into the Baltic states anytime soon.<br></p> <p>Rather, Russia\u2019s latest sabre-rattling is part of a hybrid Kremlin strategy. Abroad, the goal is to project Russian military power and strength \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/10/russia\">\u201cwilly-waving\u201d in the words of one analyst</a>. Since Putin became president in 2000, he has been determined to restore Moscow\u2019s superpower status, with Russia as a global co-equal of US \u201chegemony\u201d.</p> <p>Putin wants to show that no international problem can be solved without the Kremlin\u2019s views being taken into account. That goes for the Middle East and Syria \u2013 where Russia has staged its first large-scale military action outside the borders of the former Soviet Union since communism. </p> <p>And it goes for Ukraine, the neighbour Putin covertly invaded in 2014, and whose territory Crimea he annexed. Far from not attacking anyone in Europe, about 10,000 people have perished in eastern Ukraine in a war that the Kremlin kicked off and sustained.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s armed forces play a key role, but television is important, too. At home, Russian state channels have recently floated the prospect of nuclear war with Washington. (Russia\u2019s military is inferior to that of the US, but in nuclear weapons it has parity.) Many Russians now dangerously believe their country is already in a state of almost-war, or pre-war, with the west.</p> <p>This war rhetoric, of course, is designed to deflect attention from Russia\u2019s domestic woes, which are numerous. They include a worsening economy, western sanctions, recent rigging in Russia\u2019s parliamentary election and massive state corruption, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore\">led from the top by Putin and his billionaire cronies</a>. At home, the propaganda has broadly worked. </p> <p>Russia\u2019s president sees Nato is an implacably hostile and aggressive bloc. Paradoxically, Nato\u2019s newest deployments in eastern Europe merely serve to confirm the story that Putin and state television have been telling Russians for so long: that the west is hell-bent on \u201cencircling\u201d Russia and bringing it to its knees.</p> <p>The danger now is not from an open military conflict. Rather with troops deployed in big numbers, and with Russian jets routinely buzzing US aircraft carriers, and other assets, the greater danger is from an accident or collision. In September, a Dutch investigation concluded that it was a Buk missile smuggled across the border from Russia that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\">shot down Flight MH17 in 2014</a>, killing 298 people. </p> <p>For much of the 1990s, Nato had lost its rationale. In recent years, it has been short of cash. The US has repeatedly complained that many member states are unwilling to pay the price of collective European security. For better or worse, Nato now has a purpose: to contain a growing and unpredictable Kremlin threat.<br></p>",

Her involvement has placed Allred back in familiar territory: holding court at one of her trademark press conferences, surrounded by a phalanx of news crews.</p> <p>Politics is her strong suit. Allred tanked Meg Whitman\u2019s bid for California governor when she announced that Whitman\u2019s former nanny would be suing for unpaid wages. And she fanned the flames engulfing Herman Cain\u2019s presidential campaign when she introduced a woman who claimed that Cain once grabbed her head, forced it toward his crotch, and leered, \u201cYou want a job, right?\u201d </p> <p>But the California attorney has also pursued causes that have chagrined her fellow feminists. It was not so long ago that Allred\u2019s press conferences starred Tiger Woods\u2019 ex-girlfriend or a woman who had an online flirtation with Anthony Weiner. Allred <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/12/tabloid-feminist/308300/\">proclaimed</a> that Woods\u2019 ex was \u201ca victim because he broke her heart\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cSome of her causes are incredibly worthy,\u201d the writer Emily Bazelon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/fashion/20ALLRED.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times</a>. \u201cBut her way of going about it makes me cringe.\u201d</p> <p>I spoke with Allred this week about her supposed baggage, Trump\u2019s accusers, the cultural shifts around rape and sexual assault and what young women may not understand about Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Our conversation took place in two, 15-minute bursts. \u201cI just have so many people trying to contact me,\u201d she said as she excused herself from our first conversation. \u201cBasically, women about Trump.

We\u2019d be in a guessing game about what she means when she says \u201cher way of going about it\u201d.</p> <p>There are some people who would prefer that victims suffer in silence. I\u2019m not one of them. We\u2019re lawyers. We don\u2019t take polls or votes to see what other feminists believe is right. </p> <p><strong>OK, but people at the time had this criticism that you were giving an equal platform to women with broken hearts and women alleging an actual crime.</strong></p> <p>Our standard is not: should women only have a voice if they\u2019re the victim of a crime? I don\u2019t know who thinks that that\u2019s the standard, that women can only speak out if there\u2019s a crime. I\u2019ve never heard that as a requirement. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4ee97de416a115d0f38f9683018656aa2d461a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4ee97de416a115d0f38f9683018656aa2d461a7/0_144_3501_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allred holds hands with spouses Robin Tyler and Diane Olson as they take part in the 38th annual San Francisco LGBT pride parade on 29 June 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allred holds hands with spouses Robin Tyler and Diane Olson as they take part in the 38th annual San Francisco LGBT pride parade on 29 June 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You\u2019re a big Clinton supporter. Do you notice a generational divide among women in how excited they are to see the first woman elected president, potentially?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m not a pollster. I will say this: I think that there are many women, older women, who really understand how important it is that we have a woman president. </p> <p>Four years from now, and I think of this often, it will be 2020. And Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2013 if, as, and when she\u2019s elected in November \u2013 will still be president. And in that year we will mark the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s winning the right to vote in the United States. </p> <p>That will be so important. And yes, I believe that we do, as mothers, as grandmothers, understand the importance of having a woman in the White House. Not only for the purposes of what I\u2019ll call herstory, but as an inspiration for our daughters. And it\u2019s just long overdue. </p> <p><strong>Is \u201cherstory\u201d really your preferred word for history?</strong></p> <p>Yes!</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong></p> <p>Now it is. If she wins, she really is going to be making herstory.</p> <p><strong>You referred to Hillary Clinton as Hillary Rodham Clinton. Which I love, I don\u2019t see many people referring to her using her maiden name. Is that a conscious choice?</strong></p> <p>Yes. At some point when she was in Arkansas, after she got married, she added her married name. She\u2019s chosen to keep both names. And I\u2019m glad she did. She\u2019s saying, consider me on my own merits. </p> <p>I went to an all-girls high school, and many of these girls went on to be accomplished leaders and very successful. When it\u2019s time for a reunion, it\u2019s difficult to find some of these girls, because some of them have shed the only name we knew them by.</p> <p><strong>A colleague of mine keeps saying she\u2019s surprised no one is selling shirts that just read \u201cHillary Rodham\u201d. </strong></p> <p>Yes! I like it. Listen, part of why I admire her is because I have a small sense of what she\u2019s endured. She has taken all of this criticism. That\u2019s the price you pay for standing up for women\u2019s rights, which is a statement by itself. Her election will be a message to our daughters: yYou too can overcome. I think this is herstoric and I\u2019m so excited.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m sorry, did you say herstoric or historic?</strong> </p> <p>It\u2019s herstoric.</p> <p><strong>The Obama presidency unleashed in many ways a racist backlash. Do you think a Hillary Clinton presidency could have the potential to do the same for sexism?</strong></p> <p>There are some people who think that women should be denied opportunities because of their gender. But I think she\u2019s going to show, through deeds, not just words, what a president can be. For many of the misogynists and male chauvinists out there, just experiencing a woman in power hopefully will help to eliminate some of those stereotypes. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your level of optimism?</strong></p> <p>There will still be some who will cling to the gender stereotypes and traditional gender roles. But this is it. We\u2019re moving ahead. I\u2019ve already made my reservations for the inauguration.

  "<p>Angela Merkel has called on major internet platforms to divulge the secrets of their algorithms, arguing that their lack of transparency endangers debating culture.<br></p> <p>The German chancellor said internet users had a right to know how and on what basis the information they received via search engines was channelled to them.</p> <p>Speaking to a media conference in Munich, Merkel said: \u201cI\u2019m of the opinion that algorithms must be made more transparent, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen about questions like \u2018what influences my behaviour on the internet and that of others?\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cAlgorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they can shrink our expanse of information.\u201d </p> <p>An algorithm is the formula used by a search engine to steer a request for information. They are different for every search engine, highly secret and determine the significance or ranking of a web page.</p> <p>Merkel has joined a growing number of critics who have highlighted the dangers of receiving information that confirms an existing opinion or is recommended by people with similar ideas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a development that we need to pay careful attention to,\u201d she told the conference, adding that a healthy democracy was dependent on people being confronted by opposing ideas.</p> <p>\u201cThe big internet platforms, through their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through [to access their users],\u201d she said.</p> <p>There has been increasing concern about so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers \u2013 the result of an internet search in which an algorithm supposes the information someone would like to see based on previous searches, as well as information it might have about their location or preferences \u2013 in the light of the growing strength of populist movements in Europe, the Brexit vote in the UK and the rise of Donald Trump in the US. This month, President Barack Obama\u2019s former social media adviser Caleb Gardner highlighted the danger of <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?nolanguage=en-+on+democracy\">filter bubbles \u2013 a phrase invented by the internet activist Eli Pariser</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMore likely than not, you get your news from Facebook,\u201d  <a href=\"http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/story/icymi-obamas-former-social-media-director-speaks-a/\">Gardner told students at Northwestern University in Illinois.</a> \u201cForty-four per cent of US adults get news on the site, and 61% of millennials \u2026 if that doesn\u2019t frighten you, you don\u2019t know enough about Facebook\u2019s algorithm. If you have a parent who\u2019s a Trump supporter, they are seeing a completely different set of news items than you are.\u201d</p> <p>Merkel will have an eye on next year\u2019s federal election in which she is expected to stand for a fourth term. The concern that the phenomenon of narrow debate which has been seen during the US presidential campaign might be replicated in Germany is one shared across Germany\u2019s established parties.</p> <p>Merkel called the issue a \u201cchallenge not just for political parties but for society as a whole\u201d. If it was unclear what mechanisms were being used, it could \u201clead to a distortion of how people perceive things\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Thomas Jarzombek, the digital policy spokesperson of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/angela-merkel-warum-die-kanzlerin-an-die-algorithmen-von-facebook-will-a-1118365.html\">told Spiegel Online </a> he did not think she was advocating that companies such as Google and Facebook should disclose company secrets, \u201cbut we do need more information from these operators as to how their algorithms function generally speaking\u201d.</p> <p>A cross-party working group is compiling recommendations urging more openness by internet platforms, including making details on how their algorithms collect, choose, evaluate and present information available to users. Its recommendations will be sent to Brussels, for the EU digital commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to work them into guidelines by next year. Oettinger told Spiegel Online: \u201cMerkel has touched on an important topic.\u201d But he said questions about search engines\u2019 transparency had to \u201cfirst undergo a more in-depth examination\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The west risks breaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">the landmark nuclear agreement</a> if it fails to give Iran proper access to the international financial system, a former British ambassador to Iran has argued.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sir Richard Dalton, who served in Tehran between 2003 and 2006, said <a href=\"http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2016.1225896\">in a report published this week</a> in the journal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs in London that the US and its allies had made \u201csome potentially significant mistakes\u201d in respect to reconnecting Iran to global banks after the deal. </p> <p>Hassan Rouhani, under pressure to show tangible benefits of the lifting of sanctions to Iranians before the next presidential vote in 2017, complained at the UN in September that the US was failing to fulfil its obligations. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Iranian president\u2019s comments were echoed by the head of the country\u2019s Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">who told the Guardian last month</a> that \u201cthere are hints to do away [with] or to rewrite the deal, and on the other hand to unilaterally impose excessive oversighting and overcompliance to the point of Iran\u2019s discouragement and ultimate submission.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton\u2019s article, published on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/iran-deal-adoption-day-conditional-sanctions-waivers\"> first anniversary of the nuclear deal coming into effect</a>, stated that the nuclear deal was the product of diplomacy. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Noting that the nuclear agreement would only endure \u201cif everyone works at it\u201d, Dalton wrote that \u201ccommon sense suggests that, if the situation is not appreciably better later in the year, it will be impossible for the US and its partners to argue credibly that they are not in breach of\u201d the nuclear deal, which is known in Iran by the acronym Barjam. </p> <p>According to Dalton, the US and its partners have notably failed to re-authorise Iran\u2019s access to U-turn transactions [used by Iranian banks to avoid US sanctions] in dollars, or to reassure non-US banks on handling Iranian payments, or to give general licences allowing non-US entities to use US software in their businesses dealings in Iran. Banks have remained reluctant to enter Iran <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/us-and-uk-urge-banks-to-do-business-with-iran\">despite attempts</a> by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his European counterparts. </p> <p>Among other impediments are \u201cunwillingness [by the west], apparently, to use governmental influence with state-owned banks to get them to help carry out government policy\u201d such as \u201cproviding clearing facilities in London\u201d, Dalton said. <br></p> <p>The ongoing banking difficulties have prevented Iran from capitalising on interest shown by western businesses in returning to the country, or finalising lucrative deals with the west, such as the purchase of planes from Airbus and Boeing. Iran is also partly to blame because it does not have adequate regulations on transparency, anti-corruption and money laundering.</p> <p>Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of the Europe-Iran Forum business conference series, said the mood in Tehran was mixed. \u201cOn one hand, major multinationals like Siemens, Peugeot, Unilever and Vodafone have signalled ambitious plans for Iran, generating optimism in Iran\u2019s business community,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOn the other hand, there are frustrating gaps in the US Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s licensing policy. OFAC has issued so-called \u2018general licences\u2019 to help open the door for non-US companies to trade with Iran, but these provisions use broad language and do not fully account for the complexity of trade and investment by multinational companies.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton served in the British Foreign Office for more than 35 years and was among a group of former western ambassadors to Tehran <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace\">who co-penned an article in 2011</a> saying there was \u201cno evidence that the country is building nuclear weapons\u201d and urging dialogue. He is currently an associate fellow at the London thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>Dalton predicted that the nuclear agreement would last \u201cprovided that mutual benefit is delivered in practice\u201d and that the US \u201cuses its power wisely\u201d. Iran would not be the first to renege, he argued, saying that \u201cthe overwhelming interest of Iran is to comply\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe nuclear deal will stick, subject to US policy. And even if a Republican wins in the US, it is not a foregone conclusion that a candidates\u2019 hostility to perceived past \u2018concessions\u2019 to Iran would translate into active sabotage of the deal \u2013 it is too obviously a good agreement for US, regional and world security against the spread of nuclear weapons.\u201d A Donald Trump presidency would be unlikely to change that, he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With Iran\u2019s own elections scheduled for May, the moderate Rouhani faces a tough time ahead. \u201cHigh expectations in Iran of economic progress have not been realised. Disappointment has set in and criticism of the limited benefits that have accrued to Iran by the supreme leader and by President Rouhani\u2019s opponents is rising in intensity; 2017 will see a presidential election in Iran and the right scent Rouhani\u2019s blood.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Economically, Dalton viewed Iran as an emerging Bric country, alongside newly advanced economies such as Brazil and India. \u201cThey have a $1.4tn diversified economy, growing at some 4-5%, with a backlog of investment in all sectors, a reforming government (for the next year at least) and a well-educated population (total 80 million) striving to take advantage of the country\u2019s improved prospects,\u201d he observed. \u201cCrude production will soon go above 4m barrels per day. The oil minister projects a production capacity of 4.8m barrels per day within five years.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On the regional context, Dalton wrote that \u201cwe should compare [Iran] not with post-Ottoman, post-imperial Egypt or Saudi Arabia, but with Russia and other Asian powers.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>\u201cI guess it did create a little  bit of head-scratching,\u201d chuckles Kurt Wagner, as he recalls playing his Lambchop band members the songs he\u2019d written for their new album, Flotus. </p> <p>Head-scratching is certainly one way of putting it. Those who\u2019ve grown accustomed to Lambchop as a subtle and sometimes soulful alt-country outfit might have wondered if this was even the same band when they first encountered Flotus\u2019s lead single, The Hustle, back in August: electronic rhythms, hypnotic drones and painterly instrumental flourishes are all incorporated over its 18, largely vocal-free, minutes. As late-stage career reinventions go, it was pretty out there.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf9wz5esgAo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cf9wz5esgAo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s not that Lambchop were strangers to reinvention, or even the odd perverse decision \u2013 1997\u2019s Thriller saw them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzy2bKzKG6w\">cover three songs</a> from East River Pipe\u2019s Poor Fricky album; 2002\u2019s Is a Woman flirted with minimalist piano reggae \u2013 but this was something different, by far the boldest statement the band had ever put out. And the rest of Flotus, it turns out, is no less interesting: it features elements of glitch (Directions to the Can), lounge music (Old Masters) and spliced vocal fragments (Relatives #2). The whole thing is swathed in heavy vocal processing, drawing parallels with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/29/bon-iver-22-a-million-the-downsides-of-success-never-sounded-so-good\">Bon Iver\u2019s new record 22, A Million</a> and Kanye West\u2019s 808s &amp; Heartbreak. Put simply \u2026 what the hell happened, Kurt?</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cWell, the initial plan was to make a record that maybe my wife would like. The music she listens to on her phone is often commercial pop, commercial hip-hop \u2013 she\u2019s a big Beyonc\u00e9 fan. I thought, \u2018I would love to be in her playlist,\u2019 to pop up on her phone. That was a big motivation.\u201d <br></p> <p>Wagner was aware he\u2019d been absorbing such music for decades \u2013 sometimes through the television or in shops, but most often while sitting out on his porch having a cigarette and listening to the songs his neighbours were playing. Often it would overlap with the sounds of their domestic lives: parties, conversations, arguments, entwining the two together in Wagner\u2019s mind as a soundtrack to everyday existence. He began to notice the link between country and hip-hop \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re both folkorish forms of music, if you think about it\u201d \u2013 but trying to combine the two was harder than he anticipated. </p> <p>\u201cMy first attempts were pretty hamfisted,\u201d he admits. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised the technological side of it.\u201d</p> <p>And so, aged 57, Wagner decided to rip it up and start again. He ditched the Pro Tools software he\u2019d used for years, taught himself how to use Ableton Live and began studying recent albums by Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. He soon realised that these artists were making creative leaps that had not, in his opinion, been seen in pop since the 60s.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve incorporated all the things that are now available to us technologically, and are just having their way with it creatively,\u201d he marvels. \u201cThey\u2019re going beyond traditional ways of making and producing records that I, as a guy who\u2019s been making records a long time, have grown accustomed to. They\u2019ve moved beyond what we would traditionally think of as hip-hop into a form that is ... boundless. They\u2019re the lighthouse that people are heading to now as far as how they\u2019re producing sound. It\u2019s extremely sophisticated.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21a8445d046ac9b521d5ab3f0b4ea5ed6a1e624c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21a8445d046ac9b521d5ab3f0b4ea5ed6a1e624c/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Wagner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurt Wagner of Lambchop performs at the Big Chill festival in 2006</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wagner, who cites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/david-bowie-blackstar-review-a-spellbinding-break-with-his-past\">David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar</a> as another record that shares this sense of creative abandonment, came to realise that technology had developed to the point where anything an artist could envisage was possible to recreate on record. </p> <p>\u201cAnd you can do it in a way that doesn\u2019t cost a million dollars,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo be able to just reach out into the void and come up with something is accessible even to someone of my meagre means. There are no boundaries. Your mind is your outer limit.\u201d<br></p> <p>One of Wagner\u2019s eureka moments on this personal voyage of discovery came when he went to see Shabazz Palaces perform at Nashville\u2019s Third Man Records store. He was intrigued by a small box they were using on-stage to generate a myriad of sounds.<br></p> <p>\u201cI thought, \u2018What is this thing?\u2019\u201d he says, adding some dramatic suspicion to his voice. Further investigation revealed that it was a <a href=\"http://www.tc-helicon.com/en/products/voicelive-2/\">TC-Helicon VoiceLive 2</a>, a tool invented to help singer-songwriters perform solo that just so happened to be packed with all kinds of inventive sonic tricks.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou can simply turn your voice into an instrument with it,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, you could turn it into an organ and create songs and chord structures virtually just with your voice. That freed me up from my own limitations as a guitarist, because now I could process things in a way I would never have come up with on my own.\u201d<br></p> <p>As a Nashville musician who knew of Auto-Tune primarily as a device that helped mediocre singers cover up their mistakes (\u201cIt was used in the country music industry for quite a while before the cat got out of the bag\u201d), using voice processing on his own records required a mental leap: at one time Wagner had regarded it as the antithesis to the warmth and humanity that he aimed to pour into Lambchop records. But playing around with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xC1-UJeSYY\">voicebox</a> made him realise that it could be a creative instrument in its own right. \u201cIt screws things up and does unpredictable things, and I think that in itself is a very human trait,\u201d he reasons. \u201cThese things would occur \u2026 and I had no idea of how they would happen! But I liked it!\u201d<br></p> <p>He liked it, but do others? Will Lambchop\u2019s fans approve? And what about his wife? If you read the press release Wagner wrote to promote Flotus, you\u2019re left a little disheartened. \u201cIt turns out she\u2019s not impressed,\u201d he writes. \u201cShe prefers the sound of my voice as it is and has been ... turns out she loves me for who I am. God, I\u2019m such a dumbass.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/10/kurt-wagner-lambchop-nashville-redneck\">Kurt Wagner on Lambchop, Nashville \u2013 and being seen as a redneck</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His wife\u2019s approval matters, not just because Wagner set out to impress her with this project, but because of how central she is to the album\u2019s overriding theme of support. When I last spoke to Wagner, in 2008, he told me how she made podcasts for a liberal college radio show. Her working life seems to have changed dramatically since then \u2013 she is now the chair of the Democratic party in Tennessee. It means the title of the record has a multitude of meanings: FLOTUS, of course, stands for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flotus?lang=en-gb\">First Lady of the United States</a>, a directly political reference to their current situation. But in this case, it also stands for For Love Often Turns Us Still, the full title of the record. The supporting role partners play in a relationship is referenced by both readings, and certainly Wagner has had to adapt his own life in order to support his wife as her career progressed.</p> <p>\u201cMy awareness certainly had to increase!\u201d he says with another big laugh. \u201cIn order for me to hang in those situations, I had to become more aware of what\u2019s going on politically in our state, our country and our world. But that\u2019s part of being married, you know, to try to understand and embrace and support the person you\u2019re married to ... and my role in our lives now is very much a supportive one, particularly because of the intensity of her job.\u201d <br></p> <p>I suggest that most of the musicians I\u2019ve met seemed better at requiring support from their partners than giving it.<br></p> <p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s interesting is the ones I know that have stayed married over the course of time ... it\u2019s one of the key things, you have to step outside of yourself and get over yourself a little bit \u2013 to realise that you\u2019re in a relationship and that it goes both ways.

  "<p>In Little Havana, a vibrant Latino neighborhood just west of downtown Miami, a queue of a couple of dozen prospective voters had formed outside one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s field offices.</p> \n<p>Sandwiched between an insurance company and immigration counsel office, the group had arrived for tickets to a free Jennifer Lopez concert. But there was one caveat: to attend the Saturday evening show, at Bayfront Park on Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay, fans were first required to visit a Clinton campaign field office.</p> \n<p>It was one of the many creative ways in which the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign was seeking to engage likely voters in the critical battleground of Florida, a state with a key role in determining whether Clinton or her Republican opponent Donald Trump is elected on 8 November as the next president of the United States.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Inside this modest campaign space, one of 82 Clinton field offices in the Sunshine State, yellow-painted walls bore signs that read phrases such as \u201cJuntos Se Puede\u201d (Together We Can) and \u201cWhy build a wall against Hispanics when they built this country?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEnglish or Spanish?\u201d a volunteer asked as two sisters stepped into the office hoping to secure a pair of concert tickets. \u201cSpanish,\u201d they responded.</p> \n<p>Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez, both US citizens originally from Nicaragua, had already made up their mind. Trump had hit a nerve, they said, within Florida\u2019s sprawling Hispanic community.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, that\u2019s an extra vote for Trump,\u201d said Lucia, a 19-year-old college student. \u201cI have family members that might be deported, and just to be safe I wouldn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Azalia, a 27-year-old in real estate, put it even more bluntly when asked why she was voting for Clinton: \u201cWell, I\u2019m Hispanic and I don\u2019t like what Trump says.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turnout among Hispanic voters might sway the outcome of the election in a state where one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country holds substantial influence. A half-dozen volunteers worked the phones in both English and Spanish, targeting a list of likely Clinton supporters while making a strong push for the early voting process that began on 24 October.</p> \n<p>The Obama campaign worked out of the same office in 2012, recognizing a shift in demographics. While the Cubans who dominated the area typically voted Republican, a younger generation has in recent years leaned Democratic; and non-Cuban Hispanics, a reliably Democratic voting bloc, also increasingly live in the area.</p> \n<p>In 2000, a controversial recount in Florida determined whether Al Gore or George W Bush would become president. Sixteen years later, the state is still vital terrain in the presidential race \u2013 Trump, trailing Clinton in other must-win swing states, needs to secure the state\u2019s 29 electoral votes to have a path to victory.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

  "<p>This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">I\u2019ve been spending time with Donald Trump voters in Muncie</a>. Trump won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, with 53% of the vote. I\u2019ve written many columns over the past year condemning Trump for the range of things he\u2019s said and done. But my aim in this article \u2013 which was not news, but commentary \u2013 was to understand his supporters in Muncie, and hopefully elsewhere better. </p> <p> Among those I\u2019ve interviewed is Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and contacted us through this project. Jamie grew up in Muncie but moved away because she feared being drawn into a life of drugs and crime she saw in her neighbourhood. A whip-smart working-class white woman, for me Jamie singlehandedly rescued potential Trump voters from caricature. She voted for Obama in 2008, laments the impact of systemic racism, calls Trump \u201cgarbage\u201d but thinks he\u2019ll be better than Hillary.</p> <p>I had the privilege to sit in on a meeting of conservative Muncie residents, called the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government. It included some candidates and office holders, who are engaged in local campaigns. It was a feisty, raucous group not at all reticent about speaking their mind. Like Jamie they were not blind to Trump\u2019s flaws. And like Jamie, I found them through people contacting the Guardian community team.</p> <p>I also paid David Jamison and his son JR a visit.

In 2010, they had to take control of all of the chambers. In 2011, they sat down with some of the most skilled mapmakers in the country, and they drew lines with the express intent of using redistricting as a partisan hammer to lock in control of the House for the next decade.</p> </blockquote> <p>The results were dramatic. As Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5604284/us-elections-are-rigged-but-canada-knows-how-to-fix-them\">explained this week</a>, \u201cWhen Americans voted for the House in 2012, Democratic candidates won 1.4 million more votes than Republicans. Yet after the dust settled, the GOP ended up with a 234-201 majority in the chamber.\u201d The liberal blog Daily Kos conducted a comprehensive study of gerrymandering in the 2012 House election and <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/13/1382504/-How-gerrymandering-cost-Democrats-the-House-in-2012-Part-1-An-interactive-look-at-alternative-maps\">concluding</a> that it \u201clikely cost Democrats a net of 25 seats in 2012, more than the 17 they needed to claim a majority that year, and far more than the eight they actually did gain.\u201d</p> <p>Take Ohio, for example, which is generally a battleground state in presidential elections and is pretty evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Because of the radical redistricting Ohio Republicans implemented in 2010, they were able to carve up the map so that they have 75% of Ohio House seats. It\u2019s so bad, a <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/11/conservative_and_liberal_group.html\">recent study showed</a> you can predict the results of any race in Ohio with a virtual certainty just by knowing the political makeup of a particular district.</p> <p>You can see how gerrymandering can manipulate election results in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/gerrymandering-supreme-court-us-election-north-carolina\">Guardian\u2019s excellent look at</a> \u201cthe nation\u2019s most gerrymandered district\u201d in North Carolina, which was so narrow at one point state representative Mickey Michaux, a Democrat from Durham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/gerrymandering-supreme-court-us-election-north-carolina\">once said</a>: \u201cIf you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, you\u2019d kill most of the people in the district.\u201d</p> <p>The United States district map <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/13/this-is-actually-what-america-would-look-like-without-gerrymandering/\">would look radically different</a> if computers, rather than partisan humans, drew the maps based on US census data. That\u2019s why it\u2019s encouraging that President Obama <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5604284/us-elections-are-rigged-but-canada-knows-how-to-fix-them\">will reportedly make redistricting reform</a> a central part of his post-presidency plans. Given the extent to which it affects our elections, it\u2019s an underreported problem \u2013 and until it becomes a national scandal, it will persist.</p> <p>Gerrymandering has several effects beyond just making it easier for one party to control the majority of seats in the House. It drives down voter turnout, since so many elections are lopsided and unopposed. It increases polarization and deadlock in Congress since a lot of congressional members don\u2019t have to worry about a serious challenger from the other party. It also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/\">deprives minority groups</a> of political power.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t a new problem; the practice is <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-election/how-does-gerrymandering-work/article32467642/\">almost as old as the country itself</a>, and Democrats have engaged in it as well.

Every two weeks the <a href=\"http://www.forgoodgovernment.com/\">Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government</a>, a conservative group, meets here primarily to discuss campaigning on local issues. </p> <p>Nationally Hillary Clinton is <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/ \">ahead in most polls</a>; regionally they suggest she is mounting a challenge in states such as <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/clinton-campaign-makes-play-arizona-buys-ads-texas-n667706\">Utah, Georgia and even Texas</a>, where Democrats haven\u2019t won in decades; <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/what-the-early-voting-numbers-are-telling-us.html\">early voting</a> is on balance looking promising for the DNC. But when I ask the 12 people in the room how many still think he has a shot, they nearly all raise their hands.</p> <p>A reader of this project suggested I contact Hiatt, who told me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think the polls are rigged. But I think there\u2019s a hidden vote and people are giving the PC answer they think people want to hear rather than how they\u2019ll actually be inclined to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Secret Trump supporters are waiting to cause an earthquake, goes the theory. To the CDCGG members present, the alternative \u2013 that Trump loses \u2013 is unthinkable. \u201cIf she gets elected ...\u201d says Judy Campbell and then shakes her head where the end of her sentence might be. \u201cPeople can\u2019t seriously be thinking about voting for that woman. I mean what in the world ... What can they be thinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what he\u2019s done and said is indefensible,\u201d says Jim Arnold. \u201cBut when you compare it to what she\u2019s done they\u2019re not comparable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me worry about the intelligence of some of these people,\u201d says Margaret Niccum.</p> <p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t fix that,\u201d says Arnold. </p> <p>More than 50 million people are likely to vote for Trump, even if he goes down in flames. It would be unhelpful to generalise about all of them, reducing them to caricature only to dismiss them. Something is happening here and it behooves people to try to understand it, whether or not they like it. From interviews with a range of Trump voters in Muncie, it\u2019s clear most are not blind to his flaws, even if they wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe them in the manner of his detractors. </p> <p>The CDCGG was originally set up to repeal property taxes in Indiana which the group argued were exorbitant. After a successful campaign, they gained the ear of the governor and won a cap on property taxes statewide, and transformed themselves into a local group rallying around local issues. Mostly small businessmen and retirees, half male, half female, all white, it feels like a reconstitution of the Tea Party. </p> <p>Good government, in this context, means small government; with <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/articles/58583-muncie-mayor-says-fbi-investigating-city-government\">Muncie\u2019s Democratic administration under investigation by the FBI for corruption</a> they feel like they are pushing at an open door and would push harder if the local Republican hierarchy were not so reticent. The atmosphere in the room is cordial; these are not just ideological allies, with a keen sense of civic engagement \u2013 two are running for local office and the conversation touches on water rates, sewage rates and teachers\u2019 contracts among other things \u2013 but also friends.</p> <p>Only a couple had wanted Trump to win in the Republican primaries earlier this year. Most preferred Ted Cruz, the Texan who has tried to style himself as a Reaganesque disruptor of Republican politics, or Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida. \u201cI would have been happier with almost anyone else,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cI wanted [Ben] Carson, then Cruz then Rubio. Trump would have almost been my last choice.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask if they are worried that he will do something embarrassing again they mostly laugh and nod.</p> <p>Dave Jamison, who is retired and voted for Obama twice, says he thought Trump was an \u201carrogant SOB when he was on The Apprentice\u201d, but his hunting buddies in southern Indiana persuaded him to take a second look and now he\u2019s thinking seriously of voting for him.</p> <p>Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and training to be a mortician, variably describes Trump as \u201cgarbage\u201d and a \u201cword-butcher\u201d. Walsh, who got in contact with the Guardian through this project, grew up in Muncie but moved away because she saw drugs, single parenthood or incarceration claiming her peers on the southside \u2013 the white working class part of town \u2013 and felt the need to escape. She now lives in the Indianapolis suburb of Brownsburg and probably would have voted for John Kasich, one of the more moderate Republicans in the primaries, if she had registered for a party. \u201cI hated Donald Trump during the primaries,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a mockery.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c/0_58_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh has only voted in a presidential race once: for Obama in 2008. She is likely to vote for Trump now, but says of him: \u201cHe\u2019s a 70-year-old white man. He\u2019s been supported in bigotry his entire life. He\u2019s been validated his entire life. And people wonder why he acts like this. No wonder he acts like this.\u201d</p> <p>One local senior Republican tells me privately: \u201cLook, he\u2019s a bully. Everyone can see that.\u201d</p> <p>The question of why they would vote for a man of whom they apparently have such a low opinion brings us to something else that connects most of them: their loathing of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>It is a disdain of such depths that not a single virtue can be salvaged; a contempt nurtured and tended with such animus and anomie over the decades that she has been in the public eye that any redeeming features she might claim have long been stripped away. \u201cUnlike Hillary, he hasn\u2019t done anything criminal,\u201d says Hiatt. </p> <p>Niccum believes this moment is the culmination of a longstanding plot hatched by the Clintons several years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s been planning this since she was in college,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you let all this stuff go?\u201d asks Walsh, referring to things Clinton has been accused of of late. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy stuff going on in these emails if you read \u2019em. This is all the stuff the crazy people have been talking about for years and now it turns out it\u2019s most likely true ... She\u2019s a professional politician. How do you make millions of dollars as a politician? You\u2019re supposed to be a civil servant.\u201d </p> <p>Jamison is rare among Trump supporters I\u2019ve met, in saying he could vote for Hillary, if Trump were \u201cto go off the deep end again\u201d.</p> <p>But for the overwhelming majority, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/8/1478776/-Why-Do-People-Hate-Hillary-Clinton-So-Much\">Hillary hatred</a> is their driving force. What they see as the apocalyptic scenario of Clinton running the country has them reaching for the largest immovable object to stop her. This cannot simply be dismissed as misogyny. Until just a couple weeks ago Clinton and Trump were running almost even among white women, while white women without college degrees <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a12016ElectionTrackingNo1.pdf\">still favour him 51-42</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d asks Campbell. \u201cJust look at the kind of women she has standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d at the last debate he not only faithfully reflected their sentiments \u2013 he actually understated it. They do not only think she is dishonest, they think she is a criminal, scheming, cheating snob who will sell America to the highest bidder and pocket the proceeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc/160_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump window sticker in Muncie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump window sticker in Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Younge for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey look at things through the global order,\u201d says Will Statom, the head of the Delaware Republican party. \u201cA lot of people are looking at Hillary Clinton as nothing good. It\u2019s laughable that she can relate to the middle class \u2013 laughable. They\u2019re elitists. They have always have been elitists. They were elitists in Arkansas. They have just found a way to get ultra rich with that sham called the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>There are policies of Trump\u2019s they like too. \u201cUnderneath all the crap there are decent ideas but people don\u2019t see them,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cYou have to go looking for them. That\u2019s his own fault. His position on tax reform, trade reform \u2013 they\u2019re not bad. And the plan to privatise the Veterans Administration, that\u2019s a really good plan.\u201d</p> <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is the government agency that is supposed to provide services, including healthcare, to those who have served in the military. It is so notoriously badly run that <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/06/jon-stewart-vs-va-how-tv-host-raged-against-red-tape/31207623/\">Jon Stewart made improving it a campaign on The Daily Show</a>. Walsh\u2019s husband served in Iraq and has PTSD and hearing loss, following an IED explosion. The VA care he is entitled to is hard to access and inadequate when he does get it, so he uses his employer\u2019s health insurance instead.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they get home the VA just hands them pills and sends them home,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cBut psychological pills aren\u2019t one size fits all. You need therapy and treatment and they\u2019re not getting that. It\u2019s like a flow chart of pills. It\u2019s a mess. We have soldiers killing themselves in epic proportions and it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting for care.\u201d</p> <p>For Arnold it\u2019s the supreme court \u2013 currently hanging in the ideological balance after the death of the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left a four-four split between liberal and conservative judges. \u201cThat can change our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how anyone who calls themselves a Christian can vote for her. There\u2019s Roe v Wade, LGBTQ and then she says she\u2019s for the second amendment but then she\u2019ll tell you all the restrictions she\u2019ll put on gun owners.\u201d</p> <p>But the economy is the biggest issue of all in a town like Muncie, which lost much of its manufacturing base as companies moved south. About a third of what was once a thriving blue-collar town lives in poverty; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/25/middletown-muncie-factories-photo-essay-midwest\">huge factory plants lie abandoned</a>, sitting like gigantic art installations depicting the post-industrial era. The broad consensus is that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalised trade between the US, Canada and Mexico, helped kill the economic life of this town: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/hillary-bill-clinton\">an agreement championed by Bill Clinton</a> and supported by Hillary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681/0_0_5000_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Statom drove me around the empty factories, elegising about the loss of both jobs and communities, the tumbledown streets where his grandparents lived and the shuttered buildings where they and his father used to work, he tells me he helped load the last machines on to the trucks in nearby Anderson that took the jobs to Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the unions got greedy. That was part of it. And then Nafta did the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like Trump,\u201d says Jamison. \u201cGet America back, middle-class jobs and everything. I think we need some of that.\u201d Do you think those jobs are coming back? I ask Jamison. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The devastation wreaked by that hollowing-out is what Walsh felt the need to escape when she left Muncie. \u201cI have friends from high school who were incarcerated for bank robbery. One of the guys I went to high school was killed not so long ago. My best friend, who has a daughter, she\u2019s on her own. It\u2019s just a mess. People addicted to drugs. There\u2019s nothing to do. It\u2019s a sad situation. It\u2019s textbook of how you create an inner city.\u201d</p> <p>During the primaries, when all but a couple of the Republican contenders had dropped out, Trump did well on the southside where Walsh grew up. The white working class \u2013 and particularly white men without a college degree among whom he leads by a whopping 60-21 \u2013 form a significant part of Trump\u2019s core support. But it would be a mistake to conclude from that that he has the bulk of support in these areas. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">Nationally, Trump supporters are generally wealthier than most Americans</a> and considerable wealthier than those who voted for Clinton. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dcelectionday.com/2016-2/primary-election-2016/\">Democrats outpolled Republicans by a significant margin</a> during the primaries in most, if not all the southside precincts in Muncie. Bernie Sanders, the \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d insurgent on the Democratic side, got more votes than Trump on the southside and even though Clinton lost to Sanders there, she wasn\u2019t far behind Trump in vote totals.</p> <p>\u201cNobody speaks up for the poor,\u201d says Walsh, explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to those she grew up with. \u201cThere is systemic racism but black people have advocates. Poor white people don\u2019t. They\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t feel racist, they don\u2019t feel sexist, they don\u2019t want to offend people or say the wrong thing. But for them white privilege is like a blessing and a curse if you\u2019re poor. The whole idea pisses poor white people off because they\u2019ve never experienced it on a level that they understand. </p> <p>\u201cYou hear privilege and you think money and opportunity and they don\u2019t have it. I understand how it works but I don\u2019t think most people do. So when Trump says stuff, they can understand what he\u2019s saying and he speaks to them in a way other people don\u2019t. And then you\u2019ve got people calling them stupid and deplorable. Well how long do you think you can call people stupid and deplorable before they get mad?\u201d</p> <p><em>Pictures by David Levene and Gary Younge</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

If Cortez Masto wins, she will be the first Latina ever elected to the largely white, largely male legislative body.</p> <p>With so much at stake, the Nevada race has become one of the most expensive in the country, attracting tens of millions of dollars from outside Super Pacs, including more than $8m from the Koch brothers\u2019 Freedom Partners Action Fund. <br></p> <p>Heck was believed to have the best chance to wrest a Senate seat away from the Democrats this year.</p> <p>But not any more.

Barack Obama is perhaps the biggest name to go after Heck to date; in Las Vegas, he was certainly one of the most scathing.</p> <p>\u201cOn issue after issue, Catherine Cortez Masto is going to be by your side working for you,\u201d Obama said, warming to his task. \u201cHer opponent is gonna have Koch brothers on line one and Donald Trump on line two. When Donald creates his TV station, I\u2019m sure Joe Heck will be up on there giving interviews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cEven after rescinding his endorsement of Trump, he said, \u2018I want to support him.

You\u2019re for him, but you\u2019re not for him. But you\u2019re kinda for him. What the Heck?\u201d</p> <p>Such a stance, the president said, is \u201cnot leadership. That\u2019s cynical. That means you\u2019ll say anything or be anybody just to get elected depending on what\u2019s convenient at the time.\u201d</p> <p>The Heck campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p> <p>Heck is now the poster child for down-ballot Republicans\u2019 election day fears. Since the Trump campaign began imploding this month, Heck has trailed Cortez Masto in all but two of 11 polls. RealClearPolitics aggregated the most recent Nevada surveys and figures the Democrat leads by 2<strong> </strong>percentage points.</p> <p>And the specter of Trump dogs Heck wherever he goes.</p> <p>During a 14 October Nevada Senate debate, Heck was asked why it took him so long to distance himself from Trump. His answer was heartfelt and intimate.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was the victim of domestic abuse in a prior relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the decision I made was an extremely personal decision. As an emergency room doctor, I\u2019ve taken care of far too many women that have been victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, and I have great empathy for anyone who has ever had to experience such a tragedy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/arizona-swing-state-west-democrats-clinton\">Arizona asks 'the unprecedented': could Democrats sweep the west?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, at his national security roundtable in Reno, Heck sidestepped questions about whom he will vote for on 8 November.</p> <p>Heck was asked by an apparent Trump supporter why he was dodging the question of who should be the next commander-in-chief.

  "<p>Donald Trump is a man of many amazing boasts; someone who never met a hyperbole he didn\u2019t like. The truth can be a hazy thing in business, real estate and even taxes. But golf is supposed to be different. Golf lives in absolutes, and is governed by a strict honor code that players <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/golf/blog/devil_ball_golf/post/Davis-calls-penalty-on-himself-gives-up-shot-at?urn=golf,234963\">rigidly follow</a>. Or at least they should. And so it is in golf, as most everything else with Trump, where the line between fact and fiction is hazy.</p> <p>Trump has bragged about having a handicap of three. For years, this number <a href=\"http://www.golf.com/instruction/forget-boardroom-donald-will-dominate-you-tee-green-game-thats-better-you-think\">was accepted</a> with little public question, probably because nobody cared enough to investigate it. Forbes once reported his handicap as four, with the caveat that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/04/18/famous-golfers-and-their-um-handicaps/#7d483c346ea8\">he has yet to produce a signed scorecard</a> as proof. But mostly Trump\u2019s word was that.</p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee lists his handicap <a href=\"http://www.ghin.com/lookup.aspx\">as 2.8 </a>on the US Golf Association\u2019s Golf Handicap and Information Network, making him an extraordinary golfer at any age \u2013 but truly phenomenal for someone who is 70. And it raises the question: how likely is this claim to be truthful? Is it yet another story of virility fabricated by a man who has a long history of distorting reality?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-scotland-golf-course-resort-losses\">Donald Trump has lost tens of millions on Scottish golf courses, accounts show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s age should not be an impediment.

In fact, he says, there are 70-year-old golfers who show up at Langston with legitimate three handicaps.</p> <p>There is a hitch, though.</p> <p>\u201cWith someone who has a schedule like Donald Trump\u2019s, it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Somerville said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost scratch, someone who can play almost professionally. It\u2019s not somebody who has a schedule like his.\u201d</p> <p>The 70-year-olds who come through the clubhouse with three handicaps are usually retired. \u201cThey aren\u2019t in and out of meetings,\u201d Somerville said. And they are also men who have been playing their entire lives, probably starting as teenagers and who either played in college or somehow found a way to play nearly every day through adulthood.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very remote that someone could do this with the schedule he has,\u201d Somerville added.</p> <p>There are many tales of Trump bending the rules on the golf course. Last year, former Sports Illustrated managing editor Mark Mulvoy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-donald-trump-cheat-at-golf-a-washington-post-investigation/2015/09/02/f8a940b2-50c4-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html\">told the Washington Post</a> that once playing with Trump in the 1990s he realized that Trump had placed a ball just feet from the pin that he had never hit. \u201cAhh, the guys I play with cheat all the time,\u201d Mulvoy said Trump told him. \u201cI have to cheat to keep up with them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-rumbelows-cup-saint-and-greavsie-ian-st-john-jimmy-greaves\">\u2018Donald Trump had no idea what the Rumbelows Cup was.

When former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il played the first ever round of golf on the 7,700-yard championship course at Pyongyang in October 1994, state media reported that the Dear Leader finished with an 18-hole score of 34, including no less than five holes-in-one.</p> <p>That said, Trump clearly has some talent as a golfer, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JlzunW6YgA\">as seen in this 2011 YouTube video.</a> But his claim of a three handicap is hard to quantify, especially when his 20 most recent scores on his GHIN index are mostly from 2014 and stretch back to 2009. Even assuming he did not include his best rounds, it\u2019s not the kind of record you would see from a 70-year-old with a reputation as a scratch golfer.</p> <p>And it might just be yet another golf story.</p>",
  "<p>With all eyes focused on Mosul, Aleppo and Russia\u2019s military buildup in the Middle East, the sharply deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan has been all but ignored by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Whoever wins the US presidency, such insouciance will be hard to justify beyond January\u2019s inauguration day.</p> <p> As this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/afghan-civilians-shot-isis-ghor-province\">killing of 30 villagers in Ghor province</a> showed, Afghanistan has a way of forcing itself into the political headlights. Barack Obama learned this lesson the hard way. He promised to end the war. Instead, he escalated, faltered, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37772200\">then lost interest</a>. </p> <p> Obama\u2019s 2009 Afghan \u201csurge\u201d, supported by Clinton, then the US secretary of state, sent an additional 51,000 troops to the country. But the reinforcements failed to end the Taliban insurgency. In 2014 Obama said the war was ending. But he has had to eat his words. As he leaves office, 8,400 US soldiers and a large air force contingent remain behind.</p> <p> The Afghan Taliban, supported by elements in Pakistan, are still the deadliest and most numerous foe. Recent estimates suggest they are gaining territory in Helmand, where British troops once did battle. <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/taliban-in-kunduz-is-erasing-gains-of-afghanistan-deployment-a-1116101.html\">Repeated offensives</a> around Kunduz in the north and audacious attacks on Kabul have been beaten back, but with great difficulty. </p> <p> Al-Qaida jihadis \u2013 the reason the US entered Afghanistan in 2001 \u2013 remain active in at least seven provinces, while Isis has gained a foothold in Nangarhar. Rival ethnic warlords further complicate the picture.</p> <p> Afghanistan is now America\u2019s longest war. Its 15th anniversary fell on 7 October. More than 2,300 US troops have died there. The conflict <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/137041/afghanistan-infinite-quagmire\">has cost US taxpayers an estimated $686bn.</a> </p> <p>Yet despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/taliban-envoys-travel-pakistan-discuss-afghanistan-peace-talks\">recent, tentative peace talks</a>, it is far from over. Afghanistan has become the dirty little secret of the US presidential campaign that neither candidate cares to discuss. <br></p> <p> Across all three presidential debates, Afghanistan was only mentioned once, by Clinton, and then only in passing. The Democrat, already under fire for her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2011 US intervention in Libya, has little incentive to draw attention to unfinished business in Afghanistan. She knows the war is deeply unpopular with voters.</p> <p> For his part, Trump seems to understand little and care less. He once said the war was a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d but has no known policy. Even the Taliban feel affronted. A Talib spokesman, quoted by analyst Yochi Dreazen, commented after the first debate that Trump says \u201canything that comes to his tongue\u201d and is \u201cnot serious\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/world/2016/10/21/13359502/obama-clinton-trump-dying-afghanistan-isis-and-alqaeda-taliban-iraq-syria\"> This shared indifference cannot last</a>, Dreazen wrote. \u201cWhatever the reason, the silence about Afghanistan is a genuine shame since the future of the long US-led war there will be one of the first major choices that a President Trump or a President Clinton would have to make \u2026 The next president will need to decide whether to leave the troops there, send more, or bring even more of them home.\u201d </p> <p> Abandoning Afghanistan is probably not an option, however much western countries would like to wish away the problem. Despite the failure of many rural reconstruction projects, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37560704\">70 donor countries recently pledged</a> another $15.2bn for the next four years. </p> <p> While humanitarian needs are undoubtedly acute, such generosity looks like a triumph of hope over experience. The security situation is dire in many areas, Afghan government in Kabul is weak and official corruption is endemic.</p> <p> Violence against women continues despite strenuous efforts to counter it. More than 5,000 cases \u2013 including 241 murders \u2013 were reported in the first half of this year. Opium production is up again. Afghan refugees continue to head for Europe in large numbers. The conflict further destabilises Pakistan.</p> <p> Nato\u2019s fond hope that the much-trained Afghan army and police would effectively replace western troops and provide adequate security has proved illusory. According to US estimates, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/afghan-army-taliban-us-troop-withdrawal \">the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001</a>. So far in 2016, nearly 2,500 civilians have died, the UN says. Many were killed by government forces. <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55334#.WBCiFOErKu7\">Child casualties are up 15%.</a></p> <p> Whatever Clinton and Trump may think, Afghanistan is not a problem they can duck for long.</p>",

Even liberal second amendment experts have called some of Clinton\u2019s explanations of her position \u201codd\u201d.</p> <p>As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she opposes Roe v Wade.</p> <p>At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which overturned Washington DC\u2019s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a law that required other guns in homes to be \u201ckept nonfunctional\u201d.</p> <p>In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense.<br></p> <p>Clinton had <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&amp;page=1\">dodged giving a clear answer</a> about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional.

The Clinton campaign has the candidate and surrogates arrayed across Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio today while the Trump campaign is in ... <strong>Washington DC and Utah</strong>? </p> <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> is attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony today at his <strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/opinion/donald-trumps-shiny-new-washington-hotel.html?_r=0\">eerily</a> <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trumps-d-c-hotel-shows-as-poll-sink-so-does-his-brand.html\">empty</a> new hotel</strong> in the nation\u2019s capital. He has two later events in North Carolina. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/790686778986422272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DC does have three electoral votes <a href=\"https://t.co/3DRKa6yJYM\">https://t.co/3DRKa6yJYM</a></p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/790686778986422272\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Trump running mate <strong>Mike Pence</strong>, meanwhile, will be covering serious ground, with events in three western states: Nevada, Utah and Colorado. Pence\u2019s stop in Utah is sure to have people talking, as the state usually is at the top of the rankings of states voting Republican. Mormon aversion to Trump and the independent candidacy of Evan McMullin have changed the calculus this time around. </p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> has two rallies in Florida today, one in Palm Beach County in the south-east and one in Hillsborough County on the Gulf coast. <strong>Tim Kaine</strong> has two events in Pennsylvania, while <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> is diligently trying to put his wife over the top in North Carolina, with three stops there today after three stops there yesterday. <strong>Chelsea Clinton</strong> has three stops in Ohio, while senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has an event in Pittsburgh.</p> <h2>Trump with narrow Florida edge \u2013 Selzer poll</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/florida-poll\">A poll of likely voters</a> in Florida by gold-star pollster J Ann Selzer for Bloomberg politics has Trump slightly ahead of Clinton in the state, 45-43, when third-party candidates are included. That\u2019s within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Trump had 46% to Clinton\u2019s 45% in a head-to-head matchup. Clinton has a three-point lead in polling averages of the state. </p> <h2>Trump wants Biden behind barn</h2> <p>The campaign action overnight was typically nasty and nausea-inducing, with Trump saying that yes, he would like to go in back of the barn with Biden (Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/21/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-campaign-2016\">had said gym</a>), and campaign surrogate Newt Gingrich accusing Fox News host Megyn Kelly of having a \u201cfascination with sex\u201d because she takes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">women who say Donald Trump violated them</a> seriously.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/599d2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2841266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump says he would love to beat up 'Mr Tough Guy' Joe Biden \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581013e6e4b0219a00d38b1c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\">Trump says he would love to beat up \u2018Mr Tough Guy\u2019 Joe Biden</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p></p> <p>The row on Tuesday night between Kelly and one of Trump\u2019s most stalwart supporters began when the host brought up the multiple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">sexual assault and misconduct allegations</a> against the candidate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMlC0-Ut8Ng\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oMlC0-Ut8Ng?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>During the ensuing debate, which bordered on personal attack, Gingrich said the host was \u201cfascinated with sex\u201d and Kelly urged him to \u201ctake your anger issues and spend some time working on them\u201d.</p> <p>Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s director of social media, later responded on Twitter, saying Kelly had \u201cmade a total fool out of herself\u201d and warning: \u201cWatch what happens to her after this election is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/791095922709200897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/megynkelly\">@MegynKelly</a> made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>.
