  "<p><br><br>As Hillary Clinton addressed a crowd of students gathered inside a cavernous university hall, she neither pretended to be someone they would instinctively relate to nor did she rely on pop culture references that might resonate with young voters.</p> <p>Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton-new-york-new-jersey-attacks-trump-muslims\">Democratic presidential nominee</a> delivered a straight and impassioned pitch to the most racially diverse generation in US history, imploring them to fully grasp the choice before them this November.</p> <p>Standing between two signs bearing the words \u201cLove trumps hate\u201d, which has emerged as a slogan for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/donald-trump-arizona-latino-voters-democrats\">her campaign</a>, Clinton said it was imperative for voters to send a message that \u201cAmerica is better than Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton-new-york-new-jersey-attacks-trump-muslims\">Hillary Clinton: Trump's rhetoric about terrorist attacks 'gives Isis what it wants'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\u201d she said before the roughly 300 voters who had gathered at Temple University in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on.\u201d</p> <p>While the central themes of Clinton\u2019s stump speech were mostly met with polite applause, it was the urgency of her appeal against Trump\u2019s racial divisiveness that brought the crowd to its feet. It is the hope of Clinton\u2019s campaign that, in addition to her platform on issues such as college affordability, equal pay and the environment, the former secretary of state can persuade young voters to view this election as a binary choice on core values and inclusivity.</p> <p>Polling has shown young voters are far more likely to reject the premise \u2013 pushed in particular by Trump and the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d conservative movement \u2013 that a more racially inclusive outlook is akin to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. They are also more embracing of immigrants and have been turned off by Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Latinos, Muslims and other minorities.</p> <p>Even so, Clinton has struggled to capture the support of the young Americans who have reliably voted Democratic in recent cycles and helped propel Barack Obama to victory in both 2008 and 2012. </p> <p>Monday\u2019s event, part of a broader effort by the Clinton campaign to target millennial voters, was an acknowledgment that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein, who are attracting support from a third of voters under the age of 30, could imperil Clinton\u2019s hold over a critical voting bloc.</p> <p>Clinton made it clear she was under no illusion that young voters were entirely satisfied with her as an alternative to Trump, while nodding to her discomfort with the \u201cpublic part\u201d of public service. </p> <p>\u201cI also know that even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you still may have some questions about me. I get that,\u201d she said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/donald-trump-arizona-latino-voters-democrats\">As Trump slips into red with Latinos, Democrats hope to turn Arizona blue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI will never be the showman my opponent is, and you know what? That\u2019s OK with me.\u201d</p> <p>She asked of them, however, to \u201cgive us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us.\u201d</p> <p>With a significant faction of young voters still up for grabs, Clinton\u2019s campaign dispatched some of its most popular surrogates to woo them over the past week. First lady Michelle Obama, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Clinton\u2019s former primary opponent Bernie Sanders all stumped on college campuses, while the campaign and its allies launched both television and digital advertising aimed at galvanizing millennials. </p> <p>Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton campaign, said the campaign was aware of the task at hand. But he added that it was \u201ca distortion\u201d of the data to compare Clinton numbers among young voters with those of Obama, since the president\u2019s support was being gauged from exit polling \u2013 in other words, those who turned up to cast their ballot for his re-election as opposed to how many young voters supported him with two months still remaining.</p> <p>\u201cBy some measures, we\u2019re ahead of where President Obama was in 2012,\u201d Fallon told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes on in the last seven weeks.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/politics-for-humans-guardian-us/its-millennial-week-in-election-season-politics-for-humans-podcast\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F283806286&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cElection Day is what counts, and we think we\u2019ll be successful among young voters. But we have to work for them.\u201d</p> <p>With recent surveys showing Trump closing in on her lead, Clinton called on young voters who might be complacent or disillusioned to understand the influence of their vote.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNot voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump\u2019s hands.\u201d</p> <p>Rahul Ramesh, a sophomore who attended Clinton\u2019s speech, referred to himself as one of the \u201csideline voters\u201d she mentioned. But the first-time voter confessed to being moved by what he heard.</p> <p>\u201cAfter today, it\u2019s changed my perspective and I think it might make me go vote for Hillary,\u201d Ramesh said. \u201cSeeing how grounded she was was the most impressive thing to me. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is more of a celebrity seeking the limelight. Trump would definitely ruin the public image of America and America won\u2019t be seen as that country that everyone yearns to come to.\u201d</p> <p>Ariel Epstein, a sophomore at the nearby University of Pennsylvania, did not require convincing. Having already cast her vote for Clinton in the primary, she came away instead with a renewed purpose of mobilizing her friends and classmates to register to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely worried because a lot of people our age are Bernie-or-busters,\u201d she said, citing the Vermont senator\u2019s overwhelming support among young voters during the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cBeing here today made me more determined. You can just see the divide between her and Trump \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous that they\u2019re even being considered on the same playing field.\u201d</p> <p>Invoking her own story from when she was in college, Clinton recalled grappling with the same frustration toward the political system during the Vietnam war. </p> <p>\u201cIt can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing\u2019s ever going to change,\u201d she told those who might be skeptical of a seasoned politician such as herself. \u201cBut you\u2019re here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years.\u201d</p>",

Let him come home'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They joined many of his other detractors in making old and factually incorrect arguments about what Snowden actually did. As the movement demanding his exoneration grows nonetheless, here are five common misconceptions about the whistleblower \u2013 and why they are wrong. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden did not take 1.5m documents and dump them en masse on the internet </strong></h2> <p>Snowden critics love to pretend that everything the public learned from his disclosures was solely because he chose to release the information. In reality, the number of documents that Snowden published himself is zero. Instead of dumping a mass of documents on the internet, he gave them to experienced national security reporters who worked at some of the most respected news outlets in the country. He relied on their judgments about what was in the public interest. And those reporters allowed the government to make objections (some of which they listened to) tied to national security concerns. </p> <p>The Washington Post claimed, as others have in the past, that Snowden copied and kept 1.5m classified documents. Snowden\u2019s lawyer, Ben Wizner, has called that number \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/777885903024975873\">absurd</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/777899804076670976\">made up</a>\u201d. Even the former NSA director himself admitted that the 1.5m number only represented the documents that Snowden \u201ctouched\u201d, and officials didn\u2019t know how many he actually took.</p> <p>The real number is likely at least an order of magnitude lower, according to public comments by the journalists involved, which the Post editorial board could have found out if they had bothered to ask their own colleagues.</p> <h2><strong>There\u2019s no evidence Snowden \u2018harmed national security\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The House intelligence committee published an error-riddled report on Snowden last week, making vague claims about \u201cdamage\u201d to national security in a naked attempt to counter the narrative in Oliver Stone\u2019s movie. Three-time Pulitzer prize winner Barton Gellman <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/commentary/house-intelligence-committees-terrible-horrible-bad-snowden-report/\">dismantled the whole report point-by-point</a> on his blog.</p> <p>We know the US government makes all sorts of dire predictions when information is leaked to the press (the Pentagon Papers, the Chelsea Manning disclosures and the release of the torture report, to name a few cases), and it is always caught exaggerating. The Snowden disclosures are no exception. As the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131224/01373925683/james-clapper-admits-private-that-hes-really-not-too-concerned-about-terrorists-changing-communications-after-snowden.shtml\">reported two years ago</a>:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <p>[Director of national intelligence James] Clapper has said repeatedly in public that the leaks did great damage, but in private he has taken a more nuanced stance. A review of early damage assessments in previous espionage cases, he said in one closed-door briefing this fall, found that dire forecasts of harm were seldom borne out. </p> </blockquote> <p>The House intelligence committee did not point to a single concrete example of how national security was harmed solely by the Snowden disclosures. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden could not go through \u2018proper channels\u2019 to blow the whistle </strong></h2> <p>The idea that Snowden is not a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d because he didn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/29/nsa-email-snowden-surveillance-internal-whistleblowing\">go through</a> internal government channels to make his claims is absurd on two fronts. First, at the time Snowden gave his material to the Guardian and Washington Post, he was a government contractor, and contractors were exempt from most whistleblower protections given to national security employees. (Politifact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-nsa-leaker-snowden-failed-use-whistle/\">called Hillary Clinton\u2019s statement</a> that he had access to whistleblower protections \u201cmostly false\u201d.)</p> <p>But this argument is a red herring anyway. Snowden was not blowing the whistle on some rogue NSA agent or a program that only a handful of people knew about. These mass surveillance programs (later ruled illegal) were approved at the highest levels of the executive branch and by the Fisa court. Snowden would have essentially been telling his superiors, who already knew about them and were tasked with carrying them out, that they themselves were breaking the law. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden did not \u2018flee\u2019 to Russia and has regularly criticized Russia\u2019s human rights record</strong></h2> <p>There is a persistent yet false accusation that since Snowden is in exile in Russia, he \u201cfled\u201d there and has cooperated with the Russian government (in the words of the Post\u2019s editorial, \u201cMr Snowden hurt his own credibility as an avatar of freedom by accepting <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/snowden-leaves-moscow-airport-to-live-in-russia/2013/08/01/2f2d1aba-faa9-11e2-a369-d1954abcb7e3_story.html\">asylum</a> from Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin\u201d). </p> <p>This is false. The only reason he is in Russia is because the US government canceled his passport as he was transiting through the Russian airport to Latin America. He was marooned there against his will. Everyone, including Snowden himself, wishes he wasn\u2019t in Russia, but the alternative is being thrown in a maximum security prison in the United States. At least right now he is <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/edward-snowden-life-as-a-robot.html\">free to participate in the international debate virtually</a>. </p> <p>Snowden has harshly criticized Russia\u2019s human rights and civil liberties record so many times at this point that it is hard to count (including, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/18/vladimir-putin-surveillance-us-leaders-snowden\">in an op-ed for the Guardian</a>). Snowden\u2019s condemnation has been so strong that the former US ambassador to Russia (and Snowden critic) Michael McFaul recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/751752731769999360\">tweeted</a>: \u201c@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden\">Snowden</a> makes a stronger statement about human rights regression in Russia than anything I ever said as [Ambassador]. Wow.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>He cannot make his case to a jury in what the Post called the \u2018best tradition of civil disobedience\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a perfect world, Snowden could come home and tell his story to a jury, as many of his critics say he should. However, this belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the law Snowden is charged under. The Espionage Act \u2013 a first world war-era statute meant for spies, not whistleblowers who give information to the press \u2013 does not allow for a \u201cpublic interest\u201d defense. Snowden would literally not be allowed to tell the jury his motive for leaking the information, describe the benefits of the disclosures, or discuss their lack of harm to national security. <br></p> <p>The most famous whistleblower in American history, Daniel Ellsberg, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/daniel-ellsberg-snowden-fair-trial-kerry-espionage-act\">made this point</a> repeatedly and is on the record as saying that Snowden was right to leave the country so he could continue to participate in the public debate around his disclosures. </p> <p><em>Edward Snowden sits on the board of directors at Freedom of the Press Foundation, where the author is executive director </em></p>",
  "<p>An explosion on the streets of Manhattan, pipe bombs in New Jersey, and a shootout with a terrorist suspect: a jittery election, filled with hyperbole, just grew more breathless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-suspect-ahmad-khan-rahami\">Suspect in New York bombing arrested after shootout with police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course most of that hype has emerged from the mouth of Donald Trump, and he embraced the emergence of a new terror campaign well before officials confirmed Saturday\u2019s explosion as a bomb.</p> <p>Whether this helps or hurts Trump\u2019s candidacy depends a lot on whether you are already primed for the politics of fear. If Trump and Clinton sound like they\u2019re talking to two different audiences, that\u2019s because the polls suggest they really are.</p> <p>The United States is deeply divided not just about how to respond to terrorism, but about how serious the terrorist threat is.</p> <p>Recent surveys have underscored the wide gap in perceptions between Republicans on one side, and Democrats and independents on the other.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/09/07/15-years-after-911-a-sharp-partisan-divide-on-ability-of-terrorists-to-strike-u-s/\">recent study by the Pew Research Center</a>, 58% of Republicans think that terrorists are more capable of attacking the United States than they were on 9/11. That is 24 points higher than independents and 27 points higher than Democrats.</p> <p>Over the last three years, independents and Democrats have barely changed their views on the prospect of terrorist attacks on the homeland. In contrast, Republicans have become sharply more concerned, up 18 points in the same period.</p> <p>The big question about this increase is not whether it\u2019s justified; it plainly isn\u2019t. None of the terrorist attacks across the world since 9/11 have come close to the mass murders perpetrated on that day.</p> <p>What has changed, however, is the Republican rhetoric about American weakness under President Obama. In this regard, Donald Trump is no different from the other dozen candidates he beat in the GOP primaries.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the leadership of Obama and Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter on Monday. \u201cTime to change the playbook!\u201d</p> <p>How you react to this depends on what you consider attacks at home or victories abroad. As Trump himself has pointed out, the 9/11 attacks were on President Bush\u2019s watch: an observation that outraged the GOP foreign policy establishment. As for a victory abroad, Trump\u2019s definition of success includes trade wars, travel bans, mass deportations and giant border construction.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s real skill is the politics of excess. Where other officials consider the policy implications of their words, Trump lives and dies through the power to shock \u2013 not the power to scare.</p> <p>Fifteen years after 9/11, and a decade into our mass experiment with social media, we may be numbed to fear. On the streets of Manhattan on Monday, there were no signs of New Yorkers changing their daily habits as they did for months after the Twin Towers fell.</p> <p>But the power to shock lingers precisely because it is so hard to break through the digital noise of social media. Trump\u2019s willingness to say things that are excessive, unjustified and outrageous enables him to.</p> <p>He lacks the self-restraint of an elected official who may be held responsible for his performance. Like the current occupant of the Oval Office, for instance. Speaking to reporters in New York on Monday, President Obama urged the media to be responsible. \u201cIt does not help if false reports or incomplete information is out there,\u201d he noted pointedly. \u201cSo try to, as much as possible, stick to what our investigators say, because they actually know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>As an attack on the press, this is mild by Donald Trump\u2019s standards. Then again, Trump has no desire to calm public fears in any situation.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s press advice teed up a bigger argument: that stoking fear was precisely what terrorists were trying to accomplish. \u201cEven as we have to be vigilant and aggressive, both in preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice, we all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don\u2019t succumb to that fear,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cBy showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not, and never will, give in to fear, that\u2019s going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry out terrorist acts against us.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s safe to say this is not a worldview shared by Donald Trump, who tweeted out loud about how many hidden terrorists might be lurking in our midst.</p> <p>\u201cOnce again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country &amp; its people \u2013 how did he get thru system?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/777910435425226753\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>He was referring to Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect detained on Monday, who was a naturalized US citizen.</p> <p>Unexpected events normally provide the most revealing moments in a presidential campaign. And there are few things more unexpected than an actual terrorist attack, no matter the number of casualties or the number of foiled bombs.</p> <p>So far voters have favored Hillary Clinton\u2019s response to terrorism over Donald Trump\u2019s. According to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html\">recent poll for the New York Times and CBS News</a>, 49% of voters think Clinton would do a better job on terrorism and national security, a four-point lead over Trump. By a 22-point margin, Clinton is favored over Trump to handle foreign policy. Whether that lead can be sustained in the immediate aftermath of a real-life bomb remains to be seen. </p> <p>Clinton indulged in her own hyperbole on Monday by focusing on Trump\u2019s reaction to the weekend bombs. She called Trump a \u201crecruiting sergeant for the terrorists\u201d by supporting the terrorists\u2019 notion of a war with Islam, rather than a war with jihadis. \u201cThe kinds of rhetoric and language Mr Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,\u201d she told reporters.</p> <p>This presidential campaign has now entered the final, fevered stages of the cycle. A week out from the first debate, questions of temperament and terrorism are likely to dominate the next several days, if not weeks.</p> <p>Like everything else in this contest, the cooler heads are unlikely to prevail. Even when they favor better policy.</p>",

Bridget Kelly, the governor\u2019s then deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy head of the Port Authority which controlled the bridge, are charged with instigating lane closures in September 2013 as an act of political spite against Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee that sits in the shadow of the GWB. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/bridgegate-trial-chris-christies-new-jersey-donald-trump\">Bridgegate trial and Chris Christie's role could mean more trouble for Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though Christie himself has not been charged, how much he knew about any nefarious intent behind the gridlock is the elephant in the courtroom.

The findings also show that the gender gap in gun ownership is closing, with American women making up a larger proportion of gun owners as male gun ownership declines.</p> <p>The number of women who enroll each year in the NRA\u2019s basic pistol course almost doubled from 2011 to 2014, from about 25,000 a year to nearly 46,000 a year, according to NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <h2>Demographics</h2> <p>Overall, the survey found, gun owners tended to be white, male, conservative, and live in rural areas. Thirty per cent of conservatives said they were gun owners, compared with 19% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/05/hillary-clinton-nra-gun-control\">moderates</a> and only 14% of liberals. The strongest predictor of gun ownership was military service. 44% of veterans said they owned a firearm. </p> <p>Clear racial disparities in overall gun ownership remained, with 25% of white and multi-racial Americans saying they personally owned a gun, compared with 16% of Hispanics and 14% of African Americans.</p> <p>But there was essentially no disparity in gun ownership based on income level for Americans who make between $25,000 and more than $100,000 a year. Americans who made less than $25,000 a year were less likely to own guns.</p> <p>The survey found that Americans who only owned handguns were much more diverse than gun owners who owned a mix of handguns and long guns, or those who only owned rifles and shotguns. Those in the \u201chandguns only\u201d group were more likely to be female, non-white, and live in a urban area, and less likely to have grown up in a house with a gun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/gun-owner-heatmap/\" data-alt=\"Demographic characteristics of gun owners\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/gun-owner-heatmap/\">Demographic characteristics of gun owners</a> <figcaption>Demographic characteristics of gun owners</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roughly 44% of black gun owners and 37% of Hispanic gun owners said they only owned handguns, compared with 21% of non-Hispanic whites.</p> <p>Cook, the Duke firearms researcher, said the demographic data on handgun-only owners was one of the most interesting findings of the study. But he said it was \u201ckind of worrying\u201d that women who had no previous experience with guns were buying handguns for self-defense, and that he was concerned \u201cthat puts them at greater risk\u201d for gun accidents or thefts.</p> <p>The demographics of America\u2019s 7.7 million gun super-owners were less diverse than gun owners overall, with super-owners more likely to be male, less likely to be black or Hispanic, and more likely to own a gun for protection, researchers said. This subset of gun enthusiasts \u2013 only 14% of all gun owners \u2013 has amassed a collective 133m firearms.</p> <p>Interviews with Americans who own at least 17 firearms revealed a wide range of reasons for accumulating so many guns. </p> <p>Some super-owners are dedicated collectors with special rooms to display their assortment of historic firearms. Others are firearms instructors, gunsmiths, or competitive shooters, who need a variety of firearms in the course of work or competition. Some gun owners have a survivalist streak, and believe in storing up weapons, as well as food and water, in case of a disaster scenario. Others simply picked up a handgun here, a shotgun or hunting rifle there, and somehow ended up with dozens. </p> <p>\u201cWhy do you need more than one pair of shoes?\u201d said Philip van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group that views itself as being to the political right of the NRA. \u201cThe truth is, you don\u2019t, but do you want more than one pair of shoes? If you going hiking, you don\u2019t want to use that one pair of high heels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWalking around the beach with shirt off and shorts \u2026 I\u2019m probably going to use a different gun than putting on a sport coat and going out to dinner,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Membership ask\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

Many gun rights advocates are fiercely private about gun ownership. </p> <p>After Sandy Hook, when a local newspaper in New York state published an interactive map with the names and addresses of gun permit owners \u2013 a matter of public record \u2013 gun owners reacted with outrage, reporters and editors received threats, and the paper reportedly hired armed security guards in response. New York state swiftly passed a law protecting the privacy of gun permit holders. Two other local papers in North Carolina and Maine were later inundated with threats after merely requesting public records of gun ownership, though they said they were not planning to publish the names of individual owners. Both papers dropped their requests, and the editor of one of the papers resigned.</p> <p>The Harvard/Northeastern study is based on a survey of nearly 4,000 Americans conducted online in 2015 by a market research company, GfK, with a nationally representative <a href=\"http://join.knpanel.com/\">panel of opt-in participants</a> who are compensated to complete surveys on a variety of issues.</p> <p>Van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizen\u2019s Defense League, said he was very skeptical of the accuracy of phone surveys of gun ownership, since he believes many gun owners might not feel comfortable telling a stranger on the phone whether they are a gun owner or how many guns they own. He said his \u201cgut feeling\u201d was that gun owners might be a little more comfortable answering questions honestly in an anonymous online survey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ae2224fcd50b32c0cc14916fbab86024a67cacc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ae2224fcd50b32c0cc14916fbab86024a67cacc/0_20_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gun enthusiasts look over Smith &amp; Wesson pistols at the NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gun enthusiasts look over Smith &amp; Wesson pistols at the NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits in May.

It felt that we were talking about a regular consumer product.\u201d</p> <p>The new survey results mirror the trends of the annual General Social Survey, which found that household gun ownership has fallen from 50% to close to 31% since the late 1970s, and that individual gun ownership fell from 28% in 1980 to 22% in 2014. </p> <p>But as with most aspects of American gun politics, the basic data on American gun ownership is hotly debated, with some gun rights supporters arguing that American gun ownership is not on the decline, and that Americans may be under-reporting their gun ownership in some surveys.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> last year estimated personal gun ownership at 28%, while a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/26/opinions-on-gun-policy-and-the-2016-campaign/\">Pew Research Center</a> survey put it at 31%, which would make the estimated total of American gun owners more than 75 million, compared with 55 million in the Harvard/Northeastern study.</p> <p></p> <p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tracks the numbers of firearms manufactured in or imported into the United States, as well as how many background checks on gun sales licensed firearm dealers process. </p> <p>Manufacturing and import records suggest that more than 360m firearms entered the US market between 1899 and 2013, the new study\u2019s authors noted. With gun sales spiking since 2013, some estimates would put the total number of American firearms today around 400m. </p> <p>However, it\u2019s not clear how many American guns have been broken, confiscated and destroyed by the police, smuggled out of the country, or otherwise left the gun stock over the decades. </p> <p>The full results of the Harvard/Northeastern gun ownership study are undergoing peer review and are slated to be published in the autumn of 2017 by the Russell Sage Foundation. While the full peer review is not complete, Azrael said, the current results have gone through an initial round of comments and revisions from a group of leading firearms researchers. </p> <p>The National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the initial findings of the survey. </p> <p>Mike Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry\u2019s trade association, said he would have to defer full comment until he could read the entire survey and its methodology. </p> <p>But he questioned why some results of the survey were being released before the full paper was published, and said some of the results sounded implausible. </p> <p>\u201cReally? Three per cent of American gun owners own half the guns? That seems wildly off the mark. On the surface, this survey sounds like part of the ongoing effort to minimize gun ownership to make more gun control seem politically achievable,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. </p> <p>But Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist and firearms researcher, said the concentration of most guns in the hands of a relatively small proportion of gun owners was \u201cold news\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably true for just about any consumer good,\u201d he said. </p> <ul> <li>Support the Guardian\u2019s independent journalism by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/home?INTCMP=co_us_article_lois_footer\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/us/supporter?INTCMP=co_us_article_lois_footer\">becoming a member</a></li> </ul>",
  "<p><br> Donald Trump has upset Sir Cameron Mackintosh and co-creators of the stage musical Les Mis\u00e9rables for playing one of their songs at his Miami rally.</p> <p>Mackintosh, a leading British theatre impresario, is to make his objection felt in a joint statement with Alain Boublil, the musical\u2019s librettist and others who own the copyright. </p> <p>A copy released to the Guardian said: \u201cThe authors of Les Mis\u00e9rables were not asked for permission and did not authorise or endorse usage of Do You Hear the People Sing? at last [week\u2019s] Trump rally in Miami, and have never done so for any of the songs from the musical for this or any other political event.\u201d</p> <p>Les Mis\u00e9rables has broken box office records worldwide, seen by more than 70 million people in 44 countries. It is a story of \u201cbroken dreams and unrequited love, passion, sacrifice and redemption\u201d, with songs that include I Dreamed A Dream. In Miami, the Republican presidential nominee took the stage as Do You Hear the People Sing? blasted through the loudspeakers.</p> <p>Mackintosh\u2019s statement said: \u201cAs the musical\u2019s popularity and universal message have been part of international popular culture for more than 30 years now, countless political and social movements around the world, including the first Bill Clinton and Obama campaigns, have independently embraced songs from the musical as a rallying cry for their own cause.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has upset musicians before. In May, he faced <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/04/rolling-stones-donald-trump-songs-campaign-events\">demands by the Rolling Stones to stop playing their music at his campaign events</a>. Earlier, he faced criticism from Neil Young for using his Rockin\u2019 in the Free World. Whether Mackintosh takes legal action remains to be seen.</p> <p>The intellectual property lawyer Mark Stephens of Howard Kennedy, said politicians were supposed to clear the use of songs. Sometimes permission was obtained without disclosing it was for a political purpose and there could be a question about whether Trump\u2019s campaign said it would be used at a rally, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s where political parties very often come unstuck,\u201d Stephens said.</p> <p>Asked whether Mackintosh could potentially have a legal case against Trump, he said: \u201cAssuming that there wasn\u2019t a fully disclosed, informed consent given, then he can sue for infringement of copyright.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Trump is among numerous politicians who have upset musicians. Bruce Springsteen objected to Ronald Reagan\u2019s attempt to use Born in the USA as a backdrop for his re-election in 1984, and Mick Fleetwood has said that Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign never sought permission for his 1992 campaign anthem, Don\u2019t Stop.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, there is harmony between musicians and politicians. The Northern Irish group D:Ream approved Tony Blair\u2019s use of Things Can Only Get Better during the Labour party\u2019s 1997 campaign.</p>",

Long and short, that means debt relief and putting discussion of it on the table. To get there Athens needs to complete the current round of prior actions, or milestone reforms, it failed to deal with over the summer. Upon them not only rests the next installment of bailout aid \u2013 at \u20ac2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the eurozone. \u201cThe idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through parliament this week,\u201d said one well-placed source.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f/0_133_3979_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the country\u2019s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously with creditors \u2013 and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public entities in the body. </p> <p>With Greece\u2019s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so the Euro Working Group can agree to disburse the aid when it next meets on September 29. If that goal is achieved, the hope is the next bailout review will begin on October 17 \u2013 and with it the much anticipated issue of debt forgiveness. </p> <p>Addressing his Syriza party\u2019s central committee over the weekend, prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted \u201cthere will be developments on the debt issue soon.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

  "<p>In Italy politicians are even more despised than elsewhere, but Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, president of the republic from 1999 to 2006, was one of the few who escaped opprobrium. When he died at the age of 95, the praise was near-universal. Supporters of the former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a> joined hands with those of the centre-left in celebrating an honest, sincere and self-effacing man who exuded integrity.</p> <p>The only discordant note came from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/donald-trump-gets-my-backing-says-italys-matteo-salvini\">Matteo Salvini</a>, the leader of the xenophobic Northern League, <a href=\"http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2016/09/16/former-president-ciampi-dies-at-95_2f0b110c-4159-49c4-bcf8-497aae2d504a.html\">who declared that Ciampi had been, \u201cpolitically speaking\u201d, a \u201ctraitor\u201d</a>. Few were surprised: Salvini is given to hyperbolic pronouncements, having last year announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/01/northern-league-gains-italian-elections-matteo-salvini\">the euro was a crime against humanity</a>.</p> <p>The consensus around Ciampi had been evident when he was elected head of state by members of parliament and representatives from the regions, winning in the first round with 70% of the vote. Why Ciampi? Probably because he was not a regular politician. He had not spent the best part of his life wheeling and dealing nor (like Berlusconi) had he entered politics thanks to a media empire and the vacuum created by the collapse of the party system after the political scandals of 1991-92 known as <em>Tangentopoli</em> (Bribesville).</p> <p>Born in Livorno, on the coast of Tuscany, Carlo was the son of middle-class parents, Pietro Ciampi, an optician, and his wife, Marie (nee Masino). Carlo had a Jesuit education till the age of 18, then entered the Scuola Normale of Pisa and graduated in classics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/former-italian-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-at-95\">Former Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies at 95</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the second world war he was drafted and sent to fight in Albania. After King Victor Emmanuel III ditched Mussolini and switched to the allies, Ciampi joined the resistance.</p> <p>In Pisa he had met Franca Pilla, and in 1946 they married. She convinced him to abandon his idea of becoming a high school teacher and to take the examination for the Bank of Italy. He passed and by 1960 was in Rome in the bank\u2019s research department, the Servizio Studi. In those years the ruling Christian Democrats \u201ccolonised\u201d much of the state machine, but the bank remained fiercely independent. By 1970 Ciampi was in charge of the Servizio Studi, and in 1979 was appointed the bank\u2019s governor, a position he held for 14 years.</p> <p>Those were difficult years for Italy. Its inflation rate was formidable even by the standards of the time: 14.8% in 1979, 21.2% in 1980. That year, under Ciampi\u2019s leadership, the bank \u201cdivorced\u201d from the treasury, with the enthusiastic acquiescence of Beniamino Andreatta, the then treasury minister, a progressive Christian Democrat. It was thus no longer forced to buy unsold treasury bonds, the equivalent of creating money to pay the state\u2019s debts. This was largely symbolic \u2013 inflation decreased mainly because of international factors.</p> <p>By 1991 Italy was in turmoil. The <em>Tangentopoli</em> scandals destroyed the Italian Socialist and Christian Democratic parties, the latter of which had dominated Italian politics for decades. The Communist party, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, changed its name. In 1993 Ciampi was asked to become prime minister, unelected, to lead a government of experts to see Italy through a tumultuous period, when no party had a majority. He was the kind of person who, precisely because he had no political ambition, could be trusted by politicians who could not trust each other. He entered politics at the age of 73, the first government leader not to be a member of parliament. During his year-long tenure he started to privatise Italy\u2019s large public sector, and abolished the automatic indexation of wages to inflation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac7ef3f1ca3f897a12fa6019b1e4a2235b9db29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac7ef3f1ca3f897a12fa6019b1e4a2235b9db29e/0_140_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, left, with Silvio Berlusconi, in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, left, with Silvio Berlusconi, in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giulio Napolitano/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1994 Berlusconi won the election and a new era began. But Ciampi continued to serve: in the centre-left governments of Romano Prodi and Massimo D\u2019Alema (1996-99) he was the treasury minister and fought consistently to bring Italy into the euro, convinced that no government should be able to use devaluation to fix systemic problems. He ensured that Italy met the Maastricht criteria, thus paving the way for its entry into the single currency. This was celebrated by all shades of the political spectrum. In today\u2019s climate critics of this operation abound, but at the time there was jubilation and Ciampi was acclaimed as a national hero, which led to his virtually uncontested election as the republic\u2019s 10th president.</p> <p>He took his role seriously, exploiting what some called his \u201cpassive charisma\u201d. Like some other holders of the office, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/26/obituaries/sandro-pertini-italian-president-with-common-touch-dies-at-93.html\">Sandro Pertini</a> (1978-85), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/29/oscar-luigi-scalfaro\">Oscar Luigi Scalfaro</a> (1992-99) and his successor, the former communist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/14/italian-president-giorgio-napolitano-steps-down\">Giorgio Napolitano</a> (2006-15), he rose above factionalism to promote a patriotic \u201clove of country\u201d in a land where the national pastime is to whinge about it. He talked about the glories of Italian history not in a jingoistic way but as if to say that the country should not be reduced to the bizarre behaviour of some of its politicians.</p> <p>He was not entirely successful. In 2010, as Italy prepared to commemorate the 150th anniversary of its unification, he published a book-interview called, significantly, and melancholically, <em>Non \u00e8 il paese che sognavo</em> (It is not the country of which I dreamed). The country of culture, of the Renaissance, the Risorgimento and the resistance, he mused, a country which even achieved membership of the euro against all the odds is also a country devoid of ideals and ethical principles, prey to secessionist temptation, to conflicts of interest, and plagued by scandals.</p> <p>He is survived by Franca and his children, Claudio and Gabriella.</p> <p>\u2022 Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, politician and central banker, born 9 December 1920; died 16 September 2016</p>",
  "<p>Is coming into work when you\u2019re so sick that you\u2019re on the verge of collapse really something we should be praising, or encouraging? When Hillary Clinton announced last week that she was trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-campaign-regret-911-trump\" title=\"\">work through a pneumonia diagnosis</a> and continue her campaign schedule, her supporters were quick to use this as an opportunity to praise her strength of character.

I suspect at one time or another we\u2019ve all uttered the words \u201cdon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing serious\u201d, or struggled in only to be greeted by a concerned colleague who politely asked us to go home and stop sneezing on them.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s guilt about letting down the team, concern your tasks won\u2019t get covered or more likely some fear that it might be counted against you, the trend for employees to come into work or to work longer hours when they should be taking time off has been growing.</p> <p>Research by Simplyhealth and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), where I work as chief executive, shows \u201cpresenteeism\u201d is on the rise. Our <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/research/absence-management-survey.aspx\" title=\"\">2015 survey</a> showed that in the preceding 12 months, a third of firms reported a rise in employees working when they\u2019re sick, and this has some pretty clear negative effects on employee wellbeing. Organisations that have noticed an increase in presenteeism are nearly twice as likely to report an increase in stress-related absence and more than twice as likely to report an increase in mental health problems among their staff too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/537dd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2721721\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton, back on the campaign trail: \u2018I'm doing great\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57daf05de4b067ad300881c3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915Clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915Clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915Clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia-video\">Hillary Clinton, back on the campaign trail: \u2018I\u2019m doing great\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Greater uncertainty in the economy and regarding jobs in recent years, together with an increasingly \u201calways on\u201d working environment and the pressure to perform are all factors driving this trend. Many of the companies and employees we talk to cite job insecurity as a reason for increased presenteeism, with employees fearing that a competitive job market, and the growth of automation, will make them more replaceable.</p> <p>But leaders and managers set the tone, and have a responsibility not just to their organisation but also to the wellbeing of their employees. As our research shows, increasing presenteeism leads to increased prevalence of stress, and there is a wealth of evidence, such as the Towers Watson <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/Towers-Watson-Insider-Workers-Still-Uneasy-About-Financial.pdf\" title=\"\">2014 Global Benefits Attitudes survey</a>, which clearly shows that workplace stress leads to less productive employees.</p> <p>So why, then, do more than half of all organisations admit that they aren\u2019t doing anything to combat this growing problem? It may well be that they believe that promoting long-term employee wellbeing might come at the expense of the short-term success of an organisation, but it can also be a lack of awareness of the growth of a corporate culture that accepts or even encourages presenteeism.</p> <p>To perform at our best, people need to be well both physically and mentally. If businesses want employees who are engaged and motivated, then employees need to feel that their organisation, their managers and bosses are supporting them, and not pressuring them to work when they are not properly fit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/zero-hours-contracts-used-far-beyond-short-term-work-research-says\">Zero-hours contracts used far beyond short-term work, research says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How do we change this culture? It has to come from the top down. Employees won\u2019t feel empowered to take time off when they\u2019re sick if their manager\u2019s behaviour runs counter to that. The second action businesses can take is to build a culture that emphasises healthy living.</p> <p>Health should be promoted in the workplace, with people given the opportunity to learn more about their own health, to exercise and eat well within the workplace and beyond. At the CIPD, we host discounted zumba and yoga classes each week. TransferWise takes all its staff on annual company holidays, while the law firm Allen &amp; Overy has GPs and dentists on site. Those are at the more expensive end of the scale, but even simple things like free fruit for staff, a perk offered by just 15% of employers, can help instil a healthier work culture.</p> <p>Mental health and particularly the understanding of stress is equally important and is perhaps even more challenging. Much more needs to be done to educate managers in how to show understanding and ask the right questions, and how and where to find the right support. Leaders in this field, such as Google, have built good mental health into their culture by offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/google-meditation-mindfulness-technology\" title=\"\">mindfulness classes</a> to staff, while many large employers in the City, such as KPMG and Deloitte, have launched the <a href=\"http://citymha.org.uk/\" title=\"\">City Mental Health Alliance</a>, working with charities to end the stigma attached to mental health problems.</p> <p>The message to business is clear; a workforce that is well, works well. Clinton may have wanted to preserve her image of strength, but she wasn\u2019t being honest with herself. We need our leaders \u2013 in the workplace and beyond \u2013 to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing first, to set the right example.</p> <p>Only then does this damaging culture of presenteeism have any chance of changing.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>\u2019s new parliament will be overwhelmingly loyal to the Kremlin, after elections marked by a record low turnout threw up few surprises.</p> <p>With more than 93% of the votes counted on Monday morning, the United Russia party, backed by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and led by its prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had won 54% of the vote. The other three parties to clear the 5% barrier required to make it into the Duma are all broadly loyal to the Kremlin line. United Russia will take more than three-quarters of the 450 seats in the Duma.</p> <p>The communists, and the far-right nationalists of Vladimir Zhirinovsky\u2019s Liberal Democratic party took about 13% of the vote, while the liberal Yabloko party and the opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/russian-opposition-party-regional-election-kostroma\">Parnas</a> garnered miserly returns. Parnas was the party led by Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\">shot dead</a> outside the Kremlin last year.

We will never know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new, mixed voting system was introduced for Sunday\u2019s election, in which voters chose both a party and individual candidates, with half the MPs coming from party lists and half from the direct voting. United Russia candidates also dominated the direct voting, meaning that in the end they will control 76% of the seats in the new Duma, giving them the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution. The projected 343 seats for United Russia is an increase of more than 100 from the previous parliament.<br></p> <p>In recent years, the Duma has been a pliant body with little real voice, and the two MPs out of 450 who had pursued an independent line have not been re-elected. One, Ilya Ponomarev, is living in exile while the other, Dmitry Gudkov, was beaten by a United Russia candidate in a Moscow district.</p> <p>Turnout in the election was just 47%, the lowest in the history of modern Russia. In major cities, the turnout was even lower, with just 28% of eligible voters making it to the polls in Moscow. </p> <p>In Crimea, which was voting in the first parliamentary elections since annexation by Russia in 2014, turnout was also low. Only 40% of Crimeans had cast their ballots with two hours of voting remaining, and the turnout was on course to be lower than the last time Crimeans voted in Ukrainian parliamentary elections. After the widespread euphoria over rejoining Russia two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/crimeans-still-tigerish-over-split-with-ukraine\">life has not improved in the way many Crimeans had hoped</a>, which has led to discontent and apathy similar to that in other parts of Russia.</p> <p>The national average was boosted by some provincial regions, where officials are known to demand local residents, and especially public service workers, come out to vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is tough and difficult but the people still voted for United Russia,\u201d Putin said on Sunday evening. United Russia was described as \u201cthe party of crooks and thieves\u201d by the opposition leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/alexei-navalny-russian-opposition-is-not-deterred-by-boris-nemtsov\">Alexei Navalny</a>, but although many Russians have disdain for corrupt local leaders, United Russia remains electable due to its association with Putin and a lack of viable alternatives.</p> <p>There were some violations reported on the day of the vote, including cases where what appeared to be blatant ballot stuffing was captured on camera. However, most election observers noted that the elections were much cleaner than the parliamentary elections five years ago. Then, multiple violations prompted tens of thousands of Muscovites to come out on to the streets for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/04/anti-putin-protests-moscow-russia\">season of protests</a> that lasted several months and rattled the Kremlin.</p> <p>While the day of the voting was cleaner and some opposition candidates were allowed on to the ballot, Kremlin critics say the vote is skewed from the outset given the partisan nature of state television and access to resources. However, few expect a new season of protests, after a crackdown in 2012 dissuaded many opposition-minded Russians from dissent. </p> <p>The next big election in Russia is the presidential vote, scheduled for early 2018. Putin is expected to stand and win another six-year term. By the end of that term, he would have ruled Russia for 24 years.<br></p>",
  "<p>Hopes of a fast and effective response to the global refugee crisis now rest on a summit convened by Barack Obama on Tuesday in New York, after negotiations before a meeting of world leaders at the UN on Monday failed to produce any concrete measures.</p> <p>The UN summit is expected to conclude by giving the international community another two years to reach a \u201cglobal compact\u201d on how to share the burden, after a pledge to resettle 10% of the world\u2019s refugees within the developed world was removed during negotiations last month.</p> <p>For leaders to speak at the Obama summit, they will have to make substantial new pledges to either take in more refugees, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/prisoners-of-europe-the-everyday-humiliation-of-refugees-stuck-in-greece-migration\">do more to help those who have already arrived</a> or give much greater assistance to host countries in the developing world, where 86% of the world\u2019s refugees live. </p> <p>\u201cThe onus on the participants on Tuesday is all the greater because of the triumph of the lowest common dominator politics on the Monday,\u201d said David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary who is now president of the International Rescue Committee aid organisation. \u201cAny refugee reading the conclusions of Monday\u2019s summit is bound to say \u2018what is going to change?\u2019 and the answer they would have to be given is very little.\u201d</p> <p>The challenge to the leaders\u2019 meeting on Tuesday, Miliband told the Guardian, was \u201cnot just to make a difference to the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. It\u2019s to show that political leaders don\u2019t have their heads in the sand at a time of international crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Obama will co-host Tuesday\u2019s summit with the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and leaders of some of the countries deemed to have done most for refugees or carrying more than their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\">share of the burden</a>: Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia. Before the event, the president raised the goal of the number of refugees the US would permanently resettle in the coming year by 10,000, to 110,000. </p> <p>British officials say the prime minister, Theresa May, will be a speaker at Tuesday\u2019s summit, in part because of the UK\u2019s role in hosting a donor conference that raised $12bn (\u00a39bn) in pledges for Syria and the region. They said she would also be making new British commitments.</p> <p>Samantha Power, the US envoy to the UN, made it clear that any other world leader wanting to speak at the event would have to come up with genuinely new and meaningful offers of help. </p> <p>\u201cWe are leveraging the additional steps that we are taking to get other countries also to do their part, given that up to this point a small number of countries have been carrying a disproportionate share of the refugee opportunity and burden,\u201d Power said. </p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to have dozens of countries present at the meeting. I can\u2019t give you an exact number now because we\u2019re still in a whirl of countries coming to us and saying, this is what we\u2019re going to commit, and us saying, actually, that\u2019s not new or significant, and then some of those countries going back to the drawing board. But it will be dozens of countries and you\u2019ll be able to see a very significant return on this format of meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Clark, New Zealand\u2019s former prime minister who is now head of the UN Development Programme, said that even if the summit produced a significant increase in support for refugees, it would not help the majority of the record 65 million people forced from their homes by conflict or persecution around the world \u2013 internally displaced persons (IDPs) who flee their homes but do not cross into another country.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOf the 65 million, my understanding is that the clear majority are IDPs and they\u2019re not dealt with, so that means there is more work to do to raise awareness of those needs,\u201d Clark said. </p> <p>She said it was possible IDPs were getting less attention because by not leaving their country of origin they did not pose such a direct threat to the political stability and budgets of the developed world. </p> <p>\u201cThat might be a factor. All I can say is that the IDPs also want their kids in school,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe IDPs are unfinished business, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>On the eve of the UN summit, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), Pierre Krahenbuhl, urged leaders not to forget the plight of long-term refugees, nearly half of whom are Palestinians.</p> <p>\u201cThe summiteers are clear that no one must be left behind and I urged that this must include the 5.2 million Palestine refugees registered with UNRWA,\u201d Krahenbuhl said. \u201cThey represent 44% of the world\u2019s long-term refugees, the largest in scale and most protracted in duration of any refugee situation today.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the failure of world leaders to agree firm commitments for the UN summit on Monday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said the draft of its final non-binding declaration would still make a difference by reaffirming the global community\u2019s collective responsibility for refugees, encouraging longer-term responses to prolonged refugee crises, which are currently often dealt with in a knee-jerk way.<br></p> <p>Volker Turk, the UNHCR\u2019s assistant high commissioner for protection, said: \u201cI see it as the beginning of an exciting process \u2026 it identifies a response framework that consolidates the nuts and bolts of what is needed if a country is faced with a large-scale [refugee] situation.\u201d<br></p> <p>The declaration was also praised by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which was pleased that it engaged with migrants as well as refugees. \u201cWe\u2019re not disappointed in any way,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, IOM\u2019s chief spokesman.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But others are. Record numbers of people are displaced worldwide, and given the gravity of the crisis, rights campaigners along with countries hosting large numbers of refugees are frustrated that the declaration has achieved no concrete measures, and concrete proposals will not be approved until 2018.<br></p> <p>Lebanon has a higher number of refugees per capita and per square mile than any other country in the world \u2013 and its ambassador to the UN, Nawaf Salam, said the proposals did not go nearly far enough.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFrom our perspective, all this falls way behind what is needed to address, one, the plight of refugees and, two, the needs of host communities,\u201d Salam said. \u201cThere are no commitments in terms of responsibility-sharing, no agreement on relocation of refugees, no real commitment to [the creation of] development funds that could address the needs of refugee and host communities.\u201d</p> <p>Salam said he would have liked to have seen international partners \u201cmake good on pledges already made. We need to shift from only humanitarian aid to development aid <em>and</em> humanitarian aid. We need to give more help to host communities. And we need to prepare plans for a safe and dignified return [of Syrians to Syria] \u2026 That\u2019s not implementable today, but preparations need to start today, to be implemented when conditions permit.\u201d</p> <p>The watered-down nature of Monday\u2019s summit means that the stakes on Tuesday are far greater, Miliband argued. \u201cIt would be better not to have a summit at all than to have a summit that doesn\u2019t lead to substantive change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Tuesday\u2019s summit achieves nothing, if the convening power of the American president on Tuesday doesn\u2019t deliver, it will further drain confidence that the international system gets it.\u201d</p>",

The FBI is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-mass-stabbing-mall-fbi-terrorism-investigation\">investigating the stabbing as a \u201cpotential terrorist attack\u201d</a>; police have ascribed no motive or suspect to the pipe bombs, which officials said on Sunday had not been established to be linked to the New York explosion.</p> <p>\u201cI pray for all of those who were wounded, and for their families,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. \u201cOnce again, we saw the bravery of our first responders who run toward danger to help others. Their quick actions saved lives.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton then reiterated her outline for an anti-terror plan, including an \u201cintelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks\u201d and \u201cwork with Silicon Valley to counter propaganda\u201d. Both Clinton and Trump\u2019s proposals largely mirror the counter-terrorism priorities of Barack Obama, who has waged a bombing campaign abroad and authorized extensive surveillance online.</p> <p>Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, argued that his running mate has hard-earned experience in such crises.<br></p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton was New York senator on 9/11 and was there at the World Trade Centers,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThey were still looking for survivors. And she\u2019s been through this. It\u2019s been a searing experience in her life. And she was part of the national security team that worked together to revive the hunt and wipe out [Osama] bin Laden.<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd so it is an important time where you have to have experience.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if the threat of violence, whether through bombings, mass shootings or terror, was \u201ca new normal\u201d, Kaine said: \u201cI don\u2019t accept that. We don\u2019t know yet about the cause of these incidents. But we\u2019re not allowing it to be a normal.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine also spoke of the US campaign against Islamic State, although the terror group has not claimed responsibility for the explosion. \u201cThe challenge is, as Isis realizes that they\u2019re losing ground, then they see whether they can exploit weaknesses elsewhere,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>On Sunday Trump only acknowledged the bombing only with a tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/777494113834917888\">writing</a>: \u201cI would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.\u201d</p> <p>His ally Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was markedly more cautious than the Republican nominee when asked about the bombing on Sunday. A pipe bomb exploded in the New Jersey town of Seaside on Saturday, and though police say they have found no connection between that explosion and New York\u2019s, they were investigating any possible link.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe at this time that there is evidence connecting it to the attacks in New York or Minnesota,\u201d Christie told CNN, referring to a stabbing at a mall in St Cloud in which eight people were wounded and the suspect, who reportedly made reference to Allah, was shot dead. \u201cWe have some promising leads, but no suspects at this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to put information out there that you don\u2019t know is absolutely true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/manhattan_explosion-zip/giv-22601KtRnW5sKJ5ka/\" data-alt=\"The site of the explosion in Manhattan.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/manhattan_explosion-zip/giv-22601KtRnW5sKJ5ka/\">The site of the explosion in Manhattan.</a> </figure>  <p>But despite this admonition Christie defended Trump\u2019s decision to describe the explosion as a bombing long before there was any evidence to do so. </p> <p>\u201cI think that what Donald did was perfectly appropriate to tell that group in Colorado Springs that a bomb had exploded,\u201d Christie said. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to defer when saying that there was an explosion and a bomb in New York. I mean, everybody knew that. It was being reported on television.\u201d</p> <p>Most news networks were careful to say that police did not know the cause of the explosion at the time.</p> <p>Throughout his campaign, Trump has spoken of America in almost dystopian terms, describing it \u2013 often with false or misleading statements \u2013 as a \u201c<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/288099-trump-country-is-divided-crime-scene\">divided crime scene</a>\u201d where refugees are a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004648650/trump-likens-refugees-to-trojan-horse.html\">Trojan horse</a>\u201d for terrorism, police are endangered and murder and unemployment on the rise. </p> <p>He has also reacted in unpredictable ways in the aftermath of horrific events, for instance after the mass shooting in Orlando in June, when he thanked people <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/288099-trump-country-is-divided-crime-scene\"> for \u201cthe congrat</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/742034549232766976\">s for being right on radical Islamic terrorism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Christie echoed Trump\u2019s dark vision of the US on Sunday, and blamed Clinton and Barack Obama for it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of her type of leadership over the last eight years,\u201d he said, \u201calong with the president, that the world is a much more dangerous place.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton contrasted that message in her own statement, saying: \u201cAmericans have faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger. I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear.\u201d</p>",
