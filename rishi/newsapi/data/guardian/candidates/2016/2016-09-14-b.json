  "<p>The chair of the House homeland security committee said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d Wednesday evening when he intimated during an interview on CNN that the Republican National Committee\u2019s computer network had been hacked.<br></p> <p>\u201cI misspoke by asserting that the RNC was hacked,\u201d Texas Republican Mike McCaul said in a statement. \u201cWhat I had intended to say was that in addition to the DNC hack, Republican political operatives have also been hacked.\u201d</p> <p>In the earlier interview with CNN, McCaul had told host Wolf Blitzer that the RNC had fallen victim to a hacking perpetrated by Russian state actors at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to note, Wolf, that they have hacked not only hacked into the DNC but also into the RNC,\u201d McCaul told Blitzer at the time. \u201cSo they are not discriminating one party against the others. The Russians have basically hacked into both parties at the national level and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are.</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI director would tell you they\u2019re just trying to undermine the integrity of the process,\u201d McCaul continued, after Blitzer noted that if Russia had hacked the RNC, it was news to him. \u201cThey are not discriminating one party against the other.</p> <p>\u201cThey have hacked into the RNC, so this is, again, they\u2019re not picking sides here, I don\u2019t think,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re hacking into both political parties. What they intend to do with that information, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this summer, hackers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/russia-hackers-democratic-national-committee-email-leak\">believed by the US government</a> to be agents of the Russian government successfully infiltrated the data networks of the Democratic National Committee. That hack led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/dnc-emails-wikileaks-hillary-bernie-sanders\">tens of thousands of internal DNC emails</a> being released on the internet days before the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, infuriating supporters of onetime Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who cited emails deriding the candidate as evidence that the party\u2019s establishment had been hostile to Sanders\u2019 candidacy.</p> <p>The resulting turmoil eventually led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders\">resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz</a> \u2013 as well as speculation that the Russian government was actively involved in the hack in a bid to interfere with the US presidential election.</p> <p>Putin has recently been praised by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">appeared to incite</a> Russia to hack into and publish his opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s private emails.</p>",

But the blood clot she sustained four years ago was declared completely resolved in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-health-excellent-doctor-letter-2016-campaign-120861\">a two-page letter</a> Clinton released from her personal physician last June, stating that she was \u201cin excellent physical condition\u201d.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, released a four-paragraph letter from his doctor in December that mostly engaged in hyperbole and declared him as the \u201chealthiest individual ever elected\u201d if successful in his pursuit of the White House. It did not, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/14/donald-trump-health-doctor-letter-americas-healthiest-president\">mention the foot problems</a> that Trump claims excused him from the Vietnam war draft.<br></p> <p>Trump, who has thus far declined to release further medical information or his tax records, has since announced he would discuss his health in an appearance with Dr Oz.

The 58-year-old senator was deemed in \u201cexcellent health\u201d, according to his doctor, and has faced only minor medical incidents such as molar extractions, a dislocated shoulder and a broken clavicle.</p> <p>Mike Pence, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElizLanders/status/776166909591117824\">reportedly ignored</a> reporters\u2019 attempts to determine whether he, too, would be disclosing his medical records.

  "<p>First of all, I would like to welcome everyone in this house and thank you for your attendance. It is very much appreciated. When I cast my mind back to the last day on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1998, just prior to the election, I called out across the chamber, \u201cI will be back!\u201d Those around me cried out, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u2019\u201d </p> <p>My electorate boundaries were changed, forcing me to stand for the new seat of Blair. Also, with the introduction of full preferential voting, this cost me the seat. Although I polled 36% of the primary vote, this was not enough against the Liberals\u2019 21% and Labor\u2019s preferences, delivering them the seat.</p> <p>It has taken numerous elections, countless legal battles and doing a stint in maximum security on trumped-up charges \u2013 of which former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop stated I was Australia\u2019s first political prisoner \u2013 to find myself here. Some call it persistence and tenacity. My daughter describes it as a Johnny Farnham comeback. I call it standing up and fighting for what you believe in and not allowing the bastards to grind you down. So, to all my peers in this place and those from the past, I have two words for you: I\u2019m back \u2013 but not alone.</p> <p>I cannot begin to express the pride and honour I have in being joined in this place by three of my colleagues \u2013 Senator Malcolm Roberts, also representing Queensland; New South Wales senator Brian Burston; and Western Australian senator Rod Culleton \u2013 elected under Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation. As a strong, united team I guarantee we will make a difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/comprehending-pauline-is-not-the-challenge-engaging-constructively-with-hansonism-is\">Comprehending Pauline is not the challenge. Engaging constructively with Hansonism is | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been 20 years and four days since I last delivered my first speech in this house, a speech that shook a nation, woke up many Australians and gave hope to those who thought no one was listening. That speech was relevant then and it is still relevant today. The problem is we have not had leaders with the foresight or the intestinal fortitude to cast aside political correctness. They have failed to discard old treaties and agreements that are not in our best interest and have signed new ones giving away our sovereignty, rights, jobs and democracy. Their push for globalisation, economic rationalism, free trade and ethnic diversity has seen our country\u2019s decline. This is due to foreign takeover of our land and assets, out-of-control debt, failing infrastructure, high unemployment or underemployment and the destruction of our farming sector. Indiscriminate immigration and aggressive multiculturalism have caused crime to escalate and trust and social cohesion to decline. Too many Australians are afraid to walk alone at night in their neighbourhoods. Too many of us live in fear of terrorism.</p> <p>In my first speech in 1996 I said we were in danger of being swamped by Asians. This was not said out of disrespect for Asians but was meant as a slap in the face to both the Liberal and Labor governments who opened the floodgates to immigration, targeting cultures purely for the vote, as expressed by former Labor minister Barry Jones \u2013 to such an extent that society changed too rapidly due to migrants coming in the front door but also the back door, via New Zealand. Now we are in danger of being swamped by Muslims, who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own.</p> <p>I love my country, culture and way of life. My pride and patriotism were instilled in me from an early age when I watched the Australian flag raised every morning at school and sang the national anthem; watching our athletes compete on the world stage, proud to salute the Australian flag being raised to honour them as they took their place on podiums. It is about belonging, respect and commitment to fight for Australia. This will never be traded or given up for the mantras of diversity or tolerance. Australia had a national identity before federation, and it had nothing to do with diversity and everything to do with belonging. Tolerance has to be shown by those who come to this country for a new way of life. If you are not prepared to become Australian and give this country your undivided loyalty, obey our laws, respect our culture and way of life, then I suggest you go back where you came from. If it would be any help, I will take you to the airport and wave you goodbye with sincere best wishes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson is back, and it's still just as hard to counter her rhetoric with facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is predominantly a Christian country, but our government is secular. Our Constitution prevents governments from imposing religious rule and teachings. The separation of church and state has become an essential component of our way of life, and anything that threatens that separation threatens our freedom. Australia has embraced migrants from all different races, making us one of the most multiracial nations on earth. Most have assimilated and are proud to call themselves Australians, accepting our culture, beliefs and laws. I welcome them from the bottom of my heart. As they integrate and assimilate, the disruption caused by diversity diminishes.</p> <p>Why then has Islam and its teachings had such an impact on Australia like no other religion? Islam sees itself as a theocracy. Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. It does not separate religion and politics. It is partly a religion, but it is much more than that. It has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion. It regulates Muslims\u2019 social and domestic life, their legal system and politics \u2013 their total life.</p> <p>Australia is now seeing changes in suburbs predominantly Muslim. Tolerance towards other Australians is no longer the case. Our law courts are disrespected and prisons have become breeding grounds for Muslims to radicalise inmates. Muslims are imprisoned at almost three times the average rate. The rate of unemployed and public dependency is two to three times greater than the national average. Muslims are prominent in organised crime, with associated violence and drug dealing. Antisocial behaviour is rampant, fuelled by hyper-masculine and misogynist culture. Multiple social surveys find that neighbourhoods of Muslim settlement are suffering from collapsing social cohesion and fear of crime. Australians, in general, are more fearful.</p> <p>Not only is terrorism seen around the world but it is now part of our society, with Muslim refugees involved in the Lindt cafe siege, the Curtis Cheng murder in Sydney and the stabbing of the two police officers in Melbourne. The grand mufti and other Muslim leaders are deafening with their silence, or lack of sympathy. Radicalisation is happening on our streets, in our suburbs and mosques. Yet, our leaders continue to tell us to be tolerant and embrace the good Muslims. But how should we tell the difference? There is no sign saying \u201cgood Muslim\u201d or \u201cbad Muslim\u201d. How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?</p> <p>Many more Australian Muslims have volunteered, or have tried to volunteer, to fight for Isis than we have in our own defence force. Asio has over 509 terrorist suspects under surveillance. Civil tension is on the rise across the country, led by Australians feeling the impact of Islam in their lives and a distaste for its beliefs. Their tolerance to our customs has seen Christmas carols no longer sung at some schools and Bibles not to be found in most hospitals. Some public swimming baths have times set aside for Muslim women only, and drivers licences are obtained by Muslim women wearing the burqa and niqab. Prayer rooms are now provided in universities, hospitals, schools, airports and shopping centres to accommodate Muslims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/forget-one-nation-cory-bernardi-is-the-politician-to-watch\">Cory Bernardi is more dangerous than One Nation \u2013 his party is in power | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halal certification tax has been forced upon us, costing Australians approximately $10m a year. Halal certification is not a religious requirement but a moneymaking racket, and certification is unnecessary for Muslims\u2019 welfare because non-halal products can be consumed, provided the word \u201cBismillah\u201d is said over the food and a prayer is recited. Muslims want to see sharia law introduced in Australia. This law is a totalitarian civil code which prescribes harsh feudal rules imposed on everything, firstly for Muslims, later for everyone. As long as Islam is considered a religion, sharia conflicts with our secular state.</p> <p>Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular and cohesive society. Never before in Australia\u2019s history have we seen civil unrest and terror associated with a so-called religion, or from followers of that faith. We have seen the destruction that it is causing around the world. If we do not make changes now, there will be no hope in the future. Have no doubt that we will be living under sharia law and treated as second-class citizens with second-class rights if we keep heading down the path with the attitude, \u2018She\u2019ll be right, mate.\u2019</p> <p>Therefore, I call for stopping further Muslim immigration and banning the burqa, as they have done in many countries around the world. Burqas are not a religious requirement. Most Australians find them confronting, as did two of our former prime ministers. I am sure a lot of the women forced to wear them would love to cast them aside but live in fear to do so. In addition, no more mosques or schools should be built, and those that already exist should be monitored with regard to what they are teaching until the present crisis is over. Sharia law should not be acknowledged or allowed. And Australian companies should be banned from paying for halal certification.</p> <p>Australians have never been permitted to vote on immigration and multiculturalism. When have we been asked or consulted about our population? We reached a population of 24 million this year, 17 years ahead of prediction. Governments have continually brought in high levels of immigration, so they say, to stimulate the economy. This is rubbish. The economy is stimulated by funding infrastructure projects, creating employment. What major projects have we had in this country for the past 30 years? How many dams have we built in the past 50 years? </p> <p>The only stimulation that is happening is welfare handouts \u2013 many going to migrants unable to get jobs. At present, our immigration intake is 190,000 a year. High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business, seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting longer for their lifesaving operation. The unemployment queues grow longer \u2013 and even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants.</p> <p>Our city roads have become parking lots. Schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves. And many cities and towns struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to cope, due to a lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the pieces. Governments, both state and federal, have a duty of care to the Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with more people who are going to be a drain on our society. I call for a halt to further immigration and for government to first look after our aged, the sick and the helpless.</p> <p>Foreign investment and foreign ownership are great concerns. The government finally released its register of foreign ownership, which reveals that foreign interests owned 13.6% of Australia\u2019s farmland. That is 52m hectares. It includes 30% of the Northern Territory\u2019s farmland and 22% of Tasmania\u2019s. The register fails to show the quality of the foreign-owned land. Is it the jewels in the nation\u2019s agricultural crown? Let\u2019s have a register on all land owned by foreigners, including non-agricultural land and housing. </p> <p>And why is there no information on who owns our country\u2019s vital irrigation and water assets, despite this being promised? The registry is a disgrace. It makes me wonder whose interests this government is serving. Australia needs a national government, not a corporate one, not a union one, and not an alternative lifestyle one. Any foreign ownership is regrettable, but why are we allowing the Chinese government, an oppressive communist regime, to own our land and assets? Why are we allowing our ports, utilities, services, agricultural land and industries, to be acquired by foreigners of any nationality?</p> <p>It is foolhardy to sell our water, agricultural land \u2013 our food source \u2013 essential services and ports. This is not in Australia\u2019s national or security interests. This foreign takeover is destroying small towns across the nation. A farm once the home of an Australian family is now run by a manager. People move, less money is spent, schools lose students and then the town starts to die. Now these foreign-owned properties become food bowls for their own countries. Tax is avoided, or very little paid, because they go straight from paddock to plate. Transfer pricing, which involves minimising taxation by artificially charging high prices or operating costs to subsidiaries in Australia, and other forms of tax minimisation, are a certainty.</p> <p>Housing is beyond the dreams of ordinary Australians. Why? Because they cannot afford to buy, due to foreign investors driving up prices. Officially, foreigners can only buy new housing, but this is not policed. If the Liberal party wants a pat on the back for having reduced the purchase price to $15m before it has to go to the foreign investment review board, they will not get it from me. I intend to give them a kick up the backside. Australians have given their lives protecting this great land from foreign takeover. I can guarantee most did not want to go to war but knew it was their duty to ensure their loved ones lived in peace. But, more importantly, they fought for freedom.</p> <p>I want Australian land, houses and companies to remain locally owned, and I believe I speak for the majority of Australians. Our land and assets are not for sale. Governments are only caretakers of our assets. No contract has been signed giving them permission to sell them. If they cannot rein in the budget with overpaid public servants \u2013 one being the head of Australia Post, who is on $4.8m per year \u2013 foreign aid, welfare fraud, politicians lurks and perks, including former prime ministers, and backroom deals for government jobs, then get out of the job of running this country. I warn this government and future governments: you never miss the water till the well runs dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/its-good-to-catch-up-pauline-hanson-and-tony-abbott-bury-the-hatchet\">'It's good to catch up': Pauline Hanson and Tony Abbott bury the hatchet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s federal gross debt is currently $499bn. Our interest payments are over $43.5m a day. Out-of-control government spending, mismanagement of taxpayers\u2019 dollars, multinationals not paying their fair share of tax and welfare that was introduced to provide for the aged and sick, or as a helping hand for those going through tough times, has now become a way of life for some and is abused and rorted by others. Welfare costs the Australian taxpayer approximately $158bn a year and this is expected to rise to $191bn by 2019-20. Nearly one half of our budget is spent on welfare. This is out of control and must be reined in.</p> <p>Farmers are screaming out for workers and small businesses have difficulty in finding people who want to work. Welfare is not a right, unless you are aged or sick. It is a privilege paid for by hard-working Australians. I support the government in wanting to stop school leavers going immediately on to welfare. What message are we sending them? Teach them how to apply for a job, rather than encouraging them to become dependent on money they have neither earned nor worked for. Then we have the single mums having more children just to maintain their welfare payments, and Muslim men marrying multiple wives, under their laws, then having multiple children at our expense while they collect thousands of dollars a week from the taxpayer. How many have ever held a job? Why would anyone want to work when welfare is so very lucrative? If people bring children into the world, it is their responsibility not the taxpayers\u2019. Therefore, I propose that if a woman has a child, the taxpayer will support the first child, but, if they have more, there will be no increase to the welfare payment. Get a job and start taking responsibility for your own actions.</p> <p>Not only are we facing a crisis with welfare but also with our health budget. It also is being scammed, abused and rorted and is costing taxpayers billions. The healthcare card has no identification on it, just a name and number. Anyone can, and does, take another person\u2019s card when visiting a doctor, especially those who bulk bill. Prescriptions are collected at a cost to the taxpayer, if the cardholder is on welfare. Overseas tourists, illegals and those not entitled to Medicare use their family\u2019s card or a friend\u2019s card. Let me give an example. When one tourist visiting family fell sick, he went to the doctor and used his cousin\u2019s Medicare card. He ended up in hospital and died. The owner of the card had to admit it was not he. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask. Well, he just had to pay the hospital bill.<br></p> <p>We have to stop the rorts, mismanagement and abuse of our taxpayer-funded services, whether it be welfare, health or education. If you want to access these services then apply for an Australian identity card. You must prove you are entitled to apply for the card on a points system. There should not be any complaints because applying for a $30 phone plan is the same. So I will not accept do gooders complaining about people\u2019s privacy. The card will have an identification chip, a photo and electronic fingerprint. If we are ever going to pull back our deficit we must stop the thieves. If you are not prepared to apply for the card, that is your choice, but expect to pay full price for doctors and prescriptions, and no more welfare handouts will be coming your way.</p> <p>Family law would be the most discriminatory, biased and unworkable policy in this country. I referred to it in my maiden speech 20 years ago and still nothing has changed \u2013 if anything, it is worse. As a nation, we should hang our heads in shame when, on average, three men, and occasionally a woman, suicide a day due to family breakdowns. The whole system is unworkable and is in desperate need of change. Children are used as pawns in custody battles where women make frivolous claims and believe they have the sole right to the children. Children have two parents and, until we treat mums and dads with the same courtesy and rights, we will continue to see murders due to sheer frustration and depression and mental illness caused by this unworkable system. Suicide is the only way out for those who feel there is no hope after facing years of costly legal battles. Their lives having been destroyed and the pain of missing their children are the reasons many end up in a state of depression caused by the trauma and in some cases the blatant vindictiveness from former partners.</p> <p>Child support is another contentious issue and should be revised. Some parents are left caring and providing for children without any financial help from the other parent. Others refuse to work so they do not have to pay child support. The system needs to be balanced, taking in the age of the child on a sliding scale and both parents\u2019 incomes should be taken into account. Non-custodial parents find it hard to restart their lives, with excessive child support payments that see their former partners live a very comfortable life. Make it fair with both custody and child support and most parents will gladly take on their responsibility.</p> <p>I ask all parents: is it worth the pain and anguish to deny your child the love they so deserve from both parents? They are only children for such a short time and all children need both parents. Please put your differences aside, make your peace and come to agreements outside of law courts. The only ones to gain are the legal professions, who are rubbing their hands together watching the thousands of dollars coming their way. Is it worth losing the family home? Is it worth the grief it brings not only to you but also to your extended families, not to mention the children? At the end of the day, the answer is no. I speak from experience not only as a mum myself but also as a grandmother.</p> <p>I am not going to do a Derryn Hinch and speak for 45 minutes \u2013 oh, he\u2019s still awake! I have a lot more to say but I have six years in this place \u2013 Derryn, sorry, you only have three \u2013 so there will be plenty of time. Oh, I can feel the Greens cringing \u2013 no, they have left \u2013 and squirming in their seats at the thought that I could possibly be here for six years.</p> <p>In closing, I will finish on this note: very few of us ever travel a journey alone and nor should we. Our loved ones and friends we have accumulated along the way are an integral part of who we are. Three of my children are here today. They have been with me every step of the way sharing my triumphs and battles, my high points and the lowest in my life. I did not know my life was going to be such a rollercoaster of a ride. I love you with all my heart. But I hate to tell you guys: it\u2019s not over yet; buckle up.</p> <p>There are those who kept the political party I launched in 1997 alive for 13 years after I left in 2002 till I came back in November 2014. Special thanks to Ian Nelsen for never giving up and for asking me to come back and lead the party. James Ashby is a man I have the utmost respect and admiration for. Like myself, the establishment has also kicked him about unfairly. Your dedication and hard work beside me added up to the clincher that not only saw me win my seat but also saw the other senators win their seats. With deep appreciation and sincerity, thank you.</p> <p>Thanks to Sarah Beric. You took on a task unbeknown to you, from performing as a professional violinist to running a political office and campaigns. You have been invaluable. A couple of strangers came along at the right time, helped me spread my wings and gave me the support and assistance I needed that now see me standing on this floor today. These people are no longer strangers but dear friends, welcome at home any time for another lamb roast. Thank you, Bill and Renatta.</p> <p>As I said earlier, I was imprisoned in 2003 for three years, held in maximum security on electoral fraud charges. My sentence was quashed on appeal after 11 weeks. If it were not for my sister Judy and brother Peter fighting for my freedom and justice \u2013and Alan Jones, along with approximately 90% of Australians who believed I was wrongly imprisoned \u2013 I would have been behind bars for three years. My father always said, \u201cPolitics is a dirty game.\u201d </p> <p>I was one of seven children and the quiet one of the family \u2013 believe it or not! Believe me: you are lucky to have me here and not the rest of the Seccombe clan. We come from a breed of Australians who were taught values, morals, honesty, work ethic and common sense \u2013 things very much lacking today.</p> <p>I will never take my position as a senator in this place for granted and nor should I. To the people of Queensland and Australia who voted for me and my party: thank you. You have given me a great honour. Now it is up to me to prove my worth to you. I can guarantee Pauline Hanson is a name that carries with it independence, honesty, assurance, quality and reliability \u2013 things the Chinese can never buy. Also, halal snack packs are never provided \u2013 isn\u2019t that right, Sam?</p> <p>Mr President and my fellow senators: thank you for your indulgence. We may not agree on everything but we need to work together for the future of our country and its people. I look forward to working with each and every one of you, including the Greens, if you are prepared to see this country prosper rather than shut down.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump visited the beleaguered city of Flint, Michigan, on Thursday, for a campaign stop punctuated by a brief spat with a local pastor.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee, whose visit followed a stop earlier this month in Detroit, was halfway through remarks at the Bethel United Methodist church that constituted more of a typical stump speech than anything tailored to focus on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/lead-drinking-water-level-nrdc-report-flint-crisis\">Flint\u2019s two-year water crisis</a>, when the Rev Faith Green Timmons interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we\u2019ve done in Flint,\u201d she said, \u201cnot give a political speech.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOh, oh, OK,\u201d Trump responded, as several in the audience applauded. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d<br></p> <p>Every Wednesday the church distributes water and filters to residents in the parking lot. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s brief stop in Flint was met elsewhere in the city with disdain by residents who viewed the visit as nothing more than an opportunistic photo-op, while the Republican nominee attempted to blame the water crisis on a myriad of issues.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/21/michigan-governor-rick-snyder-flint-water-crisis\">Flint water crisis: governor's brand of corporate politics set stage for disaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFlint\u2019s pain is the result of so many failures,\u201d Trump said at the church before about 50 attendees. </p> <p>The visit was initially light on details. By the early afternoon on Thursday, only two stops were confirmed \u2013 a brief visit to the city\u2019s water plant and the church, where Trump was expected to speak with local pastors about the community. Before his arrival at the church, Flint resident LaShonda Richmond said she came to \u201csupport our city \u2013 not to support him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShame on him,\u201d Richmond, 46, said of the visit. \u201cHe don\u2019t care about anyone but Trump.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"869d90ec16cb85476e76eb72bedb84638c5094f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/869d90ec16cb85476e76eb72bedb84638c5094f4/0_0_4500_3066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump at Flint water plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump tours the Flint water plant with utilities administrator JoLisa McDay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the speech at the church, Flint native Danielle Green said few in the audience were receptive to his remarks.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a political pitch, completely,\u201d Green, 46, said. </p> <p>Anthony Paciorek, 33, said Trump was pandering to get votes. </p> <p>\u201cPastor reminded him that we\u2019re not here to talk about politics because he started to go into a Hillary-heavy rhetoric, and then \u2026 there was interruptions with some questions I don\u2019t think Donald Trump was prepared to answer, or wanting to, frankly,\u201d said Paciorek, also a Flint resident. </p> <p>\u201cI also saw five, maybe 10 people clap out of a room full of 60,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Ahead of Trump\u2019s visit, protesters convened a brief press conference outside Flint\u2019s water plant, where many expressed dismay at what they described as the nominee\u2019s attempt to use the city\u2019s public health crisis as a \u201ccampaign prop\u201d.</p> <p>Carrie Younger-Nelson, a Flint resident, said the city has been engulfed by the water crisis for two years and Trump \u201cjust sees an opportunity to get in here and get him some media\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFlint do not want him here, and he needs to keep it rolling,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Younger-Nelson, 65, said she experienced rashes, hair loss and sinus issues after the city switched its water source over two years ago. And still, months after state and federal officials declared it was safe to use filtered tap water, she refuses to rely on anything but bottled water. </p> <p>\u201cEverything you do, you\u2019ve got to use bottled water,\u201d she said. Asked what she\u2019d say to Trump if she ran into him during Thursday\u2019s stop, Younger-Nelson was direct: \u201cI\u2019d tell him to go to hell.\u201d</p> <p>Standing nearby, the state senate minority leader, Jim Ananich, a Flint resident himself, said the purpose of the protest early on Thursday was to send \u201ca strong message that Flint\u2019s not a photo-op\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLooking at the water plant doesn\u2019t help us get new, clean pipes; it doesn\u2019t help us get clean water,\u201d Ananich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a policy position to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. This was a failed policy and culture created by [Michigan governor Rick Snyder] and emergency managers, bottom line. That\u2019s what happened. It was 100% avoidable.\u201d </p> <p>Jia Ireland, 23, also a Flint resident, said the public needed to know that Flint was still dealing with the effects of the water crisis, now well into its third year. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are still living off of water bottles and living off of filters,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, pipes are being dug up, but it\u2019s a slow progress. And we need to see things happen fast and now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I am not a supporter of Trump,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like Donald Trump is using this as a PR statement \u2026 so, you\u2019re late. And then, also, it\u2019s ironic that you\u2019re coming to speak to a city that\u2019s predominately African American, working class. There are high pockets of poverty here. And these are demographics of people you\u2019ve been disrespecting your entire election \u2026 now all the sudden you want to come here and talk to a group of people that you\u2019ve belittled this whole time. It just seems disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stop came as Flint\u2019s mayor, Karen Weaver, was in Washington DC to call attention to a bill before the US Senate that is expected to bring millions of dollars to aid the city\u2019s recovery efforts. </p> <p>The mayor initially said Trump\u2019s request to visit the Flint water plant would be burdensome, adding that the facility\u2019s staff \u201ccannot afford the disruption of a last-minute visit\u201d. But a spokesperson for the city said Trump would receive a tour if he decided to appear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f7cb98112387a9ccad192f5cf544c97bd7b1d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f7cb98112387a9ccad192f5cf544c97bd7b1d97/0_87_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump at Flint water plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Flint water plant on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf he shows up, a tour will be provided,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Kristin Moore. \u201cNot open to the public.\u201d Asked if she had an indication of Trump\u2019s itinerary, Moore simply said: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Trump eventually arrived, and was given a roughly 20-minute tour of the facility by the plant\u2019s supervisor, JoLisa McDay. Trump observed as McDay pointed out basic operations of the facility, saying: \u201cThe water is coming, you open this gate, and the water is coming.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d Trump responded. The water plant is currently not in operation. </p> <p>Flint\u2019s water supply became contaminated with lead in April 2014, when a state-appointed emergency manager running the city made a decision to switch its water source to a highly corrosive river. State environmental officials failed to require Flint to use corrosion controls to treat the water supply, thereby allowing lead to leach off pipes and flow into households across the city. </p> <p>As part of an investigation by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Bill Schuette, nine state and local officials have been criminally charged for their role in the water crisis. The investigators have said additional individuals are expected to face charges. The crisis has also been blamed for an outbreak of legionnaires\u2019 disease, which included 12 deaths, though health officials have yet to conclusively say the city\u2019s water supply is to blame. </p> <p>Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, who has been vehemently criticized by residents for his administration\u2019s delayed response to addressing the water crisis, has refused to endorse a candidate in the presidential race. </p> <p>\u201cGovernor Snyder has stayed out of presidential politics since before the primary election and intends on continuing to do so,\u201d Snyder\u2019s spokesman, Ari Adler, said in an email. \u201cHe is focused on the work that needs to be done in Michigan.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Perhaps no cartoon frog has been as thoroughly maligned during the 2016 election as <a href=\"http://www.mattfurie.com/\">Matt Furie</a>\u2019s hapless Pepe. The meme-friendly, often crudely drawn amphibian has lately been seen smiling, sporting Trump-like hair and standing menacingly behind the Republican presidential nominee in a photoshopped lineup of The Deplorables, a play on Hillary Clinton\u2019s dismissal of many of the candidate\u2019s supporters belonging in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign posted an <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/\">under-informed explainer</a> about Pepe, describing him as a \u201csymbol associated with white supremacy\u201d, though they admit he has been \u201cenjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike\u201d in the past.</p> <p>San Francisco cartoonist and painter Furie created Pepe as part of his laid-back cartoon Boy\u2019s Club, which was collected in print by comics publisher <a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/boysclub/\">Fantagraphics</a> this July. The easygoing strip chronicles the adventures of four roommates \u2013 Pepe, Andy, Brett and the malicious Landwolf \u2013 who spend a lot of time getting high, farting, spouting catchphrases and generally behaving like people who think Pepe memes are funny. Furie says Pepe himself is not into Nazis or Klansmen. \u201cIf anything, he\u2019d be part of the Green party,\u201d he tells the Guardian.</p> <p>Furie, also <a href=\"http://www.mattfurie.com/\">a witty painter</a> with a fine arts background, explains why he likes the crude reworkings of his careful linework, why he loves The Far Side, and why he\u2019s ultimately voting for Hillary Clinton, whether or not she likes his frog drawing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3840291560cafb5166148244f38c73892d6b7ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3840291560cafb5166148244f38c73892d6b7ce2/0_0_774_902/429.png\" alt=\"Matt Furie\u2019s Pepe the Frog from his graphic novel Boy\u2019s Club.\" width=\"429\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Furie\u2019s Pepe the Frog from his graphic novel Boy\u2019s Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Congratulations on the book. Is it selling a lot of copies?</strong></p> <p>You know, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s doing! I hope it\u2019s doing well. Pepe\u2019s kind of hitting peak interest with people in the media right now, so I\u2019m kinda trying to utilize that and twist it into talking about the origins of Pepe, which is in this modest comic book I did. A lot of people are just not familiar with Pepe as he lives as a comic book persona \u2013 kind of a more simple-minded, chill frog. And now he\u2019s taken on the multiple faces of whatever\u2019s going on in the crazy world out there. I just want to bring it back down to earth a little bit at the moment.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://mattfurie.tumblr.com/image/150369755602\">Landwolf</a> feels like a much more appropriate avatar for malcontents than Pepe. <br></strong></p> <p>Definitely.<br></p> <p><strong>What was it like seeing The Deplorables picture with the characters replaced with famous heads including Pepe\u2019s?<br></strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve only just seen this stuff recently because everyone\u2019s sending it to me, including, like, media people. Honestly I don\u2019t really follow it very much but you can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s all over the place. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Pepe as Donald Trump. When I first saw it I thought it was kind of funny. </p> <p>I don\u2019t take it too seriously \u2013 I just try to take it in stride, but the thing that\u2019s come to my attention is ... well, I didn\u2019t know what white nationalists were until, like, yesterday. And the alt-right or whatever? It\u2019s all very new and very strange and definitely not something that I support. I guess Pepe is kind of its own internet thing now. I\u2019m hoping not to get any hate or threats or anything. You have to do a little bit of research to even link it back to me, I think.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a particularly political guy. Do you have any temptation to align yourself one way or another as stuff heats up before the election?<br></strong></p> <p>My interests lie more in philosophical or spiritual books, and politics come and go. But yeah, I\u2019m interested in it. I\u2019m particularly interested in environmental stuff, more like humanitarian stuff. I definitely lean much more liberal \u2013 basically the opposite of what\u2019s happening with Pepe right now.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/774684329016299520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am so proud to be one of the Deplorables <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump2016?src=hash\">#Trump2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IFD1hfC60w\">pic.twitter.com/IFD1hfC60w</a></p>&mdash; Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/774684329016299520\">September 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Can I ask who you\u2019re voting for?<br></strong></p> <p>Well, I was really excited for Bernie, and that fizzled out, so I guess I\u2019m gonna have to take one for the team and go for Hillary even though she\u2019s talking smack, or whoever\u2019s writing for her at the moment is talking smack about Pepe.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m surprised at how little I\u2019ve seen you or Boy\u2019s Club written about in stories on Pepe.</strong></p> <p>Beyond Boy\u2019s Club, I think it\u2019s even more familiar as a meme for youth culture and teenagers. It\u2019s weird that people are saying he\u2019s been \u201ca longtime white supremacist meme\u201d. If anything he\u2019d be part of the Green party. He\u2019s a frog, why would he support white supremacists? That doesn\u2019t make <em>any</em> sense.</p> <p><strong>He\u2019s not even the right species.</strong><br></p> <p>He lives with a dog, a wolf, a kind of abstract Muppet creature ... he\u2019s all about diversity.<br></p> <p><strong>Is it weird to have to have these arguments?<br></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s just funny. People are taking it <em>really</em> seriously and it\u2019s a damn cartoon frog. It\u2019s weird on some level but it\u2019s more entertaining than anything.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the fun in Boy\u2019s Club comes from the dated pop culture references that are now funny because they remind you of embarrassing trends. How do you dig up stuff with the embarrassing nostalgia vibe?</strong><br></p> <p>I think it\u2019s just growing up in the culture that we live in where it\u2019s very catchphrase-oriented and referential to whatever was popular and kind of formed your imagination over the years. For me it was the Muppets and the Neverending Story and the Terminator and the Predator and all these things that were so cool when you were a kid, at least in terms of more lowbrow art. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2be842c2605b70af8ac00f8b2c512f97713fbc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2be842c2605b70af8ac00f8b2c512f97713fbc1/0_160_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"Paintings in progress by Matt Furie\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paintings in progress by Matt Furie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you look at a guy who grew up in the 60s, he\u2019d be into <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/917k/rat-fink-culture/\">Rat Fink culture</a> or car culture; there\u2019s a moment in time where if you\u2019re a musician who came out of the 90s, you were influenced by Led Zeppelin and the Beatles and whoever else.

I put out a series of Pepe official T-shirts, and one of them is a button-up collared shirt that has all my favorite Pepes from the internet, which are these more crudely drawn, childlike and funny drawings that it looks like kids are doing on MS Paint. </p> <p>So I collected them all and made a pattern out of them. It\u2019s kind of like a bootleg of the bootleg. It\u2019s a meta-bootleg. I\u2019m using some of it to my advantage! I\u2019ll be walking down the street in a college town and some kids will pass me and be like \u201cOh, cool, Pepe!\u201d It is neat that they have no idea that I made the character but they\u2019re stoked to see an old dude walking down the street with Pepes all over his shirt. That\u2019s satisfying to me.</p> <p><strong>How old are you?<br></strong></p> <p>I\u2019m 37.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s not that old.<br></strong></p> <p>Yeah but you know, when you\u2019re 20 a 37-year-old dude is <em>old</em>, you know?</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s true.

It just opens up the possibility so much. People think: \u201cIf they can do that, I can do it too!\u201d So just as an artist I\u2019ve always wanted to have a lot of fundamentals under my belt in terms of how to draw a hand and an eyeball and a face and stuff like that; but then I like to just have that knowledge and do more simplified things.

He had a really straightforward, simple way of making these funny comics where you didn\u2019t have to have action sequences or tons of dialogue and stuff.

  "<p>German chemical giant Bayer\u2019s $66bn (\u00a350bn) deal to buy controversial US agrochemical giant Monsanto and create the world\u2019s largest seeds and pesticides company is \u201ca threat to all Americans\u201d and should be blocked, Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Speaking shortly after the deal was announced, the Vermont senator, who ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: \u201cThe attempted takeover of Monsanto by Bayer is a threat to all Americans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese mergers boost the profits of huge corporations and leave Americans paying even higher prices.

Unusually it splits its four electoral college votes, and Trump is ahead in the second congressional district, the mostly northerly tip of the country, farthest away from his proposed wall with Mexico. </p>",
  "<p>Like a lot of American women who have demanding jobs and little time to rest, when Hillary Clinton got sick, she didn\u2019t stop working. But unlike the many <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/09/12/health-hysteria-and-hypocrisy-heres-a-news-alert-republicans-have-taken-ill-too/\">male political leaders who have fallen ill over the years</a> \u2013 George W Bush who vomited on the Japanese prime minister\u2019s lap, General David Petraeus who fainted during a congressional hearing \u2013 discussion of Clinton\u2019s health has become a referendum on her fitness to lead.</p> <p>The decision not to immediately disclose her pneumonia is being attacked as a lack of transparency. But, just as the illness isn\u2019t unprecedented on the campaign trail, neither is working through it without alerting the media: John Kerry\u2019s bout with the illness wasn\u2019t revealed until after his 2004 bid had ended.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not hard to imagine why Clinton wasn\u2019t keen on sharing her diagnoses. Any time Clinton coughs or is in the vicinity of a pillow, conspiracy theorists on the right insist she\u2019s dying of some horrific and well-hidden disease. (Let\u2019s call it AgingWhileFemale-itis.) Her departure from a 9/11 memorial service in New York, followed by a video of her looking woozy and stumbling, only heightened the frenzied speculation.</p> <p>The delusion that Clinton is seriously ill is so ingrained in some people\u2019s imaginations that #HillarysBodyDouble started trending on Twitter soon after she emerged from her daughter\u2019s apartment looking markedly better. Only in 2016, our year of political cartoonishness, would some people think it\u2019s more likely that Clinton employs a doppleganger than the less exciting truth that a few hours of rest and fluids go a long way when you\u2019re under the weather.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/the_guardians_what_would_a_feminist_do/episode-fifteen-princesses-pink-and-girly-culture\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F283290548&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Using health concerns as a cudgel to criticize women\u2019s participation in public life, however, is nothing new. Our supposed fragility was a common anti-suffrage argument, for example, and suffragists were often painted as mentally unwell \u2013 their very desire to be part of the political process proof of their \u201chysteria\u201d. </p> <p>The link between women\u2019s mental and physical fitness to political engagement was so strong, in fact, that Susan B Anthony <a href=\"http://msmagazine.com/blog/2014/05/07/wheels-of-change-the-bicycle-and-womens-rights/\">once said that bicycles</a> had \u201cdone more to emancipate women than anything else in the world\u201d. They not only quite literally got women out of the house and into more comfortable clothes, but they chipped away at the notion that women were physically weak.</p> <p>Decades later, the notion that women\u2019s bodies are somehow less suited for political life remains. After all, it wasn\u2019t merely boorishness that led Donald Trump to criticize Megyn Kelly by alluding to her period \u2013 there\u2019s a longstanding myth about women\u2019s hormones making them unfit to lead. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMa1TaVmb9U\">Comedian Hari Kondabolu</a> has my favorite response to sexists who think a woman\u2019s judgement is impaired once a month: \u201cI\u2019m a man with a penis and testicles, my judgement is impaired every five to seven minutes.\u201d)</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a coincidence, either, that when <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clinton-abruptly-departs-9-11-memorial-service-after-feeling-overheated-228005\">Politico reported on Clinton\u2019s illness</a> they described her dizzy spell as \u201cswooning\u201d \u2013 a term rarely used to describe men. Even Trump\u2019s comments that Clinton <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-clinton-presidential-look\">doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpresidential look\u201d</a> signal a particular sexist disdain.</p> <p>The truth is that the campaign trail is brutal, and working all hours through an illness like Clinton\u2019s shows strength, not weakness. That we would see it as anything but stamina reveals a tired double standard. Besides, what\u2019s more important right now than an individual\u2019s health is the health of our nation. Coughs aside, I think we all know whose hands that would be safer in. </p>",

That is why Jeremy Corbyn won today, handsomely. Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, and her point about \u201cselection by house price\u201d is a good one, but Corbyn successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn\u2019t provide an answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was how little support May was getting from her own side. That\u2019s not because Tory MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it\u2019s because many of them have serious reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today\u2019s PMQs, and judging by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education matter (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/14/pmqs-corbyn-may-brexit-cannot-have-a-la-carte-access-to-single-market-eu-chief-says-politics-live?page=with:block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5#block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5\"> 12.26pm)</a>, the chances of May\u2019s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially amended, must be quite high.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T12:13:07.732Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d93845e4b067ad300879bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T11:49:34.468Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My PMQs coverage normally leaves out <strong>Angus Robertson</strong>, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I\u2019m writing my snap verdict.

He asked May:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish government who want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in Europe?</p> </blockquote> <p>May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn\u2019t want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it\u2019s the q of the EU referendum, the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he\u2019ll get a different answer.

Again, he challenged the PM over the lack of support for the plan and, again, he won the exchange because he had the best arguments. He was not flash (he never is), but his fourth question, where he spoke passionately about how wrong it was to separate children at 11, was powerful, and it was telling that towards the end Theresa May resorted to having to change the subject. Unlike last week May restricted her jokes to her final answer, but even her pay-off soundbite did not quite work. It was premised on the idea that this might be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs. But, of course, no one believes that ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d9318ae4b0e813b694cea0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T11:22:13.471Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says his policy is not about pulling up ladders. It is about offering ladders to everyone. He quotes someone saying there is something hopeless about grammar schools, and the idea only some pupils can benefit. It was Cameron, he says, who said this.</p> <p>May says she wants a diversity of good provision. Good school places are important. Corbyn has still not welcomed the employment figures, she say. Labour would offer more taxation for working families.</p> <p>Corbyn welcomes anyone who can get a job. But there are now almost 1m people on zero-hours contracts. She quotes Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools. He said the idea the poor will benefit from grammar schools is \u201ctosh and nonsense\u201d. The Tory green paper addresses none of the problems in education, he says. Isn\u2019t this the case of a government heading backwards, to segregated schooling and second-class schooling for the many.</p> <p>May says some of Corbyn\u2019s facts were wrong. There are more teachers in schools. Corbyn has opposed all measures to improve schools, such as those on parent choice, and free schools. This may be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs, she says. So she will recap some of the things Corbyn has introduced. He wants coal mines without mining them, submarines without weapons, and to be a leader without leading. </p> <p><strong>John Bercow </strong>intervenes. Progress has been absurdly slow, he says.</p> <p>But he will get down the list.

She says Corbyn went to a grammar school. She went to one to. That is what got them to where they are.</p> <p>Corbyn says she and May can both remember the 1950s and going to a grammar school. We don\u2019t need to and never should divide children at the age of 11. Can May confirm whether existing grammar schools will have to widen their existing admission?</p> <p>May says she wants all grammar schools to educate a wide range of pupils. She wants a good education for every child. There are 1.25m children who are in schools that are not good or outstanding. She believes in the education that is right for every child. Labour has stifled opportunity.

Can she name any educational experts that back her grammar school plans?</p> <p>May also pays tribute to the police constable stabbed. As home secretary she looked forward to going to the policy bravery awards, she says.</p> <p>On education she says 1.4m more children are in good and outstanding schools. That is because of the government\u2019s reforms, which Corbyn opposes. She wants more good school places, she says.</p> <p>Corbyn says he asked if May could name any experts who backed the policy. She could not. He quotes John, a teacher, asking why all schools cannot be funded properly. In Kent 27% of pupils on free school meals get five good GCSEs. In London it is 45%.</p> <p>May says Corbyn should stop casting his mind back to the 1950s. She will be ensuring that the government provides good school places for the 1.25m pupils in schools that are failing or that need improvement.</p> <p>In grammar schools the attainment gap is virtually zero, she says.

It posed as a quasi-judicial body with the right to impose criminal punishments, yet followed none of the usual rules of law and fair process.

It means censure or, to put it colloquially, a severe bollocking.</p> <p>If MPs are found to have broken parliament\u2019s rules, they can be suspended. Back in the eighteenth century parliament also had the power to imprison members of the public found to be in contempt (often reporters publishing reports that offended MPs). But that power is deemed to have lapsed.</p> <p>MPs could in theory summon someone to attend the Bar of the House of Commons (the bit marking the formal entrance to the chamber, not the place where they serve drinks) to be reprimanded in person. This happened to John Junor in 1957 when he was editor of the Sunday Express. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Junor\">Junor had written an article criticising MPs for their use of petrol allowances </a>(rationing still applied) and, although he apologised for the contempt, he did so without retracting his comment.</p> <p>In today\u2019s report the privileges committee said it considered summoning Myler and Crone to the Bar of the House. But it has not recommended that step - probably because the 1957 episode was seen at the time as a bit of a farce, and something that did not reflect well on MPs. It is also not clear what would happen if someone were summoned but refused to turn up.</p> <p>Instead what will happen is that MPs will debate the motion proposed by the privileges committee.

Associated correspondence and evidence is published on the internet.</p> <p> The report follows the referral to the Committee by the House of the Eleventh Report of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (Session 2010-12) which concluded that it has been misled by witnesses during its inquiries into phone-hacking. Based on the evidence and applying the standard of proof that the allegations must be significantly more likely than not to be true, the Committee of Privileges has found that:</p> <p> a) Mr Colin Myler misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>b) Mr Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee in 2009 by giving a counter impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement.</p> <p>c) Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p> The Committee therefore finds Mr Myler (former editor of the News of the World) and Mr Crone (former legal manager at News International) to have been in contempt of the House.</p> <p> The Committee also found that:</p> <p> d) There is insufficient evidence to find that Tom Crone sought to mislead the CMS Committee about the commissioning of surveillance.</p> <p>e) The allegation that Les Hinton sought to mislead the CMS Committee as to the extent of the pay\u2010off to Clive Goodman and his own role in authorising the payments is not significantly more likely than not to be true.</p> <p>f) The evidence that Les Hinton misled the CMS Committee about the extent of his knowledge of allegations that phone\u2010hacking extended beyond Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to others at the News of the World does not meet the standard of proof set for a finding of contempt.</p> <p>g) While the Culture, Media and Sport Committee was sceptical about Mr Hinton\u2019s memory, there is no evidence that he misled the Committee in relation to his role in the payment of legal fees or the fact that he authorised the payments to Mr Goodman to settle his Employment Tribunal claim.</p> <p>h) There is insufficient evidence of a breach of Parliamentary privilege on the part of NI (now News UK). NOTW was not a corporate body. As such, the Committee does not consider NI to have committed a contempt.</p> <p> The Committee recommends that the House be invited to agree a motion in the following terms:</p> <p> That this House\u2014</p> <p> i) approves the First Report from the Committee of Privileges;</p> <p> ii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Colin Myler, considers that Mr Myler misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct; and</p> <p> iii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Tom Crone, considers that Mr Crone misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by giving a counter\u2010impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement and by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct.</p> <p> The Committee also recommends that the Leader of the House take steps as soon as possible to address the issues identified by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 2013, particularly in respect of the penal powers of the House and select committees and contempt.</p> <p> The Government is expected to find an early date for debate on the Committee\u2019s report.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what it means.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Two very senior former News International executives, the former News of the World editor Colin Myler and the former News International legal manager Tom Crone, have been censured for misleading MPs when they gave evidence to the phone-hacking inquiry.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A third executive, Les Hinton, the former News International chairman, has been cleared of misleading MPs - but only because the evidence did not meet a relatively high burden of proof.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to pass a motion censuring Myler and Crone.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>News International \u201cas a corporate body\u201d has not been found guilty of lying.</strong></li> <li><strong>The privileges committee is calling for an investigation into what can be done to punish witnesses who lie to select committees.

  "<p>In the wake of a victory that at once seemed extraordinary and inevitable, the Slovenian Football Association chief, Aleksander Ceferin, could not have been more matter-of-fact about the reasons behind his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/uefa-president-election-backroom-talks-michel-platini\" title=\"\">remarkable rise from relative obscurity</a> to one of the most powerful roles in football in less than six months.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my decision to run for presidency,\u201d he said, unsmiling but not nervous at facing the world\u2019s media following his 42-13 triumph over the far more experienced Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag. \u201cWhen I have seen there was so much support, it was much easier. For a new face to come to lead Uefa, it was the right time now.\u201d</p> <p>The official version of the 48-year-old\u2019s vertiginous rise begins with small gatherings of around 15 federations in eastern Europe in March at which they sought a candidate who could represent their interests, followed by a series of meetings on the fringes of the Fifa congress in Mexico City in May.</p> <p>Fearful of the power of the biggest European clubs and their lobbying strength, and concerned the Uefa executive committee did not always represent their interests, they swung behind Ceferin. As momentum grew, he also soon gathered the support of many of the Scandinavian countries, plus Italy, Germany and Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/slovenian-federation-leader-aleksander-ceferin-elected-uefa-president\">New Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin vows to review Champions League deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Uefa insiders said his success in winning them over was partly down to dissatisfaction with the other two candidates in the race \u2013 Van Praag and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/13/uefa-fifa-angel-villar-llona-2018-investigation\" title=\"\">controversial Spanish FA chief</a>, \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar Llona, who withdrew this month \u2013 but also because he caught a prevailing mood.</p> <p>Inevitably, however, some wondered whether there were other factors in the patronage of Russia and the alleged support of Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, who insisted publicly he would be prepared to work with either candidate and after the vote railed that the idea he lobbied on Ceferin\u2019s behalf was an \u201cinsult\u201d to the voting members.</p> <p>Nor has it gone unnoticed that Tomaz Vesel, the new chair of Fifa\u2019s independent audit and compliance committee, is also a Slovenian who turned out for the same football team as Ceferin (who is, by all accounts, a decent&#xa0;player).</p> <p>Uefa, overseen for nine years by one of the greatest and most charismatic footballers of all time in Michel Platini, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/michel-platini-declares-clear-conscience-uefa-congress-speech\" title=\"\">who crashed to earth in a spectacular display of hubris</a>, has now turned to a little-known lawyer to lead it at one of the most turbulent periods in its history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/14/uefa-new-president-fifa-michel-platini-congress\">Uefa\u2019s new broom more reminiscent of Fifa\u2019s new dawn than a revolution | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even those who have spent time with him in Uefa meeting rooms \u2013 he is vice-chairman of the legal committee \u2013 say he is relatively sparing with his words. Initially, he plans to remain in Ljubljana, where his law firm is based, rather than moving to the smooth glass offices of Uefa on the shores of Lake Geneva.</p> <p>Ceferin has been president of the Slovenian FA since 2011 and local journalists say he is well regarded at home, not least for opening a new National Football Centre this year. The married father of three eventually became irritated with suggestions he was a nobody. \u201cI was never behind the scenes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should ask somebody behind the scenes. People trust me. Nobody behind the scenes can have 42 votes from all parts of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Ceferin has just a two-and-a-half-year mandate, owing to the untimely fall from grace of his predecessor, but insisted he would not be afraid to fight for the interests of smaller federations. All of which should make for an interesting dynamic.</p> <p>\u201cSome people may have said I\u2019m not a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say that I\u2019m young and inexperienced but I honestly think it\u2019s disrespectful to all the presidents of small- and medium-sized federations who every year have to do more with less.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I know is that I\u2019m a team player, a man of conviction, a passionate man and a man of his word. I am not a showman and I\u2019m not a man of unrealistic promises.\u201d</p> <p>If true, that will mark him out as unusual in a world where talk is cheap but meaningful action is rare. While the Uefa members patted themselves on the back and politicked on the Athens riviera, inside their bubble there is still too little realisation of the low esteem in which they are held by the wider world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the questions over his speedy ascent up the greasy pole will only multiply. Ceferin, a black belt in karate who has traversed the Sahara five times (four by car and once on a motorbike), hinted he would employ the same tactics that had got him here to win re-election.</p> <p>Among other things, he vowed to stand up for the little guys by toughening up financial fair play rules and looking again at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/europe-top-four-leagues-guaranteed-four-automatic-champions-league-places\" title=\"\">new Champions League deal that favours Europe\u2019s aristocracy</a>. But he also insisted he would deliver greater transparency, term limits and a new compliance committee.</p> <p>As he did so, it was impossible not to think of the countless times those buzzwords had been tossed from podiums down the years by Sepp Blatter, Platini, Infantino and all those who had gone before and conclude that Uefa\u2019s new accidental leader could be judged only by his actions.</p>",

It was September 2011, and earlier that year the first-term governor had turned himself into the poster boy of hardline Republican politics by passing the notorious anti-union measure Act 10, stripping public sector unions of collective bargaining rights.<br></p> <p>Now he was under attack himself, pursued by progressive groups who planned revenge by forcing him into a recall election. His job was on the line.</p> <p>He asked his main fundraiser, Kate Doner, to write him a [briefing note](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p58/a317774, \u201cGuardian\u201d) on how they could raise enough money to win the election. At 6.39am on a Wednesday, she fired off an email to Walker and his top advisers flagged \u201cred\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d she began. \u201cHere are my quick thoughts on raising money for Walker\u2019s possible recall efforts.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice was bold and to the point. \u201cCorporations,\u201d she said. \u201cGo heavy after them to give.\u201d She continued: \u201cTake Koch\u2019s money. Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask for $1m now.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice must have hit a sweet spot, because money was soon pouring in from big corporations and mega-wealthy individuals from across the nation. A few months after the memo, Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate who [Forbes estimates](http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/gallery/sheldon-adelson) has a personal fortune of $26bn, was to [wire a donation of $200,000 for the cause.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p132/a317501 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Adelson\u2019s generosity, like that of most of the other major donors solicited by Walker and crew, was made out not to the governor\u2019s own personal campaign committee but to a third-party group that did not have to disclose its donors. In the world of campaign finance, the group was known as a \u201cdark money\u201d organisation, as it was the recipient of a secret flow of funds that the public knew nothing about.</p> <p>One of the checks made out to the group, for $10,000, came from a financier called G Frederick Kasten Jr. In the subject line of the check, Kasten had written in his own hand: [\u201cBecause Scott Walker asked\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p52/a317493 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Because Scott Walker asked. That could stand as an elegant catchphrase for the state of democracy in the US today, where elections are lost or won as much according to candidates\u2019 ability to attract corporate cash as by the strength of their leadership or ideas.</p> <p>The phrase is to be found within a batch of 1,500 pages of leaked documents obtained by the Guardian that are being published in their entirety for the first time. The cache consists of a stack of evidence gathered by official prosecutors in Wisconsin who were conducting what was called a \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d into suspected campaign finance violations by Walker\u2019s campaign and its network.</p> <p>The John Doe files published today open a door onto how modern US elections operate in the wake of Citizens United, the 2010 US supreme court ruling that unleashed a flood of corporate money into the political process. They speak to the mounting sense of public unease about the cosy relationship between politicians and big business, and to the frustration of millions of Americans who feel disenfranchised by an electoral system that put the needs of corporate donors before ordinary voters.</p> <p>The theme has become a rallying cry in the US presidential election. Bernie Sanders accused politicians \u2013 not least his Democratic rival [Hillary Clinton](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/6/bernie-sanders-slams-hillary-clintons-wall-street-/) \u2013 of selling themselves to Wall Street and special interests.<br></p> <p>Donald Trump went further, brazenly using himself as an example of a billionaire who has put politicians in his pocket. \u201cWhen you give to them,\u201d [he said](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114565/donald-trump-debate-money) in a confessional tone during a televised Republican debate in the run-up to the primaries, \u201cthey do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>According to the independent monitoring group, the Center for Responsive Politics, [$2bn of corporate cash](http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php) has been lavished on the presidential race so far. It\u2019s a bewildering figure, but it only tells us so much about how the new American democracy works in practice, because so much of that largesse is shrouded in secrecy.</p> <p>Donors are often undisclosed, campaign finance laws are [notoriously complicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/05/17/the-impossibly-complex-world-of-campaign-finance-in-1-chart/), and scrutiny by electoral authorities is rare, prosecutions even rarer. When official investigations are launched, they often flounder before reaching a conclusion and virtually never have the chance to reveal their findings to the public. </p> <p>It is into that dark and obscure post-Citizens United world that the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian land. These are the documents that some of the most powerful judges in the country tried to stop the public from ever seeing. </p> <p>In July 2015 the state\u2019s highest court, the supreme court of Wisconsin, terminated the John Doe investigation before any charges were brought. The [conservative majority of the court ruled](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=144525) that the prosecutors had made a basic misreading of campaign finance law and targeted individuals who were \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d. </p> <p>In a contentious twist to the ruling, the justices ordered the prosecutors to \u201cpermanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation\u201d. </p> <p>This latter-day equivalent of a book burning could have condemned the John Doe investigation into permanent oblivion, leaving voters none the wiser. But at least one copy of the evidence gathered by the prosecutors survived the bonfire, and have now been leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Snippets of the documents have already seen the light of day, [quoted in legal filings](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-wanted-funds-sent-to-wisconsin-club-for-growth-b99336519z1-272364371.html), some of which were mistakenly posted to an official website. But the Guardian\u2019s documents \u2013 consisting of email exchanges between Walker, his advisers, Republican leaders and major donors who included none other than Trump himself, together with court filings held under seal \u2013 amount to a rich chronicle of the electoral health of the United States in the wake of Citizens United.<br></p> <p>They also form the substance of a case currently before the US supreme court, which has been [petitioned](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) by the Wisconsin prosecutors in an appeal against the decision to shut down their investigation. The nation\u2019s highest judicial panel is expected to announce within days whether or not it will take the case.</p> <p>At the heart of the John Doe files is Scott Walker, the governor who shot to national prominence \u2013 a hero for conservatives, pariah for liberals \u2013 soon after taking office in February 2011 when he introduced the hyper-partisan [Act 10](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/wisconsin_assemblys_sneaky_mov.html). The legislation instantly made Wisconsin the battleground state in the fight between boardroom might and union muscle.</p> <p>The state capital Madison erupted in weeks of protests in which the legislative building was overrun with [thousands of protesters](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42047717/ns/politics-more_politics/t/tens-thousands-pro-labor-rally-wisconsin/). Democratic lawmakers [fled the state](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116381289.html) and took up residence in neighboring Illinois in a failed attempt to foil Walker\u2019s plans.<br></p> <p>In the fallout of Act 10, progressive groups retaliated by dragging Walker and several other Republicans through a series of bitter recall elections. Six GOP senators were forced to defend their seats in 2011, and Walker himself was put through the [recall furnace](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-recall-idUSBRE82T1FV20120330) in 2012.</p> <p>Those recall elections, and the question of whether Walker flouted campaign finance regulations in order that he and other Republican politicians could stay in office and preserve their anti-union legislation, were the focus of the investigation that generated the files now leaked to the Guardian. It was run by five Wisconsin prosecutors, led by Francis Schmitz, a former federal counter-terrorism expert.</p> <p>It was known as a John Doe investigation because, much like a grand jury, its subjects were kept anonymous while officials weighed whether or not to press charges. In this case, prosecutors alleged that there was evidence to indicate that Walker and his team of advisers and associates had set up a coordinated effort with lobbyists and major donors to swing elections by secretly pouring huge amounts of corporate cash into the races. </p> <p>The money was channeled through a third-party group, the DAs alleged, in order to circumvent state and federal rules that set limits on political contributions and require them to be publicly revealed. </p> <p>The documents show the governor and his fundraising team going after, and receiving cash from, many of the most prominent rightwing donors in the country. In addition to [Adelson](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508 \u201cGuardian\u201d), there was business magnate Carl Icahn who was [approached for $100,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p4/a317509 \u201cGuardian\u201d) though nothing in the files indicates that he donated; the hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen, who [arranged a wire transfer of $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p98/a317510 \u201cGuardian\u201d); and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone who [gave $25,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p13/a317512 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Paul Singer, hedge-fund manager and chairman of the Manhattan Institute, also crops up in the documents. Three months before Walker\u2019s recall election, Singer attended a forum of business leaders held by the American Enterprise Institute in a luxury resort off the coast of Georgia.</p> <p>Walker was also there, arriving at the resort armed with a to-do list from his chief fundraiser Kate Doner. It bore the pithy command: [\u201cPaul Singer: Grab him\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p93/a317513 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The governor presumably did as he was told. Two months later a check from Singer was [banked for $250,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p133/a317515 \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>What particularly caught the attention of the prosecutors was that when the money came in it did not go directly to Walker\u2019s personal campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker. To do so would have been problematic, as any campaign committee directly linked to a candidate is limited in Wisconsin to accepting contributions of up to $43,000 that have to be fully disclosed. </p> <p>The prosecutors alleged in [court filings](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105201-2014-02-21-Schmitz-Memo.html#document/p14/a317779, \u201cGuardian\u201d) published here for the first time that Walker\u2019s campaign found a way around these restrictions by banking the corporate cash through the third-party group, Wisconsin Club for Growth. [WCfG](http://wicfg.com/) describes itself as a \u201cpro-liberty, pro-fiscal restraint\u201d organisation, sharing the same small government and anti-union ideology as Walker. It is a tax-exempt group, or 501 (c) (4), that is supposed to be primarily concerned with \u201csocial welfare\u201d rather than partisan politics and as such is not obliged to reveal its donors.</p> <p>In court submissions, the prosecutors alleged that Walker\u2019s campaign used WCfG as a shadow committee that allowed him to solicit large sums of corporate cash without scrutiny or accountability. \u201cContributions were personally solicited by Governor Scott Walker to WCfG ... in order to circumvent the reporting and contributions provisions of Wisconsin statutes,\u201d an investigator working for the [prosecutors in the John Doe investigation, Robert Stelter, alleged.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p77/a317542 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>A good example of the way things worked was the donation made by Donald Trump. On 3 April 2012, two months before the governor faced the electorate, Walker flew to New York for a rapid-fire string of fundraising meetings with big money interests.</p> <p>He travelled the length of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, making stops at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, a hedge fund, a corporate law firm, and the residence of publishing tycoon Steve Forbes. He also [enjoyed a 45-minute audience with Trump](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p9/a317522 \u201cGuardian\u201d) in his Fifth Avenue lair.</p> <p>There is no record of the conversation between the two men. But it appears to have been a warm encounter, as the John Doe files show that Trump [wrote a check for $15,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p11/a317523 \u201cGuardian\u201d) on the same day. Who was the beneficiary of Trump\u2019s generosity? Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>Another example of the pattern is the casual comment Walker dropped into an email to his fundraiser dated 14 June 2011: [\u201cAlso, I got $1m from John Menard today\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105980-Fundraising-Coordination.html#document/p8 \u201cGuardian\u201d) Eight days later [a check for $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p53/a317694 \u201cGuardian\u201d) is cut on a corporate check of Menard Inc, the billionaire John Menard\u2019s home improvement chain Menards, and made out not to the governor\u2019s campaign committee but to Wisconsin Club for Growth. There the donation remained a secret until the publication of the Guardian\u2019s leaked files.</p> <p>Friends of Scott Walker, Wisconsin Club for Growth and other parties named in the John Doe investigation have all vigorously denied any legal violations. They point out that no charges have been brought against any subject of the inquiries.</p> <p>John Fadness, spokesman for the Scott Walker campaign, told the Guardian: \u201cAs widely reported two years ago, the prosecutor\u2019s attorney stated that Governor Walker was not a target. Several courts shut down the baseless investigation on multiple occasions, and there is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing.\u201d </p> <p>In June 2014, the special prosecutor Schmitz [said through a lawyer](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-not-a-target-john-doe-special-prosecutor-says/article_9d5579ed-039d-5f22-ac98-947469c3c22d.html) that Walker was not a target of his John Doe investigation. Yet legal documents contained in the John Doe files identify as the anonymous [\u201cMovant No. 1\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15 \u201cGuardian\u201d) of the investigation \u201cFriends of Scott Walker, the personal campaign committee of Scott Walker.\u201d </p> <p>David Rivkin, the attorney representing Wisconsin Club for Growth and its director Eric O\u2019Keefe, said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cAs the Wisconsin Supreme Court explained, the John Doe prosecutors made up crimes \u2018that do not exist\u2019 under Wisconsin law in order to target \u2018citizens who were wholly innocent of any wrongdoing.\u2019 Because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review matters of state law, it should be obvious that the John Doe prosecutors\u2019 appeal is legally frivolous and just another publicity stunt intended to tarnish their targets\u2019 reputations and salvage their own.\u201d</p> <p>Further insight into the position of the subjects of the investigation \u2013 the \u201cmovants\u201d as they are technically known \u2013 is given in court papers including in the Guardian\u2019s [John Doe Files.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105213-WICFG-Motion-Quash.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) They criticise the prosecutors for making fundamental mistakes in their reading of campaign finance law. They said that regulatory restrictions on the size and source of donations only applied to groups that were expressly advocating for or against a named political candidate.</p> <p>WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe [said in an affidavit](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105216-WICFG-Quash-Aff.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) that the club\u2019s involvement had stemmed purely from its commitment to \u201cadvancing liberty and fiscal responsibility\u201d. Its role in the recall elections was \u201cto educate Wisconsin citizens ... The Club paid for advertisements that advanced its pro-liberty, fiscal responsibility, pro-Act 10 beliefs. None of the advertisements expressly urged voters to vote for or against any candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The movants also complained that in issuing over-broad subpoenas for evidence and conducting [pre-dawn raids](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/417155/wisonsins-shame-i-thought-it-was-home-invasion-david-french) on the homes of some individuals, the prosecutors strayed well beyond their legitimate powers and into the realm of governmental abuse.</p> <p>In the course of the John Doe investigation, the prosecutors obtained hundreds of emails and bank records under subpoena. An email sent by Kate Doner, Walker\u2019s fundraiser, in April 2011, summed up the strategy. She said the aim was to raise $9m in six weeks, to pay for political advertising \u2013 she called it \u201cissue advocacy efforts\u201d \u2013 in the senatorial recall races. </p> <p>Walker, she said, wants all the ads [\u201crun thru one group to ensure correct messaging\u201d,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p33 \u201cGuardian\u201d) and that group, the governor declared, should be Wisconsin Club for Growth. \u201cThe Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth [which] can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure.\u201d</p> <p>The email trail shows a pattern of behavior developing: Walker meets up with big corporate donors and encourages them to contribute unlimited sums of money through WCfG in secret, then shortly after the checks start to flow. In June 2011, the emails show, the governor had dinner with the CEO of the largest privately owned trucking company in the US, Schneider National, in the hope of getting him and his peers to donate $250,000. </p> <p>\u201cStress the donations to WiCFG are not disclosed and can accept Corporate donations without limits,\u201d [Walker\u2019s talking points said.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p42/a317530 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Two checks are recorded in the John Doe files from Schneider, [both made out to WCfG and totalling $65,000](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p1 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>The Schneider checks, like several others included in the files, were cut on corporate checks in the name of the company itself. It has long been a rule under [Wisconsin state law](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/11/XI/1112), commonly known as the \u201ccorporate ban\u201d, that corporations are not allowed to make direct political donations; they are only allowed to fund third-party groups that have to be fully independent of candidates, or spend money themselves on political TV advertising so long as the expenditure is declared.</p> <p>Some of those checks are published by the Guardian today, redacted to remove bank numbers. The Guardian has also redacted other documents in the files to remove personal information such as cellphone numbers and private home addresses. Personal email addresses have also been redacted unless they have already been put into the public domain, as in the case of Scott Walker\u2019s own [personal email address](http://watchdog.org/244820/scott-fitzgerald-john-doe-conservatives/). </p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that Walker\u2019s own advisers reached the conclusion that the large sums flowing into WCfG\u2019s coffers from corporate donors was critical to the survival of the Republican senators in their recall elections. In a memo sent to Walker shortly after the elections in August 2011, his former top campaign consultant RJ Johnson looked back on the contest and ruminated that \u201cOur efforts were run by Wisconsin Club for Growth ... who coordinated spending through 12 different groups. Most spending by other groups was directly funded by grants from the Club.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to note that WCfG \u201craised 12 million dollars and ran a soup to nuts campaign ... Polling, focus groups and message development was a collaborative effort.\u201d A mass of micro-targeted mail-outs and TV advertising that was bought with the donations had the impact that they [\u201cmoved independent swing voters to the GOP candidate\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p56/a317535 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The collaboration set up in 2011 was successful in helping four of the six Republican senators fend off the recall challenge and keep their jobs \u2013 allowing them to hang onto their senate majority by one vote. Act 10 was safeguarded for the moment, and in a gesture of gratitude Walker himself was moved to ask an aide shortly after the vote: [\u201cDid I send out thank you notes to all of our c(4) donors?\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105983-2013-09-16-Exhibits-41.html#document/p129 \u201cGuardian\u201d) </p> <p>Supporters of Governor Walker and the outside groups that worked with him, including some prominent media outlets such as the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hyperventilating-in-wisconsin-over-scott-walkers-fund-raising-1408920214), argue that the prosecutors were mistaken in their view that the coordinated activities amounted to a violation of campaign finance law. They point out that nobody in the governor\u2019s circle has been charged with any alleged violation relating to the recall elections, and argue that WCfG and the other outside groups engaged in advocacy over issues related to the elections, which is not subject to restrictions, as opposed to express advocacy on behalf of one political candidate or another. </p> <p>They also insist, using a complex formula related to the electoral calendar, that Walker only became an official candidate on 9 April 2012. Any actions he and his associates took before then were not subject to restrictions, [they argued](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105212-FOSW-Notice-Appear.html#document/p10, \u201cGuardian\u201d). To which the prosecutors replied that Walker\u2019s campaign committee had been frantically fundraising and coordinating long before that date.</p> <p>The John Doe files do contain some evidence that Walker\u2019s senior team attempted to maintain a firewall between candidate and outside interests after that date. On 19 April, the lead adviser to the governor\u2019s recall campaign, Keith Gilkes, replied to a group of businesses wanting to put up billboards supporting Walker\u2019s candidacy: \u201cI cannot have any comment on this \u2013 it is an [independent expenditure](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105981-Ad-Coordination.html#document/p40/a317537, \u201cGuardian\u201d) separate from the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>But the files also contain documents that show that RJ Johnson, a prominent political strategist in Wisconsin who worked closely with Walker for many years, and Johnson\u2019s business partner Deborah Jordahl, were simultaneously arranging political ad spending on TV and radio for both Walker\u2019s campaign and the outside lobbying groups. On 23 April 2012 [Johnson emailed Gilkes](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p45/a317539, \u201cGuardian\u201d) about a Walker ad that he was putting out for the recall election; a week later [Johnson and Jordahl were emailing](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p47/a317540, \u201cGuardian\u201d) each other about radio ad spending on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>That lead the special prosecutor, Francis Schmitz, to conclude that \u201ca review of email reflects that RJ Johnson ... [was involved](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p99/a317541, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in the media buys on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth and Friends of Scott Walker.\u201d</p> <p>Neither RJ Johnson nor Deborah Jordahl immediately responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Until the US supreme court indicates later this month whether or not it will intervene in the John Doe case, the question of the legality of the Walker network and the coordination that it involved will hang in the balance. The Wisconsin supreme court was firm on the issue: in its [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525), the court castigated Schmitz for instigating a \u201cperfect storm of wrongs that was visited upon the innocent Unnamed Movants and those who dared to associate with them.\u201d</p> <p>In colorful language, the state\u2019s highest court praised Walker, WCfG and other movants in the investigation (it didn\u2019t name them, but [their identities](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15/a317721, \u201cGuardian\u201d) are self-evident from the John Doe files as \u201cbrave individuals\u201d. It said they had \u201cplayed a crucial role in presenting this court with an opportunity to re-endorse its commitment to upholding the fundamental right of each and every citizen to engage in lawful political activity and to do so free from the fear of the tyrannical retribution of arbitrary or capricious governmental prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>For good measure, the court added: \u201cLet one point be clear: our conclusion today ends this unconstitutional John Doe investigation.\u201d</p> <p>That point is certainly clear, unless the US supreme court, which has the final say in any matter of constitutional law, decides otherwise. The nation\u2019s highest court has been asked to take the prosecutors\u2019 petition by an alliance of campaign-finance monitoring groups, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Brennan Center and Common Cause.</p> <p>In their petition, the prosecutors ask the US supreme court justices to consider whether Wisconsin\u2019s top judicial panel was truly objective in reaching its decision to shut them down. \u201cIs the state as a litigant in an adversary proceeding entitled to a hearing before a panel of impartial justices, free of bias?\u201d, the prosecutors ask. </p> <p>Protecting Walker\u2019s agenda</p> <p>The John Doe files obtained by the Guardian give clues as to why the prosecutors have raised doubts about impartiality in the state courts. They suggest that two of the conservative judges on Wisconsin\u2019s top court who voted to halt the John Doe investigation may have themselves been intimately connected to the same campaigning network of rightwing politicians, lobbyists and major donors that the prosecutors were investigating.</p> <p>Take David Prosser. He was one of the four conservative judges who approved the [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525) that terminated the John Doe investigation, sacked Schmitz from his position as special prosecutor and ordered the destruction of all the documents that had been collected (later that order was softened a little to a demand that the prosecutors hand in all the documents to the court which would keep them secret under seal). </p> <p>At precisely the same time as the six Republican senators were embroiled in their recall election, Prosser was in his own electoral fight for survival. He was up for re-election in April 2011 and facing a tough challenge from JoAnne Kloppenburg, then Wisconsin\u2019s assistant attorney general. The Prosser election and the recall election were intertwined in that Kloppenburg was attempting to turn her battle against Prosser into a [referendum on Governor Walker\u2019s](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/us/politics/05wisconsin.html) anti-union legislation, Act 10.</p> <p>Among the leaked John Doe files that the Wisconsin supreme court ordered to be suppressed are documents that underline how anxious Walker\u2019s circle were about the threat, as they saw it, to the court\u2019s conservative majority. In an email dated 14 December 2010, WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe says he\u2019s been [in touch with Diane Hendricks](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d), the owner of a roofing company who Forbes describes as America\u2019s richest self-made woman with a personal fortune of $5bn. Hendricks is a well-known funder of rightwing causes and individuals, among them Scott Walker himself who she was to go on to support with [$500,000](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) in 2012 for his own recall election.</p> <p>Hendricks has also popped up as part of the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Trump recently added [her to his inner team](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2016/08/11/trump-adds-richest-self-made-woman-diane-hendricks-to-economic-advisory-team/#29c3bf15392c) of economic advisers, having come under fire for only appointing men.</p> <p>[\u201cI have traded emails with diane hendricks,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d) O\u2019Keefe says in the email. \u201cShe is concerned about the state s. Ct.\u201d </p> <p>Hendricks was right to be concerned about the state supreme court. Were Prosser to lose the vote, the consequences for Walker and his entire rightwing union-bashing agenda would have been devastating. The four-to-three, conservative-to-liberal, balance of the state\u2019s top court would have been reversed, allowing progressive groups to overturn the reforms through legal challenges.</p> <p>The correspondence reveals how Walker\u2019s network of associates vowed to go to work to keep Prosser in his job, and thus preserve (or \u201cmaintain\u201d) the court\u2019s conservative upper hand. \u201cIt would be good for [Hendricks] to [talk with us or have her see our plan,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) writes RJ Johnson, the then \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to Governor Walker\u2019s campaign committee. He says that WCfG \u201cis leading the coalition to maintain the court. Thus far I have [raised 450k](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) and am looking to raise an additional 409k.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson name-checks other [sources of big money donations](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that he intends to tap. Leo Leonard of the conservative legal group the Federalist Society was looking for an extra $200,000, he says, and there were hopes for a further $1m from the US Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p>He wasn\u2019t bragging. As election day approached, money from rightwing lobby groups and corporations began to pour into Wisconsin, unseen by the public, as the message got out that Prosser\u2019s salvation was a necessary step to safeguarding Walker\u2019s radical rightwing reforms and Act 10.</p> <p>An email from March 2011, just two months after Walker took office as governor and a month before Prosser was tested at the polls, makes the point. It\u2019s from Matt Seaholm, state director of Americans For Prosperity (AFP), the Tea Party-affiliated group founded and funded by the billionaire rightwing Koch brothers. </p> <p>By now the anxiety surrounding the fate of the Wisconsin supreme court judge, David Prosser, is growing more intense. \u201cThis could stop everything that Walker is trying to accomplish and [the unions] know it. Goes without saying, that would be a bad thing,\u201d [Seaholm says](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105950-Strategy-Coordination.html#document/p7/a317545, \u201cGuardian\u201d), writing to Tim Phillips, AFP\u2019s national president. </p> <p>By 20 March, two weeks before the election, worry is distilling into panic. Brian Fraley of the Wisconsin-based conservative think-tank the MacIver Institute, shoots an impassioned plea for help to what he calls his \u201cgroup\u201d of like-minded lobbying groups and individuals, forwarded to Walker\u2019s chief of staff and other top advisers in Madison.</p> <p>[\u201cDavid Prosser is in trouble,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p6/a317546, \u201cGuardian\u201d) Fraley begins. \u201cAnd if we lose him, the Walker agenda is toast, as could be the Senate GOP majority and any successes creating a new redistricted map. That\u2019s not hyperbole.\u201d </p> <p>By the end of the bitter campaign, some $3.5m was spent by outside lobby groups channeling undisclosed corporate money to support Prosser\u2019s re-election \u2013 more than eight times the $400,000 the judge was allowed to spend himself. That included $1.5m from WCfG and its offshoot Citizens for a Strong America, and $2m from Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce (WMC), all of it in unaccountable \u201cdark money\u201d.</p> <p>It worked. [Prosser was re-elected](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/122364728.html), with a squeaky-tight margin of just 7,000 votes and after a fraught recount. The following month, Walker boasted to the Republican kingmaker, Karl Rove, \u201cClub for Growth\u2013Wisconsin was the [key to retaining Justice Prosser](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p18/a317547, \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>Act 10 was safe.</p> <p>Both of the two outside groups that channeled the recall election money (WCfG and WMC) are named as \u201cmovants\u201d of the John Doe criminal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations that was shut down under the court ruling that Prosser, having won re-election in no small part with their help, joined. Yet when it was suggested to Prosser and a second conservative judge on the court, Justice Michael Gableman, that they should recuse themselves from deliberations in the case, they both [refused](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/david-prosser-says-he-doesnt-need-to-step-aside-in-walker-probe-b99547465z1-319731971.html).</p> <p>In their [petition](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) to the US supreme court, the prosecutors challenge that refusal, arguing that \u201cthe special prosecutor did not receive a fair and impartial hearing\u201d. The petitioners go on to discuss Prosser in detail, but the passage is so heavily redacted that their argument is obscured. [They do say](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) at one point, quoting constitutional law, that \u201cNo jurist \u2018can be a judge in his own case or be permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Prosser declined to step aside citing a rule change that had been suggested and partially written by WMC itself. The change removed the obligation of supreme court judges in Wisconsin to recuse themselves in cases involving groups that had helped them secure their own elections.</p> <p>Kurt Bauer, WMC\u2019s president and CEO, declined to comment on the John Doe proceedings. But he stressed that the organization\u2019s \u201cgrassroots lobbying activities are conducted carefully within both the letter and the spirit of the state law. WMC strongly disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and will vigorously defend itself against such allegations.\u201d</p> <p>Bauer added that WMC was an independent group that was not controlled by any candidate or candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cWMC will not allow itself to be silenced from commenting about public officials and public policy. WMC has long been a proponent of the First Amendment and has a history of fighting to protect its ability to publicly express its views. WMC maintains that commitment to protecting its right to express a point of view on public policy, public officials and candidates for office as well as protecting the confidentiality of its donors.\u201d</p> <p>In a telephone interview with the Guardian, Prosser, who retired from the state supreme court in July, said that in his view sufficient time had passed between his re-election in 2011 and the judgment in the John Doe case in 2015 for any potential conflict of interest to fade. \u201cIf this had been a year after the contributions I think I would have had to withdraw, but it was four years. There was no expectation on the part of recipient or givers that the contributions were designed to effect litigation, and so the contributions raised no questions whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Prosser said that at the time of his re-election he was facing hostile TV ads that falsely tried to link him to Walker\u2019s contentious anti-union legislation Act 10, while he himself was unable directly to solicit large amounts of campaign contributions under new strict fundraising limits imposed by an earlier Democratic-controlled legislature. \u201cI certainly expected Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce sooner or later to put some money into my campaign. Of course I was going to hope that somebody would come in and defend me because I was unable to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>But the judge stressed that the only spending involved came from \u201cthird parties in which no one on my campaign knew they were coming, didn\u2019t ask for them, and frankly if they hadn\u2019t come I would have been blown out of the water by false advertising\u201d.</p> <p>Last year Prosser issued a [12-page justification](http://media.jrn.com/documents/prosserrecusal.pdf) of his refusal to recuse himself from the John Doe case. In it, he made reference to an email from an \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d that discussed raising money for a campaign \u201cto maintain the Court\u201d. The judge said the comment was \u201clittle more than evidence of the fact that some targets of the investigation ... engaged in expenditures that, under all the circumstances, were very valuable to my campaign.\u201d </p> <p>Just two weeks before writing that sentence, Judge Prosser had approved the court ruling that ordered the destruction of the John Doe files, among which was to be found the very same email to which he referred. The Guardian now publishes that [full email](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for the first time, and as a result the identity of the anonymous \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d who vowed to \u201cmaintain the Court\u201d can be revealed: RJ Johnson, \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to the governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker.</p> <p>Why it matters</p> <p>So why should we care about today\u2019s fiendishly complicated ways of funding elections? After all, isn\u2019t it a cornerstone of American democracy that everybody should be able to express themselves, under the first amendment right of free speech, after which the American people gets to have the final say at the ballot box?</p> <p>One area of possible concern raised by the John Doe files chimes with the anger and disgruntlement of voters that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have so powerfully articulated in the presidential race. If money channels are set up in secret to allow corporations and the super-wealthy to inject vast amounts of undisclosed cash into political races, the level playing field can be distorted to the benefit of corporate-friendly candidates and to the disadvantage of those representing ordinary voters.</p> <p>By the end of Scott Walker\u2019s recall election, some [$81m overall](http://www.wisdc.org/pr072512.php) was spent on the battle \u2013 equivalent to $23 for every registered voter in the state. The governor and other Republican groups and committees invested $58.7m, while his Democratic rival and supporters were only able to muster less than half that amount, $21.9m. </p> <p>\u201cThe sheer increased volume of corporate money that has been brought into elections in recent years may go more on one side than the other,\u201d explained Richard Briffault, a professor specialising in campaign finance law at Columbia law school. \u201cCorporations tend to lean more Republican.\u201d</p> <p>Briffault added that the proliferation in the modern era of outside \u201csocial welfare\u201d 501 (c) (4) organisations \u2013 the tax-exempt status enjoyed by Wisconsin Club for Growth \u2013 also raised the possibility that political donations would go hidden. As tax-exempt groups that are supposed not to be primarily political in their orientation, they do not have to disclose their donors.</p> <p>\u201cThat can be a very good device for hiding the participation of wealthy individuals,\u201d Briffault said.</p> <p>The other great anxiety addressed by campaign finance regulations is the potential for corruption. The US supreme court has said in rulings going back decades that the first amendment right to free speech is tempered by the need to protect against cash-for-favors. The court has repeatedly stated that elected officials must avoid not only the reality of corruption in their dealings with donors, but also any appearance of corruption, because even a suggestion that dollars might have been exchanged for political favors has the ability to undermine public faith in democracy.</p> <p>The justices use the legalistic phrase: quid pro quo. Literally that means \u201cthis for that\u201d; colloquially, it\u2019s the idea that if you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.</p> <p>Paradoxically, one of the most robust statements made by the US supreme court justices about the dangers of real or apparent quid pro quo was made in [Citizens United](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBgsCF8enOAhUBLhQKHYnsBJAQFggeMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.supremecourt.gov%2Fopinions%2F09pdf%2F08-205.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF2hn4fN946L-Ma8WV0AHhWPW0oKQ&amp;amp;sig2=-JV0qIhMiqsYCaGDRth_wg&amp;amp;cad=rja), their highly contentious 2010 ruling. [Citizens United](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/08-205P.ZO) extended to for-profit corporations and labor unions the same first amendments rights to engage in elections that had hitherto been enjoyed by individuals. </p> <p>Corporations were essentially treated for the first time as though they were people. Together with the related ruling in [Speechnow.org](http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/speechnow.shtml), the supreme court paved the way for the creation of Super Pacs that can make unlimited spending on political advertising to help their preferred candidates into office.</p> <p>What is less well known about Citizens United is that in it, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the opinion, addressed head-on the fear that unlimited corporate cash would lead to an explosion in real or perceived corruption in the political system. He stated forcefully that there was no danger of corruption if one important condition was met: that corporations kept their distance from the candidates they were supporting and remained fully independent of the candidates\u2019 campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201d Such separation was necessary, he added, to avoid the risk that unlimited secret donations are given \u201cas a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate\u201d.</p> <p>The problem is that the US supreme court has never defined in detail what precisely it means by \u201ccoordination\u201d between a candidate\u2019s campaign and outside groups, preferring to leave the fine print to lower courts and state legislatures. Most of the legal emphasis on coordination is on actual spending on political TV and radio ads, while the other end of the money chain \u2013 fundraising by candidates from big corporate donors channeled through third-party \u201cdark money\u201d groups that do not have to disclose their sources of income \u2013 is largely unregulated. The lack of firm rules has left players in the election game relatively free to act as they wish \u2013 one reason why prosecutions are so rarely brought, or if they are, ever completed. </p> <p>The outcome of this legal fuzziness is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where the John Doe investigation has been halted before it could even reach a decision on whether or not a full criminal inquiry was merited. That remains the legal standing of the case at present, pending the US supreme court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>But a moral question continues to hang in the air. If, as Kennedy put it, even the appearance of quid quo pro must be avoided to uphold trust in democracy, does the light shone on the modern American way of staging elections by the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian give cause for public concern?</p> <p>The lead paint mystery</p> <p>The strange case of lead paint might help answer that question. Lead, as the [terrible events](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/lead-drinking-water-level-nrdc-report-flint-crisis) of Flint, Michigan, have shown, is a potent poison that can seriously impair the intellectual ability of young children. The Flint health crisis was caused by contaminated water, but another peril to public health is the presence of the toxin in household paint before 1978, when it was banned in the US.</p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that the billionaire owner of NL Industries, one of America\u2019s leading producers of lead used in paint until the ban, secretly donated $750,000 to Wisconsin Club for Growth at a time when Walker and his fellow Republican senators were fighting their recall elections. Also in the same time-frame, the Republican-controlled senate passed, and Walker signed into law, legal changes that attempted to grant effective immunity to lead manufacturers from any compensation claims for lead paint poisoning.</p> <p>Since the laws were passed, the federal courts have stepped in and [overturned](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/appeals-court-reinstates-wisconsin-lead-paint-suit-b99317605z1-268494482.html) [key elements](http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/news/304161421.html) of them, leaving NL Industries \u2013 or National Lead Company as it was once known \u2013 still facing many legal challenges. But the point remains: had the new provisions been allowed to stand, they had the potential to save the company and others like it millions of dollars in damages.</p> <p>Lawyers working on the lawsuits argue that at stake were the rights of hundreds of children from poor urban areas whose lives were devastated by lead poisoning inhaled from paint when they were growing up. \u201cThese children were perfectly innocent. They entered life with all the gifts and health that God gave them and were devastated by this neurotoxin,\u201d said Peter Earle, the principal attorney on 171 cases that are currently ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead paint.</p> <p>The owner of NL Industries, Harold Simmons, made the [undisclosed payments to WCfG](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in three tranches between April 2011 and January 2012, precisely when the GOP senators and then Walker were facing a fight-to-the-death at the ballot box. </p> <p>Simmons, who died a year after Walker won his recall election, was a prominent funder of rightwing causes who, along with Donald Trump, was [reprimanded](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-18/news/mn-12355_1_contribution-limits) by the Federal Election Commission in the 1990s for exceeding legal limits of political campaign contributions. He [bankrolled with $3m](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=201041228&amp;cycle=2004) the notorious Swift Boat smear campaign against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election that erroneously questioned the current secretary of state\u2019s Vietnam war record.</p> <p>Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature made an initial attempt to change the law on the liability of lead paint producers shortly after Walker became governor. As the name implied, Act 2 was one of his opening gambits that he rammed through the legislature in less than a month after he came to office in January 2011. </p> <p>One of Act 2\u2019s key provisions was to tighten tort law to make it much more difficult for lead victims to sue. Under its terms, anyone injured by lead paint who wanted to issue a new lawsuit had to prove that the company they were taking on was responsible for making the specific paint that was on their walls at the time they inhaled the toxin \u2013 a practically impossible task given the number of different manufacturers and the layer-upon-layer of paint on the walls of old houses. </p> <p>The measure in effect granted immunity to NL Industries and other lead producers from any new claims for compensation. </p> <p>Less than three months after the law was enacted, Simmons arranged for the [first and largest check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) \u2013 of $500,000 \u2013 to be paid directly from Contran Corporation, his business empire, to Wisconsin Club for Growth. It landed at the time that the six senators were in their recall battles.</p> <p>Later that year, Walker\u2019s interest in soliciting more money from Simmons for use in his own personal recall election is made plain in an email among the John Doe files dated 14 November 2011. It was written by Keith Gilkes, Walker\u2019s then senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>The email was sent just one day before opponents of the governor formally triggered the recall procedure, putting Walker\u2019s job on the line. Gilkes rehearsed the names of several wealthy donors to hit up for donations, singling out Simmons and [\u201cSheldon Aldenhouse\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p61/a317549, \u201cGuardian\u201d), presumably a garbling of the name of Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate who later [donated $200,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508, \u201cGuardian\u201d) to bolster Walker\u2019s recall chances.</p> <p>The Gilkes memo sets out for Walker some of the \u201cred flags\u201d associated with Simmons and other potential corporate donors \u201cso you are aware of what you might need to defend in terms of contributions from donors when these are disclosed\u201d. He [warns Walker](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p72/a317550, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that Simmons had a controversial track record for reportedly dumping toxic waste in Texas. Gilkes pointed to [an article](http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2010/february/harold-simmons-is-dallas-most-evil-genius/) by Dallas Magazine in which the billionaire was dubbed \u201cDallas\u2019 most evil genius\u201d. The memo also notes that Simmons avoided having to pay millions of dollars in damages to pay for medical treatment for child victims of lead poisoning in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city Milwaukee after an appeals court cleared NL Industries of causing a public nuisance and dismissed a lawsuit brought by the city for [$52.6m](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/35084654.html).</p> <p>The leaked John Doe files do not record what conclusion Walker and his chief adviser reached about Simmons when they discussed him as a potential donor. What the documents do reveal is that only a month later, a [second corporate check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) from Contran Corporation for $100,000 was sent to WCfG.</p> <p>The third and final [check from Simmons](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for $150,000, also made out to WCfG, was cut the following month from his own personal account.</p> <p>At this point, the Wisconsin legislature and Governor Walker made a renewed pitch to change the law to the benefit of NL Industries and other historic manufacturers of lead paint. They had already passed Act 2, but that only covered new claims, leaving the company still facing a mountain of lawsuits that were already ongoing.</p> <p>So the legislators had another go. In the same month as the third check landed, senate Republicans introduced a bill that would make the effective immunity for former lead paint manufacturers retroactive, thereby scuppering all existing lawsuits. </p> <p>That attempt failed to pass the Wisconsin legislature. But even then the Republican group did not give up. In 2013, after all the recall elections had been fought and won, partly with the benefit of Harold Simmons\u2019 support, the legislators tried one more time to pass a bill making the immunity retroactive.</p> <p>They did so with a great deal of encouragement from NL Industries. Earle, the lawyer acting for victims, has discovered under freedom of information laws that the firm employed a professional lobbyists for [330 hours](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036372-GAB-Lobbying-Summary-Table.html), at a cost of $172,500, to persuade the Wisconsin legislature to pass the retroactive immunity bill.</p> <p>Another [Foia document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036374-EP-Memo.html#document/p5/a316185) shows that NL Industries\u2019 lobbyist directly suggested to the Republican leader in the state senate the language that should be added to existing law to make the effective immunity retroactive. The lobbyist encouraged the Republicans to write four words into an amendment that would apply the new immunity protections to all negligence lawsuits \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. </p> <p>Two months later GOP senators slipped into a [budget bill](http://www.twincities.com/2013/06/06/wisconsin-civil-litigation-provision-angers-attorney-pursuing-lead-paint-claims/) an amendment that contained the same four words proposed by NL Industries: \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. The amendment was introduced after midnight just before the bill was finalized. It can be found by anyone who looks hard enough on [page 548 of a 603-page bill](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036359-Exhibit-8-2013-WI-Act-20-Biennial-Budget.html#document/p548/a316191) that Scott Walker duly signed into law. </p> <p>NL Industries used the amendment to press for dismissal of the negligence lawsuits it was facing. But the move failed. A federal appeals court stepped in and ruled that such a retroactive granting of corporate immunity was a violation of the US constitution.</p> <p>It is perhaps worth asking what it would have meant for the victims had the amendment stood. Victims like Yasmine Clark, one of the plaintiffs. She suffered such severe poisoning from lead inhaled from residential paint in her home in Milwaukee that she was hospitalized twice, when she was two years old and again when she was five. </p> <p>When she was at rock bottom, Clark was found to have a lead level in her blood of [48 micrograms per deciliter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036375-Mushak-Report-3-13-10-Copy-1.html#document/p6/a316189) and had to undergo chelation therapy to remove the toxins. To give a sense of what that meant, doctors in Flint, Michigan, sounded the alarm after children were found to have levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter from polluted water supplies \u2013 about one-tenth of Clark\u2019s concentration.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s negligence suit, and 170 other cases like hers, are still ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead pigment paint. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to shut me down,\u201d Earle said.</p> <p>\u201cYasmine is a victim of egregiously vindictive behavior by these corporations,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe idea of freedom in the US is that no matter how poor you are you have the opportunity to surmount those disadvantages, and these lead companies took that opportunity away from her.\u201d</p> <p>As for Scott Walker, Earle said: \u201cThe governor has chosen to ignore the children and instead fought tooth and nail for the corporations that did this. I don\u2019t have words to describe that conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to Guardian questions relating to its relationship with NL Industries. NL Industries itself, and Contran Corporation, did not respond to numerous invitations to comment.</p> <p>As researchers pore over the Guardian\u2019s leaked John Doe files, seeking light amid the darkness of today\u2019s political process, they may ponder the lead paint mystery. There is no evidence that Wisconsin Republicans led by Scott Walker attempted to change the law as a favor in return for Simmons\u2019 $750,000 donation that had helped some of them win their own elections and stay in office. No charges have ever been brought.</p> <p>But is there even the slightest appearance of quid pro quo? And if potentially there is, should that be a matter that the American people care about? Give the last words to Donald Trump, the presidential nominee of Scott Walker\u2019s Grand Old Party: \u201cWhen you give to them, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian US interactive team is Aliza Aufrichtig, Kenan Davis, Jan Diehm, Rich Harris and Nadja Popovich.<br></p> <p>Additional research by Lauren Leatherby, Nicole Puglise and Mazin Sidahmed.</p> </noscript> </figure>",

Inside the base they had worse food and billets than white troops, and outside they faced harassment and assaults from police and civilians. Unlike German and Italian prisoners of war, they could not sit at the front of buses.</p> <p>Morris decided to motivate his black comrades by having them mimic the arduous training exercises done by white paratroopers. It worked. The cooks and cleaners began to feel like soldiers. White commanders, under political pressure to let black troops do more, let Morris form a 20-strong test platoon. </p> <p>White soldiers wagered that black soldiers wouldn\u2019t jump from planes.

Other black troops flocked to join them \u2013 a $50 monthly salary bonus helped \u2013 and the 555th parachute infantry company, later expanded to a battalion, was born.

Yet in keeping with his tireless commitment to progress abortion, Eckert has now undone all that by deciding that Platini should be allowed to address Uefa\u2019s congress this very Wednesday in Athens.</p> <p>Why? I note from Hans-Joachim\u2019s Wikipedia entry that he is a passionate mushroom picker, in which case we must ask if some sort of psychotropic fungus has not found its way into the Eckert basket in recent days. To what else can we possibly attribute his apparently unforced decision to give the disgraced Platini such a platform? Certainly not to Eckert\u2019s own justification \u2013 that allowing Platini to take the stage is \u201ca gesture of humanity\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/slovenian-federation-leader-aleksander-ceferin-elected-uefa-president\">Aleksander Ceferin, Slovenian federation leader, elected Uefa president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s see that shroomery in action. \u201cUefa formally asked the adjudicatory chamber of the independent ethics committee for an exception for Mr Platini to be able to make a short farewell address to its congress in Athens,\u201d declared the committee in a statement. \u201cThe chairman of the adjudicatory chamber, Mr Hans\u2011Joachim Eckert, granted this exception as a gesture of humanity.\u201d</p> <p>If you are one of those people who wonders in what other arena someone who had just been banned from said arena would be permitted to address its leading lights, you should probably just relax. I\u2019m sure the General Medical Council is for ever striking off doctors but gifting them a keynote address at the Royal Society of Medicine\u2019s annual conference, while financial fraudsters are promptly invited back to lecture Wall Street (on second thoughts, the latter probably does happen). Even so, there will be those who look at Eckert\u2019s decision-making and wonder whether dice might do a better job.</p> <p>Still, as so often in the world of Fifa, there is almost always another bigwig behaving in a sufficiently more questionable way to distract from yourself. And in this case, it has to be the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino. I don\u2019t want to go out on a limb here, but I can\u2019t help feeling Gianni\u2019s days as a blandly smiling cipher are rapidly drawing to a close. As you\u2019d expect with someone a mere six months into their new job \u2013 and a mere two months after he declared Fifa\u2019s image crisis to be over \u2013 Infantino has already been interviewed by Eckert\u2019s ethics committee. He was cleared of any violations, with little things like his refusal to even sign an employment contract \u2013 he is a lawyer \u2013 and a number of private jet flights regarded as par for the course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/michel-platini-declares-clear-conscience-uefa-congress-speech\">Michel Platini declares he has clear conscience in Uefa congress speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thus he is in Athens to welcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/slovenian-federation-leader-aleksander-ceferin-elected-uefa-president\" title=\"\">the election of a new Uefa president</a>, the Slovenian FA president Aleksander Ceferin. Like Infantino, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/uefa-president-election-backroom-talks-michel-platini\" title=\"\">Ceferin has risen without trace</a>, yet has beaten Michael van Praag of the Netherlands, whose outspoken criticism of Blatter over the past few years may be regarded as a blot on his company copybook. Infantino has dismissed reports his staff lobbied for Ceferin, meaning it is entirely coincidental that his campaign was launched shortly after Infantino led a delegation to Slovenia to open a new national football centre.</p> <p>Even so, I think my favourite coincidental connection in all of this is the one between Ceferin and Tomaz Vesel, another Slovenian whom Fifa has just appointed to independently audit its annual income, and Infantino\u2019s salary and bonuses. Would you believe that Ceferin and Vesel play on the same Slovenian football team? I know \u2013 what are the chances?</p> <p>Whatever you do, don\u2019t go putting two and two together to make four. When a connection is this blatant, in this sort of plain sight, it can only be unimpeachable. As Infantino himself put it: there is no conflict or cronyism here. \u201cEveryone plays football, everyone loves football,\u201d he explained in terms that would defo get him off the hook in a formal compliance setting \u2013 or certainly a compliance setting presided over by one of the men in question. As the Fifa boss continued: \u201cIt\u2019s good that people [who] love football work in football as well.\u201d</p> <p>Well quite. The family that plays together stays together \u2013 it was ever thus with the Fifa family. As Infantino was stressing just before the vote: \u201cI just hope the one who will be elected will work in a positive way with me as well. A strong Fifa needs a strong Uefa.\u201d And if it all sounds an unnaturally close relationship and as outrageously suspicious as it ever was \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjSshSvQWQA\" title=\"\">well, forget it.

As a result <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/economic-vision\">Trump\u2019s \u201ceconomic vision\u201d</a> includes goals like:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>And in <a href=\"http://sciencedebate.org/20answers\">the 2016 Science Debate</a>, although he did pay <a href=\"http://sciencedebate.org/20answers#7\">brief, vague lip service to renewable energy</a>, Trump entirely <a href=\"http://sciencedebate.org/20answers#3\">dodged the question about climate science</a>, devoting a single dismissive sentence to one of the most important issues we face today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>There is still much that needs to be investigated in the field of \u201cclimate change.\u201d </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s detailed answers provided a stark contrast to Trump\u2019s brief and vague responses.<br></p> <h2>Republican AGs take Big Oil donations, attack the Clean Power Plan<br></h2> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.exposedbycmd.org/RAGA-Clean-Power-Plan\">investigative journalists at the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) uncovered</a> a blatant example of the fossil fuel industry buying influence to undermine government efforts to tackle climate change:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Fossil fuel giants Murray Energy and Southern Company paid for meetings with Republican attorneys general to discuss their opposition to the Clean Power Plan less than two weeks before the same GOP officials petitioned federal courts to block the Obama administration\u2019s signature climate proposal, according to private emails</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Coincidentally, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-campaign-taps-gop-energy-lobbyist-as-adviser-228059\">Trump\u2019s newest adviser is a former lobbyist for Southern Company</a>.<br></p> <p>These fossil fuel companies were offered the opportunity to meet with GOP attorneys general in exchange for financial donations to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) to help fund their re-election campaigns. The documents revealed that the attorneys then discussed \u201cthe future of the fight to stop the Clean Power Plan.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>According to materials reviewed by CMD, since 2015 RAGA has received at least $100,000 from ExxonMobil, $350,000 from Koch Industries, $85,000 from Southern Company, $378,250 from the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), and $250,000 from Murray Energy. In total, fossil fuel interests, utilities and their trade groups have given more than $2.25 million to RAGA since 2015.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Subsequently, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-13/obama-climate-change-rules-fought-as-states-seek-delay\">15 Republican attorneys general took the Clean Power Plan to court</a> to stop the Obama Administration\u2019s efforts to cut carbon pollution. As CMD research director Nick Surgey <a href=\"http://www.exposedbycmd.org/RAGA-Clean-Power-Plan\">put it</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>State attorneys general are supposed to enforce the law and serve the public interest, but instead these Republican officials have hung a \u2018For Sale\u2019 sale on their door, and the fossil fuel industry proved to be the highest bidder. It\u2019s no coincidence that GOP attorneys general have mounted an aggressive fight alongside the fossil fuel industry to block the Clean Power Plan \u2013 that appears to be exactly what the industry paid for. Together, these documents reveal a sustained pattern of collusion between the fossil fuel industry and the Republican attorneys general on climate change obstructionism.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The situation is not dissimilar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general\">Trump\u2019s donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi</a>, who soon thereafter decided against pursuing an investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-university-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general-fraud\">Trump University\u2019s allegedly fraudulent activities</a>. The Miami Herald suggested that Bondi was <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article82634527.html\">\u201cbought and paid for\u201d</a> in the Trump University case. Bondi is also among the Republican attorneys general taking the Clean Power Plan to court.<br></p> <h2>Big Oil calls the shots for the GOP in all branches<br></h2> <p>And of course just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a Resolution</a> condemning a carbon tax for no apparent reason, except for possible pressure from fossil fuel industry campaign donors.</p> <p>Big Oil thus appears to be calling the shots for Republican Party leaders at their highest levels in all three branches of US government \u2013 the executive (presidential nominee), judicial (attorneys general), and legislative (members of Congress). And the attorneys general are trying to stop the efforts of the current executive branch (Obama Administration) to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change.</p> <p>This may be a contributing factor to the historically low approval of Congress today, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/192440/republicans-continue-rate-gop-led-congress-poorly.aspx\">even among Republican voters</a>. Just <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/2167/energy.aspx\">21% of Americans think</a> the US should emphasize more fossil fuel production, as opposed to 73% who favor a focus on renewable energy. <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/poll-voters-want-pretty-much-the-opposite-of-what-congress-is-doing-5bc936a668c6#.cuv1wvazc\">82% of Americans favor government limits on carbon pollution</a>. Yet the positions of Republican Party leaders in all branches of government are the polar opposite.</p> <p>The only reason they haven\u2019t paid the electoral price is that Republican voters don\u2019t yet view climate change as a priority, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/06/conservative-media-bias-is-inflating-american-climate-denial-and-polarization\">due in large part to conservative media bias</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/08/climate-change-louisiana-floods-increased-risk\">as climate change impacts become increasingly undeniable</a>, sooner or later the GOP will be held accountable for selling out the wellbeing of the American people to Big Oil.<br></p>",

She wants to look after the old and sick Australians but without the growing tax base from migration.

She said she understood the trepidation over Indigenous recognition, the idea of asking for recognition again was difficult.

Those opposite don\u2019t believe in some of the flexibility measures that would actually deliver for individuals the ability to contribute more into their superannuation to provide more in their retirement. We on this side think it\u2019s important to protect those flexibility measures, which is why we have argued so strongly for them.</p> </blockquote> <p>(This is interesting because it is the next obvious policy area for Labor and the Coalition to cooperate on after the budget cuts.

She started the piece with former Labor leader and US ambassador Kim Beazley, backing in Turnbull on the Kevin Rudd nomination for UN secretary general. Beazley\u2019s conversations with the prime minister confirm the view that Turnbull did not consider Rudd a suitable candidate. And that a government could not nominate someone without endorsing. She uses the example for a wider point.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Beazley\u2019s intervention forces us to think again about this incident, and opens a wider appraisal of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership than has generally been seen in the orgy of words marking 12 months since he toppled Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Much has been made in the past year \u2013 and the past week \u2013 of the high expectations voters had that Turnbull would transform politics and their disappointment that he has not.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s performance is rated in terms of these expectations. Many of those who criticise him notably do so because he has not delivered what they particularly want.</p> <p>On the left, there is disappointment on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. On the right, the criticism is he hasn\u2019t done enough on tax reform, budget repair and industrial relations.</p> <p>But there is very little said about the way the Turnbull prime ministership actually works. Whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it is certainly a very, very different prime ministership.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be blunt here. This is a bloke who is not particularly good at retail politics, nor particularly concerned about running to the beat of the retail politics drum.</p> <p>As one cabinet minister says, \u201cYou will observe that a particular issue isn\u2019t quite zooming down the ski slope politically and he thinks that\u2019s fine, he\u2019s relaxed. He doesn\u2019t mind things being a bit \u2018off piste\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet all those who have moaned about three-word slogans and politicians driven by the 24-hour media cycle and \u201cannounceables\u201d still don\u2019t seem happy with an approach so conspicuously lacking such frenzy.</p> <p>Few doubt Turnbull\u2019s intellectual capacities. But few also observe that the prime minister sees his job foremost as head of the \u201cOffice of Wicked Problems\u201d, not first as the beating heart of a political organisation focused on winning the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Discuss.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:57:25.318Z\">at 12.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d88e46e4b067ad3008770e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:44:59.757Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bowen says, hey government, there is more we can do to fix the budget together.

Hillary Rodham did not even take her husband\u2019s name until 1982, when her husband who lost his bid for re-election as governor was trying to get back into power \u2013 that is when she began to go by Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, in his speaking slot at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton-speech-hillary-democratic-convention\">Democratic national convention</a> in July, spun the story of his marriage as classic fairytale romance. \u201cI met a girl,\u201d he began, recounting his awe-struck state upon meeting Hillary Clinton in the Yale law library in 1971, and how he finally won her heart, asking three times for her hand in marriage before he got a yes.</p> <p>The story as told by Bill Clinton, was said to be an attempt to \u201chumanise\u201d his wife, left out the messy real-life bits, as fairytales do, in his case the epic cheating and lying, the lacerating public humiliation that risked his presidency and smolders still in the background of Hillary\u2019s presidential ambitions, fanned by the comments of internet trolls. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s testimonial and his repeated assertions that she was \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever seen\u201d did little to address the other questions about their extraordinary partnership, and really the ones that matter most: how did a formidable couple manage their respective ambitions?</p> <p>It is easy to ask, as many do, whether Hillary Clinton would ever have had a shot at being the first female president if she wasn\u2019t married to Bill Clinton, whether she exploited her position as first lady to jump on to a relatively safe New York Senate seat, and whether she once again used her husband\u2019s connections to major donors and Democratic party grandees to fix the race against Bernie Sanders in her second run for the White House. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d/0_0_1979_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billary1 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"980\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the default sexist question.</p> <p>But maybe the real question is whether Bill Clinton, who had already lost one election by the time of his marriage, would have succeeded in becoming America\u2019s youngest governor and one of the country\u2019s most popular presidents without Hillary Clinton by his side? Maybe Bill Clinton held her back \u2013 and Hillary Clinton would have got there any way, or even sooner.</p> <p>Those who befriended the young couple as they embarked on married life in the college town of Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the 1970s asked early versions of those same questions about balancing ambition within a marriage.</p> <p>The friendships they made during that first year of married life were lasting. Morriss and Ann Henry, who hosted that wedding reception, were lawyers and had held public office, like the Clintons. They were in Philadelphia when Clinton formally accepted the nomination. So was Margaret Whillock, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s first guide to southern living. Diane Blair, a close confidante from those days, died of cancer in 2000, but she kept extensive notes of their conversations, which are housed in the University of Arkansas.</p> <p>A look-back through time is always faulty. People project present-day realities \u2013 in this case Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee \u2013 on their memories. But when the friends first met in the 1970s, Bill and Hillary Clinton both seemed headed for prominent positions in public life. According to their friends, it was an open question who would get there first, and at what personal cost.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a perfect fall day in the Ozarks \u2013 warm sun, cloudless blue sky, with a hint of coolness in the air, and the Razorbacks were playing a home game. Craig and Margaret Whillock\u2019s house was just down the street from the law school where Bill and Hillary Clinton taught. </p> <p>Craig Whillock, a former state representative and aide to a local member of Congress, had been one of Bill Clinton\u2019s earliest mentors when he came back home to Arkansas.</p> <p>When Bill Clinton announced he wanted to run for Congress, against a longtime Republican incumbent, Whillock ran up to get his contacts book, and drove the newcomer all over the district making introductions, according to his widow, Margaret.</p> <p>The Whillocks often opened up their home to large football parties, and on one glorious afternoon in 1974, Margaret Whillock looked up to see Hillary Clinton at the back door. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary\u2019s pay records show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband who was on $16,182</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was something about her that was so compelling,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cI saw her out of the kitchen door, framed in the door watching the crowd, and she had on a white dress and I thought: \u2018She is going to be important to me\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>The Whillocks were already playing surrogate parents to both Clintons. Bill Clinton regularly used to drop in for dinner with the family, on his way home from a teaching job at the law school. When Hillary Clinton decided to pay a visit and eventually take a job at the law school herself, Bill Clinton asked Margaret Whillock to show her around. </p> <p>He was desperate for Hillary Clinton to like Arkansas, to like it enough to stay, Margaret Whillock said.</p> <p>\u201cBill Clinton was so excited she was coming to Fayetteville. He was thrilled out of his mind. He wanted her to like it here. He wanted her to meet people. I think he realized what a jewel he had in her.\u201d</p> <p>Whillock was working full-time as a school teacher and she had six children at home. That did not deter Bill. \u201cHe said: \u2018You have to have her over. You have to have her over,\u201d she said. </p> <p>So on Clinton\u2019s second day of work at the law school, Whillock invited her for lunch and the women became friends.</p> <p>Even then Hillary Clinton was a high-flyer \u2013 certainly in Arkansas where she was among the first women teaching in the law faculty, and a leader in expanding legal services to the poor \u2013 at a time when judges barred women from taking on rape cases on the grounds that they could not cope with the unpleasantness.<br></p> <p>She was an ambitious, east coast liberal in a hurry in a small, southern town that operated at a slower, gentler pace, especially where gender roles were concerned. Women \u2013 if they did work outside the home \u2013 were mainly confined to feminine professions like teaching and nursing. </p> <p>\u201cShe was different because she was interested in things,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cShe did things differently. She wasn\u2019t into going shopping too much and that kind of thing.\u201d<br></p> <p> Clinton was one of just 27 women in her graduating class at Yale law school. In Arkansas, there was an even bigger gender imbalance. She was among the first female professors at the law school, winning the job over 39 male and two other female applicants.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>And she earned more than her husband from the very beginning of their marriage. Both were employed to teach at the University of Arkansas law school. Hillary\u2019s pay records for the 1974-1975 academic year show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband, who was on $16,182 in his second year at the law school, and she would continue to outpace him on pay for her short time there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe/0_0_786_538/500.png\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton pay\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s starting salary was $16,450.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also had a broader portfolio of responsibilities, teaching criminal procedure and establishing a legal aid clinic, and she came with glowing recommendations from her professors and supervisors at her previous jobs.</p> <p>By the end of that year, after Bill Clinton won his election as attorney general, the couple were on their way to Little Rock. Their lives as private citizens were over. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton would face much closer scrutiny over her conduct as a wife: her decision to keep her last name, to hold down a demanding job, and to take on big policy projects, such as her successful overhaul of Arkansas\u2019s public schools, which had been ranked worst in the country.</p> <p>She saw even then the possibilities of using her position as the first lady of Arkansas to make change \u2013 if not always the perils, according to Henry, whose husband Morriss had served as a state senator. </p> <p>\u201cShe was talking about Eleanor Roosevelt. That was her role model and mentor kind of thing,\u201d Henry recalled. \u201cI was saying sometimes you have to be careful and you can only do so much and then there is a backlash.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton disagreed, citing Roosevelt\u2019s activism as first lady. \u201cI said by the time Eleanor Roosevelt was so involved in politics, that marriage was all over and I am married with three children,\u201d Henry said.</p> <p>She was not clear whether Clinton really saw her point.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Diane Blair was a prodigious taker of notes \u2013 on yellow legal pads, note paper with silly cartoons, and in typed records of hour-long phone conversations with Hillary Clinton when the then first lady was having some down time at Camp David. </p> <p>Blair\u2019s reflections on her close friend take up 16 boxes of her papers at the University of Arkansas \u2013 pages scrawled with references to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s ballet lessons, the flannel nightgown Hillary Clinton wore in the living quarters, and other intimate details of her friend\u2019s life in the White House.</p> <p>But the essence boils down to this, Blair writes at one point, paraphrasing her friend: Bill Clinton was the duck. Hillary Clinton was the decoy. As the wife, Hillary Clinton was constantly under attack for exhibiting traits that might be admired in a man. </p> <p>Her intelligence and tenacity \u2013 which would have been an asset in a man \u2013 made people uncomfortable, according to pollsters. She needed to project a softer side. </p> <p>And Clinton told Blair, the White House operatives went along with that because it directed the criticism away from Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>Clinton was also getting tired of the criticism of her appearance. \u201cI gave up my name, got contact lenses. But I\u2019m not going to try to present to be someone that I\u2019m not,\u201d she told Blair.</p> <p>\u201cShe has about come to the conclusion that no matter what she does is going to piss off some people, so will just continue to be herself and let everybody else make whatever adjustments they have to.\u201d</p> <p>From her privileged position as confidante, Blair also served as a sounding board for Clinton at the bleakest moments during her time as first lady, when she was confronted with her husband\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>It seems clear even then, when the humiliation was still fresh, that Clinton never seriously contemplated divorce. \u201cHe has been her best friend for 25 years, her husband for 23 years, they\u2019re connected in every way imaginable, she feels strongly about him and family and Chelsea and marriage and she\u2019s just got to try to work it through,\u201d Blair wrote in her notes. \u201cShe is not trying to excuse him. It was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it.\u201d</p> <p>Blair goes on to record Clinton\u2019s efforts to rationalise her husband\u2019s behaviour \u2013 because of the pressure he was under as president, his early upbringing, and to dismiss its importance. </p> <p>Ultimately, Clinton forgave her husband. \u201cShe\u2019s in it for long haul,\u201d Blair wrote. \u201cBecause she\u2019s stubborn; partly her upbringing; partly her pride \u2013 but, mostly because she knows who she is and what her values and priorities are and she\u2019s straight with those \u2013 she really is OK.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Nine months later, in July 1999, Blair flew to DC for a visit, arriving at the White House to find Bill Clinton practicing his putting, and Hillary Clinton lounging by the pool. </p> <p>That evening Blair found the couple in the solarium, with Bill Clinton helping Hillary Clinton with a speech \u2013 trying to make it punchier. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear how much she values his advice and editorial skills,\u201d Blair wrote. When Clinton came back from the event, she thanked her husband for his help.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s second act had begun. She spent her final months as first lady launching her run for the Senate seat in New York. From here on, it would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s ambitions taking center stage, and Bill Clinton offering back-up support.</p> <p>And, the old Arkansas friends said, Bill Clinton was entirely fine with that. The admiration he had for Hillary Clinton all those years before was still alive, they insisted.</p> <p>\u201cThe way he talks about her and the way she talks about him,\u201d said Margaret Whillock, visited the family in Chappaqua when Clinton was in the Senate. \u201cOne time he said Hillary got this great new dress for the Met opening or something like that. He knew those things. He was glad. He was proud of her.\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cYou could just tell.\u201d</p>",

According to <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1181a12016Election.pdf\">a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll</a>, Hillary Clinton has a 50-40 lead over her Republican rival in a demographic that Mitt Romney won by six points in 2012 despite his decisive loss that year.</p> <p>Trump called for making a childcare tax deductible, up to the average cost in a given family\u2019s state, until the age of 13, as well as an expanded rebate of up to $1,200 for those families that do not pay income tax and receive earned income tax credit (EITC). </p> <p>Further, Trump said his plan would provide six weeks of maternity leave \u201cto any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit\u201d by tackling fraud in unemployment insurance. For the six-week period, the mother would receive the equivalent to unemployment benefits while she is out of the workplace. This would not apply to fathers, though.</p> <p>Trump also strangely asserted that \u201cmy opponent has no childcare plan\u201d. Clinton has made a number of detailed proposals on childcare. The Democratic nominee <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/early-childhood-education/\">first outlined a program</a> for universal pre-kindergarten in June 2015 and in May 2016 proposed to cap childcare costs at 10% of household income and to introduce 12 weeks of paid family leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88d5e3fe124d7f9fe62af58fe41a68deb0f91cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88d5e3fe124d7f9fe62af58fe41a68deb0f91cbe/0_39_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds her son as Donald Trump speaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman holds her son as Donald Trump speaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton campaign held a conference call for reporters on Tuesday to rebut Trump\u2019s plan, which they characterized with audible disdain. </p> <p>Maya Harris, a senior policy adviser to the former secretary of state, described Trump\u2019s plan as \u201chalf-baked and completely out of touch\u201d.

But even as he was interrupted with chants of \u201cthank you\u201d midway through his remarks, the president sought to refocus the attention on his preferred successor.</p> <p>He voiced his frustration with how the election was being covered, seemingly assigning some of the blame with a narrative-driven media. He did not mention this week\u2019s frenzy over Clinton\u2019s health and renewed rancor among the press over transparency within her campaign, but admonished reporters for creating a false equivalency between the two nominees, in part because Trump\u2019s penchant for controversy has meant that \u201cour standard for what\u2019s normal has changed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mind if I just vent for a second?\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou don\u2019t grade the presidency on a curve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to debate transparency, you have one candidate in this debate who\u2019s released decades worth of her tax returns,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other candidate is the first in decades who refuses to release any at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c37ba2f3a8aec63f4326f44fc4748771eb12c6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c37ba2f3a8aec63f4326f44fc4748771eb12c6a5/0_260_5298_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama gestures during a rally for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, outside the art museum in Philadelphia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama gestures during a rally for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, outside the art museum in Philadelphia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who believed in his agenda should vote for Clinton in November, he said, deeming her the most qualified individual to ever aspire to the presidency.

  "<p>New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has opened an inquiry into the conduct of the Donald J Trump Foundation, the personal charity of the Republican presidential nominee, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to the Guardian.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/eric-schneiderman-donald-trump-foundation/index.html\">an interview</a> with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Schneiderman said Tuesday that he had been \u201clooking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it\u2019s complying with the laws governing charities in New York\u201d.</p> <p>The source said that Schneiderman \u201copened an inquiry on the Trump Foundation based on troubling transactions that have recently come to light.\u201d<br></p> <p>Schneiderman said \u201cmy interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of non-profits in New York state, and we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had correspondence with them.

Trump has claimed that Schneiderman, a Democrat, is pursuing the lawsuit for political reasons.</p> <p>In a statement, Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to the Trump campaign, said: \u201cAttorney General Eric Schneiderman is a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years and has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. This is nothing more than another leftwing hit job designed to distract from Crooked Hillary Clinton\u2019s disastrous week.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s charity has long been under sustained scrutiny for other reasons. An extensive investigation of the Trump Foundation by David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/12/there-were-five-phantom-donations-in-the-files-of-donald-trumps-foundation-heres-what-we-know/\">has found several instances</a> where the charity reported donations that were not made as well as several items bought with the foundation\u2019s money that may have been for Trump\u2019s personal use. These would represent violations of IRS rules governing not-for-profit groups.</p> <p>Further, despite claims to the contrary from Trump\u2019s campaign, it appears the Republican nominee <a href=\"Politico%20report%20on%20NYAG%20investigation%20of%20Trump%20Foundation\">has not given any money</a> to his charity since 2008 and only made a single charitable donation of less than $10,000 until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/29/donald-trump-republican-debate-iowa\">his fundraising event</a> in January 2016 to raise money for veterans. The event was held by Trump in lieu of participating in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses.</p>"
