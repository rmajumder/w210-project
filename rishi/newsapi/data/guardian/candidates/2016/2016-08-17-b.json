  "<p>Remember that kid you played checkers with (or kick-the-can, Dungeons and Dragons, Nintendo, etc, depending on your age) who would claim \u201cNOT FAIR! YOU\u2019RE CHEATING\u201d whenever you would capture one of his checkers? </p> <p>Then, just before you won the game, he would knock the board over and say, \u201cI hate this game!\u201d At every birthday party he demanded the biggest piece of cake with the most frosting and threw a fit if he didn\u2019t get it. That kid is Donald Trump. </p> <p>A full three months before the first vote is even counted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">Trump is claiming</a> that the system is rigged. He\u2019s claiming that the only way Hillary Clinton can win is if she cheats. To ensure that the election isn\u2019t taken away from him like the cake he thinks he\u2019s entitled to, Trump has added a new \u201cvolunteer\u201d opportunity to his website:</p> <p>\u201cHelp Me Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election! Please fill out this form to receive more information about becoming a volunteer Trump Election Observer.\u201d </p> <p>There\u2019s no information on what being an \u201celection observer\u201d actually entails.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never done a scientific study on voter fraud, but I do have some street cred as far as ballot integrity goes. In California I\u2019m usually the <a href=\"http://www.calnewsroom.com/2014/06/26/5-things-to-know-about-recounts-from-jimmy-camp/\">first guy they call</a> when there\u2019s a close election. The call usually comes around midnight on election night. Right about the time I\u2019m either drowning my sorrows over a loss with a single malt scotch or celebrating a win with cheap bubbles.</p> <p>I have spent hundreds of hours in the back rooms of county election offices in multiple states going over ballots. Looking at signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. Counting the number of votes cast per precinct compared to the number of registered voters. Trying to determine the slightest anomaly that would swing the election, the will of the people, one way or the other. On average I can usually come up with 10 or 12 votes in a city council race, state assembly, or statewide race, that otherwise shouldn\u2019t be there. But in the decades I\u2019ve been involved in politics, I\u2019ve never come across a case of widespread voter fraud that could swing the outcome of an election.</p> <p>If you really wanted to swing an election on a national level in a presidential race, here\u2019s how it would be done. Listen up, Hillary:</p> <ul> <li>Bring on a national voter fraud coordinator. (Perhaps the Clinton Foundation could pay for the program?)<br></li> <li>Hire a statewide voter fraud coordinator that answered to the national voter fraud coordinator in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.<br></li> <li>Enlist a county voter fraud coordinator in each of the targeted states.</li> </ul> <p>Each county coordinator in the targeted state would place ads on Craigslist recruiting supporters who were willing to commit a felony and vote multiple times. The ad would read: </p> <p>VOTERS NEEDED IN POLK COUNTY</p> <p><em>Are you a voter in Polk County willing to commit voter fraud in order to swing an election? Are you outgoing and not afraid to talk to people? If so, please respond and you will be given instructions on how to register to vote multiple times using different names and then how to apply for absentee ballots sent right to your home in the names of the fraudulent voters you registered under.</em></p> <p>Then, and only then, if the thousands of people they enlisted actually followed through, they could swing a presidential election. That is assuming the thousands involved in the conspiracy could keep a secret and not Instagram or Tweet about it so the media, the opposing campaign and the justice department didn\u2019t pick up on the scheme.</p> <p>So the big question now is, what exactly will Trump\u2019s \u201celection observers\u201d be doing? They could show up at polling places and attempt to intimidate voters they don\u2019t believe \u201clook\u201d like a voter. Perhaps Trump would encourage his observers to \u201crough them up a little bit\u201d or \u201cpunch them in the face\u201d. Sounds absurd right? No, it doesn\u2019t. It sounds like a scenario that should be expected based on past behavior.</p> <p>Trump no longer believes he can win this election and many have speculated that he never really wanted to be president in the first place. Donald hates to lose. So rather than losing gracefully and conceding and wishing the winner well as almost every single presidential candidate in recent history has done, he is knocking over the checkerboard like a spoiled brat.</p>",

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a certain degree of trepidation in the markets today, with indices selling off sharply in anticipation of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s last meeting, due out this evening. The July FOMC meeting took place after market fears had subsided in the wake of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership, with the statement citing diminished near-term risks. If the committee no longer believes external factors are worth worrying about, then a 2016 rate hike is a distinct possibility. Given that much of the post-referendum surge in stocks has come from dovish monetary policy implications, hawkish comments are likely to exacerbate the weakness we are already seeing for markets today.</p> <p>Today\u2019s UK jobs report is significant in the post-referendum world, with Brexiteer jeers ringing out as they use the figures to back their argument that the pro-remain camp was fear-mongering with its warnings over the impact on the economy. It is certainly too early to say how the UK economy will react to the referendum result and eventual Brexit from the EU, but today\u2019s surprise decrease in July claimants suggests that businesses are waiting it out rather than making any rash judgements of the implications.</p> <p>Comments from Germany\u2019s European Affairs Minister hinting that the UK may be able to obtain a \u201cspecial status\u201d post-Brexit are an encouraging signal ahead of the exit negotiations. Once article 50 is enacted, any perceived developments within trade discussions are sure to be significant volatility drivers in the markets, raising the prospect of two years of unpredictability.</p> <p>The number one concern within the city is whether the UK will retain passporting rights, and success on this issue could define whether negotiations are perceived as a success or failure within financial markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b4757ae4b062ce4d2243fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T14:46:02.004Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks in surprise weekly drop</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And now oil is recovering some ground after the US inventory figures showed an unexpected fall last week.</p> <p>The Energy Information Administration said crude stocks dropped by 2.5m barrels compared to forecasts of a 522,000 increase.

You can never tell if Teleprompter Trump believes what he\u2019s saying \u2013 he has the demeanour of a drugged-up show-trial defendant \u2013 but his plan for an immigrant screening test for \u201cthose who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles\u201d would be but the latest addition to America\u2019s inglorious history of ideological exclusion. Efforts to deny non-right-thinking foreigners access to American soil goes as far back as the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, but the banning of immigrants harbouring a specific ideology dates to the Anarchist Exclusion Act of 1903, which for good measure also excluded people with epilepsy.</p> <p>As a preventive measure, the act wasn\u2019t terribly effective. History doesn\u2019t record how many epilepsy sufferers slipped through the net, but between 1903 and 1914 only 15 anarchists were denied entry to the US. The 1918 Immigration Act broadened the definition of anarchism with the hope of deporting more foreign troublemakers, but by then the idea of blaming anarchists for everything that was wrong with America was beginning to seem a little old hat.</p> <p>Communism was the fashionable ideology of exclusion by the time the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act was introduced to protect the American way of life from evil forces such as Doris Lessing, who was refused a visa after she joined the Communist party. McCarran-Walter, cited in a Trump press release footnote as a cold war precedent for exactly the kind of thing he\u2019s talking about, also prevented homosexuals from entering the US, a restriction that wasn\u2019t officially scrapped until 1990.</p> <p>Times have certainly changed \u2013 Trump specifically mentioned radical Islam\u2019s \u201coppression of gays\u201d to illustrate the need for extreme vetting \u2013 but if tolerance of alternative lifestyles is part of his proposed entrance exam, one wonders how many of his own supporters would pass the test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dd0ed1c923c8ac1c1cd437eaab70a706dd8255f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dd0ed1c923c8ac1c1cd437eaab70a706dd8255f/0_573_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sacotherapy retreat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018According to a new study, mindfulness is no more calming than lying around watching old TV documentaries.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fortune favours the inert</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Over many years certain benefits have accrued to me simply by virtue of my doing nothing.

There were no significant differences between the two sets in sleeping, eating habits, smoking reduction or biochemical stress response.</p> <p>The study leaders cautioned against reading too much into the findings, not least because 28 of the participants \u2013 including a quarter of the mindfulness group \u2013 quit before the test was concluded.

The sharp-tongued Texan, who had the misfortune to be Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s vice-president during the great man\u2019s first two terms, once <a href=\"https://www.cah.utexas.edu/news/press_release.php?press=press_bucket\" title=\"\">observed</a> that the number two job wasn\u2019t worth \u201ca bucket of warm spit\u201d.</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s quoted as a pitcher\u2019s worth, sometimes a quart, occasionally the liquid in question is warm piss. But everyone gets <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nance_Garner\" title=\"\">Garner</a>\u2019s drift: he regretted taking the job. Roosevelt\u2019s next veep, Henry Wallace, got dropped for being leftwing. The one after that lucked out. Unassuming Harry Truman succeeded to the Oval Office when the ailing president died three weeks before Hitler in April 1945. In August he got to drop the bomb.</p> <p>That\u2019s the whole point. A US vice-president\u2019s job is basically about hanging around, to be there just in case. You don\u2019t even get much training. It\u2019s history\u2019s posh lottery.</p> <p>The British <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">deputy premiership</a> is exactly the same but different. Like most things about our flexibly unwritten constitution \u2013 so different from all those carefully written ones \u2013 being deputy prime minister has no formal status or duties, let alone an office to call one\u2019s own. We can go for years without having one.</p> <p>Where the deputy prime minister is comparable to the Washington number two job is that the incumbent (when there is one) can make a little or a lot of it and is also well placed to pitch for the succession if that\u2019s the way he/she is inclined. Some aren\u2019t and it rarely works anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad/0_176_2723_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winston Churchill and his then deputy Clement Attlee.

Clement Attlee ran domestic policy in the wartime coalition while Churchill ran the war. Modest and loyal, he was bumped up to deputy prime minister in 1942 and surprised everyone by trouncing the war hero in the 1945 general election. Prime minister for the next six years, the welfare state and decolonisation of the empire are his memorial.</p> <p>Herbert Morrison, deputy prime minister during Attlee\u2019s entire tenure, was neither modest nor loyal. Peter Mandelson\u2019s grandfather thought he should have been prime minister and made no secret of it. An inveterate plotter, he even stood for leader at 67 when Attlee finally retired in 1955, but got hammered by Hugh Gaitskell, 18 years his junior.</p> <p>Never mind, Herbert. It could have been worse. You might have won and made a complete pig\u2019s ear of the job, which is what happened to Churchill\u2019s glamorous heir-all-too-apparent, Sir Anthony Eden. As an anti-appeasement ally and foreign secretary through the war, Eden had been waiting for the old boy to call it a day for years and was made deputy prime minister (and foreign secretary) when the Tories returned to power in 1951.</p> <p>Having survived a secret stroke in 1953 and resisted robust hints, Churchill, who rightly suspected the highly strung Eden wasn\u2019t up to the job, finally went at 90. Eden took over, won a snap election and ruined himself within 18 months with the doomed invasion of the Suez canal. Being deputy prime minister with high expectations was no longer looking such a good bet. Richard \u201cRab\u201d Butler, deputy prime minister (1962-63) in the dying days of Harold Macmillan\u2019s government, was a brilliant administrator who ran Keynesian domestic policy in the 50s, but was unloved. When Macmillan was forced out after the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Profumo-affair\" title=\"\">Profumo affair</a>, he helped stitch up the succession against Rab for the second time.</p> <p>No wonder everyone went off the deputy PM habit for a while. Then in 1979 the first woman prime minister shored up her position by making her defeated rival, Willie Whitelaw, her deputy. Loyal and shrewd (\u201cEvery prime minister needs a Willie,\u201d Mrs Thatcher explained in what may or may not have been her only joke), Whitelaw, who was also home secretary to start with, lasted until 1988, trusted, loved and unambitious.</p> <p>The following year Mrs T revived the office for her estranged former ally, Sir Geoffrey Howe, a consolation prize for having sacked him as foreign secretary. Howe was furious and his team boasted that he would run a chain of powerful committees. In reality he was marginalised. When he resigned and made a devastating Commons attack on her increasingly autocratic style it was a rare example of a dormouse killing a lion. Thatcher was out within a month.</p> <p>John Major, after moving into No 10, also had a deputy PM for tactical, back-protecting party reasons. Michael Heseltine, whom he had defeated, proved a loyal ally against the Eurosceptic \u201cbastards\u201d and was given the title after Major fought off a leadership challenge by one of them, John \u201cVulcan\u201d Redwood, in 1995.</p> <p>What could be more natural than that Tony Blair, a novice to high office, should do the same for John Prescott, his own defeated rival and New Labour\u2019s ambassador to the northern working class, when he moved into Downing Street in 1997. Prezza started out with a mega-ministry, gradually disassembled amid political and personal turbulence. But he kept the deputy prime minister title and left with Blair in 2007. Again, core loyalty was a key to survival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ead944eedb6c5a4ef51f5d06b0ee589a7b1ddf86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead944eedb6c5a4ef51f5d06b0ee589a7b1ddf86/0_58_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair and deputy prime minister John Prescott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair and then deputy prime minister John Prescott. \u2018Core loyalty was a key to survival.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gordon Brown was his own deputy prime minister, but David Cameron found it expedient to make Nick Clegg, his Lib Dem coalition partner, deputy PM with a big office and team. Clegg\u2019s error was not to insist on having a real department like the Home Office to run. It left him out of too many loops, as he realised too late.</p> <p>Theresa May shows no sign of flattering rivals, since she sacked so many of them. As for \u201cacting PM\u201d Johnson, his few days of glory \u2013 chancellor Philip Hammond had the train set last week \u2013 serve to remind voters that modern communications mean a prime minister is never really out of touch or control. Johnson is there to open the post, probably steaming open her private correspondence while officials make the tea for the special poisoned chalice May has given him \u2013 the Brexit negotiation cup.</p> <p>So Boris\u2019s prospects depend on what happens next and whether he can dodge the usual falling scenery. The White House offers lessons there too. Eisenhower\u2019s vice-president, Richard Nixon, lost to Kennedy in 1960, but JFK\u2019s, Lyndon Johnson, succeeded when the president was murdered in 1963. Vietnam proved to be Johnson\u2019s Suez, forcing him out of office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/aug/16/boris-johnson-acting-pm-five-guideline-run-the-country\">'Avoid diplomacy': five guidelines to help Boris Johnson run the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, couldn\u2019t distance himself enough from Vietnam and Nixon took the White House in 1968 at his second attempt. Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice-president, George Bush Snr, pulled off the succession in 1988 against hopeless Michael Dukakis, as Al Gore, Bill Clinton\u2019s number two, did not against crafty Bush Jnr in 2000. Vice-presidents usually get delegated far more real responsibilities now than in John Garner\u2019s day. It\u2019s more of a proper school for presidents.</p> <p>As for Barack Obama, the cerebral outsider, and his vice-president Joe Biden, much older and the ultimate Washington insider/dealmaker, they have unexpectedly become real friends, not just expedient business partners. When Obama expressed surprise at this development, Biden is said to have replied: \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> fucking surprised?\u201d But Biden decided not to run in 2016 all the same. Some pitchers of warm spit are worth more than others.</p>",

  "<p>Documentary film-maker Michael Moore has said he knows \u201cfor a fact\u201d that Donald Trump does not want to be president of the United States and claims the Republican nominee is now sabotaging his own campaign in order to avoid the Oval Office. </p> <p>Moore, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/trump-self-sabotage_b_11545026.html\">writing on The Huffington Post</a>, says that Trump ran for president as a negotiating tactic, hoping to leverage a higher pay packet from NBC. The broadcaster had formerly employed Trump as the star of the reality TV show The Apprentice, but fired him after he called Mexican immigrants \u201cdrug dealers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d at his campaign launch. </p> <p>According to Moore, who does not name his source, Trump continued his campaign only to increase his stock with other television networks. </p> <p>\u201cAnd then something happened,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cAnd to be honest, if it happened to you, you might have reacted the same way.

  "<p>If you were bitten by a mosquito, and within two weeks had a fever, bloodshot eyes, a rash and felt generally achy, you would have four classic symptoms of Zika. But if you or your sexual partner didn\u2019t travel to Latin America, you might also have a hard time getting tested. </p> <p>That\u2019s because Zika tests are complicated, time-consuming, sometimes inaccurate and expensive. These obstacles have led some scientists to believe that several states at risk for spread of the disease may already have Zika outbreaks, without even knowing it.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not active surveillance going on in the at-risk states in the United States,\u201d said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. \u201cI think there\u2019s not just Zika transmission going on in Miami, it\u2019s going on all up and down the Gulf Coast and in Arizona, it\u2019s just that nobody\u2019s looking.\u201d</p> <p>The only confirmed cases of Zika caused by local mosquitoes in the continental US are in Miami, Florida. Federal officials have since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/florida-zika-cases-transmission-neighborhood-miami-dade-county\">issued a travel warning</a> for the area, asking pregnant women or those hoping to become pregnant to avoid the Wynwood neighborhood. There, local mosquitoes infected 15 people with the virus. </p> <p>Other Gulf coast states are also considered to to be at high risk for local transmission of Zika virus. That is because <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes are endemic, and multiple travelers have returned with the infection. But with laboratory limitations, even states with disease-spreading <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes may not be able to surveil non-travelers for the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a limitation, and local transmission could slip through, but it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Frank Welch, the medical director for Louisiana\u2019s center for community preparedness. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/zika-virus-miami-florida-cases-mosquito-wynwood\">Zika virus scare is turning Miami's hipster haven into a ghost town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Louisiana, long known to be a haven for mosquitoes, is considered a state at-risk of Zika transmission. There, 22 cases of travel-related Zika has been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p> <p>\u201cThe big fear, of course, is we\u2019ll figure this out seven, eight, nine months from now, in the spring of 2017, when we start seeing babies show up with microcephaly,\u201d said Hotez.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for community health centers in another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/zika-mosquito-hunters-houston-scientists\">Gulf Coast state</a>, Texas, the virus recalls an earlier epidemic that left public health officials flat-footed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never faced something like Zika before. We faced, what was it? H1N1,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Camacho, executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers. Member clinics serve about 1.3 million low-income Texans. \u201cOvernight we were overwhelmed, and I guess nobody was ready for that either. And we\u2019re fearful that some of the same things are playing out here.\u201d</p> <p>When H1N1 broke out in Texas, the CDC told doctors that they were required to test for the flu strain before prescribing antivirals, Camacho said. He recalls the first H1N1 case occurred on a Friday night. By the weekend, the CDC arrived. Then, it was discovered a standard flu test couldn\u2019t detect the strain.</p> <p>So the CDC provided new H1N1 tests. Five of them. For all 1.3 million of the Texans served by Camacho\u2019s member organizations.</p> <p>\u201cNumber one, in terms of screening, there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/zika-funding-bill-us-house-paul-ryan\">very limited resources</a>,\u201d Camacho said. \u201cWe saw the same thing in H1N1, where the flu test did not work. They actually had to develop a test and eventually change the protocols to not require a test, but delegate it more to the physician\u2019s knowledge at screening.\u201d</p> <p>Officially, the CDC recommends that patients with three of the aforementioned Zika symptoms be tested if the patient is a pregnant woman, or a woman trying to get pregnant, who lives in or has traveled to an area where Zika is being actively spread.</p> <p>That means that many people who do not fit this profile, especially men, may be left untested even though the disease is spread sexually.</p> <p>Some public health officials, like Welch, said testing more Americans would require exorbitant resources. </p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say this test was incredibly available \u2013 we would have to test every single person in the US where there is the possibility of Aedes,\u201d said Welch. \u201cWe would not only have to test them today, we would have to test them for the duration of the summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA once a week Zika test for everyone in the southern United States and California \u2013that would be more expensive than building a wall across both our Mexican and Canadian borders,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you would have to decide, since the test is in fact limited in availability and expensive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b5ce67d7d45dee0f12c1f2cebfed1d6d2712cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b5ce67d7d45dee0f12c1f2cebfed1d6d2712cdd/0_88_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton talks to a pregnant woman during a health center visit in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton talks to a pregnant woman during a health center visit in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Keane/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Scientists don\u2019t expect large-scale outbreaks in the continental US, like those that have taken place in Puerto Rico or Brazil. Texas also recently updated its guidance to include recommendations to test people who are symptomatic, but haven\u2019t traveled to Latin America.</p> <p>Even so, Zika presents its own challenges. Only one in five people infected with the disease are symptomatic. So in order for public health officials to locate a Zika case transmitted by local mosquitoes, a symptomatic patient (already just 20% of the infected population) would need to seek medical treatment. There is no guarantee a patient would even feel the need to see a doctor, since symptoms are generally mild. Then, doctors would have to rule out all other causes of such common symptoms. </p> <p>\u201cSay, for example, that person did show up at a healthcare provider,\u201d posits Welch, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be automatically turned away,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] you probably know the symptoms of Zika are pretty close to about 6 million other diseases.\u201d </p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/zika-virus-miami-florida-cases-mosquito-wynwood\">Wynwood neighborhood of Miami</a>, for example, clinicians went over and above CDC guidelines to test a symptomatic patient who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/health/zika-virus-florida.html\">showed up at an emergency room</a> without traveling abroad.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going into community health centers, we\u2019re not going into emergency rooms, we\u2019re not going into clinics identifying people with fever, or a rash, and seeing if they have Zika,\u201d said Hotez. \u201cIt\u2019s not being done.\u201d </p> <p>In part, this is because of the limitations on Zika testing methods. The two most common ways to test for the virus are both manpower intensive.</p> <p>\u201cThey absolutely take a specialized skill,\u201d said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Tests for past infections can be particularly tricky. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get more false positive results, that\u2019s just the way it works with any kind of assay.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, Camacho is rationing 50,000 bottles of donated mosquito repellant to the roughly 400,000 women of child-bearing age served by his organizations. Hotez is meeting about testing guidelines, and cities and states are increasingly broadening their testing guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still patchwork quilt,\u201d said Camacho. </p>",

Nearly 60% of Democrats oppose the death penalty, compared to just 25% in 1996.</p> <p>Which may be part of the problem for Clinton, who was roundly criticized for her awkward responses to questions about the death penalty during the primary season.<br></p> <p>Both of her primary rivals \u2013 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley \u2013 opposed capital punishment.

  "<p>Donald Trump has made the most direct appeal of his campaign to African American voters as he battles to offset dismal polling among black voters and draw political capital from a recent spate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/violence-milwaukee-police-shoot-dead-armed-suspect\">racially charged unrest</a> in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p> <p>Riots broke out in Milwaukee\u2019s Sherman Park area on Saturday after the fatal police shooting of black 23-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#sylville-smith-2016668\">Sylville Smith</a>, who police said pointed a firearm at an officer after fleeing a traffic stop.

It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It\u2019s their job, it\u2019s their homes, it\u2019s their schools and communities which will suffer the most as a result.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said he was asking for \u201cthe vote of every African American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic party has failed and betrayed the African American community.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-in-fourth-place-among-black-voters/\">Recent analysis</a> has indicated that Trump is polling at around 2% with the African American electorate \u2013 worse than almost every Republican candidate since 1948 \u2013 and is even behind the Green party nominee, Jill Stein, and libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, placing him fourth overall among black voters. </p> <p>Party insiders have<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters.html?_r=0\"> begun urging their nominee to increase his outreach</a> in African American communities nationwide. He has done little to court the demographic, most recently rejecting invitations to speak at the annual conventions of the <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/07/13/Donald-Trump-rejects-offer-to-speak-to-NAACP/8751468393067/\">NAACP</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/blog/journal-isms/donald-trump-campaign-turns-down-nabjnahj/\">National Association of Black Journalists</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rally on Tuesday evening had been scheduled before unrest broke out in Milwaukee but he seized on the opportunity to accuse his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of being \u201cagainst the police\u201d and suggested she and other Democrats were directly responsible for rioting in the city and others around America.</p> <p>\u201cThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society \u2013 a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent \u2013 share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country,\u201d Trump said in a speech that was delivered using a teleprompter.</p> <p>The billionaire accused Clinton of preferring to \u201cprotect the offender [rather] than the victim\u201d, suggested that \u201ca vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities\u201d. He argued that African Americans had been \u201churt worst\u201d by Clinton\u2019s immigration policy.</p> <p>Trump reiterated claims first made<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\"> during his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention in July</a>, suggesting that \u201claw and order must be restored\u201d amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">rising homicide rates in America\u2019s largest 50 cities</a>. Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/dueling-claims-on-crime-trend/\">has in fact declined to historic lows</a> under the Obama administration.</p> <p>The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing \u201cthe best\u201d prosecutors and judges and pursuing \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of federal laws.</p> <p>This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/08/how-americans-view-the-black-lives-matter-movement/\">according to recent polling</a>; while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americans\u2019 support for police <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183704/confidence-police-lowest-years.aspx\">was at a 22-year low</a> and especially weakened among the African American population.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of America\u2019s slave-owning history, was on sale outside of the rally.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a 40-mile radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of America\u2019s most racially segregated metropolitan areas.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way they (black people) are in that city,\u201d said Ken Schladweiler, a 61-year-old from the small rural town of Neosho. \u201cAll of that (unrest connected to Smith\u2019s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. They\u2019re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: \u201cAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: don\u2019t they (black people) have work? They\u2019re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Don\u2019t they have work?\u201d</p> <p>Julie Wanie, a 50-year-old healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didn\u2019t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all.</p> <p>\u201cI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows that\u2019s a certain area you stay out of.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: \u201cI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars.\u201d</p> <p>In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 The gun was pointed at his (a police officer\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\u2019s what the narrative is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\u2019t be rioting.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump\u2019s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists.</p> <p>Just hours before Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a pre-emptive statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime.</p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever it\u2019s important to have level-headed conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trump\u2019s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,\u201d Serpas said.</p>",
