He writes on his site The Insurgent, <a href=\"http://theresurgent.com/evan-mcmullin-a-sane-alternative/\">calling McMullin the \u201csane alternative\u201d</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is Evan McMullin\u2019s candidacy is a long shot. His best shot is winning a few states to throw the race to the House of Representatives where, though he may not get the Presidency, he might ensure neither Trump nor Hillary get it. To do this he would have to win a few blue states, which though difficult is not impossible. Surprisingly, he is already beginning to register in polls in red states like Utah and purple states like Virginia.</p> <p>Frankly, Evan McMullin may actually serve a more important role in 2016. Though he may not win, he might at least provide disaffected conservatives an excuse to show up and vote down ballot. Saving the Senate and House of Representatives from the Democrats has to be a priority for conservatives, but many are so disgusted by 2016 that they will not even show up in November.</p> <p>McMullin gives people a reason to show up. He gives conservatives someone they can vote for without holding their nose. He gives people someone to vote for instead of reconciling themselves to voting against someone. McMullin\u2019s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. For many, that will be enough.</p> <p>A lot of people have been writing me, begging me to reconsider Donald Trump. They think this is the last best chance to get this nation right. They think we will turn a corner after which we cannot turn back. In truth, I have concluded we are already past the point of redemption when the best either party can do is offer up Clinton or Trump. We are beyond the point of looking to five black robed masters to save us from ourselves when we put up either a Clinton or a Trump. The seriousness and virtue of the voter is in the grave already and too many yearn for an idolized past that never existed in a future that is not theirs, but God\u2019s, to shape.</p> <p>I am realistic that Evan McMullin has a limited change of winning. But I am idealistic enough to hope for better than Clinton or Trump.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e56cf1e4b0831a51401a9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T18:08:54.763Z\">7.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More rumors are swirling around that Ted Cruz will shortly endorse Donald Trump for president, with <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-rival-cruz-to-throw-support-to-gop-nominee-228584\">Politico reporting</a> that \u201cmultiple sources close to Cruz\u201d say it is coming as early as today.</p> <p>Cruz and Trump had a particularly brutal primary fight, with Trump insinuating that Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy and that his wife was unattractive.</p> <p>As Politico reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is unclear whether Cruz will say only that he is voting for the Republican nominee, as other lawmakers have done, or offer a more full-throated endorsement, but the idea of throwing any support to Trump is controversial within Cruzworld.</p> <p>\u201cIf he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,\u201d said someone who had worked for Cruz\u2019s campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>A former Cruz backer, conservative radio host Steve Deace, is tweeting his disappointment at news that the Texas Senator may back the party\u2019s controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hope I&#39;m wrong, but I think a man I admire will today make the worst political miscalculation I&#39;ve ever witnessed.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I really hope the Cruz advisers that pressured him for months to do this know their base as well as they seem to think they do.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779369211860815872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People may love Cruz endorsing Trump.

Its challenge, say Clinton campaign advisers, is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large-scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small-scale assaults by unconnected, self-radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect.</p> <p>Overseas, the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East.</p> <p>It seeks to expand intelligence sharing, particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure, concerning flows of jihadists, money and weapons.</p> <p>And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending \u201csignificant resources\u201d, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s successful push to find and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cShe really would put a concerted focus on that, really going after him in particular,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official.</p> <p>Read the rest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">here</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">Hillary Clinton's plan to stop Isis: hunt down leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e507cae4b0f91912fb0446\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T12:35:51.099Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. </p> <h2>Humbling at Hofstra?</h2> <p>Preparation for Monday\u2019s first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York means a fairly quiet Friday, with no official events planned for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s debate prep day.</p> <p>For Clinton that means less mock debate and more conversations about how to handle the different forms of possible Trump attacks, with the motto of prepare, prepare, prepare, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-debate-prep-228558\">says Politico</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end, it might not be anything Clinton says that matters. Many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot \u2013 a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else \u2013 as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face of Trump\u2019s expected insults.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s technique is often to question the validity of the moderators and the event itself, say <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/clinton-trump-take-different-approaches-first-debate-prep-n652726?cid=sm_tw\">campaign reporters from NBC News</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The GOP nominee has been fond of describing himself as a \u201ccounter-puncher,\u201d but Trump\u2019s debate strategy during the primary seemed simply to keep punching at rivals while reiterating portions of his stump speech. He sparred with nearly every Republican who he shared the stage with throughout the GOP primary process and mostly stayed away from specific policies in lieu of rhetorical red meat for his supporters. And he was generous with his use of nicknames for his opponents: \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and \u201cliddle Marco\u201d Rubio.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>The debate is a hot ticket. NBC\u2019s Today show says Chelsea Clinton will be there, but it is unknown if husband Bill will attend. Team Trump will have wife Melania and all five kids in attendance.

But that\u2019s not the chief reason to vote for her. She deserves America\u2019s support because she is the overwhelmingly better candidate. Against a Romney or a McCain, she would almost certainly be our choice. Against Trump? The question answers itself.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clinton\u2019s new ad: Trump insults women</h2> <p>The Clinton campaign released a new video today, similar to the \u201crole models\u201d ad where children watched TV while Donald Trump\u2019s most heinous comments play. But today\u2019s focus is on females, playing a collection of Trump\u2019s worst quotes about a women\u2019s physical appearance over footage of young women looking at themselves in the mirror.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHGPbl-werw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vHGPbl-werw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cDoes she have a good body?

He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality\">sold his company to Facebook</a> for $2bn in 2014, when he was just 21 years old. </p> <p>\u201cIf I grew up in \u2018da hood\u2019 it would make my story so much more interesting \u2013 if I had something to escape from,\u201d he told the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11309013/Oculus-Rifts-Palmer-Luckey-I-brought-virtual-reality-back-from-the-dead.html\">Telegraph</a> in 2015.

We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>But Cruz and Trump clashed repeatedly in the primary campaign. An ardent conservative who played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/13/sarah-palin-ted-cruz-veterans-shutdown\">a lead role in the government shutdown of 2013</a>, Cruz warned that Trump was not a conservative but rather a big-government liberal. Riding strong support among evangelical activists, Cruz propelled himself to victory in the Iowa caucuses and in 10 other states. He eventually finished second.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly attacked Cruz, not just politically but personally. In the course of the primary, he criticised Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/ted-cruz-brands-donald-trump-coward-feud-over-wives\">for her looks</a> and implied that the Texas senator\u2019s father was somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/03/cruz-attacks-trump-jfk-assassination-philanderer\">involved</a> in the assassination of John F Kennedy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Cruz, in July</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/donald-trump-ted-cruz-jfk-assassination-indiana-primary-philanderer\">In a dramatic press conference</a> on the eve of the Indiana primary, Cruz called Trump a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d, an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon\u201d.

  "<p>I hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.</p> <p>If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. The latest Slate Political Gabfest podcast is called <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/slates-political-gabfest/the-time-to-panic-edition\">The Time to Panic Edition</a>. Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">40% probability</a> of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \u201cNever seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump\u2019s chances.

In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.</p> <p>So low are expectations for his performance on Monday \u2013 where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him \u2013 that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton\u2019s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \u201cpresidential\u201d and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.</p> <p>And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She\u2019s been advised that she mustn\u2019t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way.

Trump has been exposed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-9-11-comments-since-2001?CMP=share_btn_tw\">serial lying over 9/11</a>, falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.</p> <p>This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others\u2019 donations, to pay for a larger than life <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/21/how-a-univision-anchor-found-the-missing-10000-portrait-that-trump-bought-with-his-charitys-money/\">$10,000 painting</a> \u2013 of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f25d5234cdc0433593ffbc7acf34365387d35c99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f25d5234cdc0433593ffbc7acf34365387d35c99/0_302_5356_3214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cBut Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he\u2019ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she\u2019s dishonest. The risk is that he\u2019ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.</p> <p>If that sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a show we\u2019ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.</p> <p>Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America\u2019s highest office \u2013 but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2378\">recorded dire numbers</a> for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.</p> <p>This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency \u2013 and no Iraq war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-presidential-debate-hillary-needs-a-slogan-to-sum-up-what-she-stands-for\">The Guardian view on the US presidential debate: Hillary needs a slogan to sum up what she stands for | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America\u2019s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.</p> <p>You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don\u2019t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven\u2019t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/136976/liberals-failed-teach-millennials-horror-george-w-bush\">New Republic</a> put it this week, \u201cLiberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\u201d (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents\u2019 history of failure.)</p> <p>So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she\u2019s all that stands between you and an American nightmare. </p> <p>You don\u2019t have to love her. You don\u2019t even have to like her. You\u2019re not saying she\u2019s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, \u201cDon\u2019t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative.\u201d And the alternative is President Trump.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 September 2016 to clarify the details of the Slate podcast.<br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Larry Sanders, the older brother of Democrat politician Bernie Sanders, is hoping to emulate his sibling\u2019s success by standing for the Green party in David Cameron\u2019s Oxfordshire seat.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders gave Hillary Clinton an unexpectedly tough fight in the Democratic presidential primaries, riding a wave of idealism among a predominantly young voter base. </p> <p>Now his brother Larry, 82, a retired social worker and former Green party councillor, plans to attempt a similar feat for the Greens in the byelection for the rock-solid Conservative constituency of Witney.</p> <p>It will be a tall order. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been the richest turf for the Green party,\u201d a party spokesman said. To become MP for Witney, he would have to overturn Cameron\u2019s 22,700-vote majority in a seat where the last Green candidate won just 5.1% of the vote. </p> <p>But as Sanders points out, he has branding on his side. \u201cBecause of Bernard, I\u2019ve become famous, and I will get more attention from the media, and that\u2019s to be used to get the Green party\u2019s policies across,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Sanders has lived in Oxford since 1968, having moved to Britain after falling in love with \u201ca beautiful Englishwoman\u201d, Margaret, to whom he was married until she died in 1983. </p> <p>He studied social work at Oxford University and worked as a social worker and adviser to people with disabilities and their carers. He also has a law degree from Harvard. </p> <p>Sanders has been the Green party\u2019s health spokesman since last year, and says the NHS and social care are the issues \u201cclosest to my heart\u201d. On a local level, he has campaigned in support of Witney and Horton hospitals, but also wants to highlight the pressure that social care is under nationally, and opposes the privatisation of social care and the NHS.</p> <p>He will also echo his brother\u2019s campaign\u2019s emphasis on social inequality. \u201cIn Britain, as in the US, we have had an increase in inequality in the last 30 years, and that\u2019s having all sorts of consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people can\u2019t afford houses who you would have expected to not long ago.\u201d </p> <p>Neoliberalism, he says, has \u201cshuddered to a close\u201d, and he blames resentment for that for the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The same tides in the US are what propelled his brother\u2019s campaign, he said. \u201cBernard\u2019s campaign in America was a very successful shifting point.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders will face barrister Robert Courts as the Conservative candidate, local councillor Liz Leffman for the Liberal Democrats, and Duncan Enright as the Labour candidate. </p> <p>The Greens point out that Enright has called for Corbyn to stand down, creating the scope for Sanders to pick up support among Corbyn-backing voters. Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s MP and co-leader, will campaign in the constituency on Saturday.</p> <p>Larry Sanders campaigned for his brother as a member of Democrats Abroad and was filmed telling the Democratic convention through tears that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders-brother-larry-democratic-convention-video\">their parents would be \u201cimmensely proud\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders will not be officially endorsing Larry, because of the convention against foreign politicians intervening in domestic elections. </p> <p>But in last year\u2019s general election, when Larry Sanders ran for the Greens in the neighbouring constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon, Bernie spoke via Skype at a meeting of Larry\u2019s supporters. Larry Sanders will not rule out a similar intervention in the byelection. </p> <p>\u201cOur similarities in terms of policies are astonishing, partly because we talk all the time,\u201d Larry Sanders said. <br></p> <p>He cannot think of a policy where they have major differences, he added. \u201cWe both have maintained a kind of naivet\u00e9, where we look around and say, why does a rich country have poor people?\u201d</p>",

Now if they don\u2019t want to look for them, then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work.

He graduated from local hero to Chicago icon during an 11-year coaching stint with the Bears that included the team\u2019s only Super Bowl win during the 1985 season, then retired permanently after a failed comeback with the New Orleans Saints in 1999.</p> <p>A well-known conservative, Ditka publicly flirted with running against Democratic candidate Barack Obama, then a state senator, for the open seat in the US Senate vacated by Illinois senator Peter Fitzgerald in 2004. No one then could have imagined how the election would ultimately propel Obama to the presidency in four years\u2019 time.</p> <p>\u201cBiggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he told the Dickinson Press in 2013. \u201cNot that I would have won, but I probably would have and he wouldn\u2019t be in the White House.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Ditka called Obama \u201cthe worst president we\u2019ve ever had\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBarack Obama is a fine man,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s pleasant, he\u2019d be great to play golf with.

  "<p>Donald Trump began preparations in earnest on Friday for his first head-to-head debate with presidential rival Hillary Clinton, setting up what <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-clinton-get-ready-for-a-ninety-minute-campaign\">\u201cmay turn out to be the most important ninety minutes in America\u2019s political history\u201d</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Republican candidate finally broke from his hectic campaign schedule for a day without any public or private events so he could focus on his presentation for the event described in those momentous terms by the New Yorker magazine. </p> <p>Clinton, by contrast, has spent most of this week hunkered down with close aides at her Dutch colonial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/hillary-clinton-new-york-chappaqua-primary-election\">home in Chappaqua</a>, a hamlet north of New York City.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s televised clash is expected to break TV audience records for a political event, possibly exceeding 100 million viewers and almost rivalling the Super Bowl. Hosted by Hofstra University in New York and moderated by NBC news anchor Lester Holt, it promises be an absorbing collision of personalities, philosophies and styles and has taken on added significance as polls show an increasingly tight race. One slip of the tongue could be devastating.</p> <p>Hype worthy of a world heavyweight boxing championship is mounting. Billionaire businessman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mark Cuban</a> tweeted on Thursday: \u201cJust got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the \u2018Humbling at Hofstra\u2019 on Monday. It Is On!\u201d</p> <p>Accused by critics of stooping low and causing offence, Trump has promised a clean fight in which he will treat Clinton with \u201crespect\u201d and not bring up her husband Bill\u2019s past sexual indiscretions. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking to do that,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do exactly. It depends on what level she hits you with, if she\u2019s fair, if it\u2019s unfair, but certainly I\u2019m not looking to do that.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee, a seasoned debater, has promised to tackle Trump\u2019s toxic rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we\u2019ve seen coming from my opponent,\u201d she told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday. \u201cI can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I\u2019ve been at this. And I understand it\u2019s a contact sport. But I\u2019m not going to take what he says about everybody else, his attacks on African Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities.\u201d</p> <p>The contrast in the candidates\u2019 preparations mirrors the contrast in their campaigns. Trump has been more laissez-faire and, so far, has reportedly eschewed mock debates against someone playing the role of Clinton. He has warned of the dangers of being overprepared. </p> <p>Clinton, a former lawyer, has been characteristically meticulous in readying herself for what her campaign describes as the most important night of the election yet, with just over six weeks to go until polling day.</p> <p>Trump has already offered an insight into his likely talking points in an email sent to supporters. \u201cWhile Hillary is listening to a team of psychologists and advisors to teach her what to say, I\u2019m turning to the very people who got me where I am today \u2026 YOU,\u201d it stated.</p> <p>The \u201cTrump debate preparation survey\u201d consisted of 30 questions for supporters, including: \u201cDo you think Trump should refer to Hillary as \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 on stage?\u201d; \u201cShould Trump contrast his tell-it-like-it-is attitude with Hillary\u2019s running list of lies, corruption, and deceit?\u201d; and \u201cShould Trump contrast himself as a tough negotiator with Hillary\u2019s history of waging endless wars that fail miserably?\u201d</p> <p>The billionaire businessman has also been prepping on his campaign plane as he shuttles from rally to rally. Advisers include former Republican rivals Dr Ben Carson and New Jersey governor Chris Christie; retired Gen Michael Flynn, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, ex-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and economist Peter Navarro have also been in discussions. Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chief executive, ousted after a sexual harassment scandal, has also offered coaching.</p> <p>Trump, a former reality TV star, hopes to bring his experience of the medium to bear and stands to benefit from low expectations \u2013 recent weeks have seen him given credit in the media for simply remaining on script or failing to attack anyone. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest danger to Trump is that Clinton will get under his skin and goad him to lash out, giving him the appearance of a bully and deepening concerns over whether he has the temperament to be commander-in-chief when compared with her steady hand.</p> <p>He told the Washington Post recently: \u201cDebate skills are something you either have or don\u2019t have. You have to prep. You have to have knowledge. But when people say you have to be nice or not nice, well, I won\u2019t really know until it begins. Because if she treats me with respect, I\u2019ll treat her with respect. If she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll reciprocate. If she\u2019s respectful of me, I\u2019ll be that way with her.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump is expected to rehearse at Trump Tower, overlooking Central Park in Manhattan, Clinton is working with advisers behind the fence of her 110-year-old house at the end of a cul-de-sac in Chappaqua. Ed Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania and a Clinton surrogate, said on Thursday: \u201cShe should continue to talk about the things she wants to do.\u201d</p> <p>Her inner circle includes Karen Dunn, Bob Barnett, Joel Benenson, John Podesta, Jake Sullivan, Jennifer Palmieri and Ron Klain, who has been a debate coach for Democratic presidential candidates since 1992 and was recently the administration\u2019s \u201cEbola czar\u201d. Contacted via Twitter, he said only: \u201cI do not talk to reporters on any basis about debate prep.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Cuban, James Carville \u2013 a veteran of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign \u2013 and civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz are all potential stand-ins for Trump in dry-run debates. A few different people are playing the role of Trump to represent his \u201cmultiple personalities\u201d, the Hill website reported.</p> <p>On Monday, it might be the old blustering Trump of the Republican primary debates, who labelled rivals \u2013 \u201clow-energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio \u2013 and even made reference to the size of his manhood; or it might be more a measured Trump in an attempt to appear statesmanlike.</p> <p>Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Clinton, told journalists: \u201cYou\u2019re just not sure who is going to show up.

And in the elections of 1964 and 1968, Americans who were 25 to 44 years old were slightly more likely to cast a ballot than the oldest voters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/age-voting-rates/\" data-alt=\"Chart on aging and voting rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/age-voting-rates/\">Chart on aging and voting rates</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also overly simplistic to say that older Americans vote Republican, they\u2019re just a lot more likely than younger voters to do so. <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/exit-polls\">Exit polls</a> show that in 2012, 56% of voters age 65 and over voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney compared to just 37% of the youngest voting group, those age 18 to 29.</p> <p>That translates to a 19 percentage point lead for Republicans among the oldest Americans. In 2008 it was 21 percentage points, and in 2004 it was just 9 percentage points. In other words, though this trend has long existed, the size of it depends on other factors too \u2013 factors like which candidates are standing for election.</p> <p><a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/\">Polling</a> so far suggests that the 2016 candidates\u2019 popularity (or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-general-election-analysis\">lack thereof</a>) isn\u2019t a huge surprise in terms of these age trends. Voters age 65 and over are the group most likely to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump; those age 18 to 34 are the least likely to vote for him.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget though, correlation doesn\u2019t mean causality \u2013 the reasons why older voters lean Republican isn\u2019t necessarily their age per se. Older Americans are more likely to be white and they\u2019re also more likely to be religious (Protestant or Catholic in particular) \u2013 and both of those demographic groups also tend to vote Republican for reasons that are quite separate from pension plans.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a mistake to treat such a loose group as \u201cthe oldest voters\u201d as a single unit. Research from <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/\">Pew Research Center</a> has found that baby boomers (those age 50 to 68) are less likely to identify with the label Republican than the uncomfortably titled silent generation (who are age 69 to 86).</p> <p>As for turnout, that is sometimes even harder to correctly forecast than voting intention. Will young Democrats who were galvanized by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home now he\u2019s out of the race, making the older voting bloc even more powerful? Will older, more traditional Republicans be put off by Donald Trump\u2019s political style? Both questions demonstrate just how much it\u2019s the youngest and the oldest voters that will be crucial in determining the results of the 2016 election. </p>",

Independent experts have said a complete revision could take 10-18 months.</p> <p>Whereas neighbouring strongmen Denis Sassou Nguesso in Congo-Brazzaville and Paul Kagame in Rwanda easily pushed through constitutional changes to allow them to stand for third terms, Kabila has been unable to take such a blunt approach.</p> <p>Kabila did manage to outmanoeuvre Mo\u00efse Katumbi, a tycoon who was seen as a powerful challenger. Katumbi, who had built a support base in Katanga province, was forced to leave the country earlier this year to seek medical treatment.</p> <p>Katumbi is currently in Washington, from where he issued a call for sanctions this week. \u201cWithout sanctions, they will continue killing people like mosquitoes,\u201d Katumbi said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/sep/23/political-violence-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-in-pictures\">Political violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Congo has found itself the focus of a range of foreign actors in recent weeks.

A former aide named Mark Penn wrote a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/4097983/Penn-Strategy-Memo-3-19-07#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">2007 memo</a> that Obama\u2019s \u201clack of American roots\u201d could \u201chold him back\u201d.

Philip Berg, a former Pennsylvania official who supported Clinton, filed a lawsuit in 2008 over Obama\u2019s birth certificate; the suit was<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/01/29/supreme-court-ousts-attorney-who-sued-to-oust-obama/\"> thrown out because it was groundless</a>. Sidney Blumenthal, an old friend of the Clintons who frequently sent them unsolicited advice, <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article102354777.html\">reportedly asked reporters </a>to investigate Obama\u2019s birth, but he has denied this and denounced the conspiracy. </p> <p>As fellow fact-checkers at Politifact have noted, a Texas volunteer for Clinton named Linda Starr eventually <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/23/donald-trump/hillary-clinton-obama-birther-fact-check/\">joined Berg\u2019s failed lawsuit</a>; there is nothing to suggest Starr had any influence in the campaign at any level. Campaign volunteers who forwarded emails falsely alleging Obama is Muslim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/25/obama-muslim-myth-clinton-connection/\">resigned</a> when they were found out. </p>",

Kianian\u2019s plea has echoed across popular apps like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%25D9%2585%25D9%2586_%25D8%25AF%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25A7%25DA%2586%25D9%2587_%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1%25D9%2588%25D9%2585%25D9%258A%25D9%2587_%25D9%2587%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D9%2585/\">Instagram</a> and on the newly formed \u201cI am Lake Urmia\u201d <a href=\"https://telegram.me/urmulake\">Telegram channel</a>. </p> <p>This is not the first effort to bring national and international attention to Lake Urmia. Iranian politicians including President Hassan Rouhani, Iranian parliamentary deputies, and even Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio have made Lake Urmia part of their public advocacy. DiCaprio\u2019s Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFAZvGAKxHi/\">post</a> on the lake in May resulted in 328,000 likes and made him an <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/leonardo-dicaprio-instagram-lake-urmia-raise-awareness.html\">overnight superhero among Iranians</a>, illustrating the way social media can help collaboration on topics that defy borders. </p> <p>Travel to the basin of Lake Urmia and you will find an area facing a high risk of salt storms. The shrinking of the lake has diminished a fragile ecosystem, with the gradual disappearance of native wildlife including the brine shrimp Artemia and migratory birds like flamingos and pelicans. </p> <p>Such degradation threatens dire economic consequences. A once flourishing tourism industry, where visitors bathed in salty water rather like the Dead Sea, is curtailed. Many people living near the lake fear they may be forced to leave due to eye problems, respiratory diseases and other health problems caused by dust and salt particles blowing in the air. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, some local farmers referred to the lake as a tumour, viewing the seeping of its uniquely saline water as a threat to their farmlands. Today, their wish is to revitalise this desiccating lake and prevent salt storms that are diminishing soil fertility and threatening their livelihoods. The shift in perspective highlights the co-dependency we all share with our environment, and shows all too clearly the repercussions of environmental neglect.</p> <p>Iran suffers from <a href=\"http://ulrp.sharif.ir/en/news/news-1655-solve-water-crisis-iran-we-have-develop-both-mitigation-and-adaptation-measures\">\u201chydraulic mission\u201d</a> syndrome, a state of mind in which a country tries to manipulate domestic water resources to meet demand through short-sighted measures based on technology and large-scale engineering. The dream of human dominance over nature has led to a nightmare of unforeseen consequences, reminding us that we must learn to live in tune with nature to sustain ourselves.</p> <p>Dams, in particular, have become idolised as symbols of development, political strength and international prowess. One of the main factors contributing to the state of Lake Urmia is the interference in the natural flow of water into the lake by over 50 dams. The damage has been compounded by unregulated withdrawal of water, water-intensive irrigation and the unsustainable use of fertilisers.</p> <p>President Rouhani made promises about restoring Lake Urmia during his election campaign, and his administration has allocated <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/07/aperture-troubled-waters-iran-lake-urmia-environment-draught-water-preservation/\">$5 billion</a> to improve infrastructure and water conservation in the area. Nevertheless, the major proposals under consideration are still structural. While dam construction is now prohibited, the government\u2019s restoration task force has shown interest in transferring water from other river basins, upstream dredging, and connecting inflowing rivers to maximise the inflow. But without policy reforms and institutional changes - including phasing out <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/saving-iran-s-precious-lake-urmia/\">water intensive crops</a>, conservation methods in irrigation and wider changes in the behaviour of farmers and other water consumers - restoration efforts will be successful only with an unusually wet period in the years to come.</p> <p>Collaborations with international partners to restore water levels in Lake Urmia are limited but underway. Most notably, the United Nations Development Programme, Iran\u2019s Department of Environment and the Japanese government have established joint projects that involve educating local farmers on sustainable agriculture practices and reducing water consumption through improved efficiency; and supplying improved, safer fertilisers and pesticides. Over the past few months, the lake has shown some signs of recovery, but this is due more to more frequent rainfall rather than the restoration efforts.</p> <p>Lake Urmia\u2019s grim destiny unfortunately reflects a wider trend. Several bodies of water in Iran (including Gav-Khuni wetland near Isfahan, the Hamoun wetlands near Afghanistan, Bakhtegan lake in Fars province, and the Shadegan wetland and Hour-Al-Azim in Khuzestan) have been heavily impacted or dried up entirely in light of weak infrastructure, over-reliance on dams, extreme weather patterns, climatic changes, poor irrigation practices and unregulated use of water.</p> <p>In the story of Lake Urmia lie invaluable lessons. Iranians have paid for their unsustainable development and have lost many invaluable ecosystems. On the positive side, however, awareness of our interdependence with nature has been sharpened by air pollution in major cities, dust storms, soil erosion, desertification and land subsidence due to extraction of groundwater.</p> <p>Iran may now be reaching a tipping point. With the better understanding of our interconnectivity worldwide today, preserving the environment is a collective goal that everyone irrespective of age, race, or background can share. No matter where we are, or who we are, we can\u2019t save ourselves if we don\u2019t care for our environment. We are all Lake Urmia. </p> <p><em>Shirin Hakim is a doctoral researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy of Imperial College, London, working on environmental issues in Iran.

  "<p>A key priority of Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposed intelligence surge will be to kill or capture Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, her campaign has told the Guardian.<br></p> <p>During the past year, Clinton, the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee, has placed bolstering the vast US intelligence apparatus at the center of her national security agenda. </p> <p>Days before the first presidential debate \u2013 and after the New York area escaped without mass casualties from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-both-devices-used-pressure-cooker-and-phone-reports\">multiple bombings</a> \u2013 her campaign has for the first time expanded on how her policies would work.</p> <p>Since its 2015 inception, the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d has evolved from an idea of expanding intelligence assets directed against the Islamic State and its adjuncts to a broader initiative with a significant domestic component, aimed at uncovering and preventing attacks directed or inspired by terrorist groups.</p> <p>Much of it remains undefined. Its challenge, say Clinton campaign advisers, is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large-scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small-scale assaults by unconnected, self-radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect.</p> <p>Overseas, the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East.</p> <p>It seeks to expand intelligence sharing, particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure, concerning flows of jihadists, money and weapons.</p> <p> And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending \u201csignificant resources\u201d, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s successful push to find and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cShe really would put a concerted focus on that, really going after him in particular,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official. </p> <p>Domestically, the \u201cprinciples\u201d of Clinton\u2019s intelligence surge, according to senior campaign advisers, indicate a preference for targeted spying over bulk data collection, expanding local law enforcement\u2019s access to intelligence and enlisting tech companies to aid in thwarting extremism. </p> <p>The campaign speaks of \u201cbalancing acts\u201d between civil liberties and security, a departure from both <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2009/05/reject_false_choice_between_se_1.html\">liberal</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/3851286/nsa-court-decision-rand-paul-patriot-act/\">conservative</a> arguments that tend to diminish conflict between the two priorities. Asked to illustrate what Clinton means by \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d that need to apply to intelligence collection in the US, the campaign holds out a 2015 reform that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/17/surveillance-reform-usa-freedom-act-nsa-civil-libertarians\">split</a> the civil liberties community as a model for any new constraints on intelligence authorities. </p> <p>The USA Freedom Act, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/usa-freedom-act-revised-senate-bill-nsa\">compromise</a> that constrained but did not entirely end bulk phone records collection, \u201cstrikes the right balance\u201d, Rosenberger said. \u201cSo those kinds of principles and protections offer something of a guideline for where any new proposals she put forth would be likely to fall.\u201d</p> <p>Many aspects of the intelligence surge, with major implications for the privacy-security debate, remain unsettled and subject to internal discussion. Among them is a thorny issue arising out of the recent waves of domestic attacks.</p> <p>Both the Orlando nightclub gunman and the accused New York-New Jersey bomber had initially come under FBI scrutiny. Both assessments ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/omar-mateen-fbi-boston-marathon-tsarnaev\">stopped</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-father-fbi-terrorism-bombing\">lack of evidence of imminent action</a>. </p> <p>Now, Clinton and her advisers are studying whether and how law enforcement agencies ought to balance the privacy and security questions which arise: should agencies share information with each other on those preliminarily under terrorism suspicion, while attempting to avoid keeping such people under permanent investigation or alienating Muslim and other communities. </p> <p>The campaign said Clinton, who discussed the issue with her counter-terrorism advisers this week, has yet to reach any conclusions.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign is also examining expanding or reforming intelligence so-called fusion centers which gather, share and analyze information between federal, state and local law enforcement, which have been long criticized as both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/data-sharing-law-enforcement-organised-chaos\">ineffective</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/10/fusion-centers/\">dangerous to privacy</a>. </p> <p>On encryption, Clinton wants Silicon Valley to move beyond its post-Snowden suspicion of US intelligence \u2013 a move dealt a big setback by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple\">FBI\u2019s abandoned fight with Apple </a>\u2013 but she does not yet have a plan for doing so beyond consistent nonadversarial engagement. </p> <p>More fundamentally, the Clinton campaign has yet to decide whether the intelligence surge includes or prioritizes adding spies, collecting more data, analyzing more data, expanding legal authorities or giving more money to the approximately $67bn intelligence apparatus. Advisers say those decisions will await the transition team should Clinton win the presidency. </p> <p>The campaign did not identify the architects of the intelligence surge, but it pointed to prominent counter-terrorism advisers who have been contributing ideas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"032ad1fa65974f7d644048c5ecc1a0230ed6f8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/032ad1fa65974f7d644048c5ecc1a0230ed6f8d8/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton national security team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton begins a working session with national security advisers and experts at the New York Historical Society.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They include former acting CIA director Michael Morell \u2013 who has come under recent criticism for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/cia-torture-report-aftermath-daniel-jones-senate-investigation\">attacks on the Senate torture report</a> \u2013 ex-National Counterterrorism Center director Matt Olsen; Clinton\u2019s state department counter-terrorism chief Dan Benjamin; former National Security Council legal adviser Mary DeRosa; ex-acting Homeland Security secretary Rand Beers; Mike Vickers, a retired CIA operative who became Pentagon undersecretary for intelligence; and Jeremy Bash, Leon Panetta\u2019s chief of staff at the CIA and Pentagon. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all involved in the conversation,\u201d Rosenberger said. </p> <p>Pat Eddington, an intelligence aide to former US representative Rush Holt, said Clinton\u2019s intelligence surge sounded like a set of marginal adjustments to a US counter-terrorism apparatus in need of vast structural overhaul. </p> <p>\u201cIn essence, they want to do more of the same and tweak it around edges instead of taking a step back and asking: \u2018What are you getting for your money and can we be doing things ultimately differently and better?,\u2019\u201d said Eddington, now a civil liberties and national security analyst at the Cato Institute. </p> <p>Karen Greenberg, the director of Fordham Law School\u2019s Center on National Security, called an expanded emphasis on intelligence sharing in the age of small-scale terrorism inspired \u201ca logical evolution\u201d, and said that Clinton\u2019s approach seemed to be to avoid \u201coverreacting\u201d to threats. </p> <p>\u201cPushing the surveillance issue off to a future time is the elephant in the room,\u201d Greenberg said.</p> <p>Malcolm Nance, a former counterterrorism intelligence author and author of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Defeating-ISIS-They-Fight-Believe-ebook/dp/B01BUE8AJM\">Defeating Isis</a>\u201d, approved of the intelligence surge\u2019s broad outlines, anticipating a forthcoming phase of the US war against Isis that will be more shadowy than the daily bombardment in Iraq, Syria and Libya.</p> <p>\u201cThe most critical thing to remember is in the next year Isis\u2019s caliphate will most likely collapse. They will transition from my physical state into what I call a ghost caliphate. The ideology will go underground and be spread almost exclusively through the Internet,\u201d Nance said. </p> <p>Beyond the hunt for Baghdadi \u2013 who already has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/inside-the-hunt-for-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">survived one US attempt on his life</a> \u2013 the campaign indicated rapid transitions in terrorist patterns would inform the shape of its intelligence surge.</p> <p> \u201cThe post-9/11 architecture was designed largely for identifying complex plots. We\u2019re in a different world now, where the lone wolf attackers may not even be directed by or coordinated with a terrorist group, they may simply be inspired by them. We need to adapt for that reality, while still not taking our eye off the ball of identifying potential complex attacks,\u201d Rosenberger said. </p>",
  "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour gathers in Liverpool</a>, we should reflect on the past year.

In 2005 the Labour party had debts of \u00a325m. We have paid back those who lent us money to fight previous elections. Our bank loan has been repaid, alongside all our mortgages. Labour is now debt-free, and in surplus. This gives us a huge strength in the electoral battles ahead.</p> <p>We have been through our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">second leadership contest</a> in two years. At the time of writing, the result is not known, but whether the new leader is Jeremy Corbyn or Owen Smith, they will have great challenges ahead. The Labour party has a long tradition of standing up for the many, and changing people\u2019s lives for the better. With the country now in its seventh year under a Tory prime minster, our work and our purpose is felt greatly.</p> <p>There must be strong opposition in parliament. It is vital if we are to challenge the reintroduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/grammar-schools-education-selection-divisive-ineffective\">grammar schools</a>, the unfair changes to political party funding that will break the link between Labour and the trade unions, or the Tories\u2019 decision to ignore two million voters in their bid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/boundary-changes-tories-ruthless-gerrymandering\">gerrymander</a> the parliamentary boundaries. Theresa May has a tiny majority in parliament, and a party split over Europe. Labour must be giving a voice to the many communities that need us across the country.</p> <p>The new leader must ensure that workers\u2019 rights are not lost in Brexit. Leaving the EU is not an excuse for the Tories to tear up decades of accumulated rights and protections in the workplace. Labour must shape Brexit as much as the Tories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/left-seize-initiative-brexit\">The left needs to seize the initiative over Brexit | Nick Dearden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main challenge, though, is to bring the Labour party together. If we can harness our finances, engage and involve our membership and have a broad political offer, then we can achieve something great. At elections, we cannot choose our opponents, our press or our voters. We cannot run campaigns telling people why they\u2019re wrong and we\u2019re right. We cannot be divided when our mission is to unite the country. Or if we do, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when voters punish us at the polls. So we, as a party, need to learn the lessons and listen to what people have been telling us about their community, their nation and their sense of security.</p> <p>There has been talk of olive branches and putting the band back together. All the money and all the members will amount to little if we can\u2019t build a unified team to harness those resources. We must work together, under one banner, and defeat this Tory government. Theresa May has never won an election as prime minister. Our job is to make sure she never does.</p>",
  "<p>In February, Tomi Lahren had yet another viral moment after she came out swinging at Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Panther-themed Super Bowl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/beyonce-profile-black-power-super-bowl-civil-rights\">performance</a>. The Blaze\u2019s up-and-coming TV pundit opened with the view that Beyonc\u00e9 was pushing the notion that \u201cblack lives matter more\u201d. She pressed on with a characteristically acerbic three-minute tirade, referring to Jay Z as a drug dealer and suggesting that if Beyonc\u00e9 wanted to protect black neighborhoods, she could \u201cstart at home\u201d. </p> <p> The video garnered millions of views, delighting her fellow hardline conservatives and outraging the left. She was later invited to reiterate her points on TMZ and in other mainstream outlets well away from the fringes of rightwing media.</p> <p>By June, Jay Z had responded. He dropped a sample of Lahren\u2019s broadcast remarks before his verse on Pusha T\u2019s track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp7dNDe00U\">Drug Dealers Anonymous</a>. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2O5MGpfKTc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p2O5MGpfKTc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lahren views it as a feather in her cap. In a phone interview from Dallas, where her show is produced, she says \u201cnot many conservatives can say that they are a rap muse\u201d. </p> <p>Fewer can say that they have been personally called out by Jay Z, but the incident was no fluke.</p> <p>Lahren\u2019s steep, two-year rise from student journalist to national conservative media star has been propelled by her series of combative, widely shared Final Thoughts segments. On a normal day, her videos, pushing familiar conservative positions, get millions of views. But most of her big viral hits have come from putting pop culture under a conservative lens, and leveraging that to talk about the politics of race in the US.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was the girl who eviscerated Obama</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As she puts it, she \u201cgoes hard at celebrities who use their platform to preach some narrative of social justice\u201d. Just this month, she proved again that her formula works. Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0_nyWVXCI \">takedown</a> of NFL star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football\">Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest</a> was posted on Facebook on 31 August. At the time of writing, after just three weeks, it had garnered nearly 65m views on that platform alone.</p> <p>Political scientist Dan Cassino, author of a new book on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-American-Politics-Psychology/dp/1138900125\">Fox News</a>, says this willingness to make \u201ca rightwing criticism of pop culture\u201d is one of the things that has so quickly developed Lahren\u2019s profile: \u201cIt is a surefire way to inject yourself into the soft news cycle. That\u2019s a niche that other people haven\u2019t moved into, and she\u2019s done a very good job of that.\u201d</p> <p>Her success is especially striking given that barely two years ago, the only videos she was appearing in were YouTube posts from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPU7k4jQUPE\">The Scramble</a>, the student newscast she hosted at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.</p> <p>Mark Ciavolo was UNLV student body president at the time Lahren hosted the show, and was a regular guest. He\u2019s also a conservative, and counts Lahren as a friend. \u201cShe\u2019s been a consistent conservative voice as long as I\u2019ve known her.\u201d He says her role on The Scramble was more the even-handed host, but her views haven\u2019t changed, even though \u201cthe delivery might vary\u201d. He\u2019s not surprised by her steep, post-collegiate trajectory. \u201cTomi is a very determined, strong woman.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren says her UNLV experience proves that she can do journalism, but that\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing now. \u201cI fully acknowledge that I am not a journalist. I clearly have a point of view, I am very passionate about my point of view. I am a commentator.\u201d </p> <p>Near the end of her degree, in April 2014, she went looking for a journalism internship. The Blaze rejected her application with a form letter. She reached out to the fledgling One America News Network. CEO Robert Herring replied directly, saying they didn\u2019t offer internships but she should come in and \u201cwe\u2019ll see if there\u2019s a job for you\u201d.</p> <p>The audition was successful, and at just 21, she was thrown in at the deep end, running her own show, On Point on OANN, which began in August 2014. <br>\u201cI built it from the ground up, and I learned a lot because I didn\u2019t have a lot of help.\u201d</p> <p>She developed the Final Thoughts segment, and began to think about how it could garner attention beyond the ranks of the channel\u2019s small audience. </p> <p>\u201cI noticed early on that people liked my Final Thoughts, so that\u2019s when we started pulling them and putting them on YouTube.\u201d<br></p> <p>Their quick cuts, discontinuous camera movements, and compression were perfectly pitched to the short attention spans of the social media era. So is Lahren\u2019s forthright outrage. Lahren calls them \u201cdirect, succinct, easy to understand and easy to follow\u201d.</p> <p>In July 2015 she got her first brush with national notoriety, when she criticised Barack Obama\u2019s reluctance to blame Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez\u2019s shootings on a military recruiting centre and navy reserve base in Chattanooga on \u201cradical Islam\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABrauM7yvco\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ABrauM7yvco?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lahren\u2019s boyfriend at the time was deployed overseas with the US military, so \u201cit was something that really resonated with me, and I was very angry at the way the media was covering it.\u201d With American flags streaming on a monitor behind her, Lahren said, among other things: \u201cRadical Islam is becoming the rule, not the exception. Yesterday\u2019s moderate is today\u2019s terrorist.\u201d She also called for a redoubled assault on Isis.<br></p> <p>The next morning, her phone blew up.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from high school were texting me and saying \u2018You\u2019re going viral.\u2019 I was the girl who eviscerated Obama.\u201d</p> <p>The video not only demonstrated that Final Thoughts was a winning formula: it brought her to the attention of honchos at The Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s post-Fox News conservative media company. Having rejected her as an intern, they recruited her as a rising star.</p> <p>In her new primetime slot, she is still intimately involved with the day-to-day production of the show, and she is dedicated to it. \u201cI don\u2019t have a family, I don\u2019t have a boyfriend. I am in Dallas for one reason only, and that is to do this show.\u201d She makes it back to her home town of Rapid City, South Dakota, only on the biggest holidays. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m very controversial, and I don\u2019t back down from being controversial</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her senior producer, Jessica Grose, works closely with Lahren. She came to The Blaze from long stints in daytime television, from TMZ to Oprah. She says they\u2019re not just colleagues but close friends. Grose\u2019s political views are less fixed, but she says that when she met her, \u201cI knew that there was something insanely special about her.\u201d Grose\u2019s pop culture chops feed into Lahren\u2019s issue and story selection. </p> <p>Lahren, Grose, and the rest of their small production team are all young women \u2013 unusual in any media company, and a surprise in a conservative outfit. That doesn\u2019t make her a feminist, though. In her view, that movement has been \u201chijacked\u201d, and has become \u201cpassively aggressively anti-men\u201d.</p> <p>This view might seem to contradict her independence and intense ambition. But historically, according to Professor Ronnee Schreiber at UC San Diego, conservative women have often been prominent in holding anti-feminist positions, not only as a movement strategy, but because \u201cit\u2019s a media story, and it helps conservative women get media attention\u201d.</p> <p>When asked to nominate a single quality that explains the speed with which she has become successful, Lahren quickly replies: \u201cFearlessness. I am fearless.\u201d Others who share her conservative views use the same adjective. Ciavolo, her college friend, says Lahren \u201chas been fearless in the way she\u2019s presented her message\u201d.</p> <p>Glenn Beck, her boss for just over a year, says via email: \u201cTomi speaks her mind and is fearless. At this point in history people are looking for people that say what they believe, regardless of the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren agrees with his analysis: \u201cThere are too many conservatives who are terrified of being labelled. They\u2019re afraid of being labelled and they\u2019re afraid of being not liked. I do not bullshit, I am genuine and authentic. I don\u2019t say these things to go viral or to be controversial, but I say things that a lot of people wish they could say but are fearful of saying.\u201d One of the labels some conservatives shrink from \u2013 and it is one that critics have freely applied to Lahren \u2013 is racist. She says commenters have repeatedly lampooned her as \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d.</p> <p> It\u2019s undeniable that her notoriety has come from incidents where she has taken on topics related to immigration (she describes herself as a \u201chardliner\u201d on the topic) and anything associated with or inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, which in one segment she compared to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baa42aa07bd95a531bd9328442f95481e77ad5a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baa42aa07bd95a531bd9328442f95481e77ad5a4/5_0_545_551/495.png\" alt=\"Tomi Lahren: \u2018I clearly have a point of view\u2019.\" width=\"495\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomi Lahren: \u2018I clearly have a point of view.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomi Lahren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cassino, the political scientist, thinks that like Donald Trump, Lahren may be both an example and beneficiary of a sea change in the way conservatives talk about race. \u201cThere was an unspoken rule in the conservative movement for a long time, which they learned from Richard Nixon: you do not talk openly about race. It was seen as toxic to talk about it in anything but dog whistles.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years ago, conservative commentators would talk in code about it, in terms of \u201cwelfare\u201d, \u201cinner city crime\u201d, or \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d. But in the last five to 10 years, Cassino says, \u201cit has become acceptable for conservatives to talk about race in concrete terms\u201d.</p> <p>The election of Obama, for example, led to arguments that talk of racial inequality was overblown, and eventually to criticisms of the president in terms of his racial identity. All of this precisely coincides with Lahren\u2019s formative political years.</p> <p>Like Trump and many other conservatives, Lahren puts this change down to a weariness with political correctness. \u201cFor too long, white people have been told that they can\u2019t talk about race, and that only some people of colour can talk about race. I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t say things to go viral, I say things that a lot of people wish they could say but are fearful of saying</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She insists that she is not racist, but also that \u201cthere can\u2019t be a group of people in this country who are blamed for the ills of minority communities and then not allowed to speak or defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>This appeal to white grievances is similar to the one made by the Trump campaign. Even if more conservatives are more willing to talk bluntly about their own racial views, there is still, for their audiences, a frisson in this that gets attention.</p> <p>Lahren has lately become a more enthusiastic supporter of the Republican nominee after her first choice, Marco Rubio, lost. A big motivation is her dislike of his opponent. \u201cI am #NeverHillary all the way down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may not like what Donald Trump says, but I don\u2019t like what Hillary Clinton does.\u201d Trump\u2019s excesses, she says, are forgivable as the flourishes of a performer. \u201cI\u2019m a performer, too,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Part of that performance is self-presentation, and her appearance is something that has attracted the ire of critics, including, she says, feminists. Certainly, it\u2019s been suggested that she is where she is because of her looks. \u201cI take care of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cDo some people watch me because they think I\u2019m pretty? Maybe, sure. But more are watching because they appreciate what I am saying.\u201d </p> <p>Her gender and age, however, do differentiate her from a sea of middle-aged, male conservative pundits \u2013 the kind of guys Cassino says are a dime a dozen. Just as important are her broadcasting talent and her ability to \u201cseize this political moment\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0_nyWVXCI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qq0_nyWVXCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As to whether Lahren\u2019s moment will last beyond our current political season, one consideration is that The Blaze, her employer, has had well-reported financial difficulties. The subscriber base is small, but it is also suffering from the same problem that led to the departure of Glenn Beck\u2019s still-popular show from Fox News. That is, an inability to attract big advertisers to support programming which is perceived as extreme.</p> <p>Lahren says she is committed to The Blaze, and is full of praise for Beck, but at some point she may be forced to find a new perch. According to Cassino, this may not be easy. \u201cThe messaging she\u2019s doing is going to make it very difficult for her to get mainstream advertisers. Like it or not, what you say on television is dictated by the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble and Chevy,\u201d Cassino says.</p> <p>Especially on issues of race, Lahren is speaking in terms corporate clients might find difficult to associate themselves with. And if she changes her messaging, what happens to her \u201cfearless\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d conservative brand? This is not something Beck is worried about. In his email, he added: \u201cAs long as she continues to be authentic, continues to seek knowledge, and is true to herself \u2013 even when she feels compelled to go against the grain, and her audience \u2013 she will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren clearly understands why and how her Final Thoughts videos work. \u201cI\u2019m very controversial, and I don\u2019t back down from being controversial,\u201d she says.

  "<p>Palmer Luckey, the creator of Facebook\u2019s Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html\">is the secret backer</a> of a pro-Donald Trump organisation aiming to turn the tide of the US election through \u201cmeme magic\u201d and \u201cshitposting\u201d.</p> <p>The group, <a href=\"https://www.nimbleamerica.com/\">Nimble America</a>, was publicly unveiled last week on r/The_Donald, the portion of social news site Reddit dedicated to supporting the Republican candidate. In its introduction to the world, now deleted, <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6-3q-m6OyY4J:https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5353i4/announcing_nimble_america/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">a moderator wrote</a> \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to accomplish here has been amazing and much bigger than any of us and certainly much bigger than Reddit.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve proven that shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real. So many of you have asked us, how we can bring this to real life.\u201d</p> <p>That same day, a user named \u201cNimbleRichMan\u201d came forward and offered to match donations for the group\u2019s first two days. In his post, also deleted, <a href=\"http://archive.is/By8Ow\">NimbleRichMan wrote</a>: \u201cYou and I are the same. We know Hillary Clinton is corrupt, a warmonger, a freedom-stripper. Not the good kind you see dancing in bikinis on Independence Day, the bad kind that strips freedom from citizens and grants it to donors.</p> <p>\u201cI reached out to the leaders of this community because I am doing everything I can to help make America great again. I have already donated significant funds to Nimble America, and will continue to do so. I need your help: For the next 48 hours, I will match your donations dollar for dollar. Donate $10 and I will match you by flying my jet a minute less. Donate a hundred and I will match you by skipping a glass of scotch. Donate a thousand and I will match by putting off the tire change on my car. Am I bragging? Will people be offended? Yes, but those people already hate Donald. They cannot stand to see successful people who are proud of their success.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s generate some success of our own. Make America great again with your meme magic, centipedes of The Donald!\u201d</p> <p>The post and group, however, quickly attracted controversy from users of Reddit. NimbleRichMan\u2019s identity had only been confirmed to Reddit\u2019s moderators and a Breitbart News editor, and the group itself was accused of being a scam. \u201cLooks to me like some of the mods have finally decided to cash in on this community, and it\u2019s not going over so well for them, because this shit seems scummier than it seems scammy, which is pretty bad, because it seems reeeaaaallly scammy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5353i4/announcing_nimble_america/d7q2a5w\">reads one typical response</a>. Others called for Trump-supporting Redditors to only donate to the Trump campaign, rather than an unaffiliated non-profit.</p> <p>Now, seemingly in an attempt to quell the controversy, Luckey has come forward <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html\">to the Daily Beast</a> as the money-man \u2013 and RichMan \u2013 behind Nimble America. Luckey confirmed that NimbleRichMan was also his Reddit account, but denied being more than a money man for the group \u2013 despite being listed as co-founder and vice-president <a href=\"https://www.nimbleamerica.com/about\">on its site</a>. (That listing has now also been deleted.)</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of money,\u201d Luckey told the Daily Beast. \u201cMoney is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.</p> <p>\u201cI came into touch with them over Facebook,\u201d Luckey added. \u201cIt went along the lines of \u2018hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff.\u2019 They wanted to build buzz and do fundraising.\u201d</p> <p>Luckey made his fortune, estimated at $700m, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality\">he sold his virtual reality startup</a> to Facebook for $2bn two years ago. He is the second big name associated with the social network to publicly back Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/22/peter-thiel-paypal-donald-trump-silicon-valley-libertarian\">Peter Thiel</a>, the Facebook board member who recently put Gawker out of business.</p> <p>The pair stand in marked contrast to Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who has been vocal in his support of progressive policies \u2013 and his opposition to Donald Trump. In April, Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/apr/12/mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-comments-immigration-video\">told Facebook\u2019s F8 conference</a> that he was alarmed by a shift in many countries towards people looking inwards, saying he heard \u201cfearful voices calling for building walls\u201d and halting immigration.</p>",
  "<p>In a dusty expanse of desert in eastern Kenya sits the world\u2019s largest refugee settlement, the place I call home.</p> <p>The camp was <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2008/aug/27/somalia-international-aid-and-development\">set up in 1991</a> to house Somalis fleeing the civil war. At first, there were three settlements: Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadera. Ifo II and Kambioos were later added. They are all generally called Dadaab, named after the nearby town 50 miles (80km) from the Somali border.</p> <p>Half a million people are estimated to live here. My family are among them. They arrived in Ifo in the early 1990s; I was born in 1996. </p> <p>I grew up and completed high school here in 2014, and I hope to start university soon. I\u2019ve been writing since I was a child and I am hoping to become a journalist.

In 2012, closing the camp was mooted due to \u201ceconomic concerns\u201d, and last year, the Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, said Dadaab would be shut within three months, although this never happened.</p> <p>From the attack on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya\">Westgate shopping mall</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/kenya-attack-survivors-garissa-al-shabaab\">slaughter at Garissa</a> University College, the Kenyan government has long blamed Somali refugees for insecurity, but for people in the camp, the most recent announcement feels like the most serious yet. The government disbanded the department for refugee affairs and politicians are keen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">appear in control</a> of national security, with a presidential election coming up next year.</p> <p>It is true that security has become an issue here. There is one main dusty road that runs through Ifo. I used to go there as a child to watch the cars drive past at exactly 8am, every day, etched with UN letters, carrying workers to their field offices. Today, it is almost dormant. </p> <p>Two Spanish aid workers from Doctors Without Borders were <a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/the-two-spanish-msf-workers-kidnapped-in-kenya-21-months-ago-are-released\">kidnapped in October 2011</a> and there have been multiple explosions over the years. Cars no longer move without a heavy security escort or following a predicable schedule. </p> <p>Other things have also changed. The playground where I played football is now occupied by people living in tents. The narrow path I walked to school is a graveyard and the hospital I attended as a child lies in ruins.</p> <h2><strong>What happens to us?</strong></h2> <p>The government has said we should return to Somalia voluntarily. This week, it <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-refugees-idUSKCN11R270\">asked the UN</a> for financial support, but has not disclosed many details on how our return can happen quickly and humanely. </p> <p>The UN refugee agency has a plan. UNHCR suggests that refugees awaiting resettlement in a third country, and those not originally from Somalia \u2013 about 30,000 people \u2013 should be rehomed at the Kakuma refugee camp, about 450 miles from Nairobi. </p> <p>It says 42,000 people living in Dadaab are registered Kenyan nationals and should be reintegrated into local communities. The remaining 170,000 refugees must return to Somalia.</p> <p>My family are in the first category. The UN opened a resettlement case for us in 2004 and we were supposed to go to live in the US. We attended the necessary medical examinations 17 times, but our flight never arrived.<br></p> <p>We suspect fraud. Maybe someone sold our slot and a different family went on it. This does happen.</p> <p>\u201cWait, be patient,\u201d is what I was told when I contacted the resettlement support centre, but 12 years is a long time to hold out. My father has given up; he says we should return to Somalia. But I was born here, in Kenya \u2013 a country that doesn\u2019t accept me.</p> <p>People in Dadaab are reacting to the threat of closure differently. Some, such as Hawa Abdi, 23, have gone back to Somalia of their own accord. I spoke to the mother of three children in Ifo II a week before she left in July. She explained that she had fled Sakow in 2011 after the devastating drought in Somalia. </p> <p>Abdi had heard that rainfall was predicted for her home town. \u201cIf Kenya doesn\u2019t want us, why should we stay here?\u201d she asked. </p> <p>But for Fatuma Mohamed, 44, a long-term resident of Ifo, this is home. Mohamed fled Somali in 1991 and has since married and had eight children here. \u201cThe land we had in Somalia has long been taken away and we don\u2019t have a place to return to ... I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, speaking at her polythene-thatched home with a kitchen made out of twigs.</p> <p>Mohamed Issack, 20, who grew up in Dagahaley, dreams of being accepted by his host country. \u201cI would have loved to be a Kenyan and free to live in any part of this country ... but that is not an option for me,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/asadhussein_/status/738851697192259588\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who has the courage to stand at the place where they were born and not cry?

  "<p>Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that Hillary Clinton bears responsibility for unrest that has followed police shootings of African Americans, saying she has \u201csupported with a nod\u201d the idea \u201cthat cops are a racist force to our society\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton \u201cshares directly in with the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country,\u201d Trump told a crowd of several thousand in suburban Philadelphia, while the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, braced for a third night of protests following a fatal police shooting of a black man.</p> <p>\u201cRioting in the streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens and it must be ended and it must be ended now,\u201d Trump told the almost entirely white crowd. The Republican nominee dismissed a brief protest against him as the result of a few \u201cviolent disrupters\u201d and pledged: \u201cI am with you and I will fight for you\u201d to \u201claw-abiding African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/north-carolina-protester-dies-keith-scott-police-shooting\">police confirmed the death</a> of a protester shot in demonstrations in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/protesters-clash-with-police-in-charlotte-after-fatal-shooting-of-black-man\">aftermath of the killing of Keith Scott</a> in Charlotte on Tuesday. Police and Scott\u2019s family have given contradictory accounts of the shooting, with officers alleging he had a gun and family saying he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/keith-scott-video-charlotte-police-shooting\">held a book</a>. After review of dashboard and body camera footage, the police chief and family both told reporters that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/north-carolina-protester-dies-keith-scott-police-shooting\">video of the altercation is ambiguous</a>. On Thursday night, however, protesters marched to the chant: \u201cWe want the tapes.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday Oklahoma prosecutors also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/terence-crutcher-betty-shelby-manslaughter-tulsa\">announced the indictment</a> of a police officer over the fatal shooting of an unarmed African American in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p> <p>The Republican nominee suggested earlier in the day in Pittsburgh that protesters may have been acting under the influence of narcotics, telling the Shale Insight Convention: \u201cIf you\u2019re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you\u2019re watching on television.\u201d Trump added that he would have \u201cno compassion for lawless conduct\u201d.</p> <p>Mike Pence, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/charlotte-mike-pence-police-shootings/\">also spoke about the issue</a> on Thursday, telling pastors in Colorado that he disagreed with protesters who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/17/one-year-ago-eric-garner-new-york\">demonstrated against</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/27/baltimore-police-protesters-violence-freddie-gray\">police abuses</a> for nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/25/violent-civil-unrest-ferguson-grand-jury-decision\">two years</a>. \u201cDonald Trump and I believe that there\u2019s been far too much talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement,\u201d Pence said, insisting the issue was resolved. \u201cWe ought to set aside this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias.\u201d</p> <p>The Indiana governor added: \u201cPolice officers are human beings.
