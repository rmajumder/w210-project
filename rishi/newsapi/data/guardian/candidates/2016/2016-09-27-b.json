  "<p>Colin Kaepernick has hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the quarterback \u201cshould find another country that works better for him\u201d in response to his decision to kneel for the national anthem.</p> <p>Kaepernick, whose protest has sparked a national discussion over racial injustice and inspired dozens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/marcus-peters-raises-fist-national-anthem-nfl-protest\">other professional</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/national-anthem-protest-college-football-kaepernick\">collegiate players</a> to follow suit, characterized Trump\u2019s comment as a \u201cvery ignorant statement\u201d during Tuesday afternoon\u2019s media availability at the 49ers\u2019 practice facility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/national-anthem-protest-lebron-james-colin-kaepernick-nba\">LeBron James will not protest during anthem but fears for his children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very ignorant statement that, if you don\u2019t agree with what\u2019s going on, hearing that if you want justice and liberty and freedom for all, then you should leave the country,\u201d Kaepernick told reporters in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CamInman/status/780863524377464833/video/1\">video shared by the Bay Area News Group</a>. \u201cHe always says make America great again. Well, America has never been great for people of color. And that\u2019s something that needs to be addressed. Let\u2019s make America great for the first time.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick\u2019s remarks came the morning after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-polls-reaction-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">Monday\u2019s first presidential debate</a>, where Trumped doubled down on his call for the national introduction of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, the controversial police tactic ruled unconstitutional in 2013 when a federal judge found it disproportionately targeted African American and Latino neighborhoods.</p> <p>Trump first addressed Kaepernick\u2019s protest in an appearance last month on the Dori Monson Show, a conservative afternoon talk-radio program in the Seattle area.</p> <p>\u201cI have followed it and I think it\u2019s personally not a good thing,\u201d the GOP candidate said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing, and you know, maybe he should find a country that works better for him. Let him try: it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Hall of Fame coach Mike Ditka <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/mike-ditka-colin-kaepernick-get-the-hell-out-anthem-protest\">echoed Trump\u2019s remarks last week</a> and said he had \u201cno respect\u201d for the quarterback and the players who have joined the protest.</p> <p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t like the country, if they don\u2019t like our flag, get the hell out,\u201d Ditka said in a radio interview on KRLD-FM in Dallas. \u201cI have no respect for Colin Kaepernick. He probably has no respect for me, that\u2019s his choice. My choice is that I like this country, I respect our flag, and I don\u2019t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick, who burst from obscurity to lead San Francisco to within five yards of a Super Bowl title during the 2012 season, has yet to take a snap in three regular-season games as a backup to starter Blaine Gabbert. He said last month he will continue to kneel until he feels the social injustices facing people of color in the United States have been addressed.</p> <p>The 49ers host the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday afternoon.</p>",

  "<p>Ratings for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are starting to trickle in, and while 83 million Americans watched, viewership was not quite as \u201cyuge\u201d as anticipated. Still, the figures are enough to break the <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2008/top-ten-presidential-debates-1960-to-present.html\">80.6 million viewer record</a> set by the Ronald Reagan\u2019s debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980. </p> <p>Reagan and Carter had just a few channels competing for viewers, and no internet. The latest figure is all the more impressive given the number of digital streaming options available to viewers \u2013 CBS\u2019s digital news division, CBSN, said it had logged 2.98m streams and 1.4 million unique viewers in total. YouTube said just under 2 million people streamed video of the debate from six news outlets that officially used its platform.

  "<p><br>I think I must have a kind face. People always talk to me. I\u2019m the guy who always gets asked for directions, even in cities where I\u2019m a tourist. When people need help reaching something at the grocery store, they ask me. Something about my expression must say: \u201cI mean you no harm.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m all right with that. When I was younger, I always wanted to be one of those devastatingly good-looking people who stopped strangers in their tracks. I worked at a coffee shop with a guy named Alan who was so beautiful that once when he was wiping down the tables out front, a driver rear-ended another car because she was so distracted by the sight of him.</p> <p>Nobody ever rear-ended a car over me, but honestly, given the choice I think I would take what I have. Having an \u201capproachable\u201d face has meant that my life has been full of interesting conversations with strangers.</p> <p>Author Kio Stark\u2019s new book <a href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/When-Strangers-Meet/Kio-Stark/TED-Books/9781501119989\">When Strangers Meet: How People You Don\u2019t Know Can Transform You</a> is about her seven-year personal study of her interactions with strangers in New York City. She believes that reaching across the gulf of silence that normally stands between ourselves and the people we encounter on a daily basis is not just essential, but transformative.</p> <p>In a Ted talk about the book, Stark said: \u201cWhen you talk to strangers, you\u2019re making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life \u2013 and theirs.\u201d</p> <p>Obviously, respecting people\u2019s boundaries is important, but so often when I find myself in elevators and waiting rooms, in line at the drugstore or the deli counter, I will smile at someone and if I receive an answering flickering of friendliness in their eyes, I will strike up a conversation.</p> <p>Sometimes I\u2019ve thought of something funny, sometimes I just remark that it\u2019s a beautiful night or day. Sometimes I speak up when I admire someone\u2019s style. Parenthetically, I\u2019ve noticed as a gay man that there is a particular way of saying: \u201cI love your shoes/lipstick/earrings\u201d to women that lets them know I\u2019m not a straight man who\u2019s trying to sell myself to them like a bad car salesman.</p> <p>Like Stark, I\u2019ve heard some amazing stories, some sad stories and some stories that opened my eyes to worlds I\u2019d never thought existed. Some of the best stories I\u2019ve heard have been from people in New York City.</p> <p>In spite of New York\u2019s reputation for rudeness, I have found that being openly friendly and falling back on my southern manners, saying \u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cNo, sir\u201d in New York makes people just melt.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re from Georgia?\u201d they say, as if they\u2019re surprised there\u2019s no actual damp cow manure on my boots or hayseeds in my hair. \u201cWell let me tell you about my favorite diner/movie house/karaoke bar etc.\u201d</p> <p>The best meals I\u2019ve had in London, Chicago, Philadelphia and yes, New York, have been places I\u2019ve tried after striking up a conversation with a cashier or a cab driver or someone in a coffee shop. My experience has always been that New York is a city that\u2019s itching to tell me its secrets.</p> <p>Our consumerist, stratified society dictates to us that we live inside our own lines, associating primarily with people like ourselves. We go about our business, buy groceries and order food alongside each other, but we never connect.</p> <p>In the presidential debate on Monday night, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said \u201cimplicit bias is a problem for everyone\u201d. Our culture inculcates its ideas and prejudices and dogmas into us virtually from the moment we open our eyes.</p> <p>Part of undoing the fear that separates us, dispelling the hostility and suspicion, is pushing past the lines of race and gender and orientation and political affiliation that divide us and connecting as human beings full of love and desires and fears and aspirations. In this way, communicating with people outside our prescribed societal sphere feels to me like a deliciously seditious act.</p> <p>When we connect, when we really learn about each other and find out what we have in common, we are fighting the power. When we see each other as individuals and not as representing The Other, we\u2019re already fighting to stop the next war.</p> <p>So if you see me out there somewhere, say hello. Let\u2019s talk. And if you need me to reach something for you on a high shelf, I\u2019ll be happy to. </p>",

Earlier this year, a coalition of dozens of police chiefs and prosecutors from across the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/donald-trump-crime-policy-law-enforcement-officials-letter\">urged Trump in an open letter</a> to instead pursue a policy of reducing arrests and imprisoning fewer Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThough this may seem counterintuitive, we know from our experience as law enforcement officials that over-relying on incarceration does not deter crime,\u201d said the letter.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI think maybe there\u2019s a political reason why you can\u2019t say it, but I really don\u2019t believe \u2013 in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.

It did fall sharply, however, under the Democratic mayor David Dinkins, who hired thousands more police officers and focused on the kind of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d Hillary Clinton championed during the debate.</p> <p>This steep decline continued under Dinkins\u2019s successor, Republican Rudolph Giuliani, who from 1994 ushered in an aggressive, data-driven form of policing including the \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d tactic of halting and searching pedestrians for weapons or drugs on a lower standard of proof than the probable cause typically needed. Mayor Michael Bloomberg carried this on. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado, Miss Universe weight-shamed by Trump, speaks out for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysts, however, have <a href=\"http://www3.istat.it/istat/eventi/2003/perunasocieta/relazioni/Langan_rel.pdf\">not found clear evidence</a> Giuliani-style policing was responsible for New York\u2019s crime reduction.

It\u2019s a classic move from this sitcom, as is Jack (Sean Hayes) showing up and wondering why everything in the fridge is 10 years old or Will and Jack trying to convince everyone that not all gays think alike and then launching into a simultaneous tirade about Ryan Lochte on Dancing with the Stars. </p> <p>But, like always, all of the really great lines to go Karen (Megan Mullally), the vacuous socialite and Trump supporter who has built a wall in her backyard to keep her housekeeper Rosario out of the main house. Of course Karen is more of a caricature of a Trump voter and she claims that she helped Trump \u201cpick out\u201d Melania like she was a mail-order bride and marvels at the \u201cmahogany brown of the staff\u201d at Mar-a-Lago (Which takes on a different meaning after the first debate when Trump\u2019s claim that he isn\u2019t racist is that his clubs allow members of all races to join.) </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzae4DKexko\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jzae4DKexko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is where the video fails. One of the biggest problems of this election is that liberals like Will and Grace (and the creative team behind this) treat Trump as a punchline. They don\u2019t take his proposals or those who are swayed by them seriously. These tactics are not going to sway voters to be #ImWithHer supporters, they\u2019re just going to reconfirm misguided notions that Trump\u2019s America has about \u201cHollywood liberals\u201d and how they don\u2019t understand their plight.</p> <p> The second half of the video then focuses on trying to convince Jack, an uneducated white male who happens to vote in Pennsylvania, that he should support Clinton. Grace gives an impassioned speech about how cracking the glass ceiling would be important, but what ultimately convinces him is that Katy Perry is a big Clinton fan, something that probably won\u2019t sway most Pennsylvania voters. </p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s a good gag though, and every laugh is truly earned. It was great to see the old gang back in action and they\u2019re all still as sharp and funny as they were when the show was in its heyday. But this clip was more preaching to the choir and a nice diversion for those who already support Clinton. If the aim was to win the election, it might not convince all the undecided voters out there to join the liberal cause. </p> <p>However there is one truly subversive joke when Grace tells Karen that Trump says awful things about Karen\u2019s maid who is a Mexican American. Will retorts: \u201cShe\u2019s from El Salvador.\u201d Grace replies: \u201cSame difference.\u201d This highlights that liberals, while trying to do good, don\u2019t even realize some of their blind spots. Unfortunately, I\u2019m afraid this modest, topical entertainment is going to fall squarely into one of those blind spots. </p>",

I\u2019m sorry it has taken a while to post a summary, but Labour were slow sending out the transcript. Anyway, it\u2019s worth it. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tom Watson warned Labour against \u201ctrashing\u201d the record of the Blair and Brown governments. </strong>In a comment clearly aimed at some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supports, which received strong applause, Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t know why we\u2019ve been focusing on what was wrong with the Blair and Brown governments for the last six years, but trashing our own record is not the way to enhance our brand. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He told Labour not to treat capitalism as the enemy.</strong> This passage seemed to be aimed at some on the Corbyn wing of the party too.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the past, big businesses were too easily cast as predators. We meant to say that we would stand up to the abuse of corporate power as the Tories never will. But we ended up sounding like we were anti-business; anti-prosperity; anti-success. We\u2019re not and we never have been. Capitalism, comrades, is not the enemy. Money\u2019s not the problem. Business isn\u2019t bad. The real world is more complicated than that, as any practical trade unionist will tell you. Businesses are where people work. The private sector\u2019s what generates the money to pay for our schools and hospitals.</p> <p>We can afford the best health service in the world because we are one of the most prosperous countries in the world. That\u2019s a fact and we forget it at our peril. And I don\u2019t say this because it\u2019s what wins elections, I say it because it is true. And people know that it\u2019s true. And that\u2019s why it wins elections. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he expected an early general election.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a general election soon. The more often Theresa May says it won\u2019t happen, the more certain I am that it will. And, comrades, we need to be ready.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour could win a general election by building on its achievements in local government.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We owe the British people - our people - an alternative to a government that doesn\u2019t care and a Prime Minster they didn\u2019t vote for. You keep hearing that Labour can\u2019t win, well we can, and we will. And I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re going to win: we\u2019re going to win through local government because that\u2019s how we always win.</p> <p>Our councillors are the engine of Labour\u2019s electoral machine. It\u2019s Labour councilors all over the country who are our leaders and ambassadors in local communities. Our councillors and our trade unions: these are the rocks our movement\u2019s built on.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He lavished praise on Labour\u2019s leaders in local government and in the Wales. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a champion [Sadiq Khan] is. What an outstanding representative of our great national capital and our historic socialist party - still relevant, resonant, and winning elections in one of the most dynamic cities on earth.</p> <p>And in Bristol we have got marvellous Marvin, who you have just heard from.</p> <p>What a hero. And in our other great conurbations next May: Andy Burnham,</p> <p>Si\u00f4n Simon and Steve Rotherham are going to follow Sadiq\u2019s and Marvin\u2019s example. And Carwyn in Wales. Reminding people what Labour government looks like - how innovative and radical we can be. How growth and prosperity, social justice and fairness all go hand in hand under Labour. And not just doing the right thing - not just compassion - but doing the thing right. Competence.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson\u2019s comments about people like Sadiq Khan and Marvin Rees contrasted strongly with what he had to say about Jeremy Corbyn. He praised Corbyn\u2019s performance at the last PMQs, when he attacked Theresa May over grammar schools, but otherwise his praise for Corbyn was conspicuous by its absence.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed his plan to set up an independent commission on the future of work.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the next Labour government we must judge ourself on our ability to redraw that pie-chart. The problems of inequality aren\u2019t new, but the solutions will need to be. So I\u2019ve put together an independent commission on the future of work, to start influencing policy right now - from opposition.</p> <p>It will be chaired by Helen Mountfield QC, joined by a world-class team including Naomi Climer, the first ever female President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Professor Michael Sandel, Jon Cruddas, Lord Jim Knight and many more. We\u2019ll feed into Jon Trickett\u2019s work on building a targeted Industrial Strategy and we\u2019ll report back to you next year.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the Tories only cared about money and power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of the real British values the Tories can never understand; of compassion and fairness alongside enterprise and fierce independence. This is no nation of ideologues. We know that and that\u2019s our advantage over the Tories.</p> <p>They\u2019re blinded by money and power. It\u2019s all they care about. And the old lady next door; and your neighbour\u2019s children; and that migrant family working 60 hours a week and paying taxes: all these can go hang to the Tories. Other people don\u2019t matter. Well that\u2019s not the British way.</p> <p>Yes, British people want a fair chance for themselves and their families. They want their hard work rewarded. But they also care what happens to the other children in the class, the other people at the bus stop, the others in the lengthening queues waiting months now for life-saving operations.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"181b4c82c43cd25ac24fb55be3bcc8dc1d1cbc1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/181b4c82c43cd25ac24fb55be3bcc8dc1d1cbc1f/0_255_4954_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T17:15:23.596Z\">at 6.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8fdee4b08ca277ca0c28\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T16:09:03.464Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>has done a round of interviews with broadcasters this afternoon. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he would hold a shadow cabinet reshuffle next week.</strong> It would not be this week, he said, but it would come before parliament resumes a week on Monday.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will be appointing ahead of the return of Parliament to ensure that we have an effective shadow cabinet. We are filling the positions, but we are not announcing anything this week. It is all going to come later on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn also hinted that the reshuffle might not involve filling all 60-odd vacant frontbench jobs. He said he would \u201cdevelop a team of the size that we need\u201d. But there is no absolute requirement for the shadow ministerial team to be as large as it was. In the past oppositions have functioned with fewer shadow ministers than they normally have now.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that \u201clots\u201d of MPs would return to the front bench. </strong>\u201cLots of MPs are coming back,\u201d he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He restated his opposition to bringing back full shadow cabinet elections. </strong>Asked if he would agree to them, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn\u2019t vote for it. I\u2019m open to the idea and I understand the argument behind it, but I also think the leader of the party must have the ability to form the general policy areas.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, despite saying the party leader had to have some right to determine policy direction, he also reaffirmed his commitment to extending party democracy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think intrinsically, members need to have much more say in policy making for the longer term. That means we have to engage much earlier on. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said there might be a \u201cspecial meeting of the policy forum\u201d later this year to consider proposed changes to party rules.</strong> Labour\u2019s national executive committee is expected to discuss these proposals, covering policy making and the selection of the shadow cabinet, at a meeting in November.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he accepted that Labour\u2019s policy was to back Trident - while also suggesting it could change in the future.</strong> He also reaffirmed his personal opposition to nuclear weapons.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The policy the party has from previous conference decisions does support the renewal of Trident. As you know, I never agreed with that decision ... That\u2019s the existing party policy. I cannot predict what will happen in the future, who will decide what they want to bring forward to conference.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that he wanted to \u201clead this party in a direction will bring about a nuclear free world.\u201d (In their speeches to the conference yesterday Clive Lewis, the shadow defence secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8f854e4b03598d1ce8b89#block-57e8f854e4b03598d1ce8b89\">both stressed Labour\u2019s commitment to multilateral nuclear disarmament </a>- suggesting that this might be a compromise policy around which Labour\u2019s pro and anti-Trident factions could coalesce.)</p> <p>Asked if he \u201caccepted\u201d party policy, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course I know what the party policy is and of course I understand the decision that was taken. Does it mean there are people in the party who have a moral objection to nuclear weapons? Yes there are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he never wanted to use a nuclear weapon</strong>. Asked if he would fire a nuclear weapon, he replied: \u201cI never want to use a nuclear weapon.\u201d This is as less provocative answer than the one he gave last year, when asked on Today if he would press the nuclear button. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/30/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-morning-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-560b8d2be4b00e76364a24d8#block-560b8d2be4b00e76364a24d8\">On that occasion he bluntly said no, </a>prompting pro-Trident MPs to claim that he had rendered the nuclear deterrent worthless. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He played down the nature of the row with Clive Lewis about the wording of his speech.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s perfectly normal that there be discussions with shadow cabinet colleagues on statements they are going to make, and that\u2019s what happened. It was discussed and that\u2019s what came out of it. I don\u2019t see it as a huge problem, I don\u2019t see it as a huge issue.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that Sadiq Khan\u2019s speech was directed at him.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How is that a lecture to me? It was a lecture to everybody that we have to come together to get in power ... What he was saying was we have to win a national election. On that we are all agreed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was wrong to treat socialism as a dirty word.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Socialism is the basis of what brought the Labour Party about, it\u2019s the basis of what forms our opinions. It\u2019s actually the basis of why we got the NHS. The Labour Party has won lots of elections ...</p> <p>Stop treating the word `socialism\u2019 as if its some sort of bad word we should only talk about late at night. It\u2019s an ideology that\u2019s based on the principle that everyone should contribute and those in need should benefit the most from our common endeavours.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that Labour was not reaching out to ordinary voters.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How is a message that is about making sure that everyone in this country has a living wage, that there is real job security, that we end zero hours contracts, that we invest in infrastructure, railways and broadband, schools and hospitals \u2013 how is that not a message that reaches out to millions of people all across this country?</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he had changed the political agenda.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I tell you what \u2013 the political agenda has changed \u2013 Everyone\u2019s against austerity now, they weren\u2019t a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would tackle concerns about immigration partly by trying to standardise living standards across Europe.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I would do about immigration is try to bring about a degree of co-terminosity, a degree of equality of work conditions and wages across Europe.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450b6c11771c87569a69e04543f977c340c7dad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450b6c11771c87569a69e04543f977c340c7dad0/0_164_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T16:30:27.589Z\">at 5.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8d13e4b04cbd30bc3a59\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:25:31.615Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Angela Rayner vows to fight extending grammar schools with 'every breath in my body</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Angela Rayner,</strong> the shadow education secretary, spoke earlier.

She has produced no evidence that grammar schools help social mobility. Selection - or segregation as it should be called - entrenches division and increases inequality ...</p> <p>Conference, Theresa May is telling fairy tales about social mobility and opportunity. Selection is toxic. It tells a clever child they are stupid, strips a child of self-esteem and embeds inequality. Every child has potential. Every child can succeed. No child should be left out or left behind. </p> <p>Conference, Tony Blair talked about education, education, education. Theresa May wants segregation, segregation, segregation. And our Labour Party will fight it, starting on Saturday when we launch our nationwide campaign against more grammar schools. We\u2019re going to take the fight to the Tories and I appeal to all my MP colleagues to help lead this fight. Together, we can defeat Theresa May.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She confirmed that she was setting up a childcare taskforce.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is why I am proud to announce today, Labour\u2019s new childcare taskforce, to help us transform early years provision for every family in the 21st century. And I\u2019m delighted that Liz Snape, the deputy general secretary of Unison, who you heard from this morning, has agreed to chair that taskforce, working with Labour\u2019s shadow education team and childcare experts.</p> <p>Our aim will be to provide the care and support for every child to fulfil their potential, and to help parents back to work. Access to affordable, high-quality childcare and early years learning is one of the most effective drivers of social mobility.

The concept has been developed by the economist Mariana Mazzucato, who is advising Labour, and McDonnell said she had told him it was not just about favouring business.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mariana Mazzucato is advising us on how we become an entrepreneurial state.

Flynn, a leftwinger, has spent most of his career on the backbenches as a member of the awkward squad but he was appointed to the shadow cabinet in the summer when the resignations happened. Flynn doubles up as shadow Welsh secretary and shadow leader of the Commons. His promotion was all the more remarkable because he is 81.</p> <p>Flynn started with a joke about his age. He was speaking as a \u201cgrateful recipient of Jeremy\u2019s job creation scheme for geriatrics\u201d, he said. But his speech, which he delivered in his capacity as shadow leader of the Commons, contained some strong lines.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn appealed to the Labour MPs who resigned from the front bench to return.</strong> He said he disagreed with Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, who gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e92dc5e4b01a7059fc9dac#block-57e92dc5e4b01a7059fc9dac\">a speech yesterday saying the \u201cmerchants of doom\u201d should quit. </a>Flynn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Len McCluskey made a speech for unity yesterday but there is one phrase in it - the one that he stole from Shakespeare - that I must disagree with, because he did say \u2018some should depart the field\u2019. No, no, no.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got some of our best people sitting on the subs bench, you don\u2019t score goals from the subs bench. Some resigned, they all did for honourable reasons. It took courage for many of them to resign, it\u2019s going to take greater courage for many of them to come back and we must make it possible for them to return with dignity and respect.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour should abandon negativity.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the last 12 months we\u2019ve been locked in a gap year of negativity, of pessimism, of hopelessness, by many in our party. It seemed at times a competition to see who could be the most pessimistic about our future and our prospects - we\u2019ve got to end that. It\u2019s time to now to give unity a chance. Take all the bile and the hatred together, put it in a box, bury it deep underground, put six feet of concrete on top and then put a sign saying \u2018never should the last 12 months be unearthed from its dishonest grave\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn insisted that Labour could win. To back his point, he recalled helping out during the 1945 general election campaign with his brother. He was only 10 at the time, but he remembers his mother telling him he was wasting his time. She told him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, boys, you are on the right side, it\u2019s the Labour party, it\u2019s our party, but this candidate cannot win because of prejudice. You cannot win in Wales as a candidate if you\u2019ve got an Irish name. And no one called Jim Callaghan has any future in politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Callaghan was elected MP for Cardiff South in 1945, and of course went on to become prime minister.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn claimed that Labour had enjoyed \u201cmarvellous results\u201d in elections over the last year.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trouble with unity is that it is not sexy. The media, the press, are not interested in it. They are interested in rows, they are interested in division, they are interested in conflict. But they don\u2019t notice the brilliant year we\u2019ve had: magnificent election results. Instead of the polls, look at what happens when real people use real votes in real elections. Marvellous results in all the mayoral elections, in all the byelections. In Wales we gained three parliamentary seats that we lost a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn seems to be using the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d rather loosely. For a more accurate assessment of Labour\u2019s electoral record over the last year, read <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9749\">this UK Polling Report blog by Anthony Wells.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn mocked David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Daily Mail, of all people, described his honours list as devalued, debased, discredited, egregious, grubby, tawdry, tainted, tarnished - otherwise alright. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Britain needed \u201croot and branch reform of our democracy\u201d.</strong> But reform needed to happen by cross-party agreement, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only House in the world where we have chieftains, hereditary chieftains in parliament, is ourselves and Lesotho. Only another country, Iran, has clerics as lawmakers. We need a thorough reform of our democracy. It must be done on an all-party basis. It must be done with the consent of all parties so that we get a fresh democracy that\u2019s fair, that\u2019s durable, that\u2019s democratic. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc67b57c7706845e4fe5f00a861438d40725b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc67b57c7706845e4fe5f00a861438d40725b6a/0_75_3776_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Flynn addresses the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Flynn addresses the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea7422e4b04cbd30bc39bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:30:36.796Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wendy Nichols,</strong> who is chairing the afternoon\u2019s session, has just told delegates that Iain McNicol, the Labour general secretary, has ensured that the stand giving away free copies of the Sun will take them away.

It was a tribute to the way, during the London mayoral campaign, Khan relentlessly and unashamedly kept going on about his upbringing at every opportunity. It worked, because there is not a soul in London who does not know what Khan\u2019s dad did for a living. Khan is someone who understands the importance of repetition.</p> <p>But this speech took the art of repetition to a whole new level. At times it was veering into self-parody. Essentially, almost every sentence was about how Labour can only achieve things if it is \u201cin power\u201d. It certainly wasn\u2019t subtle, and some will accuse him of overkill, but if Khan\u2019s only concern was to get his message across, then it was certainly effective.</p> <p>And what was the message? Khan backed Owen Smith in the leadership contest because he thought Jeremy Corbyn could not win an election. He explained his thinking in an Observer article. In his speech today Khan did not criticise Corbyn directly, and he specifically said that the leadership issue was settled. But he did not retract anything he said during the summer. His focus on the importance of Labour being able to win elections to get things down could be seen as a firm reminder to Corbyn that he will be judged by electoral performance, but it sounded more as if Khan was advertising his own credentials as an election winner. He seemed to be putting down a marker for the future, signalling that if Labour needs an election-winner when the Corbyn era is over, Khan will be available.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Khan said Labour should focus on winning power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the election this summer the leadership of our party has now been decided and I congratulate Jeremy on his clear victory. Now it\u2019s time for us all to work together towards the greatest prize: getting Labour back into power.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that Labour was in power in local government and in Wales, if not at Westminster.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Labour in power, Britain is a fairer country - a more equal country and a more just country. And Labour is in power right now - not just in London but in Wales too. Labour re-elected with the First Minister, Carwyn Jones, and in Bristol with the new Mayor, Marvin Rees. Labour is in power right now in Liverpool, Manchester and Southampton; in Newcastle, Glasgow and Cambridge; in Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds and Cardiff too.</p> <p>Labour is in power in towns and cities the length and breadth of Britain. And Conference, where Labour is in power it\u2019s thanks to your hard work. Thanks to Labour members, activists and supporters. Thanks to the trade unions and the working people they represent. Thanks to the Labour staff who work so hard for us.<br></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explained why being in power was so important.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Labour out of power, the number of affordable new homes built falls, the cost of rent rockets, and the number of homeless people sleeping on our streets rises. But it\u2019s only with Labour in power that we can make tackling the housing crisis our number one priority; we can create new teams like Homes for Londoners, to get more genuinely affordable homes built; or a new social letting scheme to stop renters being ripped off; we can enact new policies like the London Living Rent to put home ownership back within reach for our young people; and we can make tackling homelessness and rough sleeping a real priority - because it\u2019s a stain on our great nation.</p> <p>Most of the speech consisted of Khan making this point again and again, but applying it to issues like housing, air pollution, social integration, inequality, education, Brexit and the public services.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that EU citizens in Britain are welcome.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019d like to take a moment to speak to the European citizens living across Britain, and who make a huge contribution to our NHS, schools, on construction sites and in business: you make a massive contribution to our country; economically, socially and culturally. Thank you. Thank you for all that you do to make our country great.

In the Conservative Party, where the overthrow of leaders is an art form nurtured and treasured over two centuries, we would never have made this error. The rule of thumb is that it takes a good two years for a party to despair even of a very unsuccessful leader. By jumping the natural starting gun, the moderates left some Labour members able to say that their leader was still new and hadn\u2019t been given a chance.</p> <p>Third, that premature challenge was not spearheaded by a real alternative. Owen Smith was not only unprepared for the fight but offered merely a less doctrinaire version of Corbyn himself, rather than a different vision of Labour\u2019s future. Thus the central argument about the whole direction of the party was never fought out, and the leadership election actually shifted the terms of Labour\u2019s debates further to the Left.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ironically, on one point at least, Hague\u2019s analysis is identical to John McDonnell\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/07/watch-john-mcdonnell-labels-labour-rebels-fing-useless\">McDonnell famously said the Labour plotters had been \u201cfucking useless\u201d.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/labour-remains-stuck-as-the-world-moves-on-5zc6v0wdx\">Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says Labour as a party is out of touch with modern Britain.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that Labour\u2019s biggest problem is not Mr Corbyn himself but the fact that the world has moved on and the party has not. Although its battles are conducted on Twitter and Facebook, it is still an analogue organisation in a digital age. Even its name looks like an anachronism. This is a party of \u201cthe workers\u201d, which grew out of the trade union movement but which has failed spectacularly to understand that the nature of work has changed over the past 30 years.</p> <p>The number of self-employed people is predicted to overtake public sector workers by 2018 as the internet transforms the way business is done. About 16 per cent of people in this country now work for themselves \u2014 up from 8.7 per cent in 1975 \u2014 and it\u2019s a trend that will only accelerate with the rise of automation.</p> <p>The self-employed will be an ever more powerful economic and political force, but Labour has nothing to say to these voters. Its policies on full employment or workers\u2019 rights are irrelevant to them and its statist solutions are likely to be anathema to this instinctively individualistic group. These are not all thrusting entrepreneurs setting out to become millionaires by setting up their own companies. Many are freelancers cobbling together jobs, or people making a part-time living through the sharing economy \u2014 Uber drivers or those renting out a room on Airbnb. To the extent that it thinks about them at all, Labour sees them as victims of corporate exploitation, but many like the flexibility and control they get from being their own boss. They do not think of themselves as \u201cthe workers\u201d; in fact work is not their defining identity at all.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-1d3c-The-Tories-grammar-school-policy-would-take-us-back-to-the-1950s#.V-pPBSMrJZ0\">Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary who left school without any good GCSEs, tells the Morning Star in an interview she has encountered a \u201csneer of arrogance\u201d from Tories.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Rayner\u2019s] combative Commons displays on the subject have seen her become a front-bench favourite of Labour members.</p> <p>And the passion she exudes for education and the party will ensure a packed hall for her speech today.</p> <p>It will be a very different reception to the \u201csneer of arrogance\u201d she has encountered from the Tory benches since taking the role. \u201cI think some of them think: \u2018What does she know, she wasn\u2019t educated, she says it herself.</p> <p>\u201cBut actually I\u2019ve got a masters in real life and I know from the evidence this is bad for our kids.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea42b8e4b0f707b26af49b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T10:06:06.825Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the debate on the NEC rule changes <strong>Mike Katz,</strong> from the Jewish Labour Movement, complained that the party was not doing more to tackle antisemitism.

Jeremy [Corbyn] has said it, Tom [Watson] has said it, we have all said it; there is no place for this in our party. We must root it out. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, is there any wonder that support for Labour amongst British Jews is said to be as low as 7%. It makes me weep; the party of Manny Shinwell, the party that has done more than any other to promote tolerance and inequality, the party to which the Jewish Labour Movement has been affiliated since 1920, is not seen as a welcoming home for Jews. </p> </blockquote> <p>Katz said that Corbyn had acted to address antisemitism, but he said that measures to specifically tackle antisemitism should have been included in the rule changes being voted on today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3b41e4b08ee6d0d2f3d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:52:53.661Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The 15 national executive rule changes - Details</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The national executive committee\u2019s rule changes are controversial because they include plans to let the Labour leaders in Scotland and Wales nominate one person each to sit on the NEC. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish leader, and Carwyn Jones, the Welsh leader, are both seen as opponents of Jeremy Corbyn, and Corbynites fear this rule change will result in the anti-Corbyn faction on the NEC getting too extra votes. Currently Corbyn has a small majority on the NEC on some issues, but it is finally balanced. The Corbynites wanted the new Scottish and Welsh NEC representatives to be chosen by party members, which would probably have led to Corbyn supporters being elected.</p> <p>But some of the other changes are quite significant. Here is a full list of what they are.</p> <p>1 - Clarification that a sitting leader does not need to be nominated by 20% of MPs and MEPs to stand in a leadership election if challenged. This change is being introduced because the current rules are ambiguous. Labour\u2019s NEC decided that Corbyn could stand in the leadership contest without getting fresh nominations, but because the rules were not 100% clear, a Labour member took the party to court in an unsuccessful attempt to get that decision overturned.</p> <p>2 - Clarification of for how long someone needs to have paid affiliation fees to attend a CLP AGM (60 days).</p> <p>3 - Tightening of rules allowing the party to exclude people convicted of serious offences from joining, to include people subject to rulings from civil courts relating to their behaviour. This is intended to ensure Labour can exclude people who might be a threat to children but who have not been convicted of a criminal offence.</p> <p>4 - Giving the national women\u2019s conference a formal role in policy making.</p> <p>5 - Toughening up penalties for Labour groups that do not follow gender balance rules.</p> <p>6 - Banning Labour councillors from voting for an illegal budget.</p> <p>7 - Obliging Labour mayors and police and crime commissioners to report to Labour organisations and conferences.</p> <p>8 - Changing the way Labour councillors pay a levy to the party.</p> <p>9 - Adding two members to the NEC, a frontbench member of the Scottish parliament nominated by the Scottish leader and a frontbench member of the Welsh assembly nominated by the Welsh leader.</p> <p>10 - Allowing the Scottish and Welsh leaders to attend the Clause 5 meetings that determine the party\u2019s election manifesto.</p> <p>11- Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of deciding their own Westminster candidates.</p> <p>12 - Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of setting rules for the selection of candidates for the devolved bodies.</p> <p>13 - Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of setting rules for the selection of council candidates in Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>14 - Formalising the posts of Scottish deputy leader and Welsh deputy leader.</p> <p>15 - Formalising the new rule changes affecting Scotland and Wales.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3af8e4b0a785ec48be49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:26:16.660Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the Labour conference <strong>Andy Kerr</strong>, a member of the national executive committee, is now opening the main debate on the proposed national executive committee rule changes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3609e4b08ee6d0d2f3b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:08:50.120Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paddy Lillis</strong>, the NEC chair who is chairing this morning\u2019s session, called a vote on a show of hands on whether to agree a \u201creference back\u201d so that delegates could vote on all 15 proposed rule changes separately. There were loud protests when he did not agree a card vote, but Lillis said there was a clear majority against a reference back. <strong>Manuel Cortes</strong>, the TSSA general secretary who proposed a reference back, then came to the stage to protest, saying party rules said there should be a card vote. Lillis over-ruled him, saying it was clear from the show of hands who won.</p> <p>Now that\u2019s over it is seems certain that the proposed rule changes will be agreed quite comfortably.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3157e4b08ee6d0d2f3ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:47:54.506Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour conference has opened, and there will be a debate on the proposed changes to party rules (including giving Scotland and Wales a seat on the national executive committee). But, being the Labour party, at first they are having a debate about who to hold the vote. Labour HQ wants a single \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 vote on all 15 proposed rule changes. But some delegates are now arguing for individual votes on each measure.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea2cdee4b0a785ec48be11\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:42:50.062Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour conference backs call for possible referendum on final Brexit deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There were not many policy issues that divided Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith during the leadership contest but one was Europe. Corbyn said the party should accept the Brexit vote, and focus on getting the best possible deal. Smith said that any final deal should be put to the public, in a second referendum or a general election, and that he would like the UK to stay in the EU.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Labour party conference has backed the Owen Smith position. There has not been a formal debate on Brexit at the conference, but yesterday\u2019s economy debate included various composite motions on employment rights, including one proposed by the TSSA union. It was passed unanimously, and no one paid much attention to the detail, but it included a line saying the UK should retain the option of staying in the EU.</p> <p>Here is the key passage.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Conference] recognises that many of those who voted to leave the EU were expressing dissatisfaction with EU or national policy and were voting for change, but believes that unless the final settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained. The final settlement should therefore be subject to approval, through parliament and potentially through a general election, or a referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>In practice, the significance of this is limited. According to party officials, the fact that the composite was passed does not mean that demanding a possible second referendum is now official party policy. Instead the motion will feed into the national policy forum policy-making process. And in practice Corbyn\u2019s election victory means he has a mandate for his \u2018it\u2019s settled\u2019 position.</p> <p>But the fact that conference has passed this motion will embolden those Labour MPs, like Smith, who are demanding a second referendum. And if the Commons ever ends up voting on amendments to Brexit legislation demanding a second referendum, as seems inevitable, Labour MPs will be able to use composite 1 as justification for backing those amendments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:00:22.322Z\">at 10.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea1520e4b0a785ec48bdb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:05:22.315Z\">9.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour does not feature much on the newspaper front pages this morning although, given<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\"> </a>the splash headline on one of the few papers that does lead on Labour, Jeremy Corbyn may consider that a blessing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tuesday&#39;s Daily Mail front page:<br>Labour in la-la-land<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hjgkCbCMOs\">pic.twitter.com/hjgkCbCMOs</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\">September 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re interested, you can read how the Mail explains its headline<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\"> here.</a></p> <p>Our coverage is rather different.

Instead Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, gets to take the Tuesday afternoon slot.</p> <p>Here is a round-up of the overnight Labour conference stories.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, will say that the party must develop policies to stop automation harming workers.</strong> Announcing the launch of an independent commission into the future of work, Watson will highlight research saying that more than a third of workers think their job security will be harmed by automation, while a fifth think it will hit their wages. He will tell the conference:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New automated technologies are fusing with the internet, and creating models of work and jobs we haven\u2019t seen before. Daily we hear stories of machines and systems that can do things we thought only humans could do - driving cars, drafting contracts, even composing music. </p> <p>It\u2019s been called the fourth industrial revolution - a new era of fast, technology-driven change, which we\u2019re beginning to feel in everything we do. </p> <p>And it\u2019s uncertain because it isn\u2019t yet fulfilling its potential to change working lives for the good - we aren\u2019t seeing it. Too many people whose grandparents were trade unionists with secure jobs are now working 60-hour weeks, below the minimum wage, without any support from a union. The dark side of the gig economy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, will tell the conference in her speech later that Labour will rescue the NHS.</strong> She will unveil various proposals, including: focusing more on public health and preventative health care; prioritising mental health services; and ending \u201cdamaging\u201d competition and marketisation in the NHS, \u201cremoving the private sector where it is ripping-off the NHS\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will tell the conference in his speech that the party must focus on winning power</strong>. Saying that the leadership issue is now settled (Khan backed Owen Smith, not Corbyn), he will say:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s only with Labour in power that we can create a fairer, more equal and more just Britain.</p> <p>Labour out of power will never, ever be good enough ... The people who need us the most are those who suffer the most when Labour is not in power.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, will say every parent should have the right to quality, afforable childcare <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37475733\">in her speech to the conferrence. </a></strong>She will announce a review of childcare provision and early-years education. She will say:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our aim will be to provide the care and support for every child to fulfil their potential, and to help parents back to work. Getting it right will improve the life chances of countless children across the country. That must be our mission.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Newsnight last night that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident\">despite Clive Lewis\u2019s speech yesterday signalling that Corbyn will not try to overturn Labour\u2019s pro-Trident policy,</a> the policy could still be changed.</strong> McDonnell said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Lewis\u2019s] view is that the matter has been decided for the time being. But it is always open for our party members to raise these issues. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn is being urged by allies to sack McDonnell,<a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/allies-urge-corbyn-to-get-rid-of-mcdonnell-20scgm8df\"> the Times (paywall) reports.</a></strong> But it says Corbyn is refusing to countenance the idea. Here\u2019s an extract from its story.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Moderate Labour MPs claim that the language used by Mr McDonnell acts as a \u201cnod and a wink\u201d to leftwingers to target them with abuse online.</p> <p>Some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s closest allies have told the leader that removing his old friend from his post would be the \u201csingle best thing\u201d he could do to repair relations in the party ...</p> <p>A senior source said: \u201cWe had the chance to reach out right at the start, but that fell apart when [Mr Corbyn] appointed McDonnell. He\u2019s been told directly to get rid of him but he can\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be the single best thing he could do to bring the party back together. It would immediately remove the major block stopping MPs from coming back.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Conference opens. Paddy Lillis, chair of the national executive committee, will introduce Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy plan, Diana Holland, the national treasurer, produces her report and then there is a debate on party rule changes, including those giving Scotland and Wales a seat each on the NEC.</p> <p><em>10.45am: </em>Debate on housing.</p> <p><em>11.15am: </em>Debate on social care.</p> <p><em>12.05pm: </em>Speech from Paul Flynn, shadow leader of the Commons.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, speaks.</p> <p><em>2.15pm</em>: Debate on children and education, with a speech from Angela Rayner, teh shadow education secretary.</p> <p><em>3pm:</em> Debate on energy.</p> <p><em>3.30pm:</em> Marvyn Rees, the mayor of Bristol, speaks.</p> <p><em>3.40pm:</em> Tom Watson, the deputy leader, speaks.</p> <p>If you want to follow or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<p>Among late-night TV hosts, the consensus on who won Monday night\u2019s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is resoundingly clear: Clinton dominated the evening, with Trump emerging as the blustering loser. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">Trump loses cool while Clinton stays calm during first presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Daily Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert all opted to air live following the first of three presidential debates, to offer comedic and pointed roundups of the chaotic clash.</p> <p>Trevor Noah\u2019s Daily Show was the first up, with the host opening by taking a swipe at moderator Lester Holt, who New Yorker humorist Andy Borowitz mocked in a piece titled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cnn-launches-manhunt-after-lester-holt-vanishes-from-debate\">CNN Launches Manhunt after Lester Holt Vanishes from Debate</a>\u201d. After playing a montage of the debate\u2019s most heated exchanges, Noah said: \u201cAt that point, Lester Holt wasn\u2019t even moderating anymore, he was just eating popcorn like everyone else.\u201d <br></p> <p>Noah, however, saved most of his attacks for Trump, who still refused to release his tax returns, and instead boasted about his income while suggesting he was \u201csmart\u201d for not paying income tax.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUbzT25kZ6s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUbzT25kZ6s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thedailyshow/videos/10154561137256800/\">Watch the video on Facebook here</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Noah said appearing perplexed. \u201cDude, taxes are a responsibility, not something to evade.

No one likes him.\u201d</p> <p>Noah admitted that when the debate started, he didn\u2019t think Trump was doing \u201ca bad job\u201d. \u201cHe was throwing the right punches, saying the right things,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBut then the debate moved to foreign policy, and honestly, I was personally offended.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s bizarre comparison of American airports to those in developing-world countries was what eventually set Noah off. \u201cOur airports are nicer than yours, Donald Trump,\u201d the South African host said. \u201cDon\u2019t bring third-world countries into this shit, you hear me? Don\u2019t involve us in your problems.\u201d </p> <p>Noah also made a point to call out Trump\u2019s endless listing of his properties during the debate, quipping: \u201cDonald Trump relates to America like he\u2019s playing a game of Monopoly.\u201d</p> <p>As for Trump\u2019s case of the sniffles, Noah suggested the Republican nominee was just \u201csniffing away all of the bullshit he was saying\u201d.</p> <p>Colbert also weighed in on Snifflegate, joking during his segment that Trump \u201csounded like the coked-up best man in the bathroom at a wedding\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/sep/28/stephen-colbert-roasts-donald-trumps-lies-after-presidential-debate-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55xjc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756874\"            data-video-name=\"Stephen Colbert roasts Donald Trump's 'lies' after presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert / CBS\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57eb1aeae4b091b7fa2b5cd8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928lateshowtrumpdebate_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928lateshowtrumpdebate.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928lateshowtrumpdebate_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/sep/28/stephen-colbert-roasts-donald-trumps-lies-after-presidential-debate-video\">Stephen Colbert roasts Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018lies\u2019 after presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Colbert kicked off his show by calling out the double standards presented by the debate. Clinton, he said, had to appear \u201cconfident but not smug, knowledgeable without being a know-it-all, charming without being affected, commanding but not shrill, also likable, authoritative, warm and not coughing. Meanwhile, Donald Trump had to not commit murder \u2013 on camera.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Colbert deemed Clinton the better prepared of the two, dubbing her with the nickname Preparation H. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment!\u201d Colbert claimed after some heckles from the audience. \u201cIn the primaries, she already proved she could soothe the Bern.\u201d</p> <p>He also drolly pointed out the debate\u2019s first lie, showing a clip of Clinton greeting Trump graciously on stage with a \u201cDonald, it\u2019s good to be with you\u201d.</p> <p>Lastly there was Meyers, who began by sending up the intense lead-up to the debate. \u201cThe media hyped it like a prize fight,\u201d said Meyers. After showing a spot that teased the debate as if it were the Super Bowl of politics, he quipped: \u201cBased on that intro, you\u2019d think the debate was taking place inside the UFC Octagon.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8syBrqA1r8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o8syBrqA1r8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like Colbert, Meyers concluded that Trump appeared woefully underprepared compared to Clinton. Still, he expressed sympathy for the billionaire businessman.</p> <p>\u201cHis head doesn\u2019t have room for facts and figures because it has to hold seven words,\u201d he joked. Those words, shown in a dissection of Trump\u2019s brain, read: Best, Huge, Ivanka, Big, Wall, Great and Tremendous. </p>",

And it could recover further, reckon Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s David Rees writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Mexican peso appreciated by more than 2% against the US dollar shortly after the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, appeared to prevail in the first US presidential debate on Monday.</p> <p>The fortunes of the peso in recent months have been closely tied with the likelihood that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will triumph in the upcoming presidential election. That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u2019s open and US-dependent economy.</p> <p>In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u2013 and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u2013 to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile.</p> <p>But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8c6be4b04cbd30bc3a55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:12:59.937Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And maybe there isn\u2019t an oil deal after all:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HermsTheWord/status/780783664393314304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iran&#39;s Zanganeh emerges from meeting with Russia&#39;s Novak.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%.</p> <p>The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The service sector sent mixed signals in September, with faster growth of activity during the month offset by gloomy forward-looking indicators. Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062/0_0_736_558/500.jpg\" alt=\"US service sector\" width=\"500\" height=\"379\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US service sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IHS Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:03:57.641Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea79f8e4b091b7fa2b5a06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:58:06.056Z\">2.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data.</strong></p> <p>Markit\u2019s initial purchasing managers\u2019 index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and August\u2019s final reading of 51.</p> <p>The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics\">@MarkitEconomics</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hash\">#US</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash\">#GDP</a> only grew around 1% q/q AR in Q3 supporting our view that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> will not hike this year <a href=\"https://t.co/zCRXavmbDT\">pic.twitter.com/zCRXavmbDT</a></p>&mdash; Danske Bank Research (@Danske_Research) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea77e1e4b091b7fa2b59fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:53:53.529Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now.</p> <p>We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u2019t switch off coupons, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). </p> </blockquote> <p>ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015....</p> <p> Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders.</p> <p> The delayed sale of DB\u2019s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u20ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed...</p> <p>The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u20ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. </p> <p>AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u20ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit.</p> <p>The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario. It is both in the interest, of the bank to continue to function, and of the authorities to receive payment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea71cde4b04cbd30bc39b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:37:43.641Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on Deutsche Bank and the repercussions if there was to be state aid from Germany, with some saying the country\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble will be the key player:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Halsrethink/status/780743545493880832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Schauble,not Merkel will decide: Save DB opens gates for Italy,Portugal,Spain,other banks on brink.Bail in starts EZ-wide bank runs? <a href=\"https://t.co/wXfn1HjR3J\">https://t.co/wXfn1HjR3J</a></p>&mdash; Harald Malmgren (@Halsrethink) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Halsrethink/status/780743545493880832\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile Thomas Oppermann of the Social Democratic Party has weighed in:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780760066131628032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DEUTSCHE BANK MUST SOLVE ITS OWN PROBLEMS, SPD&#39;S OPPERMANN SAYS</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780760066131628032\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As has Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780759710601453568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"nl\" dir=\"ltr\">*DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS DEUTSCHE BANK NEEDS STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780759710601453568\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780761934685700097\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">*DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS DEUTSCHE BANK MEETS CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMNTS</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780761934685700097\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:38:52.982Z\">at 2.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea7419e4b08ca277ca0b89\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:36:29.972Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clinton rally in US markets has fizzled out before it even began.</p> <p>Banks - in the wake of Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price fall - and Brexit continue to weigh on investors\u2019 minds, while a fall in the oil price is also undermining confidence.

His doctors are worried about his health.\u201d<br></p> <p>Peres\u2019s son-in-law and deputy director-general of the hospital treating him, Rafi Walden, added that \u201chis condition is extremely serious\u201d.</p> <p>Peres was rushed to hospital near Tel Aviv on 13 September after he reported feeling ill. Following tests he was diagnosed to have suffered a stroke and was placed in a medically induced coma.</p> <p>His defining achievement was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize with Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The last surviving political figure associated with the founding of modern Israel, Peres\u2019s life story tracked many of the most important moments in the country\u2019s short history, and saw him move from being a hawk to a key peacemaker \u2013 a legacy that in recent years has substantially unravelled, to his dismay.</p> <p>For a long time Peres was deeply divisive in Israeli politics, but he went on to become one of the country\u2019s most popular public figures, serving a seven-year term as the president, which he completed two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIn his people\u2019s eyes he ceased to be a politician. He became an historic figure, larger than politics, larger than everyday affairs, a figure in a league of his own,\u201d wrote Nahum Barnea, a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, shortly after Peres was taken ill in one among many retrospectives of his long career.</p>",
  "<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Round one: Achieving Prosperity</h2> <p><strong><em>Clinton</em></strong><br></p> <p>Hillary Clinton focused early on policy, laying out an economic agenda that called for reducing income inequality by raising the minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap and eliminating corporate tax loopholes. But she did not miss the opportunity to go after Donald Trump for being the first major-party nominee in more than 40 years to refuse to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The Republican candidate managed to put his Democratic rival on the defensive on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, forcing her to explain why she came out against the landmark 12-nation trade agreement last year after previously supporting it. But Clinton was able to overcome the question in part because Trump repeatedly shouted over her attempts to answer it \u2013 placing the focus instead on his aggressive posture. <strong>SS</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Trump</em></strong></p> <p>Donald Trump was strongest early in the debate, when he hit familiar talking points on trade and put Clinton on the back foot, having to defend her flip-flop on TPP and the controversial legacy of Nafta, the free trade agreement signed by her husband that many in the industrial midwest feel has cost manufacturing jobs. An off-key rehearsed line from a stilted Clinton about \u201cTrumped-up trickle down economics\u201d represented a brief window into what the debate might have been like if Trump had been able to act like a normal candidate for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">more than 10 minutes</a>.</p> <p>But the Republican nominee took Clinton\u2019s bait and played defense on personal attacks almost immediately. After Clinton said: \u201cHe started his business with $14m, borrowed from his father,\u201d Trump immediately responded, rather than turn the focus back on to trade, perhaps his strongest issue. <strong>BJ</strong></p> <h2>Round two: America\u2019s Direction</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-video-debate-birther-obama\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54pf4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754571\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump defends 'birther' stance: 'I think I did a good job' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9e357e4b0a785ec48bd23\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-video-debate-birther-obama\">Donald Trump defends \u2018birther\u2019 stance: \u2018I think I did a good job\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong><em>Clinton</em></strong></p> <p>Arguably Clinton\u2019s strongest segment of the debate was when the discussion turned to race in America.

But beyond that policy, she put forth a unifying message that asked Americans to acknowledge the systemic barriers against minorities.</p> <p>Wisely, when the topic shifted to birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the US \u2013 Clinton did not engage in a debate on the subject.

Eventually, the Republican nominee boasted: \u201cI think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\u201d <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BJ</strong></p> <h2>Round three: Securing America<br></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-stamina-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54ph9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754630\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton hits back after Trump attacks her 'stamina' at debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9eb53e4b08ee6d0d2f2d6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926stamina2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926stamina2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926stamina2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-stamina-video\">Clinton hits back after Trump attacks her \u2018stamina\u2019 at debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em><strong>Clinton</strong></em></p> <p>Eager to draw a contrast on national security, an issue high on Americans\u2019 priorities amid recent terrorist attacks, Clinton relied on familiar characterizations of Trump: he was unfit to be president, unqualified and lacking the right temperament, and he should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> <p>For the benefit of voters tuning in to the race for the first time, Clinton enthusiastically highlighted Trump\u2019s admiration for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin \u2013 regarded by most members of Trump\u2019s Republican party as a dictator and a thug.

Though dwarfed by an estimated television audience of up to 100 million people, they included well-known political figures including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio as well as celebrities such as billionaire Mark Cuban and controversial boxing promoter Don King. </p> <p>At first Trump appeared to be trying to rein in his more aggressive tendency. \u201cIs that OK?

The older Trump, a successful real estate developer, helped to fund his son\u2019s effort to remodel the Grand Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan and also aided his son with his political connections. Trump immediately fired back, insisting that \u201cit was only a small loan\u201d from his father, taking the bait offered by his Democratic rival.</p> <p>Trump then knocked Clinton for previously supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the landmark 12-nation trade pact brokered under the Obama administration.

Clinton fired back and proceeded to lay out all the hypothetical reasons that Trump, who has claimed he is under a tax inspector\u2019s audit, was not releasing his tax returns. Clinton said perhaps Trump was \u201cnot as rich as he says he is, not as charitable as he says he is\u201d and even suggested that Trump hadn\u2019t paid any income tax for several years. The Republican nominee responded \u201cthat makes me smart\u201d and Clinton continued to admonish him by suggesting: \u201cI think he is probably not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of the country see because it must be something really important, even terrible that he is trying to hide.\u201d </p> <p>Afterwards, Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, avoided repeated questions from reporters about whether the Republican nominee has paid federal income taxes. Miller insisted \u201cof course he pays taxes\u201d and that \u201che has paid taxes at every level\u201d but repeatedly declined to state whether Trump had paid federal income tax every year in the past 20 years.

He would be surprised, he said, if 40 of them actually voted in November. Because nobody at any age votes much in Nevada, which is usually in the bottom 10 states for voter turnout.</p> <p>\u201cNevada has been one of the fastest-growing states,\u201d Lokken said en route to class one recent Thursday. \u201cNo one is from here. Voter registration disappears in those moves. It\u2019s not a priority. There are new politicians, new players.

Nevada, he said, was \u201cin the cynical part of the country where people don\u2019t trust government\u201d. More than a third of residents between 18 and 24 are Hispanic, \u201ca population that may be either undocumented or unengaged\u201d. And high school graduation rates are among the lowest in the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe ones who don\u2019t graduate,\u201d Lokken said, \u201care even less likely to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/millennial-voter-share/\" data-alt=\"Younger voters have been gaining on previous generations\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/millennial-voter-share/\">Younger voters have been gaining on previous generations</a> </figure>  <p>Nevada has among the highest percentages nationwide of Hispanics registered to vote: 24% of the electorate is of Hispanic origin, according to the US census bureau. There is little hard data here on whether Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance has caused an uptick in Hispanic registration. But a <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2016/09/21/latino-voters-are-more-partisan-and-energized-in-2016-than-in-2012/\">recent survey</a> by Latino Decisions shows that young Hispanics in Nevada are deeply interested in casting a ballot in 2016. A total of 87% of Hispanics younger than 39 who were polled said they would most likely vote, with immigration reform their top issue.</p> <p>It is 12.30pm, and students in Lokken\u2019s second class of the day is milling in the hallway of the Red Mountain building, waiting for their professor to unlock room 412. Two weeks earlier, Hillary Clinton was in the same building, rebuking Trump for \u201ctaking hate groups mainstream\u201d.<br></p> <p>Her appearance on campus was a testament to the importance of Washoe County \u2013 the \u201cswingiest\u201d county in a critical swing state. What that means is the number of registered Democrats and Republicans is relatively equal, and, come election day, anything could happen.</p> <p>For 30-some students ranging in age from 17 to 33, Lokken\u2019s class was angry and cynical. The nine students who said they would not cast ballots will stay away from the voting booth because the choice of candidates is just so awful. Those who say they will vote agreed with the assessment.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, you\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s lying,\u201d mourned Ilana Barry, 18, who will not vote. \u201cOn the other is someone who\u2019s probably going to destroy the country.

The other polling questions seemed to confirm a clear victory:</p> <p><strong><em>Who seemed to be the stronger leader?</em> <br></strong>Clinton 56% <br>Trump 39%</p> <p><em><strong>Who was more sincere and authentic?</strong></em> (Note: this has been a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/21/hillary-clintons-inauthentic-self/?utm_term=.cd45f8aba61c\">problem</a> for Clinton in the past.)<br>Clinton 53% <br>Trump 40% </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-reaction-live\">Donald Trump blames debate 'sniffles' on bad microphone \u2013\u00a0campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><strong>Overall, did the debate make you more likely to vote for a candidate?</strong></em><br>Clinton 34% <br>Trump 18%</p> <p>It all sounds like bad news for Republicans right?

Of the people CNN/ORC spoke to, 41% identified themselves as Democrats and 26% identified as Republican (the rest said they were Independents). So you would have expected Clinton to do better, regardless of how she performed during the debate. </p> <p>If you\u2019re feeling particularly skeptical, you should pay attention to \u201cthe margin of error\u201d on a poll. On this one, it was +/- 4.5 percentage points which means that Clinton\u2019s lead could be much larger (take that last question above \u2013 the true national number could be as high as 38.5% choosing Clinton) or it could be much smaller (maybe only 29.5% did).

You don\u2019t know who broke into DNC.\u201d</p> <p>While I do want to congratulate Trump on one of his few successful deployments of the English language last night \u2013 buddy put words in an order that conveyed a vaguely decipherable meaning, much like Franklin Delano Roosevelt! \u2013 the phrase \u201csomebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds\u201d raises a vital question.</p> <p>Fat people, are we going to stand for this shit?</p> <p>We already knew that Trump hates fat women. He hates Rosie O\u2019Donnell so much for being fat and gay (\u201cRosie is just disgusting,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d32577Hom08\">said in 2006</a>. \u201cShe\u2019s fat, she\u2019s a loser, she\u2019s a farm animal pig, she\u2019s a beast, OK\u201d) that he shoehorned his irrelevant, decade-old grudge into the most precious and tightly regimented 90 minutes of his political career thus far. As the Clinton campaign masterfully publicised last night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">the former Miss Universe Alicia Machado has claimed Trump drove her to an eating disorder</a> by calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and publicly threatening her crown if she didn\u2019t lose weight. Trump epitomises the type of man who sees no value in women other than their smallness, compliance, conventional attractiveness and sexual availability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">Hillary Clinton stays calm while Trump loses cool during first presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But by pointing a wee alabaster doll finger at fat nerds for the DNC hack, Trump didn\u2019t just express the standard disgust for fat bodies, he positioned fat people as dangers to national security. The implications are familiar, even if the context is outlandish: fat people are lazy, bedridden, unscrupulous, untrustworthy, antisocial, gluttonous (for secrets!) and worthless as anything but a punchline. Trump could have said, simply, \u201ca person sitting on their bed\u201d, but he chose to specify the fictional hacker\u2019s fictional weight, because it evokes destructive stereotypes about fat people and antique ones about nerds. Because it milks harsh, cheap laughs out of the bullies who make up Trump\u2019s base. Because Americans do not like or trust fat people \u2013 nor, really, consider them fully human \u2013 and neither does Trump.</p> <p>That\u2019s the same dislike and distrust that makes fat people <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/11522021/Nearly-half-of-employers-unlikely-to-hire-overweight-workers.html\">less likely to be hired for jobs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16755130/ns/business-careers/t/fat-chance-its-not-easy-obese-workers/#.V-onz5MrL-Z\">take home equal pay</a> or <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2009/10/glutton_intolerance.html\">receive adequate medical care</a> under their insurance. It\u2019s that dislike and distrust that make it socially acceptable (a public service, even!) to harass and verbally abuse fat people. It\u2019s the reason why most clothing labels refuse to make garments in larger sizes \u2013 because we fat people are so worthless that they do not even want our money.</p> <p>\u201cFour hundred pounds\u201d (181kg; 28st 8lb) is not a punchline; it is not an absurd, shameful, astronomical number; it accurately describes a body that many, many Americans are living in right now \u2013 Americans with fulfilling jobs and vibrant families, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\">pay their taxes</a> (it\u2019s this thing regular people do every year \u2013 ask your gardener) and treat the people around them with humanity and respect. Americans who vote.</p> <p>Now, my dear fellow fat people. I know that you have been taught not to think of yourselves as a group, because the diet industry makes billions of dollars from the notion that each of you is just an individual who has temporarily failed to be thin. But, believe me, the rest of the country \u2013 employers, jurors, neighbours, voters \u2013 thinks of you collectively and treats you accordingly.

  "<h2>Clinton, Holt put Trump on defensive</h2> <p>Goaded by Clinton and pressed by moderator Lester Holt, Donald Trump angrily defended his record against charges of racism, sexism and tax avoidance for much of the first presidential debate. The Republican candidate blamed the nation\u2019s chronic problems on Clinton, while also appearing thin-skinned and under-prepared as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">sniffled</a> his way through the debate. Clinton said her opponent \u201clived in his own reality\u201d. After a particularly one-sided exchange, Trump retorted, \u201cIt\u2019s all words, it\u2019s all soundbites,\u201d adding that Clinton was a \u201ctypical politician: all talk, no action\u201d. In her closing remarks, Clinton also noted that he had called women pigs and slobs and, in one case, called a beauty pageant contestant Miss Housekeeping \u201cbecause she was Latina\u201d. Trump, later told a TV interviewer that he had shown heroic self-restraint in not mentioning Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities out of respect for their daughter Chelsea.

  "<p>By traditional standards, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\" title=\"\">first televised US presidential debate</a> on Monday night produced a clear result. Hillary Clinton\u2019s experience, grasp and temperament proved superior qualities to Donald Trump\u2019s forcefulness, rambling and egotism. Fears that Mrs Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia\" title=\"\">recent bout of pneumonia</a> would cause her to stumble proved unfounded. Instead, Mr Trump\u2019s sniffing caused more comment on the night. But the question, in this most unpredictable of elections and in a new media world, is how far traditional standards <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">matter</a> any more.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton repeatedly put Mr Trump under pressure on his finances, his taxes, his climate change denial, Iraq, Russia, Barack Obama\u2019s birth, and race. Mr Trump countered with powerful lines about unfair trade deals and immigration and was both personal and boastful. Mrs Clinton stayed careful but grew more relaxed as the 90 minutes evolved. Mr Trump got angry and repeatedly rose to the bait. To adopt the dismal boxing terminology that tends to be wheeled out on such occasions, neither candidate landed the fabled knockout blow. There were plenty of low punches. But Mrs Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\" title=\"\">obviously won</a> on points.</p> <p>Yet traditional responses to the debate may not suffice. Politics is in flux in many democracies, America included. And both these candidates are already very well known. Neither has to introduce themselves to the voters. Most people have an opinion about both of them. Each is also already a very divisive figure, both to the other side and, to an unusual extent in this race, on their own side too.</p> <p>The very fact of seeing two such dissimilar figures together in the presidential debate studio was a reminder of how 2016 is different. On the one hand, Mr Trump, a candidate whose self-confidence has swept him to the Republican nomination on a wave of predominantly white anger without any experience of government whatever. On the other Mrs Clinton, whose conventional qualifications for the top job are beyond question, but whose political instincts seem to date from a different era. The fact that here was the first woman to be taking part in a presidential debate almost passed without notice \u2013 though Mr Trump could not resist some nasty innuendos.</p> <p>The televised debates are always built up as great moments of national attention and decision. Sometimes they are. The reality is that while debates may inform opinion, there\u2019s a question as to whether they shift it dramatically. As the Guardian\u2019s Alastair Cooke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama\" title=\"\">wrote</a> of the first Nixon-Kennedy debate in 1960, the Republicans to whom he spoke afterwards thought Nixon had won, while the Democrats believed Kennedy was the victor.</p> <p>There is still a lot of sense in that more circumspect approach today. Most voters already have a preference going into the debate. They look to the exchanges to confirm them in their judgment. Relatively few voters actually tune in with an innocent mind. Last night was no exception to that. Those who are appalled by Mr Trump will have seen and heard a Clinton victory. Those who cannot abide Mrs Clinton will have seen and heard Mr Trump tell truth to power.</p> <p>The 2016 race may be an exception in other ways. The polls have narrowed in September, both nationally and in the battleground states that will determine the result in November. The debates may therefore make a difference this time. That was a subtext in Monday\u2019s exchanges. Mr Trump name-checked Michigan and Ohio, states he must win, twice in the first 30 minutes. Mrs Clinton aimed a lot of her remarks on criminal justice and police at black and Latino voters, and had sections on the banks and social justice that reached out to wavering supporters of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Both candidates made sure to showcase their well-tested strong messages: Mr Trump to make America great again, Mrs Clinton to question her opponent\u2019s fitness to have his finger on the nuclear trigger. Mrs Clinton certainly missed a lot of opportunities to hit back instantly at Mr Trump\u2019s untruths that a better debater would have seized on. Yet Mr Trump said many things that may come back to haunt him on social media and in campaign ads in the days to come. Mrs Clinton, by contrast, made few gaffes.</p> <p>Some will say neither candidate is worthy. In the end, though, one of them will be president of the United States in January. Mr Trump came into this week\u2019s debate with an opportunity to show that there is more to his candidacy than the recklessness, rudeness, falsehood and appeal to racism that has marked it over the last months. On Monday he blew his opportunity. On the biggest stage of his career he showed he is unfit to rule, that he is a danger to America and to the rest of the world. But will enough voters care? If one thing came clear and undeflected out of Monday\u2019s debate it is that Americans cannot afford not to.</p>",

They labeled Trump \u201cscary\u201d, \u201cfake\u201d, an \u201cegomaniac\u201d and a \u201cshape-shifter\u201d. </p> <p>The battleground state voters watched the debate from a room inside the National Constitution Center while Luntz\u2019s team tracked their snap reactions throughout the 90-minute debate. On display behind the voters were large, expressionistic paintings of an American flag, John F Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Trump and Clinton by artist and GOP darling Steve Penley.</p> <p>At the end of the debate, 16 of the 27 participants agreed that Clinton had won while just six believed Trump had won the debate. In near uniformity, the voters said the outcome of the debate was the result of Trump\u2019s failure rather than Clinton\u2019s success.</p> <p>Asked to react to their performances, the voters offered of Trump\u2019s: \u201cstrong start, weak finish\u201d, \u201cbombastic\u201d, \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201cverbose\u201d. When asked to respond to Clinton\u2019s performance, the answers were markedly positive: \u201cfirm\u201d, \u201cpowerful\u201d, \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cinformed\u201d.</p> <p>Trump struggled to defend himself against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\">attacks by Clinton</a> over his denigration of women, insensitivity on race relations and an assertion that he avoided paying federal taxes for years. The freewheeling Republican nominee repeatedly interrupted Clinton and drew sardonic laughs from both the audience in New York and the voters in Pennsylvania, when he claimed to have a \u201cwinning temperament\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe dug his own grave by just talking and talking,\u201d said one woman named Marti G, who described herself as truly undecided.</p> <p>On the monitor tracking the voters\u2019 reactions to the candidates, which was visible to the handful of reporters observing the group, even those leaning toward the Republican nominee disapproved of his windy response when Clinton ticked off possible reasons Trump may not want to disclose his tax returns.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54py9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754738\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9f924e4b0a785ec48bd68\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926taxes2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926taxes2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11903794&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\">Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As the lines on the screen plummeted, Luntz, sporting a pair of American Flag Nike sneakers, bounded over to the small group of reporters. \u201cDonald Trump just got nuked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if he can recover from this debate.\u201d</p> <p>Until that point, Trump appeared to be doing a better job appealing to the firmly undecided voters in the room.

As she spoke, many of the voters in the room agreed with her, especially among those already leaning towards her. </p> <p>After the debate, the voters lamented that too much time was spent discussing birtherism. Overall the voters rated Clinton\u2019s response on issues of race higher than Trump\u2019s, and after the debate several people flatly labeled the Republican nominee a racist.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-video-debate-birther-obama\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54pf4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754571\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump defends 'birther' stance: 'I think I did a good job' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9e357e4b0a785ec48bd23\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-video-debate-birther-obama\">Donald Trump defends \u2018birther\u2019 stance: \u2018I think I did a good job\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cHe\u2019s come to the black community because he wants our vote, not because he truly cares about [me] as a black person,\u201d said Ragni Lee, of Collegeville, Pennsylvania. </p> <p>The group included women and men who were reluctant to support either candidate, including a lifelong conservative voter who would rather sit out than vote for Trump, a millennial who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary but has been persuaded by Clinton and a middle school teacher who says Trump \u201clost\u201d her when he began denigrating Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I looked at my Muslim students and I knew he was talking about them, he lost me,\u201d said Judy McDermott, who remains \u201creally undecided\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\">Hillary Clinton shows strength over Trump in one of history's weirdest, wildest debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet some left the first debate impossibly conflicted and even more pessimistic than when they arrived.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton is not a good candidate and Donald Trump is just a despicable person,\u201d Nicole Gerson, an attorney in Philadelphia, reflected after the debate.

But I didn\u2019t know why.</p> <p>As a young child, my parents would often mention that we were <em>ilegais</em>, but at first I was unable to grasp the impact this word would have on my life. Sometimes people would call my father an \u201cillegal\u201d, using it as a slur towards him. They would use his immigration status to gain an advantage over him, especially when he first started working as a mason. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t see my father for weeks, as he had to work long hours and long distances away from home for a subsistence wage. I worried for him, my mother and for my own future.</p> <p>I always feared of what would become of my life. I worried whether I would ever be allowed to drive, I worried that I might never get a job or have the opportunity to finish high school. Those were all pervasive thoughts in my 13-year-old mind.

And then, as the mood quickly soured: \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.\u201d</p> <p>Trump nearly always called his Democratic rival Secretary Clinton. At the outset he checked: \u201cIs that OK? I want you to be very happy.\u201d But the politeness very quickly faded as he interrupted, heckled, rolled his eyes and tried to throw the authority figure off her game with lies. She missed some opportunities to capitalise as she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt.</p> <p>The debate of the century at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, began with Clinton and Trump striding out on a deep blue stage with white stars and a giant seal: the American eagle with an olive branch, a bunch of arrows and the words: \u201cThe union and the constitution forever.\u201d</p> <p>The nation that brought you Batman v Superman and Captain America v Iron Man held its breath for Mrs Know It All v Mr Know Nothing.</p> <p>Clinton said the central question of the election is what kind of country the US wanted to be: \u201cToday is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot.\u201d Trump, the former host of The Apprentice, narrowed his eyes, tightened his mouth and stared at the camera, as if trying to plant in the audience\u2019s mind the familiar phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d</p> <p>But the gloves soon came off.

But she shot back with a line that could sum up the entire election for the celebrity businessman: \u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the night felt like that. As if to prove the point, Trump told Clinton later: \u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting Isis your entire adult life.\u201d</p> <p>Even Clinton hardly knew how to respond to that one. \u201cThat\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 go to the \u2013 please, fact-checkers, get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Later Clinton mused: \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I\u2019m going to be blamed for everything that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d responded Clinton. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d</p> <p>The pair also tangled over Trump\u2019s tax returns.

First, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\u2019s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don\u2019t know all of his business dealings,\u201d she said, adding that he may not have paid any income tax.</p> <p>Trump lobbed in: \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">Trump's sniffles distract viewers at first presidential debate with Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Had the class clown just admitted on live television, before a global audience of tens of millions, that he has not in fact paid income tax?

Trump boasted of his travels to speak to African American voters, telling Clinton: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me, I\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>But Clinton had a zinger up her sleeve: \u201cI think Donald just criticised me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was asked about his crusade to sow doubts over Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace. He flunked the test and this was the turning point in the debate. \u201cI say nothing because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate]. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\u201d</p> <p>On national security and foreign policy, he was all over the place. Resurrecting one of the best lines from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton-convention-speech-analysis\">her convention speech</a>, Clinton said: \u201cA man who could be provoked with a tweet should not have his finger anywhere near the button.\u201d</p> <p>Trump replied: \u201cThat line is getting a little bit old.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton came back: \u201cIt\u2019s a good one, though. Well describes the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in the bottom of the final round, came the knockout punch over sexism and stamina. It was over. Despite the bad blood, the debate of the century ended as it began, with a handshake and Trump twice patting Clinton on the back. Later he told a TV interviewer that he had shown heroic self-restraint in not mentioning Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities out of respect for their daughter Chelsea. So yes, it could have been more childish still.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<h2><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country, they\u2019re going to Mexico they\u2019re going to many other countries \u2026 Hundreds of hundreds of companies are doing this.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump is primarily talking about the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the long-term decline in manufacturing around the US can\u2019t only be attributed to the trade deal. Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best. In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing is down 37% <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\">since its peak in 1979</a>, but this change has a great deal to do with the general shift toward a service-based economy, which the US has had surpluses in in recent years. It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest. In 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost $1m \u2013 about $3.7m today \u2013 and acted as guarantor for the young Trump\u2019s early projects. A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>.

His financial filings suggest he has<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/self-financing-campaign-all-the-way-would-have-been-a-stretch-for-trump-1463341722\"> less than $250m in liquid assets</a>, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Trump has a history of overstating his properties: he has, for instance, told the FEC that a New York golf club is worth $50m but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-briarcliff-manor-golf-course-tax\">argued in court that it is worth only $1.4m</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Trump claimed that his tax plan will be the largest cuts since Ronald Reagan and create jobs, while in his words Clinton\u2019s would create a huge tax hike.</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding trillions to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. He would reduce the business tax rate to 15%, eliminate the estate tax (aka the \u201cdeath tax\u201d), which mostly affects wealthy inheritors, and would reduce revenue from taxes by about $5tn. According to the Foundation, the top 1% of earners would see a 10.2% increase to their incomes.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/01/12/investing-in-america-by-restoring-basic-fairness-to-our-tax-code/\">tax plan</a> does not change tax rates for the middle class, but does increase taxes by 4% on people who have an adjusted income of more than $5m, as well as closing corporate loopholes.

In 2015, Chicago had 2,988 people who were victims of gun violence, according to <a href=\"http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/shootings/\">the Chicago Tribune</a>, and 488 homicides in all. The city has <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-violence-labor-day-tuesday-20160906-story.html\">more than 500 homicides</a> so far this year, per the paper, and more than 2,100 victims of gun violence.

One research paper, unpublished through peer review, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/20/ray-kelly-says-stop-frisk-saves-lives-theres-no-good-evidence-for-that/\">found modest drops</a> in some crimes.

Among more than 5m stops during the Bloomberg administration, police found a gun less than 0.02% of the time, according to the report. NYPD <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/08/new_york_s_stop_and_frisk_policy_is_neither_effective_nor_constitutional.html\">records between 2004 and 2012</a> show similar figures: in 4.4m stops, weapons were seized from 1.0% of black people, 1.1% from Hispanic people and 1.4% of white people.</p> <p>New York\u2019s long-term decline in crime rates began before Giuliani took office in 1994, and<a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/html/how-new-york-became-safe-full-story-13197.html\"> its causes were and are diverse</a>: data-driven policing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/inside-look-system-cut-crime-new-york-75-percent-n557031\">with the Compstat system</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/what-caused-crime-decline\">growth of the police force by 35%</a> over the decade, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">incarceration increases by 24%</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/digest/jan03/w9061.html\">the 39% unemployment decline</a> that matched with national economic growth. Not even the loudest supporters of stop and frisk, including Bloomberg \u2013 whose last term Trump has called \u201ca disaster\u201d \u2013 have argued the tactic alone reduced crime to its current lows.</p> <p>Trump said that the tactic was ruled unconstitutional because of a judge \u201cwho was against policing\u201d, but his personal opinion about the judge does not mean she did not rule it unconstitutional.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cWe have to take the guns away from the people that shouldn\u2019t have them \u2026 These are bad people.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>This argument flies in the face of Trump\u2019s pro-gun rights stance for legal owners; he has repeatedly and falsely insisted that Clinton wants to take away guns from legal owners.</p> <p>Trump claimed that New York\u2019s crime rate is up since the end of stop and frisk. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/nyregion/anxiety-aside-new-york-sees-drop-in-crime.html\">It remains near historic lows</a>.</p> <h2>Trump blames Sidney Blumenthal, a friend of the Clinton\u2019s, and Patti Solis Doyle, a 2008 <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=4269776\">campaign manager</a>, for creating the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the US.</h2> <p>There is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with the false rumors that Barack Obama was not born in the US, nor did Clinton have anything to do with Trump\u2019s five years of questions about birth certificates, which he finally recanted last Friday.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has tried to blame several people who were, if at all, tangentially related to the Clinton campaign. There is no evidence that Solis Doyle had anything to do with the claim either. She told CNN that<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/hillary-clinton-patti-solis-doyle-birther-donald-trump/\"> there was a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded the email</a> and that the volunteer was dismissed, and that she called the Obama campaign to apologize.</p> <p>A former aide named Mark Penn wrote a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/4097983/Penn-Strategy-Memo-3-19-07#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">2007 memo</a> that Obama\u2019s \u201clack of American roots\u201d could \u201chold him back\u201d.

The money was delivered as foreign currency because US law bars any transaction in US dollars and sanctions make bank transactions difficult.</p> <p>The US is not giving any of its own money to Iran as part of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">international nuclear arms deal</a> meant to prevent the construction of weapons. The deal <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general%E2%80%99s-statement-iran\">gradually unfreezes assets</a> that belong to Iran but were frozen under sanctions related to the nation\u2019s nuclear program. Sanctions related to human rights, terrorism and other issues remain in place and still lock Iran out of billions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s guess of how much Iran will benefit by unfrozen assets is far higher than most experts\u2019 estimates, though not inconceivable. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>. Independent economists have calculated that Iran will free up anything <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-frozen-assets-20160120-story.html\">between $30bn to $100bn</a>. Complicating the math are Iran\u2019s debts: it will have to pay off tens of billions to countries <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/world/getting-china-sanction-iran/p24212\">such as China</a>.</p> <p>There is no evidence that the brief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/iran-releases-us-navy-boat-crews-who-entered-territorial-waters-state-tv\">capture in January of 10 American sailors</a> had any effect on the nuclear deal, which had been finalized five months earlier, although the incident rattled fragile relations between Washington and Tehran. A few days after the sailors were released, UN inspectors <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/world/middleeast/iran-sanctions-lifted-nuclear-deal.html\">confirmed that Iran had complied</a> with the deal.</p> <p>What Iran does next remain an open question \u2013 subject to inspection by UN officials \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s argument in favor of the deal hinges on a degree of good faith that Tehran will comply by the terms of the deal.</p> <h2>Trump: \u201cI was just endorsed by ICE.\u201d</h2> <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a government agency and does not endorse political candidates.

Here\u2019s a summary of what happened:</p> <ul> <li>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engaged in an occasionally raw series of clashes on topics from trade policy to the Iran deal to Trump\u2019s taxes.</li> <li>The Republican candidate came out swinging on Nafta and on, he said, his Democratic rival\u2019s failed record of public service. His most aggressive attacks had Clinton appealing to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">fact checkers</a>\u201d instead of offering rebuttals.</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s performance was magisterial. She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior,\u201d on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cwhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>. Trump also had the sniffles.</li> <li>Trump lost altitude quickly after the first half hour, shifting from pointed interruptions to a more incoherent, sloppy pattern of interruption. </li> <li>Trump tried to deny five years of spreading birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the US. Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China, or bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said. Then Trump agreed with her.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/780599581994209280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> after Trump&#39;s comment about her temperament: &quot;Whew!

To study dusting!\u201d says Will.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they teach,\u201d replies Karen.</p> <p>In the show, Karen had supposedly shot at Rosario, but that just became a comment about gun control.</p> <p>\u201cIf Crooked Hillary had her way, I wouldn\u2019t have that gun and I\u2019d have to use my cannon and Rosario would be dead,\u201d said Karen.</p> <p>When Will complains that Trump uses hateful language to talk about people, Karen turns to Grace.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Will\u2019s friend Jack stars as the undecided voter who is considering not bothering to cast a ballot in November.</p> <p>\u201cBut does my vote even matter? How can one unemployed white fella registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Grace attempts to appeal as Clinton being the first female president. But Jack isn\u2019t convinced, saying he hasn\u2019t heard \u201cthe one thing that will convince me to vote for one candidate over the other\u201d.</p> <p>But Will knows exactly what to stay to win over the urban gay Jack. \u201cKaty Perry likes Hillary,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the end of the \u201cepisode\u201d, the words #votehoney appears.

Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.

Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best.

It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest.

Don\u2019t take my word for it (you probably wouldn\u2019t if I was reading this aloud) - this is based on a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051216\">study</a> into human voice pitch research conducted in 2012. The methodology couldn\u2019t be more relevant to this debate.</p> <p>In the study, 10 women and 10 men were recorded saying the phrase \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November\u201d - a sentence that\u2019s about elections and yet is politically neutral. The researchers then manipulated the sounds of the recordings to be lower or higher and played them to a bunch of men and women who were asked which hypothetical candidate they\u2019d vote for. They found that male and female leaders with lower-pitched voices (ie those that are more stereotypically masculine) were preferred by both men and women.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the authors interpreted the results: \u201cThis bias could be a consequence of lower-pitched female voices being perceived as more competent, stronger, and more trustworthy \u2026 [and] in the case of men\u2019s voices, men with lower-pitched voices are larger, stronger, and more aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>The findings can be corroborated by any woman who has ever spoken in a meeting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f/0_0_2629_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reaction to female and male candidates compared\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reaction to female and male candidates compared</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Report</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e9be72e4b0a785ec48bc8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:35:19.010Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve asked for your favorite music to fact-check to.

Such a voter may not react to the same thing the crowd reacts to, the campaigns react to or, needless to say, the media reacts to. Watch and judge for yourself, America ... and the world.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to start soon. Both candidates arrive onstage as practiced debaters, though Trump does not have any experience facing just one other person. He participated in a dozen primary-season debates this cycle, while Clinton participated in nine \u2026 plus the two dozen she showed up for in 2008.</p> <p>Thank you for reading, and please join us in the comments!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brb getting Oreos.</p>&mdash; Scott Bixby (@scottbix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:31:12.742Z\">at 1.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e9ba98e4b0593b3cb15008\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:19:31.238Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Clinton aide Philippe Reines \u2013 best-known among journalists as the state department spokesman who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/how-philippe-reines-handles-the-press-203496\">told a reporter to fuck off</a> \u2013 playing Trump in a debate prep session:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/780558043457196033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are multiple Trumps.

It\u2019s also because polls, which have come to be the manna of political analysts, now offer less help in making sense of it all.</p> <p>In past elections, the polls had settled down by Labor Day. This year, they continue to point all over the place. On Sunday, a survey by the <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/09/25/yougoveconomist-poll-september-22-24-2016/\">Economist and YouGov</a> found that Hillary Clinton had a lead of 4%. Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/\">LA Times and USC Tracking</a> put Donald Trump 4% ahead.</p> <p>Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing.</p> <p>This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a>.</p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45.9% of the vote while Trump has 43.8%, meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2.1%.</p> <p>Notice how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> aren\u2019t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck.</p> <p>But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">pointed out</a>, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).</p> <p>So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/skeptical-polling-clinton-trump-before-first-debate\">How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e949f3e4b0a785ec48ba9f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T17:00:24.328Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Monmouth poll: Clinton has 4-point lead over Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eight hours before going toe-to-toe at the first presidential debate of the general election campaign, Hillary Clinton has a four-point lead over Donald Trump among likely voters nationwide, according to a just-released Monmouth University poll.

Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson is polling at 8% in the survey and Green nominee Jill Stein is at 2%. Among all registered voters, and not just those most likely to vote in the upcoming election, Clinton leads with 45%, while Trump falls slightly further behind with 40% Trump.</p> <p>Among her compatriots in the Democratic party, Clinton has the support of 91% of party members, while Trump has won 85% of Republicans. This is an improvement for Trump, who previously counted only one-in-four Republican voters in his corner. Monmouth\u2019s polling suggests that independents are cutting right, supporting Trump over Clinton by 39% to 33%, a precipitous drop for the former secretary of state, who held a five-point lead among independent voters in late August.</p> <p>The generation gaps are in keeping with previous polling. Clinton leads among millennial voters under the age of 35 by 48% to Trump\u2019s 28%, while voters 35 to 54 support Trump at and Clinton at 41%. For voters older than 55, support is similarly divided, with 47% supporting Clinton and 46% supporting Trump.</p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s support has softened since the summer, but she has still managed to grab a share of those who tend to vote Republican,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.</p> <p>The historically unpopular major-party candidates are still viewed negatively by large majorities of the electorate. According to the survey, 36% of voters view Clinton positively, while 54% view her negatively.

Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?<br></strong>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?<br></strong>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?<br></strong>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?<br></strong>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-awkward-questions\">10 awkward debate questions to put Clinton and Trump on the spot</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94652e4b0593b3cb14e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:15:54.036Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What are the third-party candidates up to?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4/0_0_3957_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Stein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Stein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only two candidates to participate in tonight\u2019s presidential debate at Hofstra University on Long Island - polling limitations have limited the field to just the two major-party candidates, as has happened in every presidential debate since 1992 - but that doesn\u2019t mean that the other would-be presidents have given up on participating in some capacity.</p> <p>Former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson will watch tonight\u2019s debate from New York City with his running mate, Bill Weld, and will be livetweeting the proceedings from Twitter\u2019s offices in Chelsea.</p> <p>Green party nominee Jill Stein, meanwhile, plans to \u201cliterally insert herself\u201d into the debate tonight, responding to each of the debate questions via Periscope livestream.

He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?<br></strong>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet. Asked if he backed the invasion of Iraq, he said: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why would Mexico pay for you to build a wall?<br></strong>The flagship policy of building a physical wall on the southern border is frequently embellished with a boast that Trump would make sure Mexico paid for its construction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?<br></strong>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?<br></strong>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own.

The candidates may also respond to direct mentions, accusations or calumnies made by their opponent, and Holt may ask follow-up questions.</p> <p>Holt has separated the debate into three themes so nebulous as to be almost meaningless: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Direction,\u201d \u201cAchieving Prosperity\u201d and \u201cSecuring America.\u201d Whether or not these blocks are divided into 30-minute segments depends on the succinctness of the candidates\u2019 answers and Holt\u2019s willingness-slash-ability to reign them in.</p> <p><strong>Where: </strong>The debate will be held at Hofstra University on Long Island, which also hosted presidential debates in 2008 between then-Illinois senator Barack Obama and Arizona senator John McCain and in 2012 between President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.

  "<p>Donald Trump walked on to the biggest stage of his life with nothing but upside ahead.</p> <p>After the most undisciplined campaign in living memory, Trump was always going to look bigger by standing on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">presidential debate stage</a>. He could spar with a former secretary of state on an equal footing.</p> <p>To paraphrase George W Bush, Trump thrives on the soft bigotry of low expectations. All he had to do was avoid tripping over his shoelaces. Instead he somehow contrived to blow his biggest moment, and all the credibility accrued by steadily gaining ground in the polls over the last several weeks.</p> <p>Just like his convention speech, Trump ran a gamut of emotions from angry to aggravated. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">sniffed</a> and he snorted. He took every piece of bait Clinton dangled out there \u2013 from sideswipes about his father\u2019s business to his support for the war in Iraq.</p> <p>He sounded more like a heckler at a Clinton speech than a presidential candidate asking for votes. And he often seemed to resemble the rivals he once liked to mock. Just like Marco Rubio, he sipped water early and frequently. Just like Mitt Romney, he choked.</p> <p>They say that presidential campaigns are the longest job interviews in the world.

Pressed by moderator Lester Holt on his initial support for the war in Iraq, Trump explained that he had \u201cvery lightly\u201d supported the war in an interview with Howard Stern. Or as he put it, \u201cWho knows?\u201d Then he detailed several conversations with Sean Hannity, a Fox News host who has recently taped a TV commercial on his behalf. But apparently \u201cnobody wants to call him\u201d which is a shame because Sean could totally clear this whole thing up.</p> <p>In any case, as the GOP nominee put it, he\u2019s just a lot better at this whole president thing than Hillary Clinton. At least, that\u2019s what it sounded like. The following comes from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/?postshare=7441474938013874&amp;tid=ss_tw\">transcript</a>, which captures the moment in all its unfathomable detail.</p> <p>\u201cI have better judgment than she does,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.

She pretended to loosen her shoulders but frankly the rest of the world remains in need of a deep tissue massage.</p> <p>For her part, Clinton appeared to be interviewing for something like commander-in-chief. When Trump once again suggested he would only defend allies if they paid him for the privilege, Clinton turned to the camera to address a fearful planet.</p> <p>\u201cI know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with a number of them. But I want to, on behalf of myself and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people say that, you know, our word is good.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, by the way, has also talked to world leaders. \u201cI met with Bibi Netanyahu,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019s not a happy camper.\u201d</p> <p>It would be wrong to say that Trump had no good moments in this first encounter. He voiced popular dismay with manufacturing job losses and politicians in general. He conceded that people on the no-fly list of terrorist suspects should not be able to purchase guns, and he reminded voters that his opponent had talked of some criminals as \u201csuper-predators\u201d.</p> <p>But then the debate turned to the pesky question of his obsession with Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, years after the White House released the full birth certificate. And Trump lost the plot, as well as his intended audience.</p> <p>Clinton cast what she called \u201cthe whole racist birther lie\u201d as part of a pattern stretching back to his early career in real estate when he was sued for racial discrimination. Trump\u2019s response was to blame Clinton for the birther debate, before insisting that he was just one of many developers sued for discrimination. Besides, he bragged, he developed property in Palm Beach, Florida, that could prove his bona fides on race. \u201cI opened a club and really got great credit for it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo discrimination against African Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.\u201d</p> <p>It was widely reported that Trump did not prepare for this evening season with policy briefings or mock sessions with aides. Instead he clearly prepped for the big night by reviewing his own LinkedIn profile. </p> <p>This was clearly no ordinary debate. That was obvious from the outset, when the candidates\u2019 families and friends walked out as bold-face names: Bill Clinton, Ivanka Trump, Mark Cuban and Vernon Jordan. The audience cheered and hollered, clapped and booed, unlike the normally tightly controlled presidential debates of contests gone by.</p> <p>In any ordinary election year, by any rational measure, you would say that Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump in their first debate. She was in command of her facts and her soundbites; he could only cite numbers about his own cash-to-debt ratio. She controlled the pace of the debate; he could barely control his temper. She talked about how she wanted to govern; he talked about her inferior stamina.

  "<p>The first presidential debate is in the can. Here\u2019s a summary of what happened:<br></p> <ul> <li>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engaged in an occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">raw series of clashes</a> on topics from trade policy to the Iran deal to Trump\u2019s taxes.</li> <li>The Republican candidate came out swinging on Nafta and on, he said, his Democratic rival\u2019s failed record of public service. His most aggressive attacks had Clinton appealing to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">fact-checkers</a>\u201d instead of offering rebuttals.</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s performance was magisterial. She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior\u201d, on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax\u201d, and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience, but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>.

Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China or, bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said.

Donald Trump is accountable not just for what he gets wrong factually, but also what lurks beneath the surface of the thinly veiled sexist or xenophobic statements he traffics in.</p> <p>And tonight \u2013 in a moment that may end up a turning point not just in this debate, but also, perhaps, the election \u2013 Clinton not only managed to make the point but prove it.</p> <p>It occurred towards the end \u2013 a little less time and it never would have happened \u2013 when Trump was asked to explain what he meant by one of the more transparently sexist things he\u2019s said about Clinton: namely, that she doesn\u2019t look presidential. It was a delicate question, seemingly designed expressly to let Trump walk into a trap of his own making, but since Trump couldn\u2019t dodge it on substance, he obfuscated. \u201cI said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d he said, before diverting the conversation down a rabbithole, calling into question the nature of Clinton\u2019s experience.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that Trump has also said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina, but it doesn\u2019t negate his more obviously sexist comment that she doesn\u2019t look presidential. And for once, Clinton didn\u2019t let the truth float away on a cloud of empty rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cHe tried to switch from looks to stamina but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers,\u201d she said. Clinton also reminded the audience that Trump had impugned the legitimacy of the fight for equal pay \u2013 and even called upon the experiences of a specific woman, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump body shamed when she gained weight after winning the crown, to illustrate how he\u2019d insulted both women and the Latino community.</p> <p>Clinton had successfully weaponized Trump\u2019s words against him; she knew them all by heart, and no amount of changing the subject could get him out of it. As she herself quipped earlier, that she\u2019d prepared for the debate was obvious, and it wasn\u2019t anything to be ashamed of \u2013 rather, it was a sign she\u2019s prepared to be president. Tonight she just came one step closer.</p>",
