  "<p>Lawyers for Melania Trump are pursuing legal action against the Daily Mail for reporting \u201c100% false\u201d rumors that she worked as an escort in the 1990s as well as raising questions about her immigration status at the time.</p> <p>While Donald Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing litigation, it is unusual for a major party nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication only months before an election.</p> <p>The Republican nominee\u2019s wife had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/761212858944421888?lang=en\">previously denied</a> a story in Politico<em> </em>in which questions about her immigration status were first reported but had not previously addressed the other accusations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/melania-trump-nude-photos-work-visa-immigration\">Melania Trump denies working unlawfully as model in US on improper visa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suit comes in the wake of Trump launching an offensive against many media outlets, banning some such as Politico and the Washington Post from covering his rallies as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">calling for stricter libel laws</a> in the US. He also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">banned the Guardian from attending an event in Scotland</a> after Trump took offence when reporter Ewen MacAskill questioned the Republican nominee about his allegedly \u201ctoxic\u201d politics. </p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Charles Harder, an attorney at the firm of Harder, Miller and Abrams which is representing Trump, said: \u201cThis law firm is litigation counsel for Melania Trump. Mrs Trump has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an \u2018escort\u2019 in the 1990s. All such statements are 100% false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful. She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency.\u201d</p> <p>Harder\u2019s not-quite-four-year-old Beverly Hills firm, Harder Mirell &amp; Abrams LLP, is perhaps best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">bankrupted Gawker Media</a>, which was sold at auction to media company Univision earlier in August. The suit was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who spoke on behalf of Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Harder has also represented a number of other plaintiffs against Gawker as well; most recently, Harder has threatened a lawsuit against the now-defunct website because of <a href=\"http://gawker.com/now-peter-thiels-lawyer-wants-to-silence-reporting-on-t-1781918385\">an investigative report</a> about Donald Trump\u2019s hair.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Daily Mail did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Harder has since confirmed to the Guardian that Melania Trump is also considering filing lawsuits against other publications including Politico and the Week. Harder said that those publications are all \u201con notice\u201d and no suit has been filed yet. The Guardian has since learned that Politico has received a letter from Harder putting the publication on notice of a potential legal action. The lawyer\u2019s complaints <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/melania-trump-immigration-donald-226648\">related to a 4 August story </a>about Melania Trump\u2019s immigration status when she first came to the United States. For other publications, Harder did not specify which articles Melania Trump considered defamatory.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Thielman</em></p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton will quit the board of his charitable foundation but not disband it if Hillary Clinton wins the US presidency, he said on Monday, as Republicans pressed allegations of a conflict of interest.<br></p> <p>The announcement came as newly disclosed emails revealed how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/06/hillary-clinton-huma-abedin-marriage-politics\">Huma Abedin</a> coordinated a meeting for a Bahraini prince with officials at the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/06/hillary-clinton-huma-abedin-marriage-politics\">Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin and the politics of marriage | Crystal Wright</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid intensifying political controversy, Bill Clinton told foundation staff last week that it will stop accepting foreign or corporate donations in the event of his wife reaching the White House. <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2016/08/22/empowering-people-build-better-futures-themselves-their-families-and-their\">In a blogpost</a> on Monday, he put flesh on the bones.<br></p> <p>He defended the foundation\u2019s work, saying it had \u201cimproved millions of lives around the world\u201d, for example, by providing HIV/Aids drugs at vastly reduced cost, but admitted it would need to change if his wife wins.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIf Hillary is elected president, the foundation\u2019s work, funding, global reach, and my role in it will present questions that must be resolved in a way that keeps the good work going while eliminating legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Over the last several months, members of the foundation\u2019s senior leadership, Chelsea, and I have evaluated how the foundation should operate if Hillary is elected,\u201d the 70-year-old former president wrote.</p> <p>In the event of a Clinton victory in November, he added, the foundation will accept contributions only from US citizens, permanent residents and US-based independent foundations, whose names will be made public. Many of its international activities will be transferred to other organisations and its official name will change from the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, who set up the foundation at the end of his presidency 15 years ago, wrote: \u201cWhile I will continue to support the work of the foundation, I will step down from the board and will no longer raise funds for it.\u201d</p> <p>Next month\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York will be the last, he added, irrespective of the election result. But he rejected growing calls, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/16/clinton-foundation-should-stop-accepting-funds/W8JsNkBseYo6wIxWosNb5O/story.html\">not only from Trump</a>, that the foundation should close down if his wife prevails. \u201cWhile my role in that work will change, the work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it.\u201d</p> <p>The statement, which was emailed to about half a million supporters, came hours after Trump stepped up his attacks on the foundation. \u201cHillary Clinton is the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-clinton-foundation\">the Republican nominee said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history. What they were doing during Crooked Hillary\u2019s time as secretary of state was wrong then and it is wrong now. It must be shut down immediately.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5867ae3a864ba08d14f2e49b7b0afa9f2d01524b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5867ae3a864ba08d14f2e49b7b0afa9f2d01524b/197_292_4760_2854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Its official name will change from the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation if she wins the presidency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Its official name will change from the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation if she wins the presidency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Kraft/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Trump has donated to the foundation previously, he has accused Hillary Clinton of creating a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme whereby donors to the foundation got preferential treatment at the state department.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He was given fresh ammunition on Monday when a batch of 20 emails released by <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/new-abedin-emails-reveal-hillary-clinton-state-department-gave-special-access-top-clinton-foundation-donors/\">the conservative group Judicial Watch</a> showed how the foundation sought access to Clinton on donors\u2019 behalf.</p> <p>On 23 June 2009, for example, Doug Band, a senior executive at the foundation, wrote to Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff Abedin. Band wanted to arrange for the crown prince of Bahrain, a US ally, to meet the secretary of state during a visit to Washington. \u201cGood friend of ours,\u201d Band wrote to Abedin.</p> <p>After initial doubts over scheduling, Abedin confirmed that Clinton would meet Crown Prince Salman, who in 2005 had made a $32m commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative. Copies of Clinton\u2019s calendar obtained by the Associated Press confirm that the meeting took place in her state department office on 26 June 2009.</p> <p>Another exchange shows Band requesting that Clinton help a member of British football club <a href=\"http://www.wolves.co.uk/\">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> \u2013 presumably a player, though no name is given \u2013 who was struggling to get a US visa to visit Las Vegas for a \u201ccelebration break\u201d because of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. This was at the behest of Hollywood and sports executive Casey Wasserman, who had donated between $5m and $10m to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s office did not comply and no visa was obtained. Abedin said it \u201cmakes me nervous to get involved but I\u2019ll ask\u201d. Band replied: \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The emails also show that Clinton met SlimFast founder <a href=\"http://www.centerpeace.org/about/staff/s-daniel-abraham/\">Daniel Abraham</a>, founder of the Center for Middle East Peace and another Clinton Foundation donor, at a day\u2019s notice in May 2009. According to the Associated Press, the calendars show the meeting was one of eight between Abraham and Clinton while she was secretary, the most of any foundation donor.</p> <p>On Monday the state department rejected any allegations of undue influence. Deputy spokesman Mark Toner said: \u201cI would just once again emphasise that there wasn\u2019t a single channel for access to the secretary of state than secretary of state Clinton. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAnd for senior aides working at the department at the time to have connections with the Clinton Foundation \u2013 which by the way was working on, for example, Haiti relief, post-earthquake, pretty significant roles in that, in fact \u2013 only speaks to the fact that these were important people who had reason to convey information to the secretary. There was nothing that we have seen that implied any kind of untoward relationship.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign rejected the criticism and took a swipe at Judicial Watch. Spokesman Josh Schwerin said: \u201cOnce again this rightwing organisation that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s is distorting facts to make utterly false attacks. No matter how this group tries to mischaracterise these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate <a href=\"http://www.kaine.senate.gov/\">Tim Kaine</a>, speaking at the ironworkers\u2019 annual convention in Las Vegas, said: \u201cAll the donors to the foundation have been disclosed. And the foundation has said, \u2018We\u2019ll go further. We\u2019ll restructure itself completely if Hillary Clinton is elected president.\u2019 That\u2019s a pledge.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump, on the other hand, has told us nothing about how he\u2019ll deal with the conflicts posed by his business dealings, like the money his company owes to the Bank of China. And I have this to say to Donald Trump, because these ties affect your net worth: before you go about attacking a charity, why don\u2019t you come clean about your own business dealings and tell the American people who you are in debt to?\u201d</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland\">Finland</a> says it is close to concluding a defence cooperation agreement with the US, the latest in a series of steps the formally neutral Nordic country has taken to bolster its security in the face of heightened Russian military activity.</p> <p>The country\u2019s defence minister, Jussi Niinist\u00f6, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-finland-usa-defence-idUKKCN10X19Z\">said he hoped the deal</a> \u2013 incorporating joint military training, information sharing and research \u2013 would be signed before the US presidential election in November. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons to have it done this autumn. But I\u2019m certain we will continue to work together with either one of main candidates winning,\u201d Niinisto told Reuters news agency. There was no immediate response from the Pentagon on a potential agreement.</p> <p> The deal would provide a framework for increased cooperation between the armed forces of the two nations but would not involve any binding commitment for either country to come to the defence of the other. Finland <a href=\"http://www.finlandtimes.fi/national/2016/07/10/28461/Finland,-Britain-sign-defense-protocol\">signed a similar agreement</a> with the UK in July. </p> <p> Sweden, the other Nordic country to have remained outside Nato, signed a defence cooperation agreement with the US in June. Leaders from both Sweden and Finland also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit-nordics-idUSKCN0ZO1EO\">took part in a Nato summit</a> last month in Warsaw, and their armed forces have taken part in Nato military exercises in the region as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/russian-attack-planes-buzz-uss-donald-cook-baltic-sea\">nervousness has grown</a> around the Baltic over an increasing number of Russian military drills in the air and sea following Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Both Nordic states have already signed agreements that would make it easier for them to host Nato troops in a crisis, and they contributed troops to the Nato mission in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Russia has warned it would respond to any move by Finland or Sweden to join Nato. In a meeting with his Finnish counterpart in early July, Vladimir Putin claimed (wrongly) that Russian troops <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://en.special.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/52312\">had been withdrawn</a> 1500km from the Finnish border, but suggested that decision would be reviewed if Finland moved towards Nato membership. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/russias-lavrov-warns-sweden-nato-membership-453890\">said in April</a> that Russia would reassess its troop deployments along its northern flank if Sweden joined the alliance. </p> <p> In a recent defence policy review, Finland, which has a 800-mile border with Russia, said it would leave open the option of joining Nato, but a panel of experts warned that any such move would trigger a \u201charsh\u201d Russian reaction, and opinion polls show that a majority of Finns oppose Nato membership. </p> <p>Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Moscow Centre of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described the proposed Finnish-US agreement as \u201ca significant \u2013if at this point largely symbolic \u2013 step.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cUnlike in the days of the Cold War, Finland is no longer \u201cneutral\u201d between Russia and the West,\u201d Trenin added. \u201cThey know which side they are on, and are not shy to demonstrate it. However, they are careful not to create more problems for themselves even as they move closer to the US/NATO. Their position from now on can be compared to that of Sweden during the Cold War: an undeclared member of the Western alliance.\u201d</p>",

Two of Rodchenkov\u2019s former colleagues including the one-time head of the agency, Nikita Kamayev, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36833962\">died </a> in February.</p> <p>Cybersecurity researchers at ThreatConnect believe the hacker was \u201cFancy Bear\u201d, a hacking team long suspected of ties to Russian security agency GRU. Fancy Bear breached Wada in apparent retaliation against whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova, the Russian sprinter who spoke out against what she described as the practice of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/30324812\">helping athletes cheat in exchange for a percentage of their earnings</a>, according to ThreatConnnect.<br></p> <p>ThreatConnect\u2019s Toni Gidwani, formerly of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Guardian that the breach came after the revelation of widespread cheating by Russian Olympians. ThreatConnect issued a <a href=\"https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/\">report</a> on the breach last week.<br></p> <p>The hack was \u201cthuggish\u201d, she said, but as is usual with Fancy Bear, the very public attack masked an intended chilling effect: \u201cWe also think there\u2019s very much an element of retaliation against Yuliya Stepanova,\u201d Gidwani said. \u201cThey attacked her email, they got her records out of Wada. There\u2019s very much a retaliatory aspect to it and a way of intimidating anybody who might be thinking about speaking out.\u201d</p> <p>The specific intimidation campaign against Stepanova is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/magazine/the-marriage-that-led-to-the-russian-track-teams-olympic-ban.html?_r=0\">well-documented</a>.

That is the context that helps explain these kinds of actions.\u201d</p> <p>Fancy Bear attacked the DNC, and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, in a broad attack revealed earlier this summer. But the splashy nature of that intrusion \u2013 a person or people using the online handle Guccifer 2.0 distributed tidbits from the breach to reporters \u2013 revealed a second intruder, codenamed Cozy Bear by ThreatConnect.</p> <p>Cozy Bear, which has also been linked to the Russian intelligence services, came to prominence last year following hacks of the state department and White House networks.</p> <p>Gidwani says she\u2019s heard very little from Cozy Bear as her firm tracks malware and phishing attacks. \u201cIf I put on my tinfoil hat for a minute, that\u2019s one of the things that kind of concerns me,\u201d Gidwani said. \u201cFancy Bear has been so noisy that we\u2019re not focusing on Cozy Bear as much.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A federal court in Texas has blocked new US school rules for accommodating transgender students, setting up a legal battle with the White House that may soon head to the supreme court.<br></p> <p>As millions of American children prepared to return for the new academic year, <a href=\"http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judge/district-judge-reed-oconnor\">Reed O\u2019Connor</a>, a district judge in Forth Worth, issued <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Texas_et_al_v._U.S._et_al_-_Nationwide_PI_(08-21-16).pdf\">the nationwide injunction</a> late on Sunday night to prevent public schools from being forced to allow equal access to bathrooms and changing facilities. </p> <p>The case follows <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights\">guidance issued in May</a> by the US justice and education departments which said transgender students were entitled to protection under sex discrimination laws and should be allowed access to \u201cactivities and sex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity\u201d.</p> <p>This rapidly escalating skirmish in American culture wars came after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/lgbt-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-justice-department\">Department of Justice sued North Carolina</a> for a state law that forced people to only use public bathrooms that correspond to the gender listed on their birth certificates.</p> <p>But now Judge O\u2019Connor has upheld a complaint brought by Texas and a dozen other mostly Republican states who argue the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority by forcing schools to allow the opposite.</p> <p>\u201cThis case presents the difficult issue of balancing the protection of students\u2019 rights and that of personal privacy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate facilities, while ensuring that no student is unnecessarily marginalized while attending school,\u201d wrote the judge in his 38-page ruling.</p> <p>\u201cThe resolution of this difficult policy issue is not, however, the subject of this order. Instead, the constitution assigns these policy choices to the appropriate elected and appointed officials, who must follow the proper legal procedure.\u201d</p> <p>Equality campaigners reacted angrily to the latest decision, which they said would put vulnerable students at risk.</p> <p>\u201cJudge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision to bar the Department of Justice from enforcing this important guidance puts thousands of transgender students at even greater risk of marginalization, harassment, and discrimination as they return to school this fall,\u201d said Human Rights Campaign (HRC) legal director Sarah Warbelow. \u201cAll students, regardless of their gender identity, deserve to be able to learn in an environment free from discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>The nationwide ruling does not prevent schools or states from allowing access, something both sides claimed was a silver lining.</p> <p>\u201cAs the separate facilities provision is permissive, states that authorise schools to define sex to include gender identity for purposes of providing separate restroom, locker room, showers, and other intimate facilities will not be impacted by it,\u201d said Judge O\u2019Connor.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this judge\u2019s decision, schools are not barred from following the federal guidance, and school administrators still have a responsibility to ensure that the civil rights of all students are respected and that transgender students have access to facilities consistent with their gender identity,\u201d responded the HRC. \u201cAs lawsuits on the scope of Title IX proceed, we believe that justice will prevail as courts continue to recognise that discrimination against transgender students is a form of sex discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>Assuming it is challenged and then held up by the Texas-based appeals court, the latest ruling \u2013 from a judge who also fought gay rights advances \u2013 is likely to mark the opening salvo in what will swiftly become a major test of the supreme court\u2019s approach to civil rights for transgender individuals.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administration\u2019s latest illegal federal overreach,\u201d <a href=\"https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ruling-in-favor-of-school-and-state-rights-federal-court-stops-enforcement\">said Texas attorney general Ken Paxton</a>, who led the challenge by Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, Maine, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky.</p> <p>\u201cThis president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people, and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform,\u201d he added. \u201cThat cannot be allowed to continue, which is why we took action to protect states and school districts, who are charged under state law to establish a safe and disciplined environment conducive to student learning.\u201d</p> <p>The White House declined to join direct criticism of the judge\u2019s ruling. Press secretary Josh Earnest said: \u201cThe primary goal in offering this guidance was to ensure a safe educational environment for all students \u2026 It certainly was not a mandate. It was not described that way by the administration.</p> <p>\u201cIt was described that way by some of the administration\u2019s critics. I understand there are people eager to play politics with this just a few months before an election.\u201d</p> <p>Earnest added: \u201cOur goal has been from the beginning to provide for the safety, security and dignity of students all across the country \u2026 we certainly have confidence in the legality of the guidance.\u201d</p> <p>The White House also respected the rulings of federal judges, he said, and would allow the Department of Justice to determine the next step.</p> <p>The US supreme court, currently operating with a depleted bench of eight justices, recently temporarily blocked another similar rule in Virginia while it considers whether to take up the overall issue of transgender bathroom access in the coming term.</p>",

She also discovered that each Potter book that her respondents had read lowered their feelings about Trump by two to three points on the 100-point scale.</p> <p>\u201cThis may seem small,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for someone who has read all seven books, the total impact could lower their estimation of Trump by 18 points out of 100.\u201d</p> <p>Mutz said that even when she controlled for issues including gender, education and age, all of which predict Americans\u2019 attitudes to Trump, the \u201cHarry Potter effect\u201d remained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">JK Rowling on Donald Trump: 'Voldemort was nowhere as bad'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mutz writes in the study that similarities between Trump and Potter\u2019s nemesis Voldemort \u201chave not gone without notice during the 2016 campaign\u201d, with the term Trumpdemort gaining traction, and \u201ceven Trump supporters \u2026 buying into the analogy, purchasing Trump posters featuring their candidate in front of an American flag as backdrop, with a quote from the Dark Lord himself: \u2018There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She points out similarities between the fictional wizard and the Republican candidate for president, including how Voldemort \u201csupports the eradication of mixed blood wizards\u201d, and how \u201cin comparison, Donald Trump has called for a temporary moratorium on Muslim immigration\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt may simply be too difficult for Harry Potter readers to ignore the similarities between Trump and the power-hungry Voldemort,\u201d she writes in the study.</p> <p>Mutz found that the Potter films, by contrast, did not lead to Trump opposition \u2013 possibly, she believes, because \u201creading inherently requires much higher levels of attention and allows for greater nuance in characters, many of whom are neither wholly good nor wholly bad\u201d, and \u201cdue to length, movies must leave out material from the full books, and they are more likely to emphasise action over the characters\u2019 internal dilemmas and introspection\u201d. </p> <p>Mutz ends her study by speculating that \u201cthese findings raise the hope that Harry Potter can stop the Deathly Donald and make America great again in the eyes of the world, just as Harry did by ridding the wizard world of Voldemort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout the series, love and kindness consistently triumph over aggression and prejudice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful, positive theme, and thus not surprising that readers understand the underlying message of this storyline, and are moved by it. These pro-unity views come through loud and clear in the storyline and have also been publicly voiced by the author of the series, JK Rowling, who has \u2026 espoused anti-Brexit and anti-Trump political views. Harry Potter\u2019s popularity worldwide stands to make a difference not just in the US election, but in elections across Europe that involve aggressive and domineering candidates worldwide.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-donald-trump-freedom-pen-america-gala-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ja6v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2507193\"            data-video-name=\"JK Rowling defends 'objectionable' Donald Trump\u2019s freedom to speak \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PEN American Center\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573b09b4e4b05be498d5fba5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-donald-trump-freedom-pen-america-gala-video\">JK Rowling defends \u2018objectionable\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s freedom to speak</a></figcaption> </figure>",

His speech on Monday came after Corbyn\u2019s campaign announced a raft of policies on more direct democracy, including within the party. </p> <p>These would \u201cextend democracy in every part of public life: in national politics, communities, the economy and the workplace \u2013 and in our own party\u201d, Corbyn said on Sunday night.</p> <p>\u201cLabour under my leadership will listen to ideas from the bottom up \u2013 and take radical action to transform and rebuild our country so that no one and no community is left behind. We need nothing less than a democratic revolution in our politics, communities and workplaces.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside his pledge for a sovereign conference, Corbyn also promised a charter of rights for party members and widening representation on the party\u2019s NEC to reflect the rapid rise in membership.</p> <p>His campaign director, Sam Tarry, dismissed Smith\u2019s proposal, saying: \u201cI would be astonished if most of the MPs backing Owen Smith would sign up to that; there\u2019s a sell-by date of 24 September, when most of his policies will get shelved.\u201d</p> <p>Tarry also dismissed the endorsement of Khan, who was booed at a Corbyn rally in north London on Sunday night that was attended by 4,000 people. He also said the campaign would not take \u201cmany lessons from Labour in Scotland; Kezia delivered a disastrous result for us there\u201d.</p> <p>The Aslef union president, Tosh McDonald, told the Morning Star that Khan would not have won the London mayoral election without the Corbyn effect on his popularity. \u201cMy personal view is that not only is Sadiq Khan stabbing Jeremy in the back, he\u2019s stabbing Aslef and all our members in the back.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he gets this idea that Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable from.

  "<p>It is two months since British voters surprised themselves by deciding to end the UK\u2019s 43-year relationship with the European Union \u2013 \u201cindependence day\u201d to some and \u201cthe worst political decision since 1945\u201d to others. </p> <p>As stunned political leaderships on both sides of the Channel continue dithering about what to do next, it is worth looking back at the origins of a crisis the EU elite had not expected.</p> <p>1) It may have started with Harold Macmillan\u2019s father taking the future prime minister to watch Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee parade in 1897. Aged just three, Macmillan was very impressed by its splendour, but years later he would tell audiences that the pomp and power had been \u201call an illusion\u201d. Two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in both) and the Great Depression put paid to it. The answer was a Europe that replaced old enmities with cooperation, he decided. But in 1955 Anthony Eden was PM and clung to old illusions. His government sent no minister \u2013 only a middling trade official named Russell Bretherton \u2013 to the summit in Messina, Italy, that led to the 1957 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome\">Treaty of Rome</a>. Britain missed the boat. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, regarded Britain as an American Trojan horse and vetoed Macmillan\u2019s first bid to join in 1963 and Harold Wilson\u2019s in 1967.</p> <p>2) After De Gaulle\u2019s retirement, Ted Heath achieved entry for Britain on 1 January 1973, splitting both the Labour and Tory parties in the process. Key policies such as fishing and farming had not been designed to meet UK needs, and some people were worried about pooling aspects of sovereignty with the \u201cCommon Market\u201d six. They were now nine, as Ireland and Denmark joined too, but Norwegians voted against membership. Heath was a hopeless salesman. When he lost power in 1974, Labour\u2019s Wilson embraced Tony Benn\u2019s idea of a referendum to legitimise British membership. With most of Fleet Street and the new Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, on his side, Wilson won heavily by a margin of two to one against a coalition of rightwing Tories, Bennites and much of the Labour movement. Union leaders saw the economically booming Europe as a capitalist plot.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> 3) The Common Market evolved into the European Economic Community (EEC) and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union#Enlargement\">membership expanded</a>, taking in former dictatorships Spain, Greece and Portugal in the 1980s, neutrals and ex-Soviet bloc countries after the end of the cold war. It would be 28 in all when Croatia joined in 2013. To keep growing, Europe needed to reduce tariff barriers and in 1986 signed the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act\">Single European Act</a> (SEA), which committed members to free movement of goods, capital, services and people in a \u201csingle market\u201d by 1992. Acknowledging emerging fears of a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d, the SEA also gave the elected European parliament greater powers. But it also replaced national vetoes with qualified majority voting on many decisions in the EEC\u2019s council of ministers. Denmark\u2019s parliament rejected the SEA, but it was endorsed by a referendum, as it was in Ireland. An opponent of referendums, Thatcher did not hold a British referendum and only later regretted that she had been deceived by the \u201cfederalist conveyor belt\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb/387_132_1624_974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher made her Bruges speech in 1988 opposing economic and political union</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>4) The next signpost on the road to what EU integrationists hoped would be \u201cever closer union\u201d was to set up a single currency. By now Thatcher was vocally against such a move and in 1988 made her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Bruges speech</a> opposing economic and political union, but backing cooperation between nation states. (It was not meant as a Brexit speech, aides would stress in 2016). Meanwhile Labour\u2019s modernisers, led by Neil Kinnock, had reversed the party\u2019s opposition to EU membership. They had been wooed by the vision of a high-wage workers\u2019 Europe promoted by Jacques Delors, the visionary French socialist who was president of the powerful Brussels bureaucracy, the European commission. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened up the prospect of German reunification, the French insisted on a currency union to tie an ever more dominant Germany to the EU project. Britain wanted the project to be \u201cbroader, not deeper\u201d by expanding eastwards. Both policies were implemented; both would later have fateful consequences.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>5) As Thatcher\u2019s power weakened she quarrelled with key allies such as Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson over Europe. But her new chancellor, John Major, persuaded her to link sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) at what some feared was too high a rate for British industry. When Thatcher fell, Major took over and negotiated British opt-outs from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty\">Maastricht treaty</a> (1992), which reorganised the EU and set timetables and rules for a single currency zone and for the no-passport Schengen zone. As part of Major\u2019s \u201cvariable geometry\u201d strategy for a two-speed Europe, Britain was also allowed not to join the \u201csocial chapter\u201d covering workers\u2019 rights. Denmark needed two referendums before signing; France\u2019s was only narrowly carried. Major won the 1992 election, but opposition to Europe crystallised at this time into demands for an in/out referendum on UK membership. The sterling crisis of September 1992 forced Britain out of the ERM. The economy recovered, but not Major\u2019s reputation. What became Ukip was founded and Major\u2019s government was hobbled by backbench \u201cEurosceptic\u201d rebellions, billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum_Party\">Referendum party</a> and Thatcher\u2019s criticisms. BSE (\u201cmad cow disease\u201d) turned into an ugly beef war with Europe.</p> <p>6) Major\u2019s EU problems helped Tony Blair pile up a 179-seat majority in 1997 as the most pro-European PM since Heath. Labour talked a positive game on Europe, but Fleet Street had moved against it in line with rightwing public opinion, and Blair never dared expend much political capital making the positive case for Europe. Instead his turf war with Gordon Brown ensured that the chancellor imposed a near-impossible \u201cfive tests\u201d of the British national interest before he would consent to sterling joining the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro\">euro</a>, whose coins and notes were launched in 2002. Labour joined the \u201csocial chapter\u201d that Major had blocked, but fell out with most of its EU partners over UK support for the US-led invasion of Iraq. The French were denounced as \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d.</p> <p>7) Serious strategic mistakes were then made on both sides of the Channel. Labour decided not to impose transitional restrictions on the free movement of workers when mostly former Soviet bloc states known as the A10 joined the EU on 1 May 2004, unaware that France and Germany would do so. Instead of the estimated 13,000 annual arrivals expected, mostly from Poland, more than a million came in the years that followed. It allowed Ukip to capitalise on fears of wage competition, pressure on social services and cultural resentment in many areas, pushing the Tories to the right. Labour failed to respond to fears shared by many of its supporters. Tony Blair promised a referendum on the EU \u201cconstitution\u201d but ducked it when French and Dutch voters said no. Resentment grew when a version of the constitution became the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon\">Lisbon treaty</a> (2009).<br></p> <p>8) When the global banking crisis began in mid-2007, initially in France and Britain, it was blamed by many in Brussels on irresponsible \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d speculative banking. But US and British central bankers proved much more nimble in restructuring and bailing out troubled banks than the EU did at both national and eurozone level. At Germany\u2019s insistence, a tough line was taken against eurozone states, notably Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal \u2013 \u201cperipheral\u201d economies that had borrowed heavily on the new currency\u2019s credibility to launch unsustainable booms. The subsequent austerity regime crippled Greece and killed growth elsewhere. Free to devalue and with flexible labour laws, Britain was able to navigate the crisis more adroitly. Badly hit by the rising economic power of Asia, the eurozone looked less like an engine of growth than one of stagnation, and some of its banks a submerged problem that leaders tried to ignore.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915/0_228_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron hoped he could sell the economic case for continued EU membership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>9) David Cameron had won the Tory leadership in 2005 by outflanking his main rival, David Davis, over Europe, promising to quit the main conservative group of MEPs. After becoming prime minister in 2010 he talked tough, but Eurosceptic colleagues never trusted him and used his appeasement tactics to demand more. Despite investing less effort and manpower at the Brussels negotiating table, Britain was winning key battles, its language had now replaced French, its approach to law and free trade gained ground and it was outside the floundering eurozone and Schengen\u2019s border free-for-all. It was already half out. But that was not enough for critics. Ahead of the 2015 election Cameron promised an in/out referendum after a \u201crenegotiation\u201d (the tactic Wilson had used in 1975), probably expecting Nick Clegg to veto it again in a renewed coalition. Instead he won an outright majority and decided to resolve the issue early, in 2016 rather than 2017.<br></p> <p>10) Cameron\u2019s elevation of party management tactics over strategy was rapidly compounded by a perfect storm for what became known as the Brexit campaign. Tory promises to reduce net immigration from about 300,000 to below 100,000 repeatedly failed, weaponising the \u201cTake Back Control\u201d slogan. Middle East wars (in which British action and inaction made things worse) compounded the economic and asylum migration flow. The spread of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism into Europe added fresh fears to the mix. The eurozone was easily portrayed as a basket case in which failed EU policies were stirring up the very extremism the union had been devised to prevent. Yet the cross-party remain camp\u2019s lacklustre campaign clung to the economic case for membership, revealing an arrogant metropolitan disdain for voters\u2019 fears on immigration in less prosperous regions. </p> <p>Cameron thought he could keep the wavering Boris Johnson onside. Instead the London mayor became leave\u2019s biggest campaign draw, willing to deploy some of its most unscrupulous claims about migration (\u201cTurkey is joining the EU\u201d) and budget savings (\u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d). Cameron had also banked on strong Labour backing. But the official opposition had elected Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, as its leader. He declared for Europe, but millions barely noticed his feeble contribution. Nor did they believe remain\u2019s warnings of the dangers of a leave vote, some too crude to impress anyone, some from foreign VIPs like Barack Obama. In the brave new world of Brexit, Michael Gove spoke for the 52% to 48% majority on 23 June when he said: \u201cI think people in this country have had enough of experts.\u201d<br></p> <p>It wasn\u2019t quite the outcome Macmillan had in mind when he denounced imperial illusions and sought refuge in Europe.

  "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-speech-foreign-policy-security\">speech in San Diego recently</a>, Hillary Clinton asked: \u201cDo we want his [Donald Trump\u2019s] finger anywhere near the button?\u201d She was doubtful that her Republican rival was really the guy you wanted to unleash <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_States\">America\u2019s arsenal of nuclear warheads</a> which has thousands of times the destructive force of the weapons that obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki 71 years ago this month.</p> <p>Certainly, her opponent\u2019s nuclear strategy, if that\u2019s not too strong a word, is nothing if not maverick. \u201cSomebody hits us within Isis, you wouldn\u2019t fight back with a nuke?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/world/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons.html?_r=0\">Trump asked in March</a>. He was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/03/trump-clinton-campaign-election-2016-live?page=with:block-57a202c9e4b031196bf5bc88#block-57a202c9e4b031196bf5bc88\">reported</a> as saying of nuclear weapons: \u201cIf we have them, why can\u2019t we use them?\u201d On an interview with MSNBC in March, his interviewer told Trump that nobody wanted to hear that \u201ca guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons\u201d. To which <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons\">Trump replied</a>: \u201cThen why are we making them? Why do we make them?\u201d</p> <p>This sort of stuff has been too much, for some Republicans. One of them is John Noonan, who worked for many years as a Minuteman III nuclear launch officer under the Wyoming tundra, hoping never to receive a particularly urgent call from presidents Bush or Obama. He is not voting for Trump because he thinks the Republican is too irrational and doesn\u2019t understand nuclear deterrence strategy that, in his view, has spared the world from destruction since 1945. \u201cThe very point of nuclear weapons is that they are never used,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-noonan-trump-nuclear-20160809-snap-story.html\">wrote Noonan in the LA Times earlier this month</a>. \u201cWe have them to dissuade hostile powers from attacking us, and vice versa.</p> <p>\u201cI sat at my post believing, through both the Bush and Obama administrations, that the president was fundamentally rational and would never ask me to do my terrible duty. Not unless the country was in the direst of national emergencies. With Trump as president, the young men and women who are assigned to our nuclear forces will have no such assurances.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, maybe Trump does understand something of the mind-boggling, games-theory-based logic underpinning deterrence strategy. He was <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/9-terrifying-things-donald-trump-has-publicly-said-about-nuclear-weapons-99f6290bc32a#.7d54x6q0i\">asked on CBS in March</a> when should the US use nuclear weapons. \u201cWell, it is an absolute last stance. And, you know, I use the word unpredictable. You want to be unpredictable.\u201d The corollary? If you\u2019re too predictable, then the enemy can get the nuclear jump on you.</p> <p>In another interview, Trump was asked if he would nuke Europe. \u201cEurope is a big place,\u201d he replied airily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take cards off the table.\u201d</p> <p>What Clinton must have known better than most when she made her San Diego speech is that Donald Trump will never get his fingers on the nuclear button. Not because the polls suggest she will trounce him in November, but rather because it is merely a figure of speech. In a 1980s Spitting Image sketch, Ronald Reagan had two buttons at his bedside. One was labelled \u201cnurse\u201d, the other \u2013 inadvertently pressed \u2013 labelled \u201cnukes\u201d. In reality, there is no such thing as the president\u2019s nuclear button.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-bit-like-us-oliver-burkeman\">Is there a bit of Donald Trump in all of us? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every US president since John F Kennedy has been equipped with a nuclear biscuit and a nuclear football.

Indeed, one of Clinton\u2019s former military aides, Lt Col Robert \u201cBuzz\u201d Patterson, recalled that the morning after the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal broke, he asked the president for the card so that he could supply an updated version.

We called upstairs, we started a search around the White House for the codes, and he finally confessed that he in fact misplaced them. He couldn\u2019t recall when he had last seen them.\u201d These were, we realise in hindsight, perturbing hours for humanity, since it is only when the Pentagon and nuclear launch officers hear these codes that will they know for certain that the person on the line is really the president rather than, say, an Obama impersonator working for Kim Jong-un.</p> <p>There may be some of you already suspecting that humanity\u2019s best hopes for surviving a Trump presidency is to send his suits for dry cleaning before he gets to empty the pockets, or tuck the nuclear biscuit down the back of an Oval Office sofa while the president is distracted arranging his hair.</p> <p>As for the nuclear football, it comes into active service when the president leaves the White House. It is the nickname for a large leather, aluminium-framed briefcase weighing 20kg which is hefted by a military aide who shadows the US commander in chief.</p> <p>It is, <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/real-story-football-follows-president-everywhere-180952779/\">as former Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs calls it</a>, \u201cthe ultimate power accessory, a doomsday machine that could destroy the entire world\u201d. The late Bill Gulley, a former director of the White House Military Office, described what\u2019s inside the nuclear football in his 1980 memoir Breaking Cover. \u201cThere are four things in the football. The Black Book containing the retaliatory options, a book listing classified site locations, a manila folder with eight or 10 pages stapled together giving a description of procedures for the Emergency Broadcast System, and a three-by-five inch card with authentication codes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd7898de1e0bd71f8798438414c382eedc91aba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd7898de1e0bd71f8798438414c382eedc91aba7/0_683_2953_3691/800.jpg\" alt=\"The nuclear football in Red Square during Reagan\u2019s visit.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The nuclear football in Red Square during Reagan\u2019s visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nuclear football has an antenna protruding from it, likely indicating that inside there is a communication system with which the president can maintain contact the Pentagon\u2019s National Military Command Centre which monitors worldwide nuclear threats and can order an instant nuclear response. \u201cThe football,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/real-story-football-follows-president-everywhere-180952779/\">says Dobbs</a>, \u201calso provides the commander-in-chief with a simplified menu of nuclear strike options \u2013 allowing him to decide, for example, whether to destroy all of America\u2019s enemies in one fell swoop or to limit himself to obliterating only Moscow or Pyongyang or Beijing.\u201d Or, presumably, Milton Keynes.</p> <p>One of Ronald Reagan\u2019s aides even carried the nuclear football across Red Square during a presidential visit to Moscow. In principle, Reagan could have ordered a first strike on the Soviet Union at that moment. In any case, Reagan\u2019s Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, was also accompanied during the visit by a military aide holding a very similar bag, known in Russian as the chemodanchik, or \u201clittle briefcase.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years there have been several nuclear footballs, all manufactured for the White House by <a href=\"http://zerohalliburton.com/#\">Zero Halliburton</a>, the Utah firm that also supplied aluminium briefcases <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120314205312/http://www.zerohalliburton.com/index.php?dispatch=pages.view&amp;page_id=17\">for movies</a> like Men in Black II, Air Force One and perhaps less reassuringly, Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? and Spy Kids. Today, visitors to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington can see a retired nuclear football and, if so minded, salute its gallant contribution to global security.</p> <p>The nuclear football came into active service after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when President Kennedy worried how the Pentagon and nuclear launch officers would be sure that it was really the president ordering a strike. Declassified documents <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2pEQpx8CB7oC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+would+I+say+to+the+Joint+War+Room+to+launch+an+immediate+nuclear+strike?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jfksuHVMEc&amp;sig=PBJ_MNOo84HEPyBBVN1PAw1C-pA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbuaP8lrfOAhXIShQKHXF1CNQQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20would%20I%20say%20to%20the%20Joint%20War%20Room%20to%20launch%20an%20immediate%20nuclear%20strike%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\">reveal his concerns</a>: \u201cWhat would I say to the Joint War Room to launch an immediate nuclear strike?\u201d Kennedy asked. \u201cHow would the person who received my instructions verify them?\u201d</p> <p>Now, long after the end of the cold war, the man bag still shadows the president on his or her travels. There are in fact three nuclear footballs \u2013 one kept near the president when they leave the White House, another for the vice-president and a third kept in storage in the White House. The nuclear football is not handcuffed to aides, as some have claimed, but has a leather cinch strap <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138042614/\">that can be looped around the wrist</a>.</p> <p>Why is the briefcase nicknamed the nuclear football? According to former US secretary of defence Robert McNamara, it was so-named because it was part of an early nuclear war plan code-named Operation Drop Kick.</p> <p>In Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 nuclear black comedy Dr Strangelove, there is also an Operation Drop Kick. It denoted a nuclear exercise that goes wrong when the unhinged US general played by Sterling Hayden orders a first strike on the Soviet Union. All the president\u2019s men strive to recall the bombers to prevent nuclear politics. As you know (spoiler alert!), they fail and the film concludes with Major TJ \u201cKing\u201d Kong played by Slim Pickens, dropping from Russian skies astride a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>In reality, happily, Operation Drop Kick hasn\u2019t resulted in nuclear catastrophe. That said, there have been nuclear-football fumbles. Peter Metzger, a former marine who was one of five military aides charged with carrying the nuclear football for Reagan, recently recalled that once a colleague steered him into a different lift from the president and tricked him into thinking he had missed the motorcade. Metzger said his heart was racing \u201clike a gerbil in a cage\u201d until he realised his colleague was playing a practical joke.</p> <p>Metzger said that carrying the nuclear football is a worrisome responsibility. \u201cThe result of a decision the president would make is so grotesquely horrible \u2013 it would change the face of the earth, it would change humanity, it would change mankind,\u201d <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/06/politics/nuclear-football-president-button/\">he said</a>. \u201cI guess when you\u2019re on duty, you try not to think of the import of that. But you are fully prepared to do so if you have to.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Patterson, who carried the football for Clinton, said: \u201cYou\u2019re always kind of on edge. I opened it up constantly just to refresh myself, to always be aware of what was in it, all the potential decisions the president could possibly make.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, one of the nuclear football\u2019s trusty carriers, ex-marine John Kline, even used footage of the bag in a TV ad to help his campaign for re-election to Congress. \u201cIn this briefcase lies the fate of the world,\u201d <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-05-nuclear-football_x.htm\">went the voiceover</a>. \u201cIt contains top-secret codes to launch a nuclear strike. Two presidents \u2013 one from each party \u2013 trusted a young marine named John Kline to safeguard it.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how key that ad was to his successful campaign, but it probably didn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>Aides who carry the nuclear football have extensive psychological evaluations to assess whether they\u2019re up to the task. Metzger discloses that he underwent extensive vetting by the Defense Department, the secret service and the FBI before he was given the job. The incoming president, whether it is Trump or Clinton, will undergo no such checks as to their mental stability. There is, though, one consoling thought. Even if Trump did nuke Europe, he\u2019d probably spare part of Aberdeenshire \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t want to destroy his golf resort.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2016.

  "<p>Going back through some of my long-ago columns to see if there was anything that needs saying again, I came across one that discussed what happens when a man and a woman achieve something together.</p> <p>I wrote that Bedford College in London used to have a brilliant reputation and only female students; when it admitted men it got a male principal. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/feb/13/women-national-newspapers\">Felicity Green</a>, the only woman director in Fleet Street, left IPC for Vidal Sassoon, it meant that with women making up half the readers and many contributors, the newspapers of Fleet Street had no women on boards at all.</p> <p>I wrote that it was not so much the inevitability of patriarchy that was the trouble, it\u2019s the way men cannot be stopped from finding other men more normal. I quoted Michael Korda, who said in his book <em>Success!</em> that it is usually attributed to the man; he also said that if a woman ever becomes president of the United States, it would suddenly be the vice president, if male, who would be considered really important.</p> <p>Well, maybe we shall see, if Hillary Clinton gets in, if he is right, but the good news is that nowadays it may not be so. Angela Merkel\u2019s actions and achievements are not attributed to anyone else in Germany or anywhere else, and it is Christine Lagarde who is known to run the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Women have always been allowed to be in charge of things that were for women only \u2013 convents, ladies\u2019 magazines, schools and, time was, nursing; but increasingly there\u2019s no knowing where women may be found running things, and no one ever suggested, did they, that there had to be a man telling Mrs Thatcher what to do? We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what advice our current prime minister accepts.</p> <p><strong>What do you think? Have your say below</strong></p>",
  "<p>On the eve of the Rio 2016 opening ceremony, the director of communications for the organising committee was holding forth in the lobby of the International Olympic Committee family hotel, from which one member would later be led by police investigating ticket touting. Asked if he had a message for those arriving in Rio for the Games, Mario Andrada half smiled and half sighed. \u201cBuckle up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride.\u201d</p> <p>A bit like the city of Rio de Janeiro itself, that ride has been by contradictory turns chaotic, uplifting, amusing, enchanting and enraging. But as far as the IOC president, Thomas Bach, was concerned, these Games have been an unalloyed triumph from start to finish.</p> <p>He did not appear to see empty seats in venues amid huge disparities between the claimed number of sales and those actually present. He did not worry at the waste of convoys of buses speeding along dedicated lanes, many of them virtually empty. Or the fact that cuts to the numbers of volunteers had appeared to leave those left exhausted and out on their feet. Or that those Brazilians and international fans who made it to the Olympic Park had missed the last metro by the time their events finished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/22/cheers-boos-and-a-carnival-atmosphere-as-flame-goes-out-on-rio-olympics\">Rio 2016: cheers, boos and a carnival atmosphere as Olympic flame goes out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet despite everything, by the end the excitement of the sporting action had permeated the heart of this city and at its climax every bar and restaurant was tuned to Brazil\u2019s progress in the volleyball, beach volleyball and \u2013 most of all \u2013 the football.</p> <p>But it felt like it was happening in spite of the IOC and the organisers rather than because of them.

Which might come as news to those who had been promised that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/01/grassroots-efforts-lead-the-clean-up-of-brazils-guanabara-bay\">Guanabara Bay would be cleaned up</a> but who will now find the temporary fix installed so that the world\u2019s sailors did not have to compete in foul, sewage-infested waters is swept away by the tide of effluent flowing back into the bay.</p> <p>He waxed lyrical about how it would leave a \u201cnew educational infrastructure\u201d because the handball arena will be turned into four schools. That will be scant reward for those more concerned about the deep-rooted public-funding crisis that is affecting not only schools and universities but also hospitals and other services.</p> <p>The most jaw-dropping moment in this broadcast from Planet Bach was when he claimed the Games had been arranged without a single Brazilian real of public subsidy. \u201cThere is no public money in the organisation of this Olympic Games,\u201d he said. Over the previous week it had become clear that the Paralympics, paid for out of the same budget as the Olympics, would not happen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/rio-paralympics-downsized-disappointing-ticket-sales\">without a substantial bailout from the public purse</a>. For Bach not to refer to that was hubris of the highest order. It also relied on the sleight of hand long employed by the IOC \u2013 separating the \u201coperational budget\u201d from the \u201cinfrastructural budget\u201d.</p> <p>In fairness, some long-overdue improvements to the public transport network have been willed into being by the fixed deadline of the Games. Whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/2016-olympics-games-metro-extension-delay\">$3bn metro extension</a> into the upmarket Barra stretch of condos and strip malls that housed the Olympic Park at its far end is the best use of that investment will become clear in time.</p> <p>Bach was most excited about the surge in social media traffic, in which he claimed that the main headlines were \u201cthe people\u2019s Games, the most happy Games ever, the beautiful Games, the passion Games\u201d.</p> <p>In George Orwell\u2019s 1984, Newspeak was the official language and blackwhite was a key concept within it. Orwell wrote: \u201cApplied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.</p> <p>\u201cThis demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/um-mundo-novo-the-olympic-rings-leave-rio-rustier-but-brighter\">Um Mundo Novo? The Olympic rings leave Rio, rustier but brighter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swap Party for the IOC and the basis on which the guardians of the five rings invent their own mythology as they go along becomes much clearer.</p> <p>Bach went on to prove the point further: \u201cIt\u2019s also a Games in the middle of reality. This Games has not been organised in a bubble.\u201d In all honesty, the opposite is true.</p> <p>The blame for some of the pressures that have threatened to tear at the fabric of these Olympics can be laid squarely at the door of the IOC. Others were the fault of the vainglorious Brazilian politicians determined to add the ultimate seal of international approval to their story of economic growth by hosting the World Cup and Olympics back to back.</p> <p>It is true to say that Brazil has been assailed by an economic and political hurricane since winning, in 2009, the right to host the Games, on a wave of optimism as one of the emerging Bric \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China \u2013 powerhouses.</p> <p>Fifa and the IOC have been keen over recent decades to spread the gospel into new territories, largely for commercial reasons. But in doing so they have sought to take all of the upside and leave nothing behind.</p> <p>The IOC in particular has legions of working groups and committees dedicated to sustainability. In the run-up to the London Olympics there was much talk about a \u201ccompact\u201d Games. Bach was elected on the back of his Agenda 2020 reform plan.</p> <p>But it is largely just talk. The reality is that the IOC is committed to crowd-source decisions from its peculiar membership of minor royals, former athletes and slick sports politicians who play to their own vanity.</p> <p>It is right that major sporting festivals such as the Olympics should be taken to all corners of the world. But it should be done on a scale that is sensible and in a way that leaves lasting benefit. Instead, even as it was assailed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/russia-doping-scandal\">Russian doping crisis</a> on the eve of the Games the IOC voted to add five sports to the schedule for 2020; it is accelerating endlessly towards gigantism.</p> <p>Even the crowds coming out of the feelgood fillip of the packed finals of the beach volleyball on Copacabana were a reminder of the corporatism that is hardwired into the Games. As they streamed out, many started scanning for the helpers holding lollipop signs bearing the names of sponsors that would lead them back to their hotels.</p> <p>In a sane world Rio might be, in its own way, a reminder that the Olympics need not be a cookie-cutter experience, that it should embrace different parts of the world and that staging it need not mean bankrupting a state. The rough edges were in some way pleasing, a reminder that the Games has got too fat.</p> <p>It could be a signal that there is a better, lower-key, more affordable (for hosts and for spectators), more sustainable way of staging the Olympics that leaves behind a genuine legacy rather than just saying it will.</p> <p>Instead, the logistical difficulties involved \u2013 and the temerity of the Brazilian police in targeting the ticketing arrangements of some of its members \u2013 are more likely to have made this self-aggrandising \u201cmovement\u201d revert to type and start looking up five-star establishments in Tokyo and, beyond that, in Hollywood or Paris.</p>",

Asked about whether those specifics included a \u201cdeportation force\u201d, Conway replied: \u201cTo be determined.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/donald-trump-troll\">'If you fight fire with fire, everyone burns': how to catch a troll like Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The firing of Trump\u2019s former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, was in part motivated by the businessman\u2019s steep fall in the polls in August.

Since the new leadership was installed, he has limited his improvisation and largely read off teleprompters \u2013 again raising the hopes of party members that the candidate might discover discipline.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s shown maturity as a candidate,\u201d the Republican party chairman, Reince Priebus, told ABC on Sunday. \u201cI think he likes the new style that he\u2019s been out on the campaign trail producing.\u201d</p> <p>That \u201cnew style\u201d included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">a declaration of regret that approached an apology</a>, but Conway refused to say to whom, or about what, Trump was apologizing.

Americans, Priebus said, \u201cwant that product that Donald Trump presents. They also want to know that it\u2019s going to be a safe product.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has not completely kept to his new, more courteous script.

  "<p>In a country that loves its <a href=\"http://www.destinyconnect.com/2015/07/16/reality-shows-hit-sa-tv-audiences/0\"> reality shows</a>, a very public competition is attracting record audiences. It does not involve a wedding or a singing child; there is no dancing and no mascara. There is, however, a celebrity: Thuli Madonsela.</p> <p>Appointed as South Africa\u2019s constitutionally mandated public ombudsman \u2013 officially known as the public protector \u2013 in 2009, Madonsela has become one of the country\u2019s best loved and most admired figures. But her seven-year non-renewable term will expire within weeks, and the South African parliament will choose her replacement next week. The search for candidates has gripped the nation.</p> <p>Parliamentary hearings have received blanket coverage. Supposed revelations about those hoping to replace Madonsela have made front pages. \u201cWho will protect us?\u201d ran one headline in the Sunday Times newspaper.</p> <p>Established at the end of the apartheid era by South Africa\u2019s new constitution, the role of public protector carries extensive powers to hold politicians, officials and others to account on behalf of the weak, poor, ignorant or simply angry.</p> <p>Political analysts in South Africa, where elected and unelected officials are routinely accused of corruption and other abuses, say the appointment is one of the most important decisions that MPs make.</p> <p>\u201cThe stakes are really very high. It is the person who fills the office which is important, not the office itself,\u201d said Gareth Evans, a governance expert at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria. </p> <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-south-africas-public-protector-has-set-a-high-bar-for-her-successor-63891 \">Penelope Andrews</a>, a respected South African legal scholar, described the office of the public protector as \u201cthe barometer of the state of South Africa\u2019s constitutional democracy\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/south-africans-deliver-stinging-rebuke-to-anc\">Voters deliver stinging rebuke to ANC in South African election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Commentators point out that the office is one of the few that commands public confidence, and it is seen as independent of the ruling African National Congress.</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-18-from-14-to-five-here-are-the-shortlisted-candidates-for-the-public-protector-job\"> longlist of candidates</a> included Madonsela\u2019s deputy, two high court judges, a 77-year old-lawyer and amateur bodybuilder, a prosecutor and an activist. The list has now been whittled down to five. </p> <p>Whoever takes up the post will have a hard act to follow. Facebook fan pages call Madonsela <a href=\"http://%20http//www.sapeople.com/2014/03/22/most-popular-person-south-africa-thuli-madonsela-663/\">the new Nelson Mandela</a> and there have been widespread calls for her to stand for president. She has received dozens of awards from around the world.</p> <p>So softly spoken that at press conferences reporters crowd the front-row seats to better hear her, Madonsela has shown extraordinary, some say foolhardy, commitment to her brief to investigate government misconduct.</p> <p>Her highest-profile investigation was into state expenditure on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/jacob-zuma-accused-corruption-south-africa\">President Jacob Zuma\u2019s home</a>. Under immense pressure from the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the government, Madonsela found that public funds had been misused. She read her entire 448-page report aloud in a televised press conference, and her conclusions sparked a constitutional crisis, pitting her office against that of the president. She won.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eac884b9a67c9da21d69ee96bc98b9a3665b31c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eac884b9a67c9da21d69ee96bc98b9a3665b31c/0_196_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Zuma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Zuma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Macdougall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been abuse \u2013 one ANC official accused Madonsela of being a US spy \u2013 and even death threats. Madonesela remained unfazed through it all, though she admits now that \u201cthe politics\u201d was the most challenging part of her job.</p> <p>\u201cThere were smear campaigns, starting from 2011, but it was not a systemic, structural thing. It was oddballs,\u201d she said in an interview with the Guardian this summer.</p> <p>One recent inquiry focuses on allegations of improper relations between the president and the Gupta family, who are among South Africa\u2019s wealthiest businessmen. Both Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing or impropriety. </p> <p>Such highly sensitive ongoing investigations explain some of the intense interest in the post among South Africa\u2019s political elite \u2013 and among a public that, as demonstrated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/south-africans-deliver-stinging-rebuke-to-anc\">municipal elections this month</a>, increasingly views the ANC as corrupt and incompetent. The new office holder cannot simply close the inquiry, but can soft-pedal it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen it repeatedly over the years. It\u2019s very easy to undermine an investigation,\u201d said Evans. </p> <p>Many have wondered at the source of Madonsela\u2019s steely determination. She grew up in a small home without water or electricity in the Johannesburg township of Soweto during some of the darkest days of apartheid, sleeping on the floor of the family\u2019s tiny kitchen with six siblings. </p> <p>She won bursaries to fund her schooling and defied her father to study law at a top university. In 1994 she turned down a scholarship at Harvard to help draft South Africa\u2019s new constitution, which is admired around the world for its liberal principles. She then worked in the justice department, before setting up her own legal firm specialising in human rights, gender and constitutional law.</p> <p>Madonsela remembers how Zuma told her to \u201cshow no fear or favour\u201d when she was appointed, and described to her how previous public protectors had helped him before he became president. </p> <p>She resigned her longstanding ANC membership to avoid any conflicts of interest, and found a friend who was chair of the electoral commission \u201cguilty of gross maladministration\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/anc-elections-south-africa-democracy-zuma\">South Africa has broken the post-colonial narrative. It\u2019s a thrilling turning point | Justice Malala</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then came the investigation into spending on the president\u2019s sprawling home in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Zuma initially refused Madonsela\u2019s recommendation that he pay back part of the cash, but later agreed to do so. </p> <p>Madonsela, 53, who heads a team of more than 400, said the highlights of her term had been the hundreds of cases that never made it into the mainstream media. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been the men or women who have no means to hire a lawyer, who we can enable through our ability \u2026 to speak as an equal to those with power and [so] obtain a measure of justice,\u201d she said in the interview.</p> <p>Typical, she said, was an old man who had not been paid by local government officials and had lost his business and home as a result. \u201cThe average office holder works with me and my team with the utmost respect and co-operation. The politics have been dreadful but an aberration not the norm.\u201d </p> <p>The raised profile of the office will bolster its independence in the future, campaigners say. An obviously partisan political choice would cause a public outcry, and potentially a legal challenge.</p> <p>\u201cThuli set a very high bar \u2026 so the whole process is being scrutinised very closely,\u201d said David Lewis, of the Johannesburg-based campaign group Corruption Watch. </p> <p>Madonesela can now look forward to a quieter life. \u201cI will take a sabbatical and I will be writing and studying. Then I\u2019ll go back to my legal practice and being an activist in civil society for constitutionalism, rule of law and social justice,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been more rewarding than tiring. We receive more than our fair share of criticism and harassment but equally much support and more than our fair share of praise. Above all, we can see the difference we make.\u201d</p>"
