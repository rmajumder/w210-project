  "<p>After tomorrow\u2019s US election, whoever emerges as the winner will inherit an economy in a much better state than the one Barack Obama took control of eight years ago. But a number of issues remain \u2013 not the least being that if history is any guide, the winner will have to deal with a recession.</p> <p>Fortunately it seems most likely that Hillary Clinton will win the election tomorrow. And clearly her winning would be better for the US (and world) economy. While you can debate about the worthiness of Clinton\u2019s tax and economic plans, it\u2019s pretty clear that in Trump the USA would have an historically corrupt, incompetent and erratic president \u2013 not something you want when the office involves nuclear weapons and oversight of an economy of around 150 million jobs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/nov/07/investors-fear-president-donald-trump-economy-volatility-recession\">Analysts fear 'volatile' economy \u2013 and perhaps recession \u2013 under Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With that caveat, let us look ahead to what the new president will have to deal with.</p> <p>Firstly those who champion the Obama presidency most generally look at the unemployment rate. At 4.9% it is well below the 7.8% it was in January 2008, when Obama took the oath of office, and half the 10% peak reached later that year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XJf0L/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But, as in Australia, the US unemployment rate hides some important details \u2013 including the decline in the participation rate. </p> <p>In February 2008, when the US unemployment rate was also 4.9%, the participation rate (the percentage of adults either working or looking for work) was 66%; now it is 62.8%.</p> <p>The impact of this can be seen in the employment to population ratio. While the unemployment situation is now back roughly where it was prior to the GFC, the level of the US population employed remains worse \u2013 indeed it is worse than it was when Obama became president:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA employment to population ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uzRUL/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But it is not all bad news. A major cause of the decline is not a weaker economy, but (again, as in Australia) an ageing population. </p> <p>While the overall level of the adult population in the US who are employed is worse now than in January 2008, the proportion of 25-54 year olds is actually higher (though still below the pre-GFC high):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA employment to population ratio changes (Jan 2007=100)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kww9f/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Obama government (and the Clinton campaign) has also made great note of the fact that employment in the USA has now grown for 73 straight months \u2013 a post WWII record. </p> <p>But that record hides that the level of growth has been weaker than in other similar recoveries. While there has been now six years of employment growth, all up that has only seen 11% more employed in that time \u2013 well below the six year peak growth of 16% observed under Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, or the 21% during the Reagan-Bush years, let alone the massive growth of the 1960s:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA 6 year employment growth (non-farm)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eVYLo/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The employment growth also points to a big issue for the next president \u2013 one that has been a key issue of the election \u2013 the hollowing of the middle class.</p> <p>As in most nations, education is a key determinant of employment in the USA. </p> <p>While the overall unemployment rate is currently 4.9%, for those with a bachelor degree or higher it is just 2.6%. For those with some college education, or an associate diploma, the rate is 3.8%. The rate for those who only have a high school diploma is 5.5%, while it is 7.3% for those who didn\u2019t even finish high school.</p> <p>So the situation is better the more educated you are. But in the past four years something odd has occurred. The proportion of people without a high school diploma who have a job has increased \u2013 to the point where it is now back to the level it was prior to the GFC. But the proportion of those employed at all other levels of education remains worse than in the past:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA employment to population ratio by education (Jan 07=100)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/anPQs/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"440\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So there has been a bit of a boom for the lowest paying jobs and jobs for workers with high levels of education faired best through the GFC. But for those in the middle have fared the worst. </p> <p>Not surprisingly then, despite the ongoing employment growth, wages in America are growing poorly \u2013 it\u2019s now nearly five years since average earnings grew by more than 3% in any 12 month period:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA average weekly earnings - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FuYpL/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So to an extent the issues of the USA economy are of a kind with Australia \u2013 ongoing but weak employment growth, weak wages growth, and an ageing population.</p> <p>But there is another wrinkle for the new president. </p> <p>Since world war two, the USA has had 11 recessions, and in the past 40 years there were five recessions in 1980, 1981-82, 1990, 2000 and 2007-09:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA Annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YkxSX/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The next presidential term ends in 2020. By then it will have been 11 years since the end of the \u201cgreat recession\u201d \u2013 well within the usual time frame for another recession. </p> <p>Right at this moment a recession isn\u2019t on the cards. The US economy is improving just enough that the US Federal Reserve is even thinking about raising interest rates. But if the next president gets through the term without experiencing a recession it will have been quite an achievement.</p> <p>While economic issues will be ever present, as ever politics will do its best to make things just that bit worse. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/the-big-con-what-is-really-at-stake-on-election-day\">The Big Con: what is really at stake in this US election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both candidates have economic plans that would increase the US government debt. Clinton\u2019s would <a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">increase it by</a> US$200bn over the next decade, Trump\u2019s would increase it by US$5,300bn. Yep, five trillion dollars \u2013 almost all through tax cuts. </p> <p>Although Clinton\u2019s plan does not add as much to the debt, that won\u2019t save her from a major political fight over the issue.</p> <p>Last year, as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/30/us-budget-deal-close-to-passing-through-senate\">the deal to stop the government shutdown</a>, Obama and the Republican party agreed to extend the government\u2019s borrowing authority until 15 March 2017 \u2013 just over a month after inauguration day. </p> <p>It means one of the first issues a Clinton presidency would have to deal with is a Republican party congress threatening to shut down the government. </p> <p>Given how much emphasis the USA puts on the first 100 days of the presidency, you can bet the Republican party will do its best to make life awful for President Clinton \u2013 regardless of the impact such moves might have on the economy. </p>",

Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania will determine who wins the White House.</p> <p>And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here\u2019s a flavour of our latest news story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination battles began \u2013 in the rustbelt \u2013 as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the country\u2019s deep economic divide. </p> <p>Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright.<br></p> <p>Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen....<br></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-turnout-latino-vote\">Clinton campaign buoyed by high Latino turnout in election's final hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u2019ll be back in the morning with more market action.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president.</p> <p>Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c27e4b029b92ca464fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:23:59.316Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Monday has proceeded in a way eerily similar to the scenes before the Brexit back in June. In the run-up to the referendum the markets saw a last minute surge as investors prepared to Britain to remain in the EU, only to suffer a shock when the votes were counted.</p> <p>The market has a bit more time to steady itself before the results of the election are announced;

In Texas, second- and third-generation Mexican immigrants unite with educated white voters, including a lot of moderate Republicans, to deliver the first Democratic presidential victory in the Lone Star state since Watergate. </p> <p>Clinton even beats Trump in Utah, where pious Mormon voters decide at the moment of truth that no, they cannot vote for a candidate who wants to \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. Republican leaders get on TV the day after the election and declare that the nomination of Trump was a historic mistake. Thousands of words are spilled haranguing Republicans for nominating a candidate whose appeal to the base may have been strong but who obviously was not a serious contender to lead so great and diverse a nation. Final electoral tally:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"374ae1dc62982edea264e70f697acde8e3e78219\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/374ae1dc62982edea264e70f697acde8e3e78219/0_0_1290_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral scenario map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"845\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2> The Trump Bank Shot</h2> <p>In which Trump wins the 270 electoral college votes he needs to grab the keys to the White House with a surprise victory in the upper midwest, despite failing to convert in the more familiar battleground states of Nevada, Colorado, Virginia and Pennsylvania. </p> <p>In this squeaker scenario, Trump owes his electoral life to white voters \u2013 especially rural white voters. As the night grows late, Trump realizes that he has lost Nevada and Colorado, owing to a strong Hispanic vote against him both places. He has lost Virginia because there are too many people in the DC suburbs who have some actual experience of the federal government and who are horrified to their teeth at the idea of his taking the White House. Surprisingly strong turnout among Trump supporters in the white working-class communities of Pennsylvania has failed to push Trump over the Democratic wall of Philadelphia and its suburbs. But Trump has performed strongly all night in the battleground states that count, winning Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. </p> <p>And then, luck strikes: Trump picks up a single electoral vote in northern, rural Maine, one of two states that split their electoral votes. Finally, against all odds and the predictions of most polls, he pulls off an upset win in Wisconsin, which has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1988, but which is more homogeneously white than its neighboring states, where Hillary Clinton ends up having failed to inspire African American voters in Milwaukee to turn up on election day, and where Republican governor Scott Walker\u2019s political machine has once again succeeded.

Clinton has had some nice, expected victories over the course of the evening, bagging Pennsylvania and Virginia and the states she was supposed to win in the upper midwest, and seeing all the talk of a strong early vote for Democrats in Nevada come true. The people who were supposed to vote for her are voting for her \u2013 women, nonwhite voters, educated white voters \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason she won\u2019t win. But the night has been interrupted, over and over, by signals that have made Democratic eyes twitch. First, the independent voters of New Hampshire have responded to Trump\u2019s late-race momentum, and concluded that no, they\u2019d really rather not have a Clinton dynasty in American politics. They give Trump four electoral votes. Then Trump wins North Carolina, where there admittedly are plenty of white Republican voters, where Republican efforts to quash voting have succeeded and, let\u2019s be honest, if Barack Obama lost it in 2012, how was Hillary Clinton supposed to win it? </p> <p>It gets really white-knuckle, however, when the Colorado result comes in. A large share of voters in Denver\u2019s suburbs are registered independents, and maybe they\u2019ve had the same kind of feeling New Hampshirites have had: enough with the Clintons. So Clinton stalls out at 266 electoral votes. Trump gets to 243. And all eyes are on Florida. Nonwhite voters in Miami haven\u2019t turned up at the polls as they might have. Meanwhile, turnout among white voters in retirement communities has proven absolutely crushing. The Puerto Rican vote around Orlando seems to have failed to materialize. And they\u2019re still counting Tampa and St Petersburg. Then final results in Broward County, where Obama won by more than 260,000 votes in 2012, come in, and the state is clearly Clinton\u2019s. Trump cries foul but nobody can hear him through the cacophony of popping corks. Final tally: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b09f3324a08ce78d443a29709ced03359441a1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b09f3324a08ce78d443a29709ced03359441a1f/0_0_1290_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral scenario map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"845\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>The Al Gore</h2> <p>In which America gets the constitutional crisis implicitly promised the moment Donald Trump, who has been involved in more than 4,095 lawsuits, according to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-lawsuits/\">one analysis</a>, set foot on his golden escalator. The election turns out to be close \u2013 closer than anyone would have thought. Maybe Trump wins New Hampshire and makes a sweep of the other battleground states, save Colorado, to produce a 269-269 electoral vote tie. Or maybe Florida, which even in the relatively placid year of 2012 took four days to report its election result, comes down to a razor-thin margin like the one that separated Al Gore and George Bush in 2000, resulting in recounts, fights over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-lieberman-put-democrats-in-retreat-on-military-vote.html\">absentee ballot postmarks</a>, a refusal to concede on either side and, ultimately, the mother of all legal battles. </p> <p>The 2016 election cycle has proven its ability to soar beyond the human imagination, and surely no mere mortal can comprehend how hairy things could get. The most horrible scenarios appear to lie down the path of an electoral tie. What happens then? Nobody really knows. While the constitution prescribes that Congress shall step in to resolve such a tie, and while <a href=\"http://www.leinsdorf.com/House.htm\">a couple of early 19th-century elections</a> were close enough for Congress to get involved, there really are no applicable precedents. Since presidents are technically chosen by electors who meet to cast formal votes in December, it is conceivable that a so-called \u201cfaithless elector\u201d might break a tie in favor of, say, Clinton, by going against the will of his or her state\u2019s voters. But then Congress must formally count the ballots in January, and if but one senator and one representative disagree with the result, each chamber must vote on the validity of the count. You see where this is going. This is a Congress that cannot so much as tie its shoes, much less leap constitutional hurdles. </p> <p>Would a result ever emerge on the other side? Would the supreme court get involved, again? (When they\u2019re still one justice down? What if they tied, too?) Who would ultimately prove more litigious, Trump or the Clintons? Eesh. Some bridges are better left uncrossed until necessary. Final tally: pass the Scotch. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e459878d2c40f95f315a274eda07c9ad86ac68b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e459878d2c40f95f315a274eda07c9ad86ac68b1/0_0_1290_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral scenario map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"845\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>The Make America Great Again</h2> <p>Britain Brexited. The Cubs won the World Series. And guess what? These things happen in threes. It\u2019s 2016. The age you thought you were living in is yesterday. This is the age of reality television, the era of entertainment uber alles, the time of Trump. And any fool not foolishly attached to her or his notions of the false-glorious yesterday could see it coming. American voters unbothered by the worst of what Trump had to say simply voted for him. But millions of additional voters \u2013 suburban moms, second-generation immigrants who have already paid their dues, Republicans who came to their senses, and men everywhere \u2013 found that when they stepped into the polling booth, they either couldn\u2019t check the box for a relic of America\u2019s political past \u2013 a woman, no less \u2013 or they weren\u2019t as bothered by Trump\u2019s words, and by the actions of his supporters, as they thought. After all, he\u2019s not serious about wanting to deport millions of American residents, just as he wasn\u2019t serious when he said what he did about women, wasn\u2019t serious when he impugned American democracy, wasn\u2019t serious when he said Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were terrorists, wasn\u2019t serious when he called for a nuclear Saudi Arabia and wasn\u2019t serious when he said journalists should be silenced and when he said, over and over, that Hillary Clinton should be in prison. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s big night begins in New Hampshire, continues shortly thereafter in Virginia and North Carolina, rolls through Iowa and Ohio and then \u2013 earlier than anyone could have thought \u2013 through Florida, where he maintains a second home. Nobody can believe it when Trump wins Pennsylvania \u2013 it turns out that African American voters in Philadelphia stayed home, and a surprising number of centrists in the Philly suburbs decided that no candidate who loved golf so much could be so bad. Trump wins Colorado, maybe misses in Nevada and misses in the upper midwest \u2013 but by then he\u2019s over 300 electoral votes, so who cares? Hang the White House with a big gold T, and brace yourselves for whatever may be.

But he told the Conservative <strong>Nicky Morgan</strong> that, although he could not agree to her proposal for an early vote on a one-line article 50 bill, he was \u201cvery tempted\u201d by the idea. And when <strong>Peter Bone</strong>, a Conservative, said the government should just hold a vote on a resolution backing triggering article 50, Davis said that the government was not proposing that, but that the Commons itself could decide to have a vote. He also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers generally, not least because they cover decisions like going to war.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50, the supreme court ruling could say something different.</strong> He was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article 50, or whether just passing a resolution (a quicker, easier process) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme court.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the independence of the judiciary, although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 50 ruling. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of pillars of our democracy, one of them is the independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for centuries, and one of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after centuries.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said some of the online trolls who have attacked Gina Miller, the woman who brought the article 50 case, should be prosecuted.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me comment on the issue of Gina Miller.

It needed to work out its stance, he says.</p> <p>He says the government thinks it can trigger article 50 using prerogative powers.</p> <p>But the high court came to a different view, he says.</p> <p>He says the court took the view that the government cannot use prerogative powers to change the law of the land without using legislation. And it decided that the effect of leaving the EU would be to take away rights created by the European Communities Act 1972, he says.</p> <p>He says the government values the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press.</p> <p>The government still thinks triggering article 50 is a matter for the government using prerogative powers.

He told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have accepted the mandate. There was a clear mandate on 23 June to leave the EU. Article 50 triggers that process, and therefore we are not going to frustrate that. But we are going to argue very loudly and very strongly for the government to disclose its plan so that we can debate it and try to reach agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if there were any circumstances in which Labour would vote against triggering article 50, he replied: \u201cWe are not going to frustrate the process.\u201d Was that a no, he was asked. \u201cYes\u201d, he replied.</p> <p>But he also confirmed that Labour might try to amend the legislation allowing the government to trigger article 50.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it is legislation, then of course there might be amendments put down.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he gave some indication as to what those amendments might cover. This is what he said when asked about possible amendments.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are clear that we need the fullest possible access to the single market, that we should be in the customs union, and that there should be special arrangements for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because, in two respects, it goes further than <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-gives-theresa-ultimatum-9204393\">by Jeremy Corbyn in his Sunday Mirror interview</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-position-tom-watson-article-50-brexit-a7400976.html\">by Tom Watson in his Radio 5 Live interview yesterday.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer says Labour wants UK to stay in customs union.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says the Brexit deal should include special arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Starmer\u2019s comments about not blocking an article 50 bill imply that, if Labour\u2019s amendments on, for example, the customs union were voted down by the government, it would not vote against the bill as a whole at third reading.<br></p> <p>But his words are also an open invitation to Tory MPs who favour a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit to vote with Labour in favour, for example, of an amendment saying that staying in the customs union should be a priority.</p> <p>Starmer also said in his interview that Labour accepted that the Brexit talks would have to involve some curbs on freedom of movement. But he suggesting that protecting the economy was more important than controlling immigration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I accept also that freedom of movement, and changes to the way freedom of movement rules operate, have to be part of the negotiation. What I want is for the government to aim high, to put the economy and jobs first, of course to negotiate on freedom of movement, and get the best possible outcome. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer suggests protecting the economy more important than curbing immigration in Brexit talks.</strong></li> </ul> <p>This is significant because over the summer Theresa May indicated that, for her, controlling immigration was the number one Brexit priority (although recent comments from the government, perhaps influenced by the economic impact assessments ministers have been reading, suggest that business interests are increasingly seen as pre-eminent.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd7e2c3f499693301a553e9de0deb1a475d7b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd7e2c3f499693301a553e9de0deb1a475d7b35/59_0_707_424/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Keir Starmer.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Keir Starmer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58205dfbe4b029b92ca463d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T10:57:17.267Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are two statements in the Commons this afternoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/795576345162027009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2 statements from 3.30pm - your guess is as good as ours on actual titles 1.

He has identified three.</p> <p>First, the UK government should have been more ambitious.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First: we under-bid. In fact, though we had plenty of media and party political tactics, we went into the talks without a sufficiently clear strategy for change in Europe. Cameron\u2019s brilliant 2013 Bloomberg speech \u2013 envisioning sweeping EU reform (but not mentioning immigration ironically) \u2013 was incrementally distilled down to a less ambitious opening bid in the renegotiation. Even some European leaders suggested more ambition. As one diplomat put it, \u201cIn Europe, we ask for 10 things in order to get 6, you ask for 4 things to get 4. Why?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Second, the politicians gave officials too much power.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The second mistake: we outsourced political decisions to UK and EU civil servants, who, naturally, are more cautious about what\u2019s achievable. Between June and mid-autumn 2015, the most substantive discussions were conducted between officials from the UK, European Commission and European Council. These \u201ctechnical talks\u201d were meant to be purely legal but were in reality at least in part political, with options effectively being taken off the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, third, the government ran out of time.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The third mistake: we got timed out. European partners knew we were very unlikely to walk away from the table at the EU summit in February this year as that would kill a June vote. That self-imposed deadline hurt our leverage.</p> <p>The two year time-table contained in Article 50 is, arguably, the government\u2019s biggest challenge in achieving a successful Brexit.

The article was headlined \u201cJeremy Corbyn gives Theresa May ultimatum: Agree to Labour\u2019s Brexit terms or I\u2019ll force election in spring\u201d, although Corbyn\u2019s own quotes did not put it as starkly as that.</p> <p>Then yesterday <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-position-tom-watson-article-50-brexit-a7400976.html\">Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, seemed to give a different messsage when he appeared on Radio 5 Live. </a>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hold this up. The British people have spoken and article 50 will be triggered when it comes to Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>This morning Starmer was on the Today programme. Broadly he was taking the Watson view, saying at least twice that Labour would \u201cnot frustrate the [article 50] process\u201d. But he also said four times that Labour would \u201cnot simply vote down article 50\u201d, implying its support for article 50 was conditional, and that it would only back triggering article 50 if the government gave certain assurances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course we must have discussions about [the terms of Brexit]. We can\u2019t have a vote in a vacuum. And we can\u2019t proceed with this approach where the prime minister says I hold all the cards for the future of the UK in Europe, and its relationship with Europe, and indeed the world, and I\u2019m not going to disclose even the basic terms to parliament. So of course we need that discussion.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when Starmer was pressed on this, he did at one point say Labour would \u201cnot vote down article 50\u201d without including the word \u201csimply\u201d. He also said Labour would not vote down article 50 \u201ccome what may\u201d (ie, under any circumstances).</p> <p>He said Labour wanted the government to set out its plans for Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to have the plan before parliament. That needs to be subject to scrutiny ... This is the future of all of us, and the future of our children. We should be proceeding on the basis of a consensus across parliament, not forced divisions. </p> </blockquote> <p>But he left it unclear what Labour might do if the government failed to proved it with the assurances it is seeking. He ruled out blocking article 50 completely, but he did not rule out using the legislation that will have to go through parliament (assuming the government loses its case in the supreme court) to attach some sort of conditions to article 50 approval.</p> <p>I will be covering any reaction to his interview that comes in.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>1.45pm:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, visits the University of Sheffield, where she will later deliver a lecture on \u201cScotland and the UK: economic policy after the EU referendum\u201d.</p> <p><em>3.30pm: </em>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is expected to give a Commons statement about the high court ruling last week saying parliament must be consulted on triggering article 50.</p> <p><em>Around 4.30pm: </em>MPs are due to begin a debate on exiting the EU and workers\u2019 rights, the first of several debates being scheduled by the government ahead of article 50 being invoked.

Surveying the crowds of thousands who have packed into gymnasiums, outdoor parks and concert halls, often queuing up hours in advance, Clinton has sought to ease the concerns of a disenchanted electorate.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have some work to do to bring about healing and reconciliation after this election,\u201d she told voters in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Sunday evening.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5azaz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2871825\"            data-video-name=\"'Vote for someone who cares': Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581d7fc2e4b0d073c27d1b2e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\">\u2018Vote for someone who cares\u2019: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The forward-looking sentiment is in some ways a testament to a confidence on Clinton\u2019s part that, despite the narrowing of the polls, victory is in sight. But cautious optimism is a better reflection of the mood projected by both the candidate and her campaign.</p> <p>Turnout still holds the key to Clinton\u2019s path to victory. Early voting returns favor the former secretary of state, with Democrats outpacing Republicans in the swing states whose electoral votes Clinton must secure to reach the 270 that will propel her to the presidency.</p> <p>And so she has lately dispensed with her usual stump speech, choosing instead to lean heavily on the logistics of how the thousands of voters standing before her can translate their enthusiasm into action. There is a number they can text or a website they can visit, Clinton says, that will provide them with the information they need to register to vote or find the nearest polling location.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going to work until the last vote is counted,\u201d Clinton told reporters prior to departure on Monday.</p> <p>Her campaign has been bolstered by its ground game \u2013 the product of her team\u2019s early and consistent investment in a vast infrastructure that in Florida alone spans 81 field offices. This weekend, volunteers in the battleground states made nearly 14.5m voter-to-voter contacts, the campaign said, comprising 6.2m door-knocks and 8.1m phone calls.</p> <p>A memo distributed by Clinton\u2019s campaign on Monday emphasized a strong turnout among Latinos and African Americans, both core constituencies of the Democratic party. In Florida, more than one million Hispanics voted early, roughly double the number who did so in 2012, the report said. And in North Carolina, where Democrats were apprehensive about enthusiasm among black voters, a spike in recent days meant nearly the same number of African Americans had cast their ballots early as did so four years ago.</p> <p>What remains unknown, however, is the impact of FBI director James Comey\u2019s decision to reopen the issue of her private email server a week and a half ago \u2013 and then just as suddenly attempt to resolve the matter on Sunday with a statement once again clearing her of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">criminal wrongdoing</a>.</p> <p>Spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said the campaign was \u201cglad that the matter is resolved\u201d, but Clinton herself has not mentioned the latest developments. Her campaign manager lamented over the weekend that the renewed controversy had distracted from Clinton\u2019s message, but downplayed its impact on the polls.</p> <p>A palpable anxiety was nonetheless evident on the faces of many who had braved the crisp fall weather to get a glimpse of Clinton as she concluded her journey. Clutching campaign signs bearing one of Clinton\u2019s slogans, \u201cLove trumps hate\u201d, they jeered at the mention of her opponent\u2019s name. The Democratic candidate has rewarded them with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/hillary-clinton-celebrity-support-election-2016\">bevy of celebrity performers</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/im-with-her-beyonce-and-jay-z-back-hillary-clinton-in-battleground-state-of-ohio\">Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z</a> to Katy Perry and James Taylor; Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi will perform at her rally in Philadelphia on Monday night.</p> <p>In Manchester on Sunday, Clinton took the stage with a figure who has become well-known for a very different reason. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/khizr-khan-trump-virginia-campaign-hillary-clinton\">Khizr Khan</a> became an overnight celebrity when he delivered a stirring speech at the Democratic national convention in July, holding up a copy of his pocket constitution and memorably telling Donald Trump: \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one.\u201d Trump went on to attack him and his wife in racially inflected terms. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/supposed-vote-hillary-clinton-woman-why-i-wont\">I'm supposed to vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a woman.

  "<p>Janet Reno, who has died aged 78, was the first woman attorney general of the US. Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1991, she served throughout his two terms of office, the second longest tenure in American history. It made her a figure of stability in a cabinet often in flux and frequently rocked by the steady stream of partisan attacks on both President Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Clinton, most notably the Whitewater investigation.</p> <p>Never part of Clinton\u2019s inner circle, Reno displayed great independence, and her courage to stand behind decisions she felt were right often left her vulnerable to critics from both sides of the political fence. Her controversial decisions included the assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas; the return of the six-year-old Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez to Cuba; the anti-monopoly prosecution of Microsoft and a racketeering lawsuit against the tobacco industry to recover the healthcare costs of treating smokers. Each time she would stand behind her actions publicly, often quoting Harry Truman\u2019s \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Miami, she was the daughter of two of the city\u2019s journalists. Her father, born Henry Rasmussen, came to the US as a child from Denmark; his parents reportedly chose the more American name Reno from a map. He worked as a crime reporter on the Miami Herald for 43 years. Her mother, Jane Wood, was a reporter on the Miami News, and a naturalist famed locally for wrestling alligators. When Janet was eight and she and her three siblings moved to a home on the edge of the Everglades, her mother built their new house herself.</p> <p>Janet was debate champion at Coral Gables high school and left Cornell University in 1960 with a degree in chemistry; commentators sometimes noted her almost scientific approach to both the law and to the facts of a case. She graduated from Harvard law school in 1963, one of only 16 women in her class, but when she returned to Miami she was turned down by the city\u2019s most prestigious firm, Steel Hector &amp; Davis. After opening her own firm, in 1971 she was appointed counsel to the Florida state house of representatives\u2019 judicial committee and, in 1972, she lost in a race for a state house seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54261e91884b88f036ea4a1a34c0150089e44f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54261e91884b88f036ea4a1a34c0150089e44f7c/0_26_1005_603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Reno with Bill Clinton as she is named the new attorney general during a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janet Reno with Bill Clinton as she is named the new attorney general during a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But she was offered a job by R<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/us/richard-e-gerstein-dead-at-68-prosecuted-key-watergate-figure.html\">ichard Gerstein</a>, the state attorney for Dade County, which includes Miami. She informed Gerstein that her father thought he was a crook; he replied that that was why she had been offered the job. Although she left the office briefly in 1976, when offered a partnership by the same firm who had rejected her 13 years earlier, she returned, and when Gerstein retired she was appointed to his job, a difficult one given Miami\u2019s high crime rate and racial conflicts.</p> <p>She prosecuted a number of high-profile child abuse cases where doubts over convictions led to changes in the ways such cases were handled. Most tellingly, she brought charges against five white policemen for beating a black insurance salesman to death. Their acquittal in 1980 (by a judge and jury in Tampa) sparked rioting in Miami during which 18 people died. Reno resisted calls for her resignation, instead working for improved relations with the black community.</p> <p>Bill Clinton offered Reno the attorney general\u2019s post after his first two choices, Zo\u00eb Baird and Kimba Wood, both withdrew because they had hired undocumented immigrants as nannies.</p> <p>Before she had taken office in 1993, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-david-koresh-1457125.html\">David Koresh</a> and his Branch Davidian sect of the Seventh Day Adventist church began a showdown against federal agents seeking to search their Waco compound for illegal weapons. Ten people, including four agents from the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were killed when they tried to serve a warrant in Feburary. In April, Reno ordered a full-scale assault on the compound in which Koresh and 75 other people, many of them children, died. She was criticised fiercely by the right, for murdering American \u201cpatriots\u201d, and by the left for claiming she feared children were being abused by the Davidians. Reno took full responsibility; in 2004 she said that \u201cthe tragedy is we will never know what was the right thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>In 1994 Reno appointed a special prosecutor, the Republican <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/us/man-in-the-news-aggressive-prosecutor-robert-bishop-fiske-jr.html\">Robert B Fiske</a>, to investigate the Clintons\u2019 real estate deal known as Whitewater, but Fiske was viewed by the right as too bipartisan, and Congress empowered an independent counsel, George HW Bush\u2019s former solicitor general <a href=\"http://\">Kenneth Starr</a>, to replace him. Starr\u2019s investigations ran for five years, resulting in the impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton for lying about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. In the middle of Whitewater, Reno refused to appoint another prosecutor to investigate the Clintons\u2019 campaign financing, saying the was no evidence to justify such calls.</p> <p>Her efforts against Big Tobacco ran head on into powerful voices in Congress funded by the industry in the states they represented. In 1998 she pursued the suit against Microsoft despite critics who claimed the issues were \u201ctoo complicated\u201d for juries to understand.</p> <p>But her political legacy was again sealed by a raid, in the case of Gonz\u00e1lez, the Cuban boy found in an inner tube off the coast of Florida after his mother was one of 10 people who drowned when the small boat in which they left Cuba sank. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s relatives in Miami refused to send him back to his father (from whom his mother was divorced) in Cuba. The boy, who later said he had wanted to return, became a political football, until the family refused to follow a court order, and Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on their house in which Eli\u00e1n was seized and returned to his father. The attorney general who believed so strongly in the facts and the law was again left with no option but the use of governmental force.</p> <p>Over six feet tall and resolutely lacking glamour, Reno was a figure of cruel abuse on rightwing talk radio, and a somewhat gentler satire on Saturday Night Live, where Will Ferrell\u2019s skits of \u201cJanet Reno\u2019s Dance Party\u201d were a running gag. After leaving office in 2001, Reno showed a more relaxed side to her character by appearing on the show alongside Ferrell.</p> <p>In 2002, Reno mounted a challenge to Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Jeb Bush, but she lost the Democratic primary to Bill McBride.</p> <p>Reno had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 1995. In later years she served on numerous boards, including that of The Innocence Project, and devoted herself to her extended family.</p> <p>She is survived by her sister Maggy. Loretta Lynch, the second woman to serve as US attorney general praised Reno, saying \u201cShe was guided by one simple test, to do what the law and the facts required... regardless of which way the political winds were blowing.\u201d</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 Janet Wood Reno, lawyer, born 21 July 1938; died 7 November 2016</p>",

  "<h2><strong>When will we know the result?</strong></h2> <p>The US goes to the polls on Tuesday. Results will start to come in on Wednesday from about 11am AEDT (8am in Perth) when some states close their polling stations on the eastern seaboard of the US. Some states with clear majorities for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be called very quickly. Depending on how close it is and how certain key states fall, the final result could be known anywhere between 2pm AEDT and the early evening. Bear in mind that 4pm in Sydney is midnight in New York, so it is likely that Clinton and Trump will speak to supporters sometime late Wednesday afternoon AEDT.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be getting results from Michigan and Pennsylvania from around noon AEDT, though it may take a while to know who has won in either place. If Trump pulls off a surprise in Michigan, he will be in a strong position. The result in Pennsylvania will be a big indicator one way or the other, followed by Arizona, New Hampshire and North Carolina. </p> <p>Many Trump-supporting states will call early. At about 3pm Clinton will win California \u2013 and, if she\u2019s going to win the presidency, this could put her ahead on the day for the first time.

If a candidate wins a state, then that candidate wins all of that state\u2019s electoral college votes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/my-year-with-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election\">My year with Trump: covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The number of electoral college votes a state gets is based on its population size. A state gets a vote for each of its House of Representatives districts plus two votes for its two senators. The more people in a state, the more members of the House of Representatives it has and the more electoral college votes it has: California has 55 votes, North Carolina has 15, Nevada has six, Wyoming has three, and so on. </p> <p>There are 538 electoral college votes in total. That means the first candidate to reach 270 electoral college votes wins the presidential election. There have been cases in which there is an electoral college tie: in 1800, when Thomas Jefferson finally emerged as president, and more recently, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/06/24/could-veeps-election-meltdown-ever-come-true/\">in the sitcom Veep</a>. In 2016, a tie would likely look more like the latter than the former. </p> <h2><strong>Is it possible to win the popular vote but not the electoral college vote?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Just as Labor under Kim Beazley won the popular vote in the 1998 Australian election but didn\u2019t win a majority in the Australian parliament, a presidential candidate in the US can win the popular vote but fall short in the electoral college vote. This has happened four times in US history: 1824, 1876, 1888 and 2000, when George W Bush beat Al Gore in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote. </p> <h2><strong>Can Trump really win?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/american-voters-in-australia-could-have-crucial-role-in-tight-us-election-race\">American voters in Australia could have crucial role in tight US election race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, he could win, though it isn\u2019t looking likely. In the past week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/trump-campaign-clinton-panic-losing-blue-states\">Clinton\u2019s lead has narrowed</a>, largely off the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the FBI\u2019s announcement that it was reopening an investigation into her email server</a>. Some national polls have even showed Trump drawing even with her. But Clinton has consistently led in the electoral college, and many polls project her electoral college result at 270 or more. Most polls now project Trump at 200 to 215 electoral college votes, making his task of winning 270 more difficult. </p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s a blue state and what is a red state?</strong></h2> <p>Since the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/weekinreview/ideas-trends-one-state-two-state-red-state-blue-state.html?_r=0\">2000 election the US media</a> have used the colours red and blue to depict how states are likely to vote. Democratic states are shown in blue. Republican states are shown in red. Frankly, it\u2019s weird, because red is usually the colour of the left, and blue is traditionally the colour of the right. </p> <h2><strong>If I look at one of those </strong><a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\"><strong>electoral college maps</strong></a><strong>, it looks as though Trump is winning everywhere. There\u2019s a sea of red. What\u2019s going on here?</strong></h2> <p>Trump is winning a lot of states but many of the states he is winning are not full of people. So they have small numbers of electoral college votes. By contrast, Clinton has a \u201cfirewall\u201d of delegate-rich states, including California (55 votes), New York (29), Wisconsin (10), Minnesota (10) and Michigan (16).</p> <h2><strong>What are swing states, and which ones are they?</strong></h2> <p>Swing states are like Australia\u2019s marginal seats \u2013 the ones on a knife edge that can swing between the two parties. Sometimes they are referred to as purple states (a mixture of red and blue). Swing states to watch in this election are Florida (29 votes), Ohio (18), North Carolina (15), Nevada (six), Iowa (six) and New Hampshire (four). Clinton only needs to win all the blue states plus one of these swing states to win the election, whereas Trump needs to win all the red states and all of these swing states to reach 270 votes.</p> <h2><strong>How do Americans actually vote? </strong></h2> <p>There is no consistent method of voting across the US, with each state running their elections. Polling hours will vary by city or county as well. Some states use paper ballots, as Australia does. Some use electronic voting, where it looks as though the voter is using an ATM. Three states \u2013 Colorado, Oregon and Washington \u2013 conduct voting by mail for everyone, though in Colorado voters also have the option of attending a polling place.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/us-election-quiz-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">US election quiz: how much do you remember from the presidential race?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some states use punch card voting, where the voter uses an implement to punch a hole through the ballot paper, which is then read by a vote-tabulating device. (The first time I voted in a US election from Australia, the state of Illinois mailed me a punch ballot, a foam-backing pad and a metal spike so I could cast my vote.) This form of voting gave rise to the term a \u201changing chad\u201d in 2000, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/28/uselections2000.usa2\">Florida\u2019s result was challenged</a> on a number of bases including whether a vote was valid if the punch didn\u2019t seem to go all the way through the paper.</p> <h2><strong>Are Americans only voting for president?</strong></h2> <p>No. Americans are voting for a wide range of measures and candidates:</p> <p>\u2022 Local tax levies \u2013 for instance, should the county impose a tax to provide more funds to the local library?<br>\u2022 State laws, eg, should the state legalise marijuana?<br>\u2022 County officials such as coroners and dog catchers (seriously, yes).<br>\u2022 Judges (yes, they elect judges in America).<br>\u2022 Governors (12 states are voting for governors this year).<br>\u2022 State legislators (like voting for your state MP).<br>\u2022 All 435 members of the federal House of Representatives, elected every two years.<br>\u2022 34 federal senators.</p> <p>Imagine voting for your local council, state government, federal government and in several state and local plebiscites all at once: that\u2019s the equivalent of what Americans are voting for tomorrow. It\u2019s a democracy smorgasbord. </p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s the difference between Congress, Senate and the house? </strong></h2> <p>The Congress is the general term for the entire legislature. The House of Representatives is like the lower house in Australia, and the Senate is like our Senate (in that it is an upper house: it may or may not have its own quirky individuals, \u00e0 la Rod Culleton and Malcolm Roberts). The Republicans are likely to control the House of Representatives, mainly because the state legislatures get to draw their own boundaries and have ensured the districts are as friendly as possible to the Republican party.</p> <p>The Democrats may well control the Senate. It is on a knife edge. If it is tied at 50-50, then the vice-president casts the deciding vote \u2013 meaning the presidential election and the Senate election are two to watch in tandem. </p> <h2><strong>I\u2019m so tired of hearing about Clinton\u2019s emails. Just give me the potted history, quickly</strong></h2> <p>When she was secretary of state (the US foreign minister), Clinton used a private email server to send and receive work emails, rather than use the Department of State\u2019s secure email server.<br></p> <p>Republicans have sought to assert she violated state department protocol as well as federal laws regarding record keeping. The FBI opened an investigation to determine if any of the information was classified. Some of it was. But the FBI determined in July that while Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d it would not recommend charges against her. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s email issues pale in comparison to George W. Bush, who <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/23/george-w-bush-white-house-lost-22-million-emails-497373.html\">\u2018\u2019lost\u201d 22 million emails </a>he kept as president on a private email server. But the controversy has dogged Clinton\u2019s campaign, as it fed a perception that she was not an honest person. </p> <p>Last week, 11 days from the election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the FBI announced it was reopening the Clinton email investigation</a> based on newly discovered information, that is emails on another computer.

It is the ultimate bellwether state: it has voted with the US president in every election since 1964. This year Ohio\u2019s population is older and whiter than previously and will probably vote for Trump. It is likely that for the first time in more than 50 years Ohio will go with the party that doesn\u2019t win the presidency. </p> <p>\u2022 Did you know that US territories get to vote in the primaries but not the general election? That\u2019s right, people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands get to vote for who should be the candidate but they get no say on who wins the election.</p> <p>\u2022 When does the winner become president?

  "<p>With just one day to go until the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s support is at 46.8% while Donald Trump\u2019s is at 44.3%. </p> <p>When analysts refer to the Democrat\u2019s 2.5 percentage point lead, they are talking about the difference between those two figures in polling averages. </p> <p>It\u2019s an important number but it\u2019s also probably an inaccurate one. That\u2019s because polling averages do not capture fully a few factors that will affect the final outcome.</p> <h2><strong>Early votes</strong></h2> <p>More than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">41 million</a> Americans have already cast their votes. Some, but not all, polls include such early voters. More than a third of respondents in a survey released by Bloomberg on Monday morning said they had already voted. The poll showed Clinton leading by three points. </p> <p>There are some other positive signs for Clinton. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html\">Turnout among Hispanic voters is up</a> in every state where early voting data is available \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/files/1514/7839/2130/Wk8_Full_Tracker.pdf\">polling data</a> suggests that as the weeks have passed, those in this group of Americans have increasingly said they do plan on voting. Since three-quarters of Hispanic Americans say they will vote for Clinton, that is bad news for Republicans. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/oct/11/voter-turnout-presidential-election-states-2012-2016\">What is the voter turnout in your state? An election quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more complicated, though, is figuring out how increases in early turnout among Hispanic voters might offset declines in early turnout among African Americans and voters aged 18 to 29. And it\u2019s also possible that voter behavior differs by political affiliation. It might simply be that those who support Trump are more inclined to show up on election day, rather than voting ahead of time. </p> <p>In Nevada, where polls suggested Trump was leading by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nv/nevada_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson-6004.html\">1.5</a> points, early votes look positive for a Clinton win. <a href=\"http://nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=4567\">More than half</a> of active votes have been cast, 42% of them among registered Democrats and 36% among registered Republicans. </p> <p>To win Nevada, Trump would have to win over a majority of independents, which would mean bucking trends from 2008 and 2012. Which is possible. But maybe Trump has already written it off \u2013 with only six electoral college votes available, it might not be crucial in getting either candidate to the 270 they need to win. </p> <h2><strong>National opinion doesn\u2019t translate neatly to national results</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin\">Historically</a>, the popular vote (the results as a percentage of all ballots cast) doesn\u2019t neatly translate to the electoral vote (the results as a share of 538 electoral college votes). <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/\">Four times</a>, most recently in 2000 between George Bush and Al Gore, the winning candidate has won the electoral vote but not the popular vote. </p> <p>That affects the way we read the polls. Having 47% support in national polls does not mean Clinton is also set to win 47% of the electoral college votes. The size of her support varies considerably from state to state. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/md/maryland_trump_vs_clinton-5859.html\">Maryland</a>, she is polling at 63%. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/id/idaho_trump_vs_clinton-5903.html\">Idaho</a>, she has around 23%.</p> <p>So, any definition of a battleground state needs to take into account two things: how close the two candidates are in the polls and how many electoral college votes are available in that state. If you set your criteria as being 1) that the candidates are separated by six points or less in state polls and 2) that the state is worth 10 electoral college votes or more, the battleground states are as follows: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, Wisconsin and Minnesota. </p> <p>Based on early voting and the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/25/us-hispanic-latino-voters-us-election-2016\">nearly one in five</a> eligible voters there is Hispanic, Florida looks likely to vote for Clinton. That\u2019s important, given that the state is worth 29 electoral college votes \u2013 but it might not be enough. Even if Clinton can add Florida to the list of states she can count on, that will only take her to 216 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Margin of error</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/\">margin of error</a> is crucial. Typically, when a poll is published, buried in the methodology section is a line that says something like \u201cmargin of error \u00b1 3.5 percentage points\u201d, which means for example that Clinton\u2019s actual level of support could be as high as 50.3% or as low as 43.3%. </p> <p>Since the two candidates are so close in the polls, that margin of error could be the difference between winning the popular vote or losing it. </p> <p>If the margin of error systematically favors the frontrunner or the underdog, we could just take that into account. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t. Take <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/9442/election-polls-accuracy-record-presidential-elections.aspx\">Gallup</a>, for example, one of the country\u2019s largest polling firms.

  "<p><strong></strong>All eyes are on the race to be the next US president, but the battle to control Congress may be almost as consequential.</p> <p>The next Congress could determine whether the supreme court goes back to having nine justices, whether the USA makes good on its climate promises and whether, for example, Hillary Clinton is impeached, should she be elected president.</p> <p>If the Senate and the House stay Republican and Donald Trump wins the presidency, he would not necessarily have carte blanche. As much as Trump may want to build a border wall with Mexico, he would not be able to spend the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/11/trumps-dubious-claim-that-his-border-wall-would-cost-8-billion/\">estimated $25bn</a> it would cost until Congress legislated for it. (That\u2019s assuming Mexico does not pay for the wall upfront, as Trump has sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\">promised it would</a>.)</p> <p>Trump would likewise need Congress\u2019s help to deport undocumented migrants, slap new tariffs on Chinese goods or fine US companies for moving manufacturing overseas. It\u2019s unclear whether the GOP would back him on these issues. But a quick agreement on issues such as repealing the estate tax and Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law might well be in the cards.<br></p> <p>It is extremely unlikely that the Democrats will seize control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, owing to an overwhelming, 60-seat Republican majority in the lower chamber.</p> <p>Artful gerrymandering at the state level means there aren\u2019t many toss-up House races this cycle \u2013 only 18 out of 435, according to the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings\">Cook Political report</a>. Democrats could win every single one of the toss ups and still fall around eight seats short of a House majority. </p> <p>But the Senate is a different matter, with most analysts putting the Democrats\u2019 chances of overcoming the GOP\u2019s current eight-seat majority and taking the upper chamber at about even. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically 50-50,\u201d Harry Enten, a polling analyst with FiveThirtyEight, told CNN on Sunday. \u201cYou have in my opinion maybe six or seven seats that are going to really determine this.\u201d</p> <p>If Democrats controlled the senate, and Clinton were president, the supreme court vacancy could soon be filled \u2013 although Republicans have already hinted at a procedural fight to stop that from happening. </p> <p>As with every aspect of the 2016 election cycle, Trump\u2019s presence is palpable. Some Republican incumbents appear to have been wounded by associations with the GOP nominee. Senator Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire saw her numbers drop after she was asked at a debate whether Trump would be a good role model for children, and replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d.<br></p> <p>If Nevada representative Joe Heck loses his senate bid, analysts will point to the record number of Hispanic voters who lined up in the state to cast early ballots for Clinton (and against Trump). Senator Richard Burr in North Carolina may fall victim to the abandonment of Trump by moderate Republicans in his state.<br></p> <p>In other races, there is no perceivable Trump drag \u2013 and there may be Trump coattails. In Ohio, where Trump and Clinton appear to be neck-and-neck, Republican incumbent Rob Portman is polling 16 points ahead of his opponent, a former governor. And in Missouri, where Trump appears to be crushing Clinton, Republican incumbent Roy Blunt is in a seemingly tight race with the Democratic state secretary of state. In Pennsylvania, incumbent Pat Toomey appears to be running behind his opponent, but not as far behind Clinton as Trump is running in the state.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult to understand exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Enten said.<br></p> <h2>Races to watch</h2> <p><strong>New York\u2019s 19th congressional district:</strong> Big outside money is trying to block progressive star Zephyr Teachout from making it to Washington. Teachout, a law professor, has strong support from senator Bernie Sanders, but her opponent says she\u2019s a carpetbagger.<br></p> <p><strong>Arizona\u2019s first congressional district:</strong> Republican Paul Babeu, a county sheriff, dropped out of a congressional race in 2012 after an ex-lover, who was also an undocumented Mexican immigrant, outed him as gay and said the sheriff threatened him with deportation if he said anything. Democrat Tom O\u2019Halleran, a state legislator, appears to have the edge.</p> <p><strong>California\u2019s 49th congressional district: </strong>One of the sweetest of all potential pickups for Democrats, because it would send incumbent Darrell Issa, the loathed former chairman of the oversight committee (read: Benghazi), packing. He faces retired Marine colonel Doug Applegate.</p> <p><strong>North Carolina governor\u2019s race:</strong> Will Tar Heel voters make incumbent governor Pat McRory pay for signing the notorious House Bill 2, which allowed discrimination against transgender people in access to public bathrooms?

Anyone who lived through the photo-finish of 2000, when it took until mid-December for a winner to be declared \u2013 and only then by a ruling of the supreme court \u2013 will know that a presidential contest does not always produce a president, at least not right away. But one thing will certainly be over \u2013 and that is the dizzying, sometimes nauseating, 18-month-long saga that has been the 2016 campaign.</p> <p>It is standard to describe a US presidential contest as bitter and divisive. In 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/obama-four-more-years-america-verdict\">the Guardian\u2019s front-page story</a> branded the battle of Barack Obama v Mitt Romney \u201cone of the most closely fought and polarised in recent history\u201d.

While his opponent has offered <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/22/hillary-clintons-top-10-campaign-promises/\">detailed and substantive policy prescriptions</a>, those have barely got a mention: Trump\u2019s knack for hogging media attention, usually by saying or tweeting something jaw-droppingly outrageous, has left no room. In the four-and-a-half hours of formal presidential debates between Trump and Hillary Clinton, climate change was discussed for not one minute.</p> <p>But Trump does not bear the blame alone. Also shamed by the 2016 campaign are those institutions and individuals who failed to stand up to him. Some understood the danger he represented, seeing in him a would-be dictator \u2013 \u201cI alone can fix this!\u201d \u2013 whose contempt for basic democratic norms, from the importance of a free press to the need to respect the outcome of a democratic election, suggested a lurch towards fascism. That small handful will be remembered with admiration. But, whatever the outcome today, historians of the American republic will judge harshly those who did not stop Trump when they could. It will damn those who indulged, pampered and enabled him to reach this moment: where polls still show him with a path, albeit narrow, to the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33d2b1067022f23ef7329880d8efacb4e8ace0bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d2b1067022f23ef7329880d8efacb4e8ace0bd/0_116_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeb Bush was among the Republican rivals who had no idea how to deal with Bush.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeb Bush was among the Republican rivals who had no idea how to deal with Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First in this roll-call of shame is the Republican party. Among those hanging their heads should be the 16 rival candidates who allowed themselves to be steamrollered by a reality TV host and serially bankrupted businessman. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and the others had no idea how to deal with Trump. They collectively made a strategic error by failing to realise their primary task was to take him out. Instead, they fought each other, each hoping to emerge as the sole, anti-Trump candidate around whom Republicans would unite. That proved a delusion.</p> <p>As Trump\u2019s poll lead increased in late 2015 and early 2016, his rivals grew ever more frightened of taking a shot at him, anxious that they might alienate his supporters or, worse, that he might train his fire back on them. So while, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/republican-debate-new-hampshire-marco-rubio-chris-christie-donald-trump-ted-cruz\">Chris Christie mocked Rubio</a> on a TV debate stage in New Hampshire in February, Trump could literally step back and watch \u2013 only to emerge as the winner in that state\u2019s Republican primary a few days later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"503ac8289b40c1720d6f08ed534c54be7015fb1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503ac8289b40c1720d6f08ed534c54be7015fb1f/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump rival and New Jersey govenor Chris Christie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump rival and New Jersey governor Chris Christie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Evans/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the Republicans cannot be blamed for the weakness of the field that fought Trump for their party\u2019s nomination. Perhaps no traditional politician \u2013 no senator or governor \u2013 could take on Trump when the Republican grassroots, so furious at the political establishment, were hungering for an outsider. (Although, of course, this anti-establishment fervour, this loathing of all things Washington, was itself stoked for years by Republicans and their allies on Fox News and in the rest of the conservative political-media-entertainment complex. In losing their party to Trump, the Republicans were burned by a fire they themselves had started.)</p> <p>But what shames them is their conduct afterwards. Even as Trump made clear what kind of man he is \u2013 calling Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d, suggesting African-Americans are too lazy to work, that Jews see everything through the lens of money, calling women \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201cpigs\u201d, threatening violence against protesters, endorsing torture and the murder of the families of suspected terrorists, calling for a foreign power (Russia) to hack into emails belonging to his political rival, arguing that women who have abortions should \u201cface some sort of punishment\u201d, and being exposed as a proud perpetrator of sexual assault, a man whose approach to women is to \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d \u2013 even after all this and so much more, most senior Republicans of note stood by him.</p> <p>To be sure, they condemned him occasionally, when the extremity of their standard bearer\u2019s behaviour left them no alternative. Paul Ryan, who serves as speaker of the House of Representatives, rightly called it the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment\u201d when Trump said that <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442\">Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be impartial in handling the lawsuit against the so-called Trump University because Curiel was \u201cMexican\u201d</a>. In fact, the judge was a US citizen, born in Indiana. Ryan cold-shouldered Trump again, after the release of the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted of his attacks on women. But he never repudiated him fully. Ryan never said Trump was unfit to be president of the United States and that he would not vote for him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8b741b95a2e2ea85645fcecf4f26e2bde5368c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8b741b95a2e2ea85645fcecf4f26e2bde5368c4/0_40_3354_2012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator John McCain endorsed Trump and never withdrew his endorsement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator John McCain initially endorsed Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J.

McCain swallowed that, along with Trump\u2019s promise to ban Muslims and to deport 11 million undocumented migrants \u2013 only withdrawing his endorsement last month, after the notorious tape.</p> <p>Until then, McCain, like most of his fellow Republicans, clung to the fiction that Trump would transform himself into a new creature: sober, presidential and, above all, capable of being tamed by the Republican establishment \u2013 even though there was not a shred of evidence, bar a very occasional willingness on the candidate\u2019s part to read prepared lines from a teleprompter, to support that fantasy.</p> <p>That puts them on a moral plane only slightly above that occupied by Trump\u2019s trio of enablers: Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. Those three horsemen of the Republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a snake-oil salesman was fit to be president \u2013 and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process. As Hillary Clinton pointed out, Giuliani used to prosecute tax-dodgers. In this campaign, he praised Trump\u2019s failure to pay income tax for at least two decades as evidence of his \u201cgenius\u201d.</p> <p>And that is to omit the fourth horseman: Mike Pence, the defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a thrice-married, serially adulterous, self-confessed grabber of women. When the 2005 \u201cgrab them\u201d tape emerged, Pence went into seclusion. Some thought he might emerge to announce he was quitting the Republican ticket. He did no such thing. Instead, he examined his conscience, found it pristine and continued to act as a character witness to a man who cheats his taxes, cheats on his wives and lies every time he opens his mouth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"267f3ccf1675ff3f460b49a0bf5a6be3ca6fe08d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/267f3ccf1675ff3f460b49a0bf5a6be3ca6fe08d/161_222_2827_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump And Mike Pence campaign together In Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Mike Pence campaign together In Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to attack the spineless \u201cleaders\u201d of the Republican party.

But that rule only applies to candidates for office. Any truthful assessment of a campaign has at least to include those doing the voting.</p> <p>Some blame surely attaches to the Americans who let Trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway. There is no escaping the fact that north of 40% of the US electorate have been prepared to vote for Trump despite everything that he has said and done. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/297383-poll-nearly-half-of-voters-think-trump-will-detonate-a\">One poll found 22% of Trump\u2019s own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war</a>.

Analysts have not been sure how to explain the other motives. Some have been compassionate and highlighted the role of economic disadvantage among Trump supporters, those left behind by globalisation. Others have suggested that Trumpism is a howl of often racist, misogynistic rage from angry white men, furious that their once-privileged place in American life has been supplanted. The latter camp has taken to sharing pictures or reports of overt racism and sexism by Trump supporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soledadobrien/status/795426520768581637\">with the sarcastic caption: \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This debate has been thoroughly aired in parts of the American press, but, overall, the media \u2013 and especially TV \u2013 shares some responsibility for the dire state of the 2016 campaign. It\u2019s true that the most respectable newspapers and reporters kept tabs on Trump\u2019s prodigious lying: <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/donald-trump-quickfacts.html\">one correspondent tweeted out a daily tally</a>, often stretching into the dozens. Others maintained diligent fact-checking services.</p> <p>But the big picture was indulgence on an epic scale. For months, Trump had unique and unprecedented access to the airwaves of cable TV. Rather than wait to be booked for a set-piece interview, he would simply call up Fox or MSNBC and put himself on the air. He knew he was ratings gold; he knew the networks would not be able to say no. He had a similarly instinctive, reptilian understanding of the media\u2019s addiction to outrage: his nocturnal tweeting habit spread offence and insult far and wide \u2013 but it ensured he remained at the centre of public attention for over a year. According to the media analyst Jack Shafer, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/2016-election-trump-media-takeover-coverage-214419\">the only subject ever to have enjoyed a comparable full-spectrum dominance is 9/11</a>.</p> <p>Yet that quantitative imbalance was not the only distortion. The media clung to its notion that balance required equivalence, so that if Trump wallowed in dishonesty, requiring constant fact-checking, then Clinton had to be treated as equally dishonest. Witness <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/matt-lauer-forum.html\">the morning TV anchor Matt Lauer</a>, widely pilloried for a programme in which he let Trump say anything, much of it false, but played inquisitor-general with Clinton, especially over her emails. (Still, the enduring face of media indulgence of Trump will be that of late-night TV host Jimmy Fallon, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BYqzdiuJc\">playfully ruffling the hair of the real estate magnate</a> \u2013 treating him as just another lovable rogue.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BYqzdiuJc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u0BYqzdiuJc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The moment when TV host Jimmy Fallon ruffled Trump\u2019s hair epitomised the media\u2019s indulgence of him.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nowhere was this mindset more misleading than in the never-ending discussion of those emails, especially in the campaign\u2019s final stretch. Which brings us to the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and, in particular, its director, James Comey. His decision to announce 10 days before election day that he was, in effect, reopening the FBI probe into the email affair handed the last week of the campaign to Trump. It put Clinton on the defensive, halted her momentum and stopped the bleeding in Team Trump. Many analysts believe that, by bringing Republican voters back home to the party, it will also prevent Democrats retaking the senate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12dbba3a5078cefb023727a4cd39b752c034d8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12dbba3a5078cefb023727a4cd39b752c034d8bf/0_134_2716_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FBI director James Comey takes his place in the hall of shame.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FBI director James Comey takes his place in the hall of shame.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And all that on what turned out to be an entirely false premise. On Sunday, Comey had to admit that the cache of supposedly new emails was, in fact, nothing of the sort and that there were no grounds to alter his July view that Clinton should face no further action. But by then the damage had been done. Whether through partisan bias or sheer incompetence, we do not yet fully know.</p> <p>So Comey takes his place in the hall of shame of the 2016 campaign, shuffling into the group photo alongside Julian Assange, who might as well have handed over his WikiLeaks operation to the Trump campaign. Assange kept up a drip feed of leaked emails from the Clinton team, many of them embarrassing, none devastating \u2013 while conspicuously leaking nothing that might damage the Republican nominee. WikiLeaks never produced Trump\u2019s tax returns or the outtakes from The Apprentice said to contain yet more evidence that Trump is a bigot and sexual predator. It targeted Clinton alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d668e00f2cd58fa4157f72fc95e9f72e2c88b3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d668e00f2cd58fa4157f72fc95e9f72e2c88b3d3/0_148_2896_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks operation kept up a drip feed of leaked emails from the Clinton team, while leaking nothing that might damage Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks operation kept up a drip feed of leaked emails from the Clinton team, while leaking nothing that might damage Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there should be room in that photo for Vladimir Putin, whose intelligence agencies are near-universally believed to be behind the wholesale hacking of the Democratic party, and whose goal appears to have been either the installation of Trump or, failing that, the sowing of confusion and chaos in the US electoral system.

It needs to be said again, at this fateful moment, that Mr Trump is not a fit and proper person for the presidency. He is an irascible egomaniac. He is uninterested in the world. He has fought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/my-year-with-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election\">a campaign of abuse and nastiness</a>, riddled with racism and misogyny.

He panders to everything that is worst in human nature and spurns all that is best.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton is far from perfect. But Mr Trump plumbs the depths of imperfection in ways that have no precedent in frontline modern American politics. All countries from time to time produce leaders who are ignorant or vain or who lack intellectual judgment or personal grace. But Mr Trump is the first candidate to get so close to power who has no experience of the practicalities of politics and government, and who does not seem to care about them either. If he is elected president it will send the worst possible message to America about itself, and an even worse one to the rest of the world.</p> <p>There are three particular ways in which electing Mr Trump is a step that should be spurned by any responsible American voter. First, it would mean a rightwing president governing with a rightwing Congress. Mr Trump and the Republican establishment have many differences, but they would find no difficulty cutting taxes for the richest or sparking an aggressive trade war with former partners. They would ensure, as a priority, that the conservative majority is restored on the supreme court. Progress on civil rights and equality would be thrown into reverse. Abortion rights would be under threat.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Second, Mr Trump\u2019s election would be, and would be seen as, a victory for white America over African, Hispanic, Asian and other American ethnic groups.

It will contribute to instability and set back efforts to solve environmental problems. It will encourage autocratic leaders in places like Russia, China, Turkey, North Korea and elsewhere. It makes the nurturing of the planet more difficult and the future of the human race more uncertain.</p> <p>For all these reasons, Americans should summon a special level of seriousness and display a profound responsibility when they go to the polls. Anything other than a vote for Mrs Clinton is a vote for conservatism off the leash, a deepened racial divide and a more dangerous planet. The time for messing is over. America deserves much better than Mr Trump. So does the world. Mrs Clinton is much better. So elect her.</p>",

If Djokovic wins every match, he will reclaim his crown.</p> <p>\u201cLast year was hard because the Davis Cup was always right at the front of my thinking,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI was training on clay before and after this event, and that was putting all my eggs in one basket. We managed to win the Davis Cup, which was great \u2013 but probably it didn\u2019t help the last couple of tournaments much.</p> <p>\u201cThe year before, I played loads of events to get into the Tour Finals. I thought I was starting to get back on track and then got smoked by Roger [Federer]. That was like, a disaster, people saying, \u2019What\u2019s wrong with him, What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I managed to turn it around after that, and I learned a lot from that period.</p> <p>\u201cAfter my back surgery [in 2013] I did start to feel better physically towards the end of the year but my game was nowhere near where it needed to be. I had won a lot of matches and played some decent stuff at the end but, when I had to play at that top level, I wasn\u2019t able to compete. It made me realise I really need to work on my tennis in the off-season.\u201d</p> <p>Murray says gyrotonics, a machine-based version of pilates and referred to as \u201cyoga for dancers\u201d, has played a major role in his late-career development.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve a lot more range of movement and it\u2019s helped my back. Even before my surgery for 18 months it was giving me quite a lot of issues. I wish I hadn\u2019t done as much running when I was younger. I really struggled with that before my back surgery. Any time I went for a run, I was in quite a bit of pain for a few days afterwards. I feel much better than four years ago \u2013 which is a shame because, when you\u2019re 24 or 25, you should probably feel better than you do in your late 20s.\u201d</p> <p>After the O2, Murray will spend a fortnight at home before leaving for a two-week training block in Miami ahead of the Australian Open in January.</p>",

In the quest for 270 electoral votes to secure the presidency, the coveted prize of the \u201cKeystone state\u201d saw Clinton, Trump, their running mates or high-profile surrogates, and on many weeks all of these, campaigning throughout Pennsylvania. It has not voted Republican since George HW Bush in 1992, but Trump is fervently contesting it. </p> <p>Working on a photo-essay of the rust belt, a stronghold of Trump\u2019s, I drove past a derelict home with his surname spray-painted in bold scarlet lettering on the facade. For a region decimated by the collapse of the coal industry, the Republican presidential nominee represents the prospect of renewal and returned prosperity. In fact, Trump campaigns on that exact promise that he will bring back jobs through \u201cclean coal\u201d. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b4b358b20ee7e2c6c7eeb26764c5190752b0ae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b4b358b20ee7e2c6c7eeb26764c5190752b0ae8/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump campaign sign is displayed in the storefront of a firearm pawn shop in Minersville, Pennsylvania on 6 June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump campaign sign is displayed in the storefront of a firearm pawn shop in Minersville, Pennsylvania on 6 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>A Donald J.

I posted on Facebook: did anyone else want to deal with their anxiety by coming to knock on doors in Pennsylvania, the nearest swing state to where we live in Brooklyn? My friend Sid offered to join me.

Then he gave us our instructions: we were to only talk to registered voters who planned to vote for Clinton \u2013 and not try to change the minds of Trump supporters. Our job was to ensure that everyone knew how to get to their polling place on Tuesday and to remind them to bring ID and vote early. If they seemed unsure about their decision, our script directed us to say \u201cI can certainly understand not being sure\u201d and to choose one of three reasons why we had decided to support Clinton: her support for children and families. Her preparation and experience. The fact that \u201cshe never quits anything she believes in\u201d and \u201ckeeps fighting when she gets knocked down\u201d.

Today, many of the narrow, cozy-looking rowhouses in the town are still decorated with fishy motifs, but they house middle-class families, young couples, groups of cohabiting twentysomething roommates. The people in the neighborhood we covered were predominately white.<br></p> <p>I know these demographics in part because this is the nature of canvassing: in a couple of hours, you get an unprecedented window into the homes of the strangers who open their doors to you. Roommates sitting around coffee tables. Some foyers were lit with fancy chandeliers; others with modest lamps in paper shades. A woman drinking a beer and making a delicate watercolor.</p> <p>In Fishtown, very few people had doorbells. Maybe they\u2019re obsolete devices in an era where no one stops by unexpectedly. Showing up unannounced is an act of social awkwardness in 2016. Many folks didn\u2019t answer their doors to us. Why would they? We stuck Post-It notes by their doorknobs with details to remind them to vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/five-scenarios-us-election-results-predictions\">US election: five scenarios that could play out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sid and I divided the work.

She has expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/23/hillary-clinton-record-secretary-of-state-foreign-policy\">an inclination toward a tougher stance in Syria and in Europe</a>, for example, but the wiggle-room for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as Vladimir Putin has sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/russia-further-bolsters-naval-presence-in-mediterranean\">create new facts on the ground</a> in the last stages of the Obama era. More weeks would go by while a new Clinton administration dives into an inevitable policy review. </p> <p> However, events around the globe may not wait that long. Whoever sits down at the desk in the Oval Office on 20 January next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any US president has taken, much sooner than he or she would want.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/us-global-threats-transition-next-president\">US faces host of global threats during transition until next president</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>North Korea</h2> <p>US power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating rate, and nowhere more so than on the Korean peninsula. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile, and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet, they will soon. It is also widely anticipated that in the next few years, North Korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast. Former and current US administrations have taken the strategic decision that Pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point, by force if necessary. But the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton\u2019s foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming Korean crisis early in her term in office, reassuring Japan and South Korea that the US will not abandon them, and seeking to put pressure on China to enforce UN-mandated trade sanctions more effectively. That may well not succeed, leaving a Clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with Pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status, as long as it restricts missile development. If that were possible, it would alarm US allies who are already within North Korean missile range.<br></p> <p>American allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if Trump reaches the Oval Office. He has questioned the value of US alliances in the region, and he has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-japan-south-korea-might-need-nuclear-weapons/\">floated the possibility</a> that countries like Japan or South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the US strategic umbrella. If he sticks to that policy in office, there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north-east Asia and possibly beyond. Ultimately, a Trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a North Korean long-range missile. He has said he would put more pressure on China to get tough with its neighbour, and he has said he is willing to meet Kim in the US, on the grounds \u201cthere\u2019s a 10% or a 20% chance that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-north-korea-nukes-224385\">I can talk him out of those damn nukes</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>Failing that, he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the US nuclear arsenal. If the weapons cannot be used, he asked: \u201cThen why are we making them? Why do we make them?\u201d </p> <h2>China </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/china-tantalized-mayhem-us-election-prospect-thug-donald-trump-president\">China tantalized by US election mayhem and prospect of 'thug' Trump as president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within his or her first year in office, a new US president would also face a direct challenge to US power in the western Pacific. The Chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the South China Sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives Beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world. US influence is under further threat by the rise of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/philippine-president-calls-for-removal-of-all-us-troops\">threatened to eject US troops</a>, casting doubt on his predecessor\u2019s agreement to allow new permanent American presence. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s likely policy will be to continue Obama\u2019s faltering \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d, and to prioritise restoring the faith of US allies in the region that Washington will help them resist Chinese attempts to dominate the South China Sea. It is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by Duterte\u2019s ultimate intentions, and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region. </p> <p>Trump has pointed to the Chinese reef-building programme as a reflection of US weakness but has not said what he would do about it. He has focused more on the threat posed to the US by its trade relations with China. In the transactional model of foreign relations Trump favours, he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-china-idUSKCN0ZR2MN\">could agree</a> to turn a blind eye to creeping Chinese takeover in the South China Sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with Beijing on better terms. </p> <h2>Syria </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">Why Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new US president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers. It is possible that the rebel stand in Aleppo will have fallen by then, giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political transition.</p> <p>In the presidential debates, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">talked of establishing</a> a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d or a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria. However, it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with Russia, with all the risks that entails. The generals at the Pentagon, who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a zone, would work hard to block such a scheme. A Clinton White House is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition groups.<br></p> <p>Trump has indicated that he would seek to work with Assad and Putin in a combined fight against Isis, and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of rebel-held areas such as eastern Aleppo. That policy would also have heavy costs. The Syrian opposition and the Gulf states would see it as a betrayal, and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor Russia has much immediate interest in fighting Isis. </p> <h2>Russia and Ukraine</h2> <p>A Clinton administration is expected to take a tougher line with Moscow than the Obama White House, all the more so because of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">substantial evidence of the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to try to intervene in the US presidential election</a> in her opponent\u2019s favour. Clinton could well seek to take a leadership role in negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine and the stalled Minsk peace process, which have hitherto been left to Germany and France. She could also opt to send lethal aid to Ukraine as a way of increasing US leverage.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/world-opinion-us-election-russia-china-mexico-europe\">How the world views the US elections, from Israel to North Korea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump is likely to take the opposite approach. He avoided criticism of Russia for its actions in Ukraine, hinted he might accept the annexation of Crimea, and ignored US intelligence findings that Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic party\u2019s email. A Trump administration is unlikely to contest Russian enforcement of its influence in eastern Ukraine.</p> <h2>Europe and Nato</h2> <p>Clinton aides have signalled consistently that one of her priorities would be to show US willingness to shore up EU and Nato cohesion, and will attend summits of both organisations in February.<br></p> <p>Trump has suggested, by contrast, that Nato is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in Europe are worth what the US is currently spending on them. He said he would check whether US allies \u201cfulfilled their obligation to us\u201d before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-america-automatically-nato-allies-under-attack\">coming to their defence</a>, calling into question the purpose of the defence pact. Later in the campaign, he changed tack, saying he would seek to strengthen the alliance, but a win for Trump on Tuesday would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern European countries, such as the Baltic states, that a US-led Nato would come to their defence in the face of Russian encroachment. </p> <h2>Trade</h2> <p>The two major free trade projects of the Obama administration, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with the countries on the Pacific rim, will probably still be under negotiation when the new president comes into office, giving him or her the option of killing or completing them.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trade-tpp-20160926-snap-story.html\">first supported</a> the TPP and then criticised it in the face of the primary challenge from Bernie Sanders. Her reservations may prolong the negotiations, but she is ultimately expected to pursue and seek completion of the ambitious multilateral trade deals.</p> <p>Trump built his campaign on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-election-free-trade-hillary-clinton-tpp-donald-trump-tariffs\">opposition to all such deals</a>, which he has characterised as inherently unfavourable to the US. He has promised to seek bilateral trade deals on better terms and to punish other countries deemed to be trading unfairly with sanctions, ignoring the threat of retaliation. </p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/27/donald-trump-i-would-end-paris-climate-deal-video\">promised</a> to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, which comes into force on Friday, and to \u201cstop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs\u201d. The Republican presidential nominee has said he\u2019s \u201cnot a believer in climate change\u201d, describing it as a Chinese-created hoax, and has castigated efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as a risk to American jobs.<br></p> <p>The prospect of Trump in the Oval Office poses a unique challenge to the Paris deal, which was struck last year and ratified in speedy fashion in October. A total of <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">94 nations have fully signed up</a> to a commitment to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase on pre-industrial times, in the hope of staving off catastrophic sea level rises, heatwaves and extreme weather.</p> <p>The emissions cuts pledged by countries currently aren\u2019t enough to avoid climate calamity, meaning that recalcitrance from the US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter and the \u201cglobal leader\u201d in fighting climate change, according to Barack Obama, would risk ossifying a process that needs a further hefty shove.</p> <p>American involvement in the Paris deal \u2013 which has the support of nearly 200 other countries \u2013 is based upon the presidential scrawl of Obama. The accord wasn\u2019t presented to Congress as a formal treaty, meaning that Trump could undo it himself.</p> <p>Extricating the US from the deal, along with its financial support of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, would take some time, however. Now the agreement is in force, any signatory nation faces a three-year delay before it could opt out, with a further one-year wait as the process plays out.</p> <p>\u201cThat means,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an expert at environmental law at Harvard University, \u201cit would be impossible for a President Trump to remove the United States during what would be his first term.\u201d</p> <p>But the uncertainty would undoubtably spook countries that rushed to embrace the Paris deal after the US and China, the world\u2019s two greenhouse gas superpowers, jointly announced they were committed to the process last year. Some countries, aware of the dangers of climate change, may redouble their efforts to slash emissions but others may use it as a convenient excuse to slack off.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to climate action is underscored by fierce support for fossil fuels, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/07/trumps_three_messages_for_pa_i.html\">telling coal miners</a> that he will \u201cput you back to work\u201d and that \u201cgas will be a beautiful thing\u201d in his administration.

An early election would seem to give May every opportunity to increase her personal authority and that of her government.</p> <p>But perhaps it is time to stand back. Would an election early next year (assuming the obstacles to such a ballot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/fixed-term-parliaments-explained\" title=\"\">created by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act</a> could be overcome) necessarily make it significantly easier for May to secure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/theresa-may-brexit-response-tie-our-hands-negociations\" title=\"\">parliament\u2019s support for her approach to Brexit</a>?</p> <p>For a start, we should remember that it is quite difficult for any party to win an overall majority these days. Scotland is now largely barren territory for the Conservatives and Labour, and there is little sign that the electoral tide that enabled the SNP almost to sweep the board there in May 2015 has significantly receded. A majority has to be forged from within England and Wales alone.</p> <p>Indeed, it took a seven-point lead over Labour just to deliver the Conservatives\u2019 narrow 12-seat Commons majority last year. Even the 14-point lead May now has could still produce no more than a 76-seat majority \u2013 more than comfortable, it is true, but well short of a landslide.</p> <p>There is, though, no guarantee that the current lead will be sustained through to next year. Part of it is down to the prime minister\u2019s honeymoon. All honeymoons eventually come to an end.</p> <p>Meanwhile, of course, the reason the government\u2019s 12-seat majority is seen as too small is because of the continuing divisions on Europe inside the Conservative party. At present these divisions are being glossed over by the glue of ambiguity. But May could not call an election about Brexit without being more specific about what she thinks Brexit should mean. Consequently, the fissures inside the Conservative party could become exposed to public view. And divided governments are not an electorally attractive sight \u2013 even if they are facing a divided opposition.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/06/theresa-may-insists-government-are-getting-on-with-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aq5c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873136\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May insists government are 'getting on' with Brexit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581f5b3ee4b029b92ca46125\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106TheresaMayIndia_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846495&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846495&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/06/theresa-may-insists-government-are-getting-on-with-brexit-video\">Theresa May insists government are \u2018getting on\u2019 with Brexit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Moreover, those differences over Europe are also evident among Conservative voters. Much of the Conservative advance in the polls since May became prime minister has come at the expense of Ukip. Although Labour support has dropped a couple of points since June, Ukip support is down by five points. Around one in five of those who voted Ukip in May 2015 now say they would back the Conservatives, three times as many as in June.</p> <p>If these ex-Ukip voters gain the impression that May is not on course to deliver the kind of Brexit they want, they may well switch back to Ukip. True, Ukip has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/ukip-warned-of-long-wait-for-new-leader\" title=\"\">leadership problems</a> of its own. But nothing would seem better designed to heal some of its wounds than an opportunity to fight an election in which Europe is the central issue.</p> <p>At the same time, May has to bear in mind that at least one in three of those who currently say they support the Conservatives voted in June to remain in the EU. They could take fright if they come to fear the prime minister wants a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Of course, these pro-remain Conservatives might feel Labour is an unattractive alternative. However, the relatively strong Liberal Democrat performance in recent local byelections as well as in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority\" title=\"\">Witney parliamentary contest</a> suggests that, in traditional Lib Dem areas at least, voters are beginning to put aside their disapproval of the party\u2019s record in the coalition. So May could have trouble defending those gains from the Liberal Democrats that were vital to David Cameron\u2019s success last year.</p> <p>So long as Labour is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/election-labour-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">weak in the polls</a>, the prospect of an early election is always going to appear tempting in Tory eyes. However, May could end up with a markedly less successful outcome than current polling suggests. But, of course, if she does find herself suffering significant defeats in parliament, she may not have much choice.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s an election on Tuesday, and voters in Grant County, Oregon, face a stark choice. They have to choose their sheriff, and the result of that race will resonate far beyond the county. Many observers will see it as a referendum on the gains made in the west last year by the Patriot movement.</p> <p>Just as in the presidential race, those involved see it as having an almost existential significance. \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in the history of Grant County, and the entire west,\u201d says Todd McKinley, the wiry, clean-cut contender who\u2019s hoping to dislodge the three-term incumbent, Glenn Palmer.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke with McKinley in a coffee shop in the main street of John Day (population 1,707) . He chose a window table at the far end of the coffee house. When told that other interviewees had asked to meet here, he said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s a good spot. You can watch your back.\u201d</p> <p>Even more than in other small towns, people here seem to have a sense that they are being watched and listened to closely. Some feel the need to hold their political opinions close to their chests.</p> <p>Not so for McKinley, who has spent his whole policing career in the Grant County sheriff\u2019s office, working alongside his opponent from 2001 onwards. But over the years, his relationship with Palmer grew strained, due in part to his former boss\u2019s unusual political connections with the Patriot movement, which refers to a range of anti-government groups, including militias, tax protesters and so-called \u201csovereign citizens\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the sheriff\u2019s office [should be] more about policing and less about politics,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c810dc231c78fd3c0b6edec9c7dd575dcd5651f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c810dc231c78fd3c0b6edec9c7dd575dcd5651f/0_47_4423_2653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Todd McKinley, who is running against Glenn Palmer for office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd McKinley, who is running against Glenn Palmer for office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year, Palmer has become one of the most controversial local officials in the west after his support for \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/us/in-oregon-law-enforcement-faces-dilemma-in-confronting-armed-group.html\">constitutionalist</a>\u201d and militia groups became a topic in Oregon\u2019s media, as well as the subject of complaints by those working alongside him.<br></p> <p>After a group of armed men led by Ammon Bundy occupied the Malheur wildlife refuge in neighboring Harney County on 2 January 2016, this remote corner of Oregon became the center of <a href=\"http://www.bluemountaineagle.com/Local_News/20160113/members-of-armed-group-occupying-refuge-meet-with-grant-county-sheriff-in-john-day_\">a national story</a>.

They argue that federal agents should not arrest people or seize property \u201cwithout first notifying and obtaining the express consent of the local sheriff\u201d. </p> <p>In short, they believe that the county sheriff is the highest legal authority in the land (they even<a href=\"https://cspoa.org/about/\"> claim</a> that \u201cthe power of the sheriff even supersedes the powers of the president\u201d). In that, they share the same basic hostility to the federal government, and the same reading of the constitution, as the Malheur occupiers.</p> <p>Mack is also a board member of the <a href=\"https://www.oathkeepers.org/\">Oath Keepers</a>, a group founded in 2009 whose goal is to defend the constitution \u2013 and in particular the second amendment right to bear arms \u2013 against what they see as federal government overreach.</p> <p>More disturbingly for locals, Palmer has according to local press appointed 65 \u201cspecial deputies\u201d \u2013 far more than any other Oregon sheriff \u2013 who report directly to him. In the letter of complaint written by Lutrell, the 911 dispatch manager, she complained that Palmer had provided no list of the people he had deputized, but had said that \u201canyone that I deputize\u201d should be given access to the town\u2019s dispatch systems. </p> <p>Odd incidents have been reported involving these special deputies. In October 2015, according to Lutrell\u2019s letter, Palmer asked a forest service officer to release a man he had detained because he was a special deputy. In September this year, another deputy <a href=\"http://www.bluemountaineagle.com/Local_News/20160923/gcso-investigates-its-own-special-deputy-who-shot-a-dog-she-says-attacked-her\">shot a dog</a> in the street in Canyon City, saying it had attacked her. </p> <p>Because of this lack of transparency, some local residents were not willing to be named after talking to the Guardian, fearing possible intimidation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a41c6fd0c0be91f2f6ec7368e12b539e09f386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a41c6fd0c0be91f2f6ec7368e12b539e09f386/0_85_4572_2743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Becker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Becker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One who is less reticent is Dan Becker, a local McKinley supporter who has retired from the US Forest Service.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger here,\u201d he says of his community, explaining that Palmer, his local supporters, and his Patriot connections are trying to harness it. For them, \u201cthis is Lexington or Boston Square. This is their moment to take back what they believe America has lost or left behind. They\u2019re serious people.\u201d</p> <p>Like other local residents the Guardian talked to, he emphasizes that Palmer\u2019s hardcore supporters are small in number \u2013 the inner circle is around 20 people, including some outsiders drawn to Grant County by Palmer\u2019s reputation. </p> <p>And their biggest opportunities seem to arise from disaster.</p> <h2>\u2018Palmer knows what\u2019s right and wrong\u2019<br></h2> <p>On 14 August 2015, the Canyon Creek Complex became one of the most destructive wildfire in Oregon\u2019s history. </p> <p>In a few hours it gutted 43 homes and incinerated numerous cars, RVs, and outbuildings. It burned up 110,000 acres of giant Ponderosa pines and Douglas firs in and around Grant County\u2019s share of the Malheur national forest.</p> <p>Of those events, McKinley says: \u201cI ran the operations. We got it done and we didn\u2019t have a life lost.\u201d </p> <p>McKinley says the success in preserving local lives is evidence that cooperative relationships between between county and federal agencies help everyone. But the trauma of lost homes further soured local politics, and many ended up blaming changes in the US forest service\u2019s fire management practices. Old school strategies \u2013 such as thinning out trees with logging and clearing undergrowth \u2013 have become less prevalent as environmental values have exerted greater influence.</p> <p>In August 2015, the Guardian was present at a meeting in neighboring Prairie City at which US Forest Service officials who were preparing the community for possible evacuation were subject to sustained, hostile questioning from some residents about fire prevention.</p> <p>This blame game played into the hands of Palmer and his tight group of local, rightwing allies, who, in keeping with Patriot movement ideology, see federal land management and ownership as a usurpation of local prerogatives.</p> <p>Specifically, according to a report by the social justice thinktank Political Research Associates, Palmer and other Patriots adhere to a particular doctrine of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/2016/10/29/coordination-how-the-patriot-movement-re-imagines-governmental-ties/\">coordination</a>\u201d, which is interpreted by those hard-right groups to give local governments an equal position at the negotiating table with federal and state government agencies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a299c6778c5b24cfea9747a6b9ea186f76468f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a299c6778c5b24cfea9747a6b9ea186f76468f/51_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Canyon Creek Complex fire advanced along a canyon leading to John Day, destroying homes in the process.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Canyon Creek Complex fire advanced along a canyon leading to John Day, destroying homes in the process.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Zaitz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the fires, in September last year, Palmer deputized 11 Grant County residents to draft a <a href=\"http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/local-news/20151009/grant-county-sheriff-demands-coordination-with-forest-service\">natural resources plan</a> for county-level land management. Such a plan, developed outside county processes, is in keeping with Patriot tactics of establishing bodies which are intended to function as shadow governments pushing their own agenda. </p> <p>The plan calls for negotiations between the United States and the county \u201con a government-to-government basis\u201d in determining public land use, not mere consultation. This means the county is seen as having equal or greater authority than the federal government. </p> <p>One of those deputised to write the plan was Jim Sproul, of Prairie City. <br></p> <p>Sproul told the Guardian that the plan was intended for \u201cuse in the coordination process, which is federal law and allows local government agencies to have a meaningful say in these land use decisions\u201d. Sproul describes the writing committee as \u201ca citizens\u2019 group\u201d, adding that \u201cGlenn [Palmer] supports us 100% because he knows what\u2019s right and wrong.\u201d </p> <p>The group was small, though, and neither elected not formed by any recognized process. Members wanted to put it to a ballot, but county commissioners rejected it.</p> <p>Still, Sproul believes that if the plan were put to a ballot, it would be successful \u2013 adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing so much of a push against our sheriff.\u201d He claims the plan was shot down by commissioners because of the power of the existing consultative management body, Blue Mountains Forest Partners.</p> <p>Like his plan, Sproul thinks Palmer will prevail. \u201cHe\u2019s a constitutional sheriff \u2013 he represents the people, all of the people. He\u2019s a damn good sheriff, he\u2019s well liked, he will win this election.\u201d</p> <p>He says Palmer edged McKinley out of the sheriff\u2019s department because \u201cTodd has a problem with authority. He doesn\u2019t follow orders,\u201d pointing to his political disagreements with Palmer. </p> <p>McKinley says: \u201cI find it interesting that [Sproul] is accusing me of having an issue with authority when he was supportive of the Malheur occupiers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a0e282e274c72b317ea1920c4cd10bdfcc4558f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0e282e274c72b317ea1920c4cd10bdfcc4558f/0_32_7267_4361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oregon standoff supporters show support for the Bundys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oregon standoff supporters show support for the Bundys in front of a courthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The natural resources plan was the culmination of a longer history of conflicts between Palmer and the federal government. In 2011, he terminated a contract with the Forest Service which had seen deputies patrolling federal land in exchange for payments and the use of Forest Service facilities, such as a search and rescue helicopter.</p> <p>In his own <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3010967-GPalmer20110321.html]\">letter</a> terminating the arrangement, Palmer <a href=\"http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/article-i-section-8\">cited</a> Article I, Section 8 of the US constitution, which in part reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The federal government shall exercise authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many in the Patriot movement believe that these are the only purposes for which the federal government can acquire land. National parks, forests, wildlife reserves and public land are, they believe, simply unconstitutional. </p> <p>It is also the same fragment quoted by the occupants of the Malheur national wildlife refuge to underpin their demands that the federal government hand over control of public lands to counties.</p> <h2>Unemployment in the \u2018timber belt\u2019</h2> <p>Palmer\u2019s letter also cites \u201csocio-economic\u201d issues as a reason for breaking off the agreement \u2013 like the Bundy group, Palmer attributes the long-term decline of Grant County, and by extension the western interior, to the refusal of federal agencies to allow unbridled economic exploitation of public land.</p> <p>A public break between Palmer and McKinley arose from the latter\u2019s decision to write a letter to the local newspaper disagreeing with the sheriff\u2019s decision not to renew that contract. Palmer <a href=\"http://www.bluemountaineagle.com/free/20110421/sheriff-puts-undersheriff-on-leave\">put him</a> on administrative leave. </p> <p>The truth involves a bigger story. Grant County is in the \u201ctimber belt\u201d, an area stretching from northern California to Washington which has suffered from the disappearance of logging and milling jobs over the last four decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/us-militia-recruiting-clinton-trump-election-patriot-movement\">Extremist militias recruiting in fear of Clinton winning election, activists say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost every county in rural Oregon has shown some degree of recovery from the depths of the last recession. But according to figures from Oregon\u2019s office of economic analysis, employment in Grant County peaked in 1992, and is still around 15% down on 2003, with very few signs of improvement.</p> <p>Whereas some timber belt towns have increased in size as retirees and others move in, Grant County\u2019s demographics look a lot more typical of the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/the-graying-of-rural-america/485159/\">rest of rural America</a>. In 1980 there were 8,210 people there; in 2035 it\u2019s projected there will be just 6,785, while Oregon as a whole will have practically doubled its population to almost five million over the same period.</p> <p>Grant County is still dependent on its remaining timber mill as a private sector employer, but the future may be even bleaker than its immediate past. </p> <p>Environmental protections and more stringent management of public lands have played some role in this, but only some \u2013 more efficient milling, cheap imports, the disappearance of the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of old growth timber, and the decline of the US labor movement have also badly affected the logging industry.</p> <p>This complex misfortune heightens the temptation to blame federal agencies for local problems, says McKinley. \u201cThere\u2019s less logging, unemployment \u2013 people want to blame someone, so they blame the Forest Service.\u201d</p> <p>According to Becker, the disappearance of timber jobs from the 1980s on led many unionised, Democratic-voting mill workers to leave town. This tipped the balance further toward conservatism in a now deep-red county.</p> <p>Glenn Palmer\u2019s politics, though, go beyond mere conservatism. He\u2019s part of a gathering movement that wants to challenge the very idea of federal public lands, and Democrats have few incentives to challenge such candidates in conservative areas.</p> <p>Some of Grant County\u2019s problems come down to the fact that is it a long way from anywhere \u2013 but versions of this political dynamic are visible everywhere, to the extent that they have come to define the political landscape of 2016. In the face of change and decline, Palmer, politicians like him throughout the west, and the Patriot movement as a whole are offering their own version of the promise to make America great again. </p> <p>There aren\u2019t any polls in Grant County.

  "<p>Have we gone back to the 1930s? Could we see the return of fascism?

If Trump becomes president and keeps his promise to deport millions, parallels with Nazi Germany will inevitably be made.</p> <p>The march of far-right parties appears irresistible. Perhaps their success in Hungary and Austria, or even France, could be seen as a reversion to type, for authoritarian regimes were present there before 1945. But now the far right is advancing in the UK and US too \u2013 once seen as protected from extremism by their \u201cdemocratic cultures\u201d. There are clear parallels between the modern far right and fascism \u2013 authoritarianism, charismatic leadership, nationalism, racism, protectionism, anti-liberalism \u2026</p> <p>Yet whatever the similarities, we should think twice before interpreting the present as a re-enactment of the past.</p> <p>For one thing, fascism is notoriously hard to define. Decades of research have not enabled academics to agree on a definition. The problem is that fascism \u2013 like socialism or any other political movement \u2013 was diverse and meant different things to different people. Even if we confine our attention to those Italians who described themselves as Fascists between 1919 and 1945, we find an enormous range of views on what fascism was. Some thought that the state should be supreme, others that the party should rule. Some advocated government intervention in the economy; others wanted capitalists to be left to get on with the job. Fascists did not agree what fascism was, so it\u2019s not surprising that scholars don\u2019t either.</p> <p>The problem is even greater if we include nazism within the category of fascism. The German regime learned from Italian fascism in many ways. Yet many Nazis were contemptuous of Italians as poor soldiers, who had betrayed Germany by joining the Allies in the first world war. The Nazis were reluctant to call themselves fascists, because doing so implied that they were imitators.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/15/ali-gharib-is-trump-a-fascist\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4f4ay\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2424216\"            data-video-name=\"Ali Gharib: is Trump a fascist? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-566f5253e4b0b03f38dbbb11\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/15/ali-gharib-is-trump-a-fascist\">Ali Gharib: is Trump a fascist?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There were important differences between the regimes. True, racism was never absent from Italian fascism, especially towards Slavs, and in its imperialist war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1935/oct/03/italy.mainsection\" title=\"\">modern-day Ethiopia</a>. Yet before 1938 there was no equivalent in Italy of the Nazis\u2019 extreme antisemitism and drive for a biologically pure race. If we impose the category of fascism on nazism, we risk obscuring the importance of this antisemitic racism.</p> <p>The contemporary far right is equally diverse. Parties have different attitudes to Europe for instance, and some are more anti-democratic than others. All we can say is that some aspects of the modern far right are like some elements of fascism.</p> <p>Some modern far-right movements were designed to rehabilitate fascism \u2013 that was true of the French Front National in the 1970s, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/26/worlddispatch.france\" title=\"\">Italian Social Movement</a> (MSI) in the 1990s, but one never knows where such efforts will lead. While the FN has in some ways become more extreme, for instance on European immigration, the MSI was eventually absorbed into the mainstream right.</p> <p>If we simply see these movements as reinventions of fascism, then we risk obscuring what is specific to our own times. Italian fascists saw socialists as their chief enemies, while for the Nazis it was \u201cJudeo-Bolshevism\u201d. These days, the labour movement is in retreat, and the subculture that sustained it has largely gone. Disillusioned working-class voters in Europe and America provide a more important fund of support for the modern far right than they ever did for fascism or nazism, notwithstanding the often underestimated support of middle-class voters for the contemporary far right.</p> <p>Another major difference is that whereas fascism and nazism came to power by combining paramilitarism on the streets with electoral victories, the modern far right relies on the latter alone. Indeed, it rarely opposes democracy in principle and actually takes advantage of the discriminatory potential of democracy itself \u2013 those who do not conform to the characteristics and wishes of the \u201cmajority\u201d \u2013 judges or Muslims \u2013 are enemies of \u201cthe people\u201d.</p> <p>Ultimately, perhaps, it matters less than we might think whether Trump or any other figure is \u201cfascist\u201d in some academic sense. The real question is moral \u2013 do we see their policies as morally acceptable? And if history teaches anything, it is that people who called themselves neither fascist or Nazi were capable of complicity in repugnant acts.</p>",

  "<p>The 2016 US election has brought the nation\u2019s rifts to a point of blood-curdling, irreconcilable vitriol surely unseen since the civil war. Amid such mayhem, an accusation that artist Marina Abramovi\u0107 has been schooling senior Democrats in black magic is almost a welcome bit of light relief.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/04/marina-abramovic-podesta-clinton-emails-satanism-accusations\">Marina Abramovi\u0107 mention in Podesta emails sparks accusations of satanism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How did avant-garde art star Abramovi\u0107 get involved in America\u2019s most corrosive election season? Her name appears in the emails of John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, which have been released by WikiLeaks. In one of the messages, she invites Podesta\u2019s art-collector brother, Tony, to \u201ca spirit cooking dinner at my place\u201d and says John would be welcome, too.</p> <p>From this apparently innocuous invitation, the rightwing Drudge Report came up with the headline \u201cWiki Wiccan: Podesta practises occult magic\u201d. It reimagines Abramovi\u0107\u2019s performance art as nothing more nor less than satanic rites (well, she did once <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/16842/1/the-da-zed-guide-to-marina-abramovic\">carve a pentagram</a> into her stomach with a razor blade) and we are invited to picture her dinner party as a black sabbath of the liberal elite. Infowars, the website of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, <a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/bombshell-hillary-clintons-satanic-network-exposed/\">raves</a> that \u201cthe latest bombshell to come from WikiLeaks connects Clinton campaign head John Podesta to top occultist Marina Abramovi\u0107\u201d.</p> <p>It is fitting that as this year\u2019s surreally hyperbolic confrontation between two visions of America moves to its conclusion, art has been thrown into the noxious mix. The caricature of Abramovi\u0107 as an occultist is a parodic <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of a longstanding conservative obsession. The wicked liberal arts have been turned into a political issue by the American right before, and the demonisation of the avant-garde has actually been an important ingredient in conservatism\u2019s long march towards the refusal to accept that any liberal can ever have democratic legitimacy.</p> <p>Before the infowars came the culture wars. In the late 1980s, the rightwing Republican senator Jesse Helms launched a savage attack on America\u2019s National Endowment for the Arts, accusing it of promoting offensive and indecent art that mocked true American values. Helms <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/28/opinion/in-the-nation-art-and-indecency.html\">tried</a> to ban the use of public funds to \u201cpromote, disseminate or produce obscene or indecent materials ... or material which denigrates the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3676b3b7ca6c87c6a1632351d36814140bc14839\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3676b3b7ca6c87c6a1632351d36814140bc14839/0_0_4487_4504/996.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Mapplethorpe photograph Brian Ridley and Lyle Heeter, 1979.\" width=\"996\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Mapplethorpe photograph Brian Ridley and Lyle Heeter, 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert Mapplethorpe was the main target. His photographs \u2013 particularly his X Portfolio with its delight in sadomasochism \u2013 were demonised as a vile assault on decency, instead of the beautiful and sublime images they are. Speaking of demonisation, rightwing conspiracy theorists may want to note that like Abramovi\u0107, this sensual photographer did <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mapplethorpe-self-portrait-ar00226\">occasionally use</a> the pentagram in his work.

Coming at the end of an era in which Republicans dominated the American political mainstream, the culture war against art was a step towards the aggressive, deliberately divisive American popular right of today.</p> <p>Perhaps the strangest and most revealing thing about Republicans demonising artists, from Mapplethorpe to Abramovi\u0107, is the obvious connection between art and money. Mapplethorpe was no revolutionary \u2013 he was as American as apple pie, especially in his desire for success. Art in the 1980s was big business, and it\u2019s an even bigger business today. So in attacking it, conservatives from Helms to the Drudge Report are attacking capitalism \u2013 they are saying there are more important American values than making money. Those higher \u201ccultural\u201d values always seem to come down to hatred of minorities and difference, of course.</p> <p>Damn, I was looking for light relief. But this story about art, satanism and conspiracy theories is just another window on what has gone wrong with democracy. When you define those who disagree with you not just as political opponents but satanic acolytes of darkness, you are committed to a politics of unreason, intolerance and hate.<br></p>",

  "<p>The nightmare truly began when Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/donald-trump-in-iowa-obama-esque-campaign-but-the-same-mouthy-mogul\">threw</a> Jorge Ramos out of a press conference in August last year. Some might argue it was when he called Mexican immigrants \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">rapists</a>\u201d the month before, but the beast hadn\u2019t yet emerged, hadn\u2019t yet been given a clear face or features.</p> \n<p>\u201cGo back to Univision!\u201d Trump shouted as Ramos was escorted out of the room. The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> \n<p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> \n<p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> \n<p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out. </p> \n<p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> \n<p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality. Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee, accused Curiel, who was overseeing a class action lawsuit against Trump University, of being biased simply because of his Mexican heritage. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a66255a-cc79-416b-9f19-99ad578f5f5a\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   -\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I remember watching the debacle unfold and thinking: \u201cSo this is how he\u2019ll silence us as president.\u201d All of us. For Trump, it has never been about immigration. It\u2019s been about stoking racism against brown people, against black people, against the \u201cother\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican,\u201d Trump said of Curiel. \u201cWhich is all fine. But I say he\u2019s got bias.\u201d It harkened back to McCarthyism. This is what he meant when he said he would make America great again.</p> \n<p>Things took a dip into the absurd with the infamous Cinco de Mayo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728297587418247168?lang=en\">taco bowl tweet.</a> Trump, smiling and without irony, as if he hadn\u2019t advocated for the mass deportation of our people and hadn\u2019t called us criminals and thugs, tweeted: \u201cI love Hispanics!\u201d</p> \n<p>It was beyond parody.</p> \n<p>Today, many hope that the long nightmare is about to draw to a close. But Trump could still pull off a win. And even if he doesn\u2019t, the Trump machine will roll on, with or without him. We have on our hands a significant population of angry white citizens who blame us for all their frustrations. Things are about to get worse for us, not better.</p> \n<p>It happens in cycles. America\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">last mass deportation</a> of Latinos and Mexican Americans happened during the Great Depression. Approximately 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were rounded up and ejected from the country. And leading up to Trump, xenophobia in the Republican party was already the norm. Trump merely brought the subtext to the fore, bolded it and added several exclamation points. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster.</p> \n<p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara. </em>I used to hate the phrase, but now I think of it daily. It helps me survive the daily inanities of the election cycle, the daily ways we are dehumanized. It\u2019s not putting on a smile and pretending the bad times aren\u2019t happening. It is a radical act of survival. It is a resolute affirmation in the face of adversity: I will make it through this. I will live to see the better days.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I\u2019m having some friends over</strong> <strong>on Tuesday night to stay up and watch the US election.

Tricky choice, fellow Americans! Better flip a coin.</p> <p>Oh, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to bang on about who anyone should vote for because, frankly, if anyone out there has still not made up their mind after everything that has happened in the past year and a half, then I doubt anything you read in a <em>soi-disant </em>style column will push you over the edge. I mean, if your candidate has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/gloria-allred-lawyer-donald-trump-sexual-assault\">12 women accusing him of sexual assault</a> and he still has your loyalty then I\u2019m guessing my jokes about him resembling an Oompa Loompa won\u2019t make much difference.

Ready Britain? Seatbelts on.</p> <p>There is a certain demographic \u2013 surprisingly large! \u2013 who, for the past few months, has been fond of saying things like this to me: \u201cLook, I\u2019m a reasonable liberal person. I\u2019m a good guy! So obviously I hate Trump \u2013 OBVIOUSLY. But I also hate Clinton \u2013 OBVIOUSLY. They\u2019re as bad as each other. I guess you should vote for Clinton though, Christ, you\u2019ll have to walk through bleach afterwards. Damn you, corporate America!\u201d</p> <p>OK, so first of all, thank you so much for telling me how to vote. How on earth would I have known if it weren\u2019t for you? Oh, Trump is BAD, is he? Clinton talks to Goldman Sachs, does she? Thank you so much for Britsplaining the election to me, I really hadn\u2019t noticed! We ex-colonials have been too busy knocking back Supersize Big Gulps of blue soda to read a newspaper.</p> <p>Second, I get that a lot of people don\u2019t like Clinton. I think you\u2019ve mentioned it once or twice. But can we all please give the goddamn false equivalency a rest, please? Because you know where that gets you? It gets you into the same camp as Susan Sarandon who, only just last week, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LoGej6BqMc\">was on Newsnight</a> explaining why Trump and Clinton are as bad as each other, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s voting for Jill Stein, the Green party candidate who thinks Clinton is as dangerous as the man who claims climate change is a hoax. Isn\u2019t it sweet how Sarandon\u2019s belief that voting for third-party candidates gives her the moral upper hand has in no way been dimmed by her experience of voting for Ralph Nader in 2000? She won\u2019t vote for Clinton, Sarandon explained to Evan Davis, because \u201cI don\u2019t vote with my vagina, you know. This is bigger than that.\u201d Sometimes, even for me, the joke is just too obvious.</p> <p>So given that we settled the important matter of what to wear tonight in the first sentence, I\u2019d like to switch tack and look at a different issue, which is how to deal with any Americans who might be in your life tomorrow. Because they will be in a fragile place, wilted inside their hazmat suits and screaming at the television: \u201cNo no, wait! I didn\u2019t hear how North Carolina voted! Someone give me the final results from North Carolina!\u201d</p> <p>By and large, it\u2019s great to be American in Britain. Hell, we speak the language, and that\u2019s a huge boon, given that, for most of us, our knowledge of foreign languages is limited to, \u201cHasta la vista, baby.\u201d OK, you have to endure the occasional humiliation of seeing your nation represented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/17/huey-morgan-30-minutes-with-fun-lovin-criminals\">Huey Morgan</a> on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b081wrzp/question-time-03112016\">Question Time</a>, or Sarandon on Newsnight, but, generally, life is sweet. Yet it is hard to be away from home during an important election, which is why Americans, whatever the outcome, will need your kindness tomorrow. They\u2019ll be exhausted and emotionally spent. They may also need reminders of happier times in their homeland. So furnish them with food they ate as children \u2013 Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, Aunt Jemima\u2019s Pancakes, Hershey\u2019s Chocolate Milk, Fruit Roll-Ups. You can probably order them all by drone on Amazon these days.</p> <p>And above all, don\u2019t hector Americans about the result. Trust me, they know. Don\u2019t hector, just hug. Buckle up, guys.

  "<p>Presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years. They fit the great-man or -woman narrative of history, seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are. They erase our memory of grassroots power, direct democracy and civil society. Leaders beget followers; people pin their hopes on one person, and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office. Or, they wash their hands of any further involvement if it\u2019s not their one person. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we\u2019ve swayed outcome</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so it is this time around. With the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights, it sometimes seems as though we\u2019ve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them, and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power. The intensely personal nature of this campaign \u2013 and the particular danger of Donald Trump \u2013 has created a kind of tunnel vision.</p> <p>Which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant. Far from it. Many Clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win. I am less complacent. We\u2019ve had enough surprises this year \u2013 in Britain, in Colombia \u2013 to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them. A Trump presidency would be a terrible thing. But a Clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief, sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream. A Clinton victory, in fact, would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign. </p> <p>A politician is not a given. Each one is in part what we make them, by pushing, blocking, pressuring, encouraging, fighting, reframing, emphasizing, organizing. Every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who they\u2019ll be, for better or worse. We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we\u2019ve swayed outcomes, such as the decision to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. We forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as same-sex marriage rights.</p> <p>Election seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or decades, outside and around, below and above electoral politics. They drown out the histories that matter: how women got the vote, how the civil rights movement progressed, how the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade deal withered and died, how the World Trade Organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great 1999 shutdown in Seattle, how fracking got banned in New York State, how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse. In all these cases, the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people.</p> <p>To reiterate: it matters who is president, but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves, and what the House and Senate send them or sabotage. </p> <p>Mitt Romney promised to build the Keystone XL pipeline himself if elected; Republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil-fuel industry. Democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies, but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed. Obama wavered on that pipeline for several years. When he vetoed it, it was not because of who he is, but because of who we are, we the members of a climate movement that organized, educated, campaigned, blockaded and demonstrated for years, building a powerful movement. </p> <p>That the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did: it educated us on the science, made the case for the urgency and importance of action, built global coalitions, shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue, started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines, divest, implement efficiency and good design, and shift to renewable resources. A lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities, regions and states have done great work on climate, led by community organizers, small groups and minor politicians you\u2019ll never hear about. </p> <p>The Obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations, well-organized conservatives and big-money interests. Which is not to even raise the question of that administration\u2019s principles; it\u2019s more useful to ask what are our own, if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise. </p> <p>The same will be true of a Clinton administration, if that\u2019s the one voters choose on Tuesday. The extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it. You may feel exhausted right now; tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned (often to the detriment of policy scrutiny). But the truth is, we\u2019re at the beginning \u2013 either of a period of sustained resistance against a racist, misogynist, deranged climate-denier \u2013 or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely progressive, climate-conscious agenda. </p> <p>If we end up with a Democrat (and I regret that that\u2019s the best choice we get in this binary election), a lot is up to us. That\u2019s a gift and a responsibility. I\u2019ll take it. I hope you\u2019ll join me. </p>",
  "<p>President Donald J Trump. Imagine, if you can, beginning the trading day on Wednesday with those words ringing in your ears.

The election of the Republican candidate for president would be, like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">British vote to leave the European Union</a>, an event that \u201cis not expected, but that is very consequential, while also being very uncertain in terms of precisely what it means for us all, now and into the future\u201d.</p> <p> Given that stock markets loathe uncertainty above all else, the initial reaction to a Trump victory \u2013 as with the Brexit vote \u2013 would be a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economics-blog/2016/jun/24/the-day-brexit-pushed-the-markets-into-freefall\">stock market selloff</a>. \u201cThis kind of wave of emotionally fuelled selling could lead to the market losing between 5% to 10% in a couple of weeks or a couple of months,\u201d says Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.</p> <p> Following that poll, we saw <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-idUKKCN11B0TQ\">a kind of Brexit bounce</a>, when investors realized that Britain\u2019s departure from the United Kingdom wouldn\u2019t happen overnight and that it would take years to negotiate a new relationship with its trading partners in Europe. </p> <p> But the United States is a different kind of animal. It\u2019s a much larger market, for one thing: about a quarter of global GDP and some half of the value of all the stocks traded in the world are US companies, changing hands on US stock exchanges. Add to that the fact that a lot of investors have <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-wall-street-effect-markets-230164#ixzz4PATlxIQy\">already placed big bets</a> that Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, will prevail in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, and you\u2019ve got all the makings of a nasty market shock. The starting point for a selloff in the stock market could be 10%, and it could get worse from there, some suggest \u2013 and that shock would almost certainly be a global one, rippling outward from the peso and the Canadian dollar to the yen and European markets. </p> <p> Simon Johnson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has argued that the kind of \u201cbig adverse surprise\u201d that Trump\u2019s election would pose to the system, causing the stock market to crash, <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-consequences-of-trump-victory-by-simon-johnson-2016-10\">could prove cataclysmic</a>. Trump, whose promises to boost economic growth immediately to between 4% and 5% are \u201cpure fantasy\u201d \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s opinion \u2013 has advocated anti-trade policies that would lead to anything but growth, the economist argues. And a Trump victory? Well, that might just be enough to cause a worldwide recession, Johnson says. </p> <p> Nonetheless, some investors are preparing for the heightened risk of a Trump presidency, stocking up on cash, gold and such hedges against the US market as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/11/02/donald-trump-investors-safe-havens-german-bonds/\">German bonds</a> in their portfolios. They have done so as the political situation has become more fraught and Trump has succeeded <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/trump-narrows-polling-gap-rigged-message-512682\">in narrowing the polling gap</a> between Clinton and himself and making a Trump presidency more likely. </p> <p> Should Trump actually triumph, the immediate market shock isn\u2019t the only factor that these investors will have to consider, however. </p> <p> \u201cIn the near term, I think a Trump administration would affect business investment and hiring decisions,\u201d says Zandi, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain. \u201cNo one is sure what kind of specific policy decisions president Trump would make and businesses would pause until they got more clarity. That would slow economic growth.\u201d </p> <p>Longer term, Zandi adds, the outlook depends on what choices a president Trump would make. What form would his anti-immigration stance take? If Trump chooses to follow through on all his policies \u2013 deporting undocumented immigrants, building a wall along the Mexican border \u2013 it could shrink the size of the US economy or trigger a trade war. </p> <p>\u201cThis is what markets will worry about most,\u201d says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services. \u201cIf we were to impose tariffs or quotas on imported goods, our trading partners would likely retaliate, and our exports to those countries, like China and Mexico, would suffer.\u201d There would be no winners; global growth would slow.</p> <p> Trump has promised that he would cut taxes if elected, which sounds appealing to voters. That has the potential to give the consumer sector at least a brief jolt, to the extent that those tax cuts are significant enough to register for individual taxpayers, and if those people choose to spend their windfall. </p> <p> But Hoffman notes that Trump\u2019s tax plan is set up to <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/09/26/Trump-s-Tax-Plan-Would-Benefit-Wealthy-Most-Study-Finds\">benefit wealthy Americans most</a>. Many economists believe that changes in tax policy have less effect on spending by affluent households. There\u2019s also the pesky question of how Trump would pay for those tax cuts. \u201cHe is not at all clear how he would do that,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cDo you just run higher deficits? That would be a longer-term negative.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/aug/21/stock-market-records-ordinary-investors\">Why a surging stock market isn't making ordinary investors happy</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Still, investors who confront a Trump-induced market selloff on Wednesday morning shouldn\u2019t imagine that there are no economic upsides to his election.

  "<p>Not long after he launched his rocket of a campaign last summer, Donald Trump walked into a gathering of hardcore conservative activists in Nashville, Tennessee. Meeting a Manhattan businessman with no clear ideological discipline, the crowd could have been skeptical at best and hostile at worst. </p> <p> The National Federation of Republican Assemblies casts itself as the keeper of the flame of modern conservatives, claiming a big role in the Goldwater and Reagan revolutions that defined the party for a generation. \u201cWe are the Republican wing of the Republican party,\u201d the group likes to say.</p> <p> The group would go on to endorse Ted Cruz, but at the time members happily ignored Trump\u2019s flip-flops on abortion and his lack of religious roots to cheer on his anti-establishment war cry.</p> <p> \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a Republican.

Republicans could not afford to concede them to Democrats, and instead could win them over with an agenda of family values, faith and support for small business.</p> <p>So when Bush pushed for immigration reform in 2005, he fully expected his political capital to pay dividends. Instead, he found himself outflanked and outgunned by House Republicans and nativist hosts on conservative talk radio. A comprehensive approach died that year and a more limited version was killed two years later, just as the financial crisis was beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The crash of 2008, and the Great Recession that followed, transformed a political landscape that was already shifting against the pro-business, pro-immigration culture that once represented mainstream Republican opinion.</p> <p>Steve Schmidt was a senior staffer on Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign and in effect campaign manager of McCain\u2019s 2008 effort as the economy collapsed.

And in Latin culture the mother archetype is very powerful. In the case of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, she embodied the widow following the death of her husband, the former president N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2013 a woman in pain that men are expected to defend and protect. While Laura Chinchilla, who suffered <a href=\"http://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/130512/prejuicios-machistas-castigan-buena-gestion-de-chinchilla\">the most gender-specific attacks</a>, being younger and attractive, was accepted as the chosen one because of the patronage of former president Oscar Arias.</p> <p>My theory might be questionable and I have no way of proving it \u2013 it is based on my powers of observation as a writer and my feminine intuition. But having said that, there are two other objective factors: the extraordinary participation of women in the struggles of the 70s and 80s when dictatorial regimes in the region were confronted by popular uprisings, conspiracies and guerrilla groups.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30530da5c8fe984d0cbb32c8f18f76e7700c5cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30530da5c8fe984d0cbb32c8f18f76e7700c5cb3/186_40_1201_1501/800.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Peron, the first woman to become president in Latin America.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabel Peron, the first woman to become president in Latin America.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Di Baia/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Nicaragua, for example, the first guerrilla force that managed to liberate a major city during the 1979 insurrection was composed entirely of women. We women joined revolts and became experienced in grassroots organising, political activism, diplomacy, and combat. When it came time to build democratic societies, we claimed a place in governments and power structures. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the trend was still to have women resume their traditional roles. And because many refused to be relegated to status quo and go back to the kitchen or the practice of home economics, they focused their energy on organising powerful social movements, NGOs and feminist organisations. These strengths account for the quotas that have been adopted by 16 Latin American countries and allowed them to have o<a href=\"http://www.worldpolicy.org/latin-women-take-helm\">ne woman for every four legislators</a>. Only the Nordic countries have higher ratios.</p> <p>It is a big step to have women as presidents, but in the patriarchal structure of power we have all inherited, very often women are still forced to prove that they are as \u201ctough\u201d as the toughest of men. A woman president who would defy the masculine model of power and infuse it with the feminine ethic of caring and real equality is still in the making. Although women as Latin American leaders have many challenges ahead, they have managed to get to the right place, and now they have to be daring enough to seize or declare that it is the right time.</p> <p><em>Gioconda Belli is a Nicaraguan poet, writer and political activist</em></p> <p></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/story/tech/science/watchdog-earth/2016/10/10/trump-looks-burn-coal-1000-years/91850954/\">he wants to burn coal indefinitely</a> because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">he denies the climate change consequences</a>. Trump also wants to <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-zero-out-federal-clean-energy-56cca794790#.rdszdpyie\">eliminate government spending on clean energy and climate research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-tax-plan-now-favors-the-ultra-rich-even-more/\">cut taxes predominantly for the most wealthy</a>, build a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602494/bad-math-props-up-trumps-border-wall/\">costly and pointless border wall</a>, engage in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigration-tab-166-billion-121500\">expensive mass deportations</a>, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/trump-dodd-frank-wall-street/\">deregulate the financial industry</a>.

Unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org/lewandowskyTrumpUK.html\">we seem to have entered a post-truth era</a> in which facts simply don\u2019t matter. <br></p> <p>The two American political parties have become so different that <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13496688/swing-voters-dying-cartoon\">swing voters have virtually gone extinct</a> and most conservatives would vote for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Ed\">Mister Ed</a>, were he the Republican Party nominee. Political ideology trumps facts, truth, and reality. And Trump\u2019s support comes heavily from a single demographic: white men, mostly older and without a college degree.<br></p> <h2><strong>Trump wants to regress to the white male-dominated 1950s<br></strong></h2> <p>The Trump campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era. Based on the candidate\u2019s words and his supporters\u2019 feelings about science, women, and minorities, that era resembles the 1950s.</p> <p>In the 1950s, only about <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2000/feb/wk3/art03.htm\">one-third of women participated in the American work force</a>, and African-Americans were still fighting for equality in <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement\">the Civil Rights Movement</a>.

The tobacco industry <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf\">already knew that smoking caused cancer</a>, but used the denial playbook to keep Americans puffing.<br></p> <p>These characteristics fit the era that Trump and his supporters appear to yearn for \u2013 an era in which white men dominated American society. Older, white male Americans who comprise the core of Donald Trump\u2019s base are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/04/the-similarities-between-trump-support-and-climate-denial\">the predominant climate science-denying group in the country</a>. Social scientists theorize this is due to the group\u2019s historical societal advantages. They have benefited from the societal status quo, and hence are least concerned with risks, especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they benefited.</p> <h2><strong>Like it or not, the status quo is changing</strong></h2> <p>White, male Americans are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages. As minority populations grow, they\u2019re losing their grip on the American majority. The first racial minority president was elected and re-elected. Women are <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm\">approaching even footing with men in the labor force</a>. Even social norms are changing, for example with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">gay marriage becoming legal</a>.</p> <p>And of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/21/global-warming-continues-2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-ever-recorded\">the Earth\u2019s climate itself is changing rapidly</a> due to human-caused global warming, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/24/the-atmosphere-is-being-radicalized-by-climate-change\">causing all sorts of negative consequences</a>.

But like every country, there are also dark periods in its past; for example, in the treatment of minorities and women as second-class citizens.

  "<p>At a cost of $1bn to put a chill in the air during Texas Rangers games, it would surely go down as the sports world\u2019s most expensive air-conditioning bill.</p> <p>Voters in the city that is home to the Rangers go to the polls on Tuesday to decide whether to finance a new Major League Baseball stadium that would replace a popular facility that is barely two decades old.</p> <p>The election raises the question of how much a team is really worth to its community, and whether, just a few days after 102-year-old Wrigley Field basked in the World Series spotlight, stadiums are becoming almost as disposable as their corporate naming rights.</p> <p>Globe Life Park, then known as the Ballpark in Arlington, opened in 1994 for less than $200m when a certain George W Bush was the club\u2019s managing general partner. Local taxpayers were on the hook for most of the cost. <a href=\"https://theringer.com/the-rangers-stadium-was-arlington-s-crown-jewel-now-the-team-wants-a-new-one-69251a60a854#.pkbhzwgt6\">As The Ringer pointed out</a>, Bush called it a \u201cmonument to baseball\u201d and the team president at the time said it was being built \u201cfor 100 years\u201d. It may not last 30. These days the team is emphasising what it lacks: air-conditioning, a retractable roof and capacity crowds. The Rangers want to move to a new, smaller, stadium across the street by 2021, even though eight years remain on their deal to play at Globe Life.&#xa0;</p> <p>The project\u2019s cost is estimated at $1bn.&#xa0;Voters must decide if Arlington will contribute $500m through sales, hotel and car rental taxes (a model used for the current ballpark and the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 adjacent home) with the team responsible for any cost overruns.</p> <p>The heat and humidity can undoubtedly be oppressive, and the Rangers\u2019 average attendance this year of 33,461 was some 15,000 below capacity, even though the team were the runaway winners of the American League West. &#xa0;But the park still looks smart and is one of MLB\u2019s more visually appealing venues both inside and out, with a design that evokes old-time charm and Texan touches such as giant stone longhorns on the facade. The Cowboys play only half a mile away at AT&amp;T Stadium; Arlington funded about a quarter of that arena\u2019s $1.2bn cost.</p> <p>\u201cThe perceived shelf life of stadiums is getting shorter and shorter. It used to be that if you had a stadium that wasn\u2019t at least 30 or 40 years old you had to be crazy to propose building a new one. But now all kinds of teams are proposing that,\u201d said Neil deMause, co-author of a book on publicly-funded stadiums, Field of Schemes.<br>\u201cSuddenly the idea of what\u2019s considered obsolete has gotten reframed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just about at what point do you have the chutzpah to demand a new one?\u201d</p> <p>Andy Prior, media liaison for the Save Our Stadium campaign, expects a close outcome on Tuesday. Last month a WFAA/Fort Worth Star-Telegram poll found <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/arlington/article108660682.html\">respondents were split evenly</a>, with 42% for and 42% against.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/texas-high-school-football-stadiums\">Only in Texas: can $70m on a high school football stadium ever be justified?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m a third-generation Rangers fan and when I heard [the plans] on the news way back in the beginning of May, early June, I was really flabbergasted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the Texas Rangers here in Arlington for 45 years now, it\u2019s always been played outdoors, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the current ballpark, it\u2019s one of the best in the major leagues.\u201d</p> <p>The cult of the new stadium is not restricted to baseball. The Georgia Dome has twice hosted the Super Bowl since it opened in 1992. But next year <a href=\"http://news.wabe.org/post/georgia-dome-downtown-atlanta-be-imploded-next-year\">it is scheduled to be reduced to rubble</a>, the site destined to be a parking lot for Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the new home of the Atlanta Falcons NFL franchise.</p> <p>In general these days, DeMause said, \u201cI think there\u2019s a little bit more awareness and a little bit more public opposition just because some of the demands are getting so outrageous because the timespan\u2019s so short. I think the fact that the Arlington vote is expected to be close is significant because this is a city that has voted before with no problem for stadium subsidies and it\u2019s a campaign where the Rangers and the stadium advocates are outspending the opponents tremendously.\u201d</p> <p>Changing fan expectations, the growth in luxury seating and the success of the new-retro Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the early 90s helped inspire a ballpark construction boom. Only 10 current ballparks are older than the Rangers\u2019. Of the 30 major league stadiums, half have been built this millennium if we include SunTrust Park, the Atlanta Braves\u2019 new digs from 2017. They are leaving Turner Field after only 20 years, also for a smaller venue.</p> <p>\u201cAm I happy that they\u2019re going to have a new ballpark? Well, if it makes them bigger, better and more competitive, sure. But I was stunned when I heard that a deal had been cut fairly quickly and behind the scenes for a ballpark to be built in Arlington years and years and years before the current deal ends,\u201d said Michael Cramer, the Rangers\u2019 president from 2002-04.</p> <p>\u201cStructure is good, viewing lines are good, there\u2019s plenty of room for concessions and places to sell merchandise, plenty of suites. It had all of the features that you never would have found in the old breed of ballparks,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say they\u2019re doing it to be competitive because it\u2019s hot in Texas? Wait a minute, they didn\u2019t know it was hot in Texas in 1993?\u201d</p> <p>Still, Cramer understands Arlington\u2019s desperation to ensure the club stays in the city and believes it will be able to absorb the costs. \u201cIf I were a voter I would vote for this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Arlington\u2019s mayor, Jeff Williams, is spearheading the campaign for <a href=\"http://www.keeptherangers.com\">a \u201cyes\u201d vote on 8 November</a>. He argues that the plan does not call for new taxes; <a href=\"http://www.keeptherangers.com\">detractors call this claim misleading</a>, since taxes that would have ceased would instead continue.</p> <p>At issue is not only fans\u2019 perspiration tolerance levels but the fear that a \u201cno\u201d will encourage the team to leave, dealing a blow to the local economy and the city\u2019s prestige. <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/10/29/rangers-ballpark-vote-arlington-hinges-faith-econo/\">Williams told the Texas Tribune</a> that if the Rangers go elsewhere, Arlington will lose out on $77m in annual economic impact and 2.5 million visitors per year.</p> <p>In a metropolitan area of about seven million people over an area of roughly 9,000 square miles \u2013 larger than the state of New Jersey \u2013 there is no shortage of space or ambitious municipalities. The Rangers and Dallas have flirted with the possibility of joining the city\u2019s NHL and NBA sides downtown, though without any indications the relationship might get serious.</p> <p>But Arlington, a functional place of 390,000 people between Dallas and Fort Worth, lacks tourist appeal beyond its sports teams and an amusement park. It is understandable that the city is so eager to keep a team it has hosted since 1972, and also that many locals would balk at the cost.

They have closed down more than 200 media outlets and publishing houses, more than 100 universities and hospitals, and expelled 100,000 teachers, academics and civil servants.

They caused a great deal of harm while working together, but now they are fighting each other. Having got rid of G\u00fclenist elements, the government is now coming down hard on the more traditional foes: Kurds, Alawites, secularists and socialists.</p> <p>The newspaper Cumhuriyet, known for its secular stance, is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/turkey-detains-editor-and-staff-at-opposition-cumhuriyet-newspaper\" title=\"\">government\u2019s latest target</a>.

This is a clear message from the government that they will punish any kind of dissent.

At the time, no TV channel in Turkey covered the protests. In fact, one of the biggest news channels was broadcasting a documentary about penguins while whole streets in Istanbul were filled with people clashing with police. Since then, the phrase \u201cpenguin media\u201d has been commonly understood in my country.</p> <p>The government exercise a pernicious influence over Turkish broadcasters, meaning that people have turned their attention towards social media platforms and independent websites to get their news.

The latest development was the arrest of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/turkey-arrests-pro-kurdish-party-leaders-mps\" title=\"\">Selahattin Demirta\u015f and Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f</a>, co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish party HDP, alongside some of their MPs, on Friday.

During both incidents, the internet was cut off and social media accounts were out of reach across the country.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan recently extended the state of emergency and is using it to the advantage of the ruling party. The AKP now has \u201clegal\u201d permission to bypass parliament and rule by decree. For example, they recently removed the rights of universities to appoint their own rector in free elections. From now on, Erdo\u011fan himself will appoint the head of each university.</p> <p>While all of these things are happening in Turkey, most people are unaware of them due to media restrictions and bias. The majority of TV channels won\u2019t cover certain stories or will broadcast them in a distorted way. On the other hand, these channels will live broadcast all of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speeches, as was the case on 12 January this year when a suicide bomb attack killed 10 tourists in Istanbul. Erdo\u011fan gave a speech on the same day and dedicated a mere 44 seconds to the tragedy without mentioning the attacker\u2019s link to Isis. However, he spoke for exactly 10 minutes about Academics for Peace, a group of university teachers who signed a declaration demanding a peaceful solution to the Kurdish conflict.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/16/turkey-media-repression-general-mayhem-erdogan\">General Mayhem guides Turkey\u2019s media repression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Erdo\u011fan accused them of sympathising with terrorists and of threatening Turkey\u2019s national security.

Energy experts have predicted a severe downturn in Florida\u2019s already struggling solar industry, should the measure pass.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The idea of a national price on carbon was shot down early in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, but the state of Washington may follow a different path. A measure called I-732 calls for the establishment of the first carbon tax in the US, which would cost emitters $25 for each ton of carbon dioxide from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100 a ton. The revenue-neutral idea has, however, split the environmental movement, with some activists unhappy that it does not funnel money to clean energy projects.</p> <h2>Slavery</h2> <p>The 13th amendment of the US constitution abolished slavery \u2013 for the most part.

The movement faces decisions on election day, when Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington will vote on whether to increase minimum wages above the $7.25 federal rate. </p> <p>An outlier is South Dakota, where voters will hold a referendum on whether to lower the minimum wage for workers under age 18. In November 2014, South Dakotans voted to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50, with an annual cost-of-living increase. State legislators then decided to pass a law taking away the wage increase for youth under 18. Opponents of the two-tiered system gathered signatures to place it on the ballot, and now voters will have another shot at addressing the question. </p> <p>Of course, everyone who votes on the minimum wage is eligible for the higher one. South Dakotans under the age of 18 will not have a say on the matter.</p> <h2>Homelessness</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c6d07a20298878bdbb6180ff62cf6d34d18cd17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c6d07a20298878bdbb6180ff62cf6d34d18cd17/0_220_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco homeless\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man stands outside his tent on Division Street in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Homelessness is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/10/san-francisco-state-of-emergency-homelessness-crisis\">crisis</a> in many west coast cities, and some are taking to the ballot to try to make a difference. </p> <p>Los Angeles is hoping to make a $1.2bn investment over 10 years in support of housing units and programs through the issuance of bonds.

Day told an official of the finance department on January 25 2016 that, in the complicated financial arrangements surrounding the building, that he, Day, retained the loan from the National Australia Bank. </p> <p>He told the department that Fullarton Investments was to receive rent from the commonwealth to cover Day\u2019s occupancy in the building \u201cthen make vendor payments to me using those funds. No rent, no vendor finance payments,\u201d Day tells finance official <strong>Shane McGaughey </strong>on 25 January.<br></p> <p>Then there is correspondence between the special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, and Day in early August. </p> <p>In this correspondence Day characterises the arrangements with the building in the following terms:<strong> \u201cI have an agreement with someone else who has an agreement with the crown.\u201d</strong> This explanation is provided by Day to Ryan in the event \u201cthe department pulls the pecuniary interest card\u201d.</p> <p>In this email on 7 August, Day says he has spoken to finance about the pecuniary interest issue, and told them it isn\u2019t relevant.<br></p> <p>Ryan clearly disagrees with this and seeks further advice. Day also furnishes him with further particulars. </p> <p>In this email exchange on 29 August, Day says he has not been given clear advice by either the department, or by the special minister of state when he was elected in 2013 (which was <strong>Michael Ronaldson</strong>) on the problems associated with him having some kind of financial relationship with the building which houses his electoral office.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Day</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Their advice basically centred on the principle that it was \u201cnot a good look\u201d for a senator to own his or her own office.

Day gave a guarantee to the bank over the mortgage so that essentially if the commonwealth doesn\u2019t pay rent to the company that owned the building, Day or his trust has to pay.<br></p> <p>Ryan said that may lead to the conclusion that Day has an indirect pecuniary interest in the lease, which would make him ineligible to be in the Senate.

The result of the plebiscite would be determined by whether more than 50% of the votes cast are in favour or not in favour of the plebiscite proposal under clause 6 of the bill. The bill would also provide that, should this bill become an act, the writ for the plebiscite must be issued within 120 days after the act commences.</li> <li>Clause 15 of the <strong>bill would require the establishment of two committees, each comprising five members of Parliament and five citizens.

Each committee will have two government members (one of whom will be the chair), two opposition members and one crossbench member. Each committee would receive $7.5m in public funding to conduct official yes and no campaigns and the ability to receive up to $1,500 in tax deductible gifts from donors. </li> <li>The Electoral Commission will be responsible for overseeing the vote under clause 7 to ensure Australian voters are informed about the procedural elements of the plebiscite, <strong>the Electoral Commission will prepare and distribute to households in Australia general information about how to vote in the plebiscite</strong>.

They have been pushing relentlessly on the issue recently \u2013 along with the Australian newspaper \u2013 with nary a peep out of the other end of the Coalition, some of whom represent some diverse seats. </p> <p>For example, <strong>Craig Laundy</strong>, the Liberal MP for Reid, represents one of the most diverse seats in Australia. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/liberals-break-ranks-against-george-brandis-race-hate-law-20140409-zqsrt.html\">He spoke out at the time</a> against changes to the Racial Discrimination Act but, in more recent times, moderates in the Libs have been trying not to give the cons oxygen on the issue.</p> <p>Now the mods are getting restless.

(Who is counting?) Members are streaming back into the House. As I fell in the Senate doors in a mess of earphones streaming <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> from ABC AM, I almost ran into the other Malcolm, smiling sweetly next to the security check. <strong>Malcolm Roberts</strong>\u2019 office has released an alert for a press conference for One Nation at 9am. This causes reporters to prick up their ears because One Nation senator<strong> Rod Culleton</strong> is expected to be referred to the high court this morning for a ruling on his eligibility. Former Family First senator <strong>Bob Day</strong> will also be referred. Will One Nation be talking about the future of Culleton, shearer of sheep and key collector? We shall await the hour of nine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, your prime minister has been on ABC AM. <br></p> <p>There are a couple of news points.</p> <p>Turnbull says if he accepted that the boats had stopped he would fall into the complacency that hit <strong>Kevin Rudd</strong>. It\u2019s a more challenging environment \u2013 with social media \u2013 than <strong>John Howard</strong> faced, says Turnbull.<br></p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> is pandering to the left of his party on speaking out against the lifetime ban on asylum seekers who have come by boat, says the <strong>prime minister</strong>. (Shorten has yet to commit to voting against the legislation).</p> <p>Turnbull moves on to 18C. His words are a bit mashed but I will relay as much as possible so you can see the nuance. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ... has been, and <strong>I have sympathy for this argument</strong>... there is a view ... the bar that is set is too low. In other words, in particular that prescribing conduct which insults and offends is too much a restriction on free speech. You\u2019re obviously trying to get the balance between ensuring that we maintain the courteous discourse and debate that again, mutual respect that underpins our strong multicultural society and, on the other hand, freedom of speech, which is of critical importance in a democracy. <strong>I think the Human Rights Commission has done a great deal of harm to its credibility by bringing the case against the Queensland students.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>There was a lot more in that interview which I will bring you shortly but let\u2019s get this wheel spinning. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong> has been chasing the PM down corridors.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Melbourne.<br></p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Mike Katz (synths), Graeme Pogson (drums), Tamil Rogeon (electric strings).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Just imagine, right, that in a couple of days\u2019 time someone with risible hair was the de facto leader of the free world, in charge of the nuclear codes, and, according to most objective assessments, a dangerous sociopath. (\u201cBut enough about Hillary Clinton.\u201d Arf.) You might want to obliterate your senses with some good old-fashioned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_MUdmwY5io\">Swedish death metal</a>. Alternatively, you might opt for something more lightly escapist: some heady, twinkling jazz-inflected disco-funk, perhaps, redolent of happier times \u2013 the early 80s, say, when the cold war was on. Anyway, if you are in a pre-apocalyptic mood, gripped by panic and dread, you need to hear what Melbourne DJ/producer Mike Katz does as Harvey Sutherland &amp; Bermuda. It\u2019s the sound of Rhodes piano, \u201celectric\u201d (ie, synth) strings, real drums, and party-till-the-bomb-drops handclaps, all deployed in the service of some of the most mesmerising instrumental passages and sublime melodies you\u2019ve heard since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xXhJ2agJCg\">Arthur Russell</a> teamed up with Kool and the Gang, which he didn\u2019t but he didn\u2019t need to because now we\u2019ve got Sutherland and his two associates (that\u2019ll be Bermuda) doing it for us. </p> <p>Sutherland calls this live-band offshoot of his studio-based electronic work \u201clounge-room disco burners\u201d. There are echoes here of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jan/08/popandrock\">Hercules and Love Affair</a>. That is, real musicians locking together \u2013 getting \u201cin the pocket\u201d, to use the parlance of the day. In fact, Sutherland\u2019s homage-paying to his beloved golden age of club music extends to his own use of funk vernacular. \u201cPocket is essential,\u201d he says when asked whether he is trained in muso proficiency or if you have to have a degree to play with Harvey Sutherland and chums. \u201cI have no formal training, just a bit of time spent learning my <a href=\"http://piano.about.com/od/chordskeys/ss/piano_chords_min9.htm\">minor 9ths</a>,\u201d he , explaining his forays as a solo artist versus his setup with Bermuda. \u201cPlaying solo, it\u2019s more programmed drums and 808 club tracks, with improvised synthesiser loops and solos. But the band is a heavy disco excursion with a one-man electric string section and deep-pocket live drums. I just hold on for dear life behind a couple of keyboards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"HSB\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/270687407%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-uUehr&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Whatever, it works. The song Bermuda \u2013 like all of Sutherland and his eponymous outfit\u2019s output, an instrumental and one of Spotify\u2019s Top 10 viral tracks last year \u2013 is a shimmering gem. It\u2019s a lattice of lush, jazzy keyboards, burbling bass and funk-tional groove, with an upwards-spiralling synth motif reminiscent of rappers\u2019 delight Summer Madness by the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SFt7JHwJeg\">Kool</a>. Things take a turn for the cosmic on Bamboo. If you didn\u2019t know, you might assume this stuff was recorded back in the day. Priestess has a bleep and polish that makes it sound more recent - more late- than early-80s, with a Detroit techno sheen and some Chicago house piano. Nine minutes long and languorous, it evolves slowly, with a hypnotic quality that is positively psychedelic. Melody is key: Katz is more into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DavckVZylkg\">George Duke</a> than he is George Clinton. Meanwhile, his keyboard lines dovetail magnificently with drummer Graeme Pogson\u2019s relentless four-on-the-floor rhythms and Tamil Rogen\u2019s sky-caressing strings. Bravado could be a lost Isley Brothers B-side from the 70s, while Nexus sounds like the backing track to Patrice Rushen\u2019s 1982 postdisco classic <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amzp7W0RkPA\">Forget Me Nots</a>. Like a lot of disco music designed ostensibly for the dancefloor, Sutherland\u2019s compositions strike an unexpected wistful note, capturing \u2013 as New Order and Pet Shop Boys did with their best music \u2013 the ineffable sadness of this social ritual. New Paradise is full of moments \u2013 a dancing, playful synth pattern here, a wash of keyboards there \u2013 that seem to acknowledge the irony (or is that poignancy?) of such goodtime music being tinged with melancholy. </p> <p>Still, there\u2019s nothing sad about Australia\u2019s neo-disco-funk scene. We mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/20/harts\">Harts</a> and Flight Facilities to Katz, and he gets competitive: \u201cRaise you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keoPx6uOo_Q\">Krakatau</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMAs5guaaTU\">Sui Zhen </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RZzm2q4w0\">Sampa the Great</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot happening out here.\u201d And now here\u2019s Katz as alter ego Harvey Sutherland, whose superhero power is generating heat on the dancefloor. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I play solo, it\u2019s a gamble,\u201d he says, assessing the effects of his lovely music on audiences. \u201cCrowd engagement is the difference between a good and a great show, so when they\u2019re connected with what you\u2019re doing, you can take improvisational risks and enjoy the experience a lot more. I can\u2019t usually see the couples from the front, but there were some beautifully sweaty, shirts-off dancefloor moments in Tokyo.\u201d When asked who his most famous fan/Twitter follower/celebrity stalker is, he replies, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/dam-funk-snoop-dogg-stones-throw-hudson-mohawke-ariel-pink\">Dam Funk</a>,\u201d adding: \u201cLike him, I\u2019m not interested in fame.

Hillary and Bill Clinton earned $10.6m in 2015, according to a tax filing released by her campaign. Trump has not, to date, released any recent tax returns., 11:B - Trump's comments came after David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, urged sympathisers to back Trump's campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. I don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,\u201d Trump added., 12:C - Hillary Clinton won with 2,814 \u2013 2,205 pledged delegates and 609 superdelegates, 13:B - Speaking during a visit to his Turnberry golf course, Trump said: \u201cYou see it all over Europe and many other cases where they want to take their borders back. They want to take their monetary [sic] back. They want to take a lot of things back. They want to have a country again. I think you are going to have this more and more. I really believe that.

  "<p>Sharks are circling as the US prepares to vote, on the lookout for signs of American weakness and indecision around the world during the months-long transition period until the next president is firmly established in the White House. Call it a window of vulnerability.</p> <p>No matter whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, Barack Obama bequeaths a world fraught with danger. From Asia to the Middle East and eastern Europe, governments and forces hostile to US and the west <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/01/no-time-to-lose-why-the-next-president-must-move-quickly-to-reassert-u-s-power/\">may try to exploit America\u2019s power vacuum</a>. </p> <p>The problem is not new. Unlike in Britain, the US constitution does not allow a quick handover. Clinton or Trump will be sworn in at noon on 20 January 2017. Until then Obama remains in office, but as a \u201clame duck\u201d president his wishes are increasingly irrelevant.</p> <p>Once installed, it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments. The most important, such as national security adviser and the secretaries of defence and state, must be confirmed by Congress. This can be a contentious, lengthy process.</p> <p>The most disastrous transition was probably in 1860-61 between James Buchanan and his successor, Abraham Lincoln. During the interregnum, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths-about-why-the-south-seceded/2011/01/03/ABHr6jD_story.html\">seven states seceded from the Union</a>. When Lincoln came to office, he found the civil war already under way. </p> <p>Modern-day threats are mostly external (although some Trump supporters warn of domestic insurrection if he loses). North Korea is one of the most pressing. The dictatorship in Pyongyang has recklessly escalated its nuclear weapons programme in recent months.</p> <p> North Korea\u2019s latest provocations include the testing of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/north-korea-tests-submarine-launched-ballistic-missile\">submarine-launched ballistic missile</a> capable, in theory, of attacking the western US. The isolated regime has ignored stepped-up UN sanctions and is hardening its stance, determined to prove it is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37869993\"> Political upheavals in South Korea</a>, where the president faces pressure to resign, a tougher military posture adopted by Shinzo Abe\u2019s rightwing government in Japan, and the reluctance of China to crack down on its renegade ally add to a sense of growing instability. </p> <p> If Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s unpredictable leader, senses uncertainty in Washington, he may be tempted to fire a shot, literally or metaphorically, across the greenhorn president\u2019s bows \u2013 with incalculable consequences.</p> <p> China faces similar temptations. It has been sparring with the US navy in the South China Sea, where its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">expansionist maritime claims</a> and island-building have been ruled illegal by a UN court. Beijing is also squeezing Taiwan, whose new government its dislikes and whose de facto independence is underwritten by the US. </p> <p> Does Xi Jinping, China\u2019s all-powerful president, calculate he can use American distraction to his advantage? Some analysts suggest Xi would welcome a Trump presidency, because he and Trump think alike about national interest. Or maybe, scarily, he takes Trump for a fool he can bamboozle.</p> <p> Such considerations also loom large in the Middle East, where Russia seems intent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/aleppo-braces-russian-assault-rebels-vow-defy-putin-ultimatum\">helping the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad win the civil war</a> before the next American president has a chance to change Obama\u2019s hands-off policy or impose peace terms. </p> <p> In lawless Libya, where UN efforts to foster a unity government are failing, more nasty surprises may be in store. If Islamic State is evicted from Raqqah and Mosul, Libya may become its new centre of operations. The Yemen conflict, involving Iran and Saudi Arabia, is another powder keg.</p> <p> Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s leader, could also use the US power vacuum to consolidate or advance Moscow\u2019s interests, as defined by the Kremlin, in Ukraine and the Baltic region, where tensions are already high. </p> <p> How would Nato respond, for example, to increased Russian military activity and cyber warfare along the border with Estonia or Latvia? The alliance would, as usual, look to Washington for a lead. But one might not be forthcoming.</p> <p> Trump regularly disparages Nato, suggesting he may cut US support, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37858513\">like other macho men such as actor Steven Seagal</a>, appears to admire Putin.
