If you are director of the FBI, you should be able to stop that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s immediate FBI woes ended on Sunday with a letter whose five sentences signaled that James Comey\u2019s troubles have only begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">FBI director: new Hillary Clinton emails show no criminal wrongdoing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The director of the FBI has come under withering, escalating and relentless criticism since he sent Congress a vague letter, on 28 October, heralding a potential re-examination of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. The original inquiry ended in July, after months of officials scouring Clinton\u2019s communications while secretary of state, with the conclusion that her practices were \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal.</p> <p>On Sunday, Comey brought what many viewed as a frightening FBI intervention into a presidential election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">to a close</a>. The Democratic presidential nominee will not face an FBI recommendation for indictment over her stewardship of classified information.</p> <p>Whether or not Comey endangered his position at the head of the FBI, the episode has cost him his chief asset: his reputation, cultivated assiduously in the media, for probity and judgment. Beyond the director himself, the coda to the Clinton email inquiry has exposed the FBI as a politicized agency, a development with serious repercussions over the next several years. </p> <p>Donald Trump spent much of the summer and fall attacking the FBI as \u201ccorrupt\u201d for failing to recommend indictment, only to reverse himself entirely after Comey\u2019s October letter. Now that Comey has ended the issue ahead of the election, the director has demonstrated himself to be an unreliable ally to Trump, who has <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fe4c21e8e44146b2abcaba857563d11f/trump-touts-his-loyalty-defending-campaign-manager\">loudly insisted</a> on complete loyalty around him. Should Trump win the election, Comey is likely to find himself either marginalized or unemployed. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, Comey\u2019s position is unlikely to be much better. </p> <p>Sources within the FBI have pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump\">deep, visceral antipathy to Clinton</a> within the bureau, as well as substantial support for Trump. Comey\u2019s earlier decision to publicly recommend no charges had spurred anger among FBI employees disposed negatively toward her, and Comey\u2019s newest letter changes none of that sentiment. Now Comey has restored that status quo ante, again frustrating anti-Clinton sentiments in his workforce. This time, however, he has seen his allies in Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">abandon him</a>, depriving Comey of a bulwark against his rank-and-file.</p> <p>The loss of that bulwark is critical, and will likely become visible in the near future. Beyond the email inquiry, the FBI also has had the Clinton Foundation, the family\u2019s charity, under some form of scrutiny.</p> <p>Once again, Comey is in a bind. FBI sources have already leaked that allegations against the foundation are <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-claims-evidence-fbis-clinton-foundation-probe-impressive/story?id=43282736\">weak</a>, given their source in a book by a far-right author who provides little evidence. Should the FBI fail to recommend another indictment, Trump\u2019s voters and congressional Republicans will presume bias in the bureau \u2013 particularly since those Republicans have already stated intentions to keep a hypothetical Clinton White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\">under persistent investigation</a>. Should the FBI recommend indictment, Clinton\u2019s voters and congressional Democrats will presume Comey acted for political reasons, or caved to such motives within the bureau. </p> <p>Comey may very soon himself be under investigation. Al Franken, a Minnesota senator on the judiciary committee with direct oversight of the FBI, said early Sunday he was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/al-franken-fbi-james-comey-hearings/index.html\">certain</a>\u201d of forthcoming hearings into Comey\u2019s actions. After the latest letter, Senator Dianne Feinstein, another judiciary committee Democrat and a consistent ally of the security agencies, said she found Comey\u2019s intervention \u201ceven more troubling\u201d. Feinstein also called for a justice department review.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/donald-trump-fbi-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aqff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873409\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton and the FBI: \u2018She\u2019s protected\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP/Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581fb62be4b0d073c27d214c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/donald-trump-fbi-hillary-clinton-video\">Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton and the FBI: \u2018She\u2019s protected\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Clinton herself has pointedly declined to say whether she would retain Comey if she is elected. She too faces a political dilemma, even in the event of victory on Tuesday, since firing Comey could turn the director into a martyr for opponents on the right. Clinton\u2019s chief aides are notorious for their long memories, however, and her White House would likely view the FBI as a threat, or at least with extreme distrust. Her appointment of an attorney general would consequently fall under intense questioning about any tacit mandate to contain the bureau. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey: Hillary Clinton email inquiry is FBI chief's latest controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comey\u2019s political imbroglio coincides with his attempt to persuade Congress that sophisticated commercial encryption poses a security threat. He has now lost his chief weapon in that debate, the benefit of the doubt: FBI intervention into a presidential election has made fears of an assertive law enforcement and intelligence agency deciding the national agenda more salient than any PR campaign from privacy advocates ever could. </p> <p>It is a spectacular fall for Comey. He built his public persona as the man who stood up to pressure from George W Bush\u2019s White House over mass surveillance. The real story, hidden from public view until Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks, showed Comey to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/james-comey-justice-department-data-monitoring\">significantly less heroic</a>, but the persona was enough to persuade Barack Obama to elevate him to run the FBI weeks after the Guardian began publishing material Snowden disclosed. After Comey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple\">picked a fight with Apple</a> over encryption and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/28/apple-fbi-case-dropped-san-bernardino-iphone\">lost</a>, his judgment appeared shaky.</p> <p>Now Comey has committed an unforced error that has drained his reservoir of goodwill in Washington. With the FBI\u2019s integrity in the balance, Comey faces several difficult months, if not years, in Washington, regardless of the country\u2019s vote in two days.</p>",

The appearance with James followed stops in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.</p> <p>The campaign also confirmed her schedule for the day prior to the election, with two stops in Pennsylvania \u2013 including a rally in Philadelphia with former president Bill Clinton and Barack and Michelle Obama \u2013 a visit to Michigan and a final rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, at midnight.</p> <p>Trump unveiled an itinerary that resembled a mad dash for 270 electoral votes. The Republican was scheduled to hit Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/trump-campaign-clinton-panic-losing-blue-states\">Democratic stronghold of Minnesota</a>.</p> <p>Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said the contrast was a testament to the many paths open for Clinton to clinch victory on 8 November, and a culmination of a ground game and turnout operation built over the last 18 months.</p> <p>\u201cThis demonstrates the enormous amount of room we have to maneuver in the map,\u201d Mook told reporters aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane on Saturday. \u201cWe are slowly building up a lead that will be harder and harder for Donald Trump to overcome.</p> <p>\u201cI think looking at Trump\u2019s schedule versus our schedule is pretty emblematic of how we\u2019re approaching this strategically. Trump is basically going everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Many of Clinton\u2019s activities in the final days centered on galvanizing black voters and young voters. While African American voters overwhelmingly support Clinton, she is struggling to meet the turnout enjoyed by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>The event with James, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/03/lebron-james-endorses-hillary-clinton-in-emotionally-charged-declaration\">endorsed Clinton</a> in an op-ed last month, was one of Clinton\u2019s highest-profile rallies yet. On Friday, she appeared at a get-out-the-vote concert with Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9, also in Cleveland. Beyonc\u00e9 appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/beyonce-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">version of Clinton\u2019s trademark suit</a> to deliver a message focused on the candidate\u2019s appeal to female voters.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time when a woman\u2019s opinion did not matter,\u201d she said. \u201cLess than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we\u2019ve come, from having no voice to being on the brink of making history. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country, and know that her possibilities are limitless. And that is why I\u2019m with her.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton capped off Saturday at yet another star-studded event, this time a concert with Katy Perry in Philadelphia that also saw actress Debra Messing, director Shonda Rhimes and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright in attendance. Perry, whose hit song Roar is a staple at Clinton\u2019s rallies, has campaigned in several critical swing states.</p> <p>She told the roughly 10,000 fans in Philadelphia that her parents were lifelong Republicans. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about where you come from, it\u2019s about what you grow into,\u201d she said.<br><br>Rhimes, creator of Scandal and Grey\u2019s Anatomy, implored those gathered to translate their enthusiasm into action at the polls on Tuesday. \u201cY\u2019all know I make a lot of TV. But here\u2019s the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cAmerica is not a TV show. America is real. And so is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign said it had seen an increase in voting among African Americans, but also touted record early voting among another core Democratic constituency: Hispanic voters. In Florida and Nevada, both key swing states, turnout among Hispanic voters surged in recent days.</p> <p>One analysis of voting in Florida said Clinton was poised for a historic 30-point advantage among such voters. In Nevada, early voting in one county remained open until 10pm on Friday night, to accommodate a mostly Hispanic crowd who queued up for at least two hours to cast their ballots. For many, it was an opportunity not simply to show their support for Clinton but also to block Trump, who has routinely made disparaging comments about Hispanic immigrants, from the White House.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/i-just-wanted-to-show-a-sign-protester-relives-trump-fans-attack-at-nevada-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5apfn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2872688\"            data-video-name=\"'I just wanted to show a sign': protester relives Trump fans' attack at Nevada rally \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581ec0ade4b029b92ca45f6c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106trumpprotester_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161106trumpprotester.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161106trumpprotester_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/i-just-wanted-to-show-a-sign-protester-relives-trump-fans-attack-at-nevada-rally-video\">\u2018I just wanted to show a sign\u2019: protester relives Trump fans\u2019 attack at Nevada rally</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>During her final stop in Florida on Saturday, Clinton stopped by an early voting site in a West Miami neighborhood dominated by Hispanic voters to thank them for their support.

  "<p>When I was a girl of 11 I had an argument with my father that left my psyche maimed. It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">James Comey: FBI has found no criminal wrongdoing in new Clinton emails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t stop asking what a woman gets to do, and so began a lifelong confrontation with that internal howl. The slap-downs were often unexpected. Play drums in the band? No. Sign up for the science team? Go camping with the guys? Go jogging in shorts and a tank top without fear of being assaulted? Experiment boldly, have a career, command a moral authority of my own? Walk home safely after dark? No, no, no.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/06/why-do-we-love-a-trainwreck\">Why do successful women like Hillary Clinton get under so many people's skin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I wrestled my way to yes on most of these things, except of course the last one.

  "<p>William Chaloner, who has died aged 87, was one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on fossil plants. He pioneered new methods for their study and is considered one of the founders of the research field of palynology, which uses fossil pollen and spores from ancient rocks to interpret plant evolution and to reconstruct environments of the past.</p> <p>His research was wide-ranging and included work on some of the earliest plants to colonise the land, fossil plants of the coal age, and the use of plant fossils to infer ancient climates and the composition of the atmosphere in the distant past.</p> <p>Born in London, Bill was the son of journalists, Lenore \u201cLen\u201d (nee Barling) and Ernest Chaloner. He attended Kingston grammar school and evening classes in geology at Chelsea Polytechnic before going to Reading University in 1947, to study botany, chemistry and geology. He graduated with first-class honours in botany in 1950 and remained at Reading to study extinct plants with Tom Harris, who influenced him greatly, including encouraging the importance of fieldwork as the main way to gain new and interesting fossil material.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20a9387d420935df1f9569ff6b10d8495eb0f2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20a9387d420935df1f9569ff6b10d8495eb0f2c/0_124_661_396/500.jpg\" alt=\"William Chaloner\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Chaloner became fascinated by the link between carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and climate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For his doctorate, Chaloner studied spores from the extinct club-moss trees of 300m years ago, showing that these strange plants were highly diverse, and using them to understand the ecology of the vegetation that formed some of the world\u2019s most important coal deposits. In 1953 he accepted a Commonwealth Fund fellowship (now a Harkness fellowship) and travelled to North America to work with one of that continent\u2019s premier palaeobotanists, Chester A Arnold, at the University of Michigan, on the spores of similar plants to those he had studied in Britain. On the voyage home he met Judith Carroll, whom he married in 1955.</p> <p>In 1956, Chaloner was appointed an assistant lecturer in the botany department at University College London. He was promoted to lecturer in 1958, and then reader in palaeobotany in 1963, spending a year as a visiting professor in the geosciences department at Pennsylvania State University and teaching at the University of Nigeria at Nsukka in 1965-66, which gave him new insights into tropical vegetation. This phase of his career included his important 1970 review on the colonisation of the land by plants, which integrated information from plant fossils of all kinds into an influential overview that showed the stepwise accumulation of the features, such as water-conducting tissues and leaves, that today characterise almost all land plants.</p> <p>Chaloner was appointed to the chair of botany at Birkbeck College, London, in 1972, where he remained until 1979. During this period he pioneered the use of scanning electron microscopy to study fossil plants at high magnifications and in three dimensions, which opened up many new fields of study, including the possibilities of detailed work on spores and ultimately the study of fossil flowers. He also became interested in forest fires in ecosystems of the past, and the use of fossil charcoal to estimate the concentration of oxygen in ancient atmospheres.</p> <p>In 1979 Chaloner moved to the chair of botany at Bedford College, University of London. There he pioneered the use of growth rings in fossil woods to reconstruct ancient climates. He showed that forest growth, mainly of conifers, was possible close to both poles during the global warmth of the Cretaceous period, about 100m years ago, and hence that these ecosystems were capable of supporting a diverse fauna, including dinosaurs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b7e128b4b6db6521958c7fcf9f0abb349460c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b7e128b4b6db6521958c7fcf9f0abb349460c55/0_0_1414_2098/674.jpg\" alt=\"The trunk of a fossil known as Lepidodendron, an extinct coal-forming tree found in Radstock, Somerset.

There he developed the use of stomata (gas exchange pores) on fossil plants to reconstruct levels of carbon dioxide in ancient atmospheres. It had been shown that the number and density of these pores bore a direct relationship to the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Chaloner was able to document differences in stomatal number and density in fossil leaves at different times in the past, creating a record of changing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that related to warming and cooling of the climate. He became passionately interested in the link between carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and climate, believing that knowing more about past changes would help us to understand the future.</p> <p>Chaloner received numerous honours for his services to science, including election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. He was a trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, president of the International Organisation of Palaeobotany and president of the Linnean Society in its bicentennial year. He received both the Linnean and the Lyell medals and also served as vice-president of the Geological Society of London.</p> <p>After retirement in 1994, he continued to publish research up until his death, including editing a volume on the past, present and future of fire in the history of the Earth, including recommendations for future research as well as for policymakers. With a warm sense of humour and a self-effacing manner, he was ever approachable, especially for young researchers. His thoughtful, polite and generous approach won him many friends.</p> <p>He is survived by Judith, their three children, Caroline, Michael and Sarah, and six grandchildren.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>William Gilbert Chaloner, palaeobotanist and palynologist, born 22 November 1928; died 13 October 2016</p>",
  "<p>Someone threw a dildo on to the playing&#xa0;field. It happened last Sunday, during the third quarter of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/10/30/dildo-buffalo-bills-patriots-nfl/\" title=\"\">a&#xa0;nationally televised NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots</a>. Millions of Americans watched, rolled their eyes and thought to themselves: \u201cWell, that about sums it up.\u201d</p> <p>So, who threw it? A Hillary supporter, obviously. Someone fed up with all the degradation women have been subjected to in this election: infidelity, groping, sexting, the whole septic undertow of alpha-male sludge currently spewing into the Atlantic and Pacific. And, finally, one lone heroine stood up and hurled an allegorical Johnson on to a football field, where it got trampled by 22 pairs of male feet.</p> <p>Or \u2026 was it a Trumpster? A lifelong blue-collar Buffaloan who has watched his city\u2019s industrial prowess wane? Maybe his daddy made dildos and his granddaddy made dildos, and then Hillary became senator and all those dildo jobs moved overseas. And now these New England Patriots \u2013&#xa0;east coast intellectual elites \u2013 show up with their&#xa0;crooked, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/national-football-league/tom-brady-superstar-or-cheat-or-both-10255442.html\" title=\"\">ball-deflating quarterback, Tom Brady</a>, and humiliate Buffalo on their home field.&#xa0;So, in&#xa0;a&#xa0;desperate act of defiance, an angry&#xa0;man hurls&#xa0;an inferior Chinese-made dildo at&#xa0;the Patriots\u2019 offence. A way of saying: \u201cThe Revolution Has Begun.\u201d</p> <p>Make no mistake: it was a political event. Americans are frustrated and they are throwing dildos. They\u2019re fed up and they don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if the rest of the world is laughing at them. The air of \u201cfresh start\u201d is no longer alive in most places in America. We are sleepwalking into oblivion and for those, like me, raised in the twilight of a world where being president was still&#xa0;a noble thing, it cuts pretty deep. History has&#xa0;always been able to extract some shred of sacrosanctity from the electoral process, no matter how awful it turned out. But it\u2019s looking as if that warranty has expired and our republic is now an ageing Maytag churning through its final rinse cycle. Whatever comes out is going to be damp, foetid and reeking of effluviant. And we\u2019re gonna have to wear it.</p> <p>If Trump wins, I\u2019m going to enjoy the spectacle of a man wrestling within himself. Driven by inherent narcissism, he would strive to be The Greatest President Ever, a trait we look for in our leaders. But if his itchy-finger temperament prevails, he might nuke Egypt simply because they lied about the cotton threadcount in his bedsheets.</p> <p>Hillary, on the other hand, is a dead-eyed cyborg, held together with rivets and WD-40. She has been encamped in our lives for so long that handing her the presidency somehow feels like a&#xa0;lifetime achievement award. But she\u2019s dirty and corrupt and contemptuous of national security. These are our choices, folks: a pair of assholes. What is an asshole? A person who thinks they\u2019re entitled to an advantage. A person who has immunised themselves against all criticism.</p> <p>They can\u2019t hear your complaints. They\u2019re too caught up in their own ambition. It\u2019s OK to be an asshole if you have talent. Pablo Picasso and Miles Davis were assholes, but we forgave them because they gave something back. And the reason they were assholes was because they couldn\u2019t abide anything that got in the way of their talent or vision. But Trump has no talent. And Hillary has no vision. No fresh vision, anyway. So the American voter has a dilemma. \u201cLet\u2019s see, should I go with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/\" title=\"\">a six-times-bankrupt businessman</a> who once thought it was a genius idea to sell steaks at The Sharper Image?

America\u2019s greatest attribute has always been its ability to mythologise its stupid mistakes, to turn world-class blunders into cultural gold. We glorify our exceptionalism. We downplay our history of slavery, segregation, nativism and violence until we can find a way to&#xa0;turn it into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Chiwetel Ejiofor. Unlike Brits, we always forgive ourselves. But I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re ever going to illuminate Trump or Clinton with any kind of flattering historical rewrite.</p> <p>Besides, they have already been encapsulated perfectly in films: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Biff in Back to the Future</a> and Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People.</p> <p>Who am I going to vote for? Hillary. Only because she lies 30% less than Trump. I\u2019m tempted to sit this whole thing out, but I can\u2019t. I still believe in the antiquated currency of the ballot. I am grateful, as an American, that two useful idiots have offered themselves up as scapegoats for everything wrong with my country. That\u2019s the beauty of having a president. When the world isn\u2019t treating us right, when the creepy kid at school goes out and shoots up the mall, when we\u2019re up to our asses in floodwater and raw sewage because the county commissioners didn\u2019t buy enough sandbags to shore up the levee, who has to show up and apologise? The president, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>Every night, the president crawls into bed and says: \u201cGuess what, honey?

Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">what Simon Burnton wrote</a> in our big bumper bouncing weekend preview:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It took until mid-October for Watford to keep a clean sheet but having managed it for the first time at Middlesbrough three weeks ago they repeated the feat in their next two games, and, excluding stoppage time, Heurelho Gomes is but 120 seconds away from going 300minutes unbeaten. Away from home, only Arsenal and Tottenham have better defensive records. It is an impressive achievement, particularly given that of the four players who regularly contest the three central defensive positions in Walter Mazzarri\u2019s preferred formation only one \u2013 Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, a summer arrival from Sunderland for around \u00a33.5m \u2013 was signed for a fee, and Gomes was also a free transfer. But the mountainous Austrian centre-half Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl limped out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/watford-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">last week\u2019s victory over Hull</a>, apparently with a muscle injury, and with Craig Cathcart also injured it is likely only two of the four will be available for this, their sternest test of the season so far. </p> <p>Whether Mazzarri\u2019s response will be to bring in Christian Kabasele, the Belgium international who has played eight first-team minutes since August, or to move to a back four, a defence unchanged throughout their recent solid streak will be fundamentally altered. They face a team who have scored two or more goals in eight of their last nine games and have shown the ability to make even the most secure rearguards become bedraggled. There is, in short, plenty of encouragement for Liverpool, whose only obvious cause of concern would come if Nordin Amrabat, the Moroccan winger who made Hull\u2019s stand-in left-back Sam Clucas appear utterly wretched at Vicarage Road last week, manages to repeat the trick against James Milner, another player unaccustomed to that position, who is expected to return after missing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">4-2 win at Crystal Palace</a>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581f31a6e4b07ceadb3a2f3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T13:36:50.773Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This week Paul Wilson spoke to Emre Can,</strong> and via having the news broken to him that he wasn\u2019t in the German squad (bit awkward), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/emre-can-liverpool-steven-gerrard-jurgen-klopp\">the midfielder confirmed that he is not Steven Gerrard</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is very nice to be compared to Steven Gerrard but I know I am not at the same level,\u201d Can says with refreshing candour. \u201cThere is a long way to go there.

Modern football loves narrative.</strong> There\u2019s plenty of it around, stories around which the actual playing of the game must be framed. It\u2019s not enough simply to enjoy watching a match, but to understand the tales around it too. And to an extent that\u2019s understandable: without \u2018narrative\u2019, the North London derby from earlier would just be two teams who didn\u2019t have to travel very far on a Sunday lunchtime. But sometimes it does seem like it can get in the way of what we\u2019re all actually here for. </p> <p><strong>This game, though.</strong> This game seems to be absolutely free of narrative. The only mutual player is Jerome Sinclair, who played but 25 minutes of league football for Liverpool, in two dead games the season before last, and is yet to appear for Watford. The two managers have never faced each other. There have been no particularly controversial recent meetings between the two sides, unless you count Adam Bogdan flinging one into his own net as Liverpool\u2019s last goalkeeping resort last season. There was the time Tommy Mooney scored a winner for Watford at Anfield back in 1999, but only the dorkiest of narrative completists would place much significance on that. </p> <p><strong>What else have we got?</strong> Well, both sides can be delighted that the very epitome of footballing grace and delicacy John Barnes is a significant place in their respective histories, and perhaps we can all just take a moment to enjoy the great man, before we continue. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkCILQTnpw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YVkCILQTnpw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Good god, that goal against QPR.</strong> It\u2019s worth reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/22/on-second-thoughts-john-barnes\">Gregg Bakowski\u2019s paean to Barnes</a> from a few years ago, in which he discusses that strike.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unshackled, his confidence and talent grew. His ability to beat players without appearing to change gear was a gift that only a select few players have ever been able to showcase. And for three years at Liverpool he did so effortlessly. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gQuqkuhG5s\">His second goal</a> in the 4-0 defeat of the league leaders QPR in October 1987 was a perfect example. After stealing the ball on the halfway line he picked up pace as he approached the penalty box, with Terry Fenwick and Paul Parker closing, he seamlessly shifted his hulking frame left and right to create a gap between them, before calmly emerging unscathed to slip the ball past David Seaman\u2019s outstretched left hand. \u201cWhenever would-be tacklers came sliding in, I tried to toe the ball past them, ride the challenge and regain balance and the ball on the other side. After I pushed the ball past Fenwick, I landed and brought the ball back with my left foot in one movement. It was difficult to see why I didn\u2019t fall over,\u201d explained Barnes in his autobiography, making the sublime seem simple. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What a player.</strong> But anyway. We\u2019ve got a bit distracted from the business at hand. Which is football, to enjoy without distractions.

It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-online-troll-tells-samantha-bee-why-she-prefers-donald-trump_us_58184cafe4b0990edc3340d2\">One told Samantha Bee</a> that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska.

Even the <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/special/2010-02/503820.html\">state-owned Global Times</a> reported with approval on the practice in 2010, citing Changsha\u2019s party office as the source of the name after it paid a team of commenters 600 yuan a month in 2004, plus half a yuan \u2013 hence \u201c50 cent\u201d \u2013 for each glowing post they made.</p> <p>Since then, paying stooges to praise your work online has become about as routine for local government in China as hiring traffic wardens. <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf?m=1463683069\">A recent study at Harvard University</a> found that the Chinese authorities were placing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/chinese-officials-create-488m-social-media-posts-a-year-study-finds\">448m phony comments on the internet each year</a>. In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings.</p> <p>Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it.

The young man, whose own family knew nothing of his work, estimated that 10-20% of the comments he saw were left by the 50 Cent Party. He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government\u2019s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. \u201cSometimes I feel like I have a split personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like it or hate it.

Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/idfonline/\">even has its own Pinterest page</a>, featuring photo collections with themes such as \u201cSoldiers\u2019 Stories\u201d and \u201cIDF Style\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit \u201ccovert units\u201d however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. \u201cWe need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Government-to-use-citizens-as-army-in-social-media-war-322972\">Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post</a>. \u201cThat is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.\u201d Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships.</p> <p>Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/israel-hamas-clash-social-media\">Israel Under Fire</a> emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. \u201cWe counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. \u201cSocial media is another place where the war goes on.

It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry\u2019s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24).

And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/\">Some of JTRIG\u2019s tactics</a>, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual \u201choneypot\u201d stings, sound more or less like conventional spying. Others were carefully designed to manipulate and deceive. <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2015/06/22/behavioural-science-support-jtrig/\">In the words of the leaked document</a>, these included \u201cUploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages; establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum memberships \u2026 sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this sounds reasonable, and frankly welcome, such as disrupting the online activities of terrorists or child abusers. Indeed, if it still exists, JTRIG seems to target specific groups or individuals, rather than trying to influence public opinion. Which groups, however, and who chooses them, might be a legitimate concern. The document mentions the English Defence League, for example, whose members were no doubt not happy to be included. For its part, GCHQ will only say that all its work is legal.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> A few dozen.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Sex, drugs, not travelling to Syria please.</p> <h2><strong> </strong>North Korea, South Korea</h2> <p>Most North Koreans\u2019 experience of social media is none at all, unless they have been given an illicit glimpse by a foreigner or a government official. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/north-korea-announces-blocks-on-facebook-twitter-and-youtube\">Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are all officially blocked</a>, just in case. Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416970\">launch their own version of Facebook</a>, as some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/13/a-rare-glimpse-of-north-koreas-version-of-facebook/\">believe they plan to</a>.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081300891.html\">about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with</a>, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That\u2019s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8/0_0_2362_3283/719.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Joe Magee\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang\u2019s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south \u2013 such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users.</p> <p>Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/asia/south-korean-agents-accused-of-tarring-opposition-before-election.html?_r=0\">strayed into attacks on South Korea\u2019s own opposition parties</a>. Last year the country\u2019s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north \u2013 and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, <a href=\"https://revolution-news.com/south-korea-50k-protest-national-intelligence-service-election-rigging\">to smear President Park\u2019s opponents</a>, who were described as, among other things, \u201cleftist followers of North Korea\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> 200 (north) 9 (south).</p> <p><strong>Favourite subject</strong> Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid.</p> <h2> Turkey</h2> <p>President Erdo\u011fan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/elections/2015/05/11/ak-party-founded-new-turkey-digital-office-for-the-general-elections-on-june-7\">a team of 6,000 social media operatives</a>. \u201cWe aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323527004579079151479634742\">a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time</a>. \u201cAnd when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.\u201d But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined.</p> <p>Sadly for Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-twitter-trolls/\">their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let\u2019s say, under-subtle</a>. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-elections-akp-mulls-dumping-social-media-trolls.html#\">showered with far from positive remarks</a>. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/11/akp-social-media-twitter-facebook.html\">Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government\u2019s handling of a hostage negotiation</a> in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of \u201cZionism\u201d.</p> <p>At times the \u201cAK Trolls\u201d, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about \u201chis\u201d tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur\u2019s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from \u201cour trolls\u201d. When recordings allegedly showing Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down.</p> <p>Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn\u2019t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkish-president-s-social-media-campaigners-deny-being-a-troll-army-10301599.html\">New Turkey Digital Office</a>, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. \u201cAll of our accounts will be officially announced,\u201d spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. \u201cOur messages will be determined at the party headquarters. None of the other accounts would be related to us, including those ones [the trolls].\u201d Nevertheless the AKP lost its majority in the elections.

  "<p>In the beginning, Donald Trump simply wouldn\u2019t allow the press to eat cold meats from the buffet.<br></p> <p>Trump was holding a house party in suburban New Hampshire in late June 2015. The main event was around a backyard swimming pool under a fickle summer sky. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/nov/02/a-z-of-trump-26-illustrators-picture-a-ghastly-future-in-pictures\">A-Z of Trump: 26 illustrators imagine a 'ghastly' future \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family hosting the presidential candidate had a 22-year-old son who was a Trump superfan. He had somehow coaxed the candidate to appear at the backyard event. Before the speech, there would be a reception for invited guests with hors d\u2019oeuvres stacked on the family\u2019s dining room table. But this was for invited guests only. Reporters, let alone more plebeian Trump supporters, were not permitted to partake. </p> <p>Otherwise, there were no press pens as reporters stood intermingled in the crowd with ardent Tea Partiers and curious onlookers there to see a television celebrity who had somehow ended up in Bedford, New Hampshire, for the evening.</p> <p>Trump delivered a long, winding monologue of the sort that would later become his trademark as he veered from dire warnings about illegal immigrants to praise for executives at Comcast and an extended and impassioned anecdote about how professional politicians couldn\u2019t recognize low-quality highway guardrails.</p> <p>The event, with more than 200 people was one of the rare times that Trump attempted anything approaching traditional retail politics. As he soared in the polls, Trump became a phenomenon who packed arenas and stadiums across much of the south. By September 2015, even the gesture of a retail stop at a tailgate outside an Iowa v Iowa State football game turned into a mob scene. The candidate was swarmed by people chanting his name and reaching out to somehow touch him as a pack of bodyguards protected Trump from getting too close to the masses outside the stadium.</p> <p>It was during this period that the Guardian interviewed Trump in a New Hampshire hotel conference room after he had addressed a non-partisan event designed to focus on \u201cproblem solving\u201d. He was gracious and soft-spoken if vague on policy detail. He broadly endorsed several progressive priorities like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-police-body-cameras-video\">federal funding for police body cameras</a> and rail transit while striking his typical isolationist notes on foreign policy. The interview was filmed and it was noteworthy how keenly aware he was of the camera and how carefully he positioned himself for it. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-putin-assad-humanitarian-foreign-policy-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4d8yz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2388066\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump talks to the Guardian about Syria and his worldview \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561c4e15e4b0fed5dcd57348\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10872835&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10872835&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-putin-assad-humanitarian-foreign-policy-video\">Ben Jacobs interviews Donald Trump in October 2015</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Instead, Trump became a candidate of big venues and big speeches. Once or twice a day in high school gyms or a convention center in Iowa or New Hampshire, the Republican nominee would put on his show. By the autumn of 2015, Trump had acquired secret service protection and all the other accoutrements of a general election candidate, despite the fact that he was a political novice who had never appeared on a ballot. Reporters were caged in a press pen, unable to freely roam and mingle with voters once the nominee was in the vicinity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39/0_57_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Siegal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign stops became must-see events, especially in states where visits from presidential candidates were rarities. Trump rallies seemed to resemble rock concerts more than anything previously seen in presidential politics. In a January 2016 rally in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/donald-trump-burlington-vermont-bernie-sanders-home-turf\">Bernie Sanders heartland of Burlington, Vermont,</a> lines stretched for blocks in the bitter cold as thousands of people congregated to see Trump in a downtown theater. Many were taking their minds off the weather by drinking steadily as they waited and the street was soon littered with empty beer cans. </p> <p>The atmosphere was just as unusual inside the Trump rallies. The Republican candidate\u2019s events became ground zero for protests over a variety of issues, ranging from his vehement anti-immigrant rhetoric to his advocacy of a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In Burlington, a liberal college town, Trump staffers were eagle-eyed at the door, requiring attendees to take loyalty pledges to enter. That wasn\u2019t enough to stop the event from being repeatedly interrupted, with the candidate urging: \u201cTake him out. Get him out of here. Don\u2019t give him his coat!\u201d as one heckler was ejected. </p> <p>Repeated disruptions became routine, along with actual outbreaks of violence. The disturbing trend culminated in a cancelled rally in Chicago, which descended into chaos. The candidate didn\u2019t take the stage as the venue in the heart of deep Democratic blue, ethnically diverse Chicago was filled with protesters. When the announcement came that Trump was not taking the stage, fights quickly broke out throughout the arena. Such scenes of political violence had not been seen in decades in the United States.</p> <p>The next day, Trump\u2019s rally in Cleveland had about a dozen interruptions from protesters, something which would have been astonishing had it happened in any other year to any other candidate. Instead, there was no violence and no attempt by Trump to encourage violence and it just seemed like the new normal as he sneered at those who were escorted out, claiming that they were sent by \u201cour communist friend\u201d, Bernie Sanders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds forth in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump holds forth in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it wasn\u2019t just the crowds at Trump\u2019s events, which were unusual. It was the candidate\u2019s rhetoric. On a daily basis, Trump made statements that were just astonishing by any traditional standard, comparing a rival to a child molester, or linking another\u2019s father to a plot to kill President Kennedy. In the course of a single day on the campaign trail in South Carolina, Trump both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-wall-mexico-border\">attacked the pope</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/trump-appears-to-endorse-executing-terrorists-citing-questionable-history\">accused</a> one of the most decorated American soldiers in history of committing war crimes. The statements had no effect on his standing in the polls and he won a commanding victory only a few days later in the South Carolina primary. </p> <p>Trump finally clinched the Republican nomination in early May when Ted Cruz dropped out after the Indiana primary. His next event was a raucous rally in a grim brutalist arena in Charleston, West Virginia. It had been scheduled in advance of the state\u2019s primary. Hours before it started, the crowd outside formed a disorderly horde in red and white Make America Great Again hats. Once Trump finally took the stage in the dank 60s-era construction in the dilapidated downtown, he strutted about the stage triumphantly, suggesting to attendees that they didn\u2019t need to bother to vote in the primary any more as he boasted about his abiding love and affection for coal and coalminers.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, there was no pivot to a general election. Instead, Trump seemed nostalgic for the intra-Republican contest as he travelled the length of California in advance of the state\u2019s June primary, as well as taking a bizarre trip to Scotland to see his golf course in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb/17_0_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland: a grim, depressing slog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Trump officially became the nominee in July, it was at a convention in Cleveland that was more banal than anyone could have imagined. Although Trump had promised star-studded festivities and there were fears that protests in the surrounding streets would rival the dramatic scenes outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, it was instead a grim, depressing slog. </p> <p>In lieu of celebrities, there was former Happy Days actor Scott Baio and, instead of graceful concession speeches, former rival Ted Cruz urged Republicans to \u201cvote their conscience\u201d in what was widely viewed as a snub to Trump. Much of the effort seemed to be focused on stopping anti-Trump rebels from forcing any vote or coming close to any open display of dissatisfaction. No one had any illusions that Trump could somehow be thwarted. </p> <p>The nomination was secured after more than a week of grinding procedural warfare replete with the type of tactical chicanery that one would have expected from smoke- not iPhone-filled rooms. Anti-Trump petitions mysteriously disappeared, wavering delegates were subjected to intense pressure and every available scrap of procedure was put to good use. For a moment, he was just like any other candidate overseeing a political organization.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1/0_0_2203_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO and Breitbart editor, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Manafort, the shadowy veteran campaign aide who had finally elbowed out Trump\u2019s longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, after an intense turf war, oversaw all of these efforts.

Working in concert with veteran GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, Trump abandoned his unscripted rallies and began using a teleprompter exclusively. He also hunkered down, avoiding the media outside of deeply conservative talk radio and Fox News.</p> <p>In personal unguarded interactions, Trump was genial with the press. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">When the Guardian accompanied him on his personal plane</a> in September as a pool reporter, he chatted freely with handful of journalists who accompanied him and went out of his way to be gracious.

There was no more open violence or unruliness. Protesters had become rare. Instead, they became venues for Trump to share his rage over the \u201crigged system\u201d and stir up an angry crowd \u2013 against the media, against Hillary Clinton, against \u201cglobalists\u201d and a host of other villains.</p> <p>Attendees showed up in bitter T-shirts proclaiming that they were \u201cdeplorable\u201d and took up Trump\u2019s invitation to deride reporters.</p> <p>At one rally in Cincinnati in October, the traveling press was booed by a crowd of roughly 15,000 as it entered the arena. </p> <p>Trump had stopped trying to be a normal candidate but he was no longer being Trump. It was a dark hybrid. He had lost much of the freewheeling joie de vivre that had taken him to strange, albeit controversial places. Instead, he had become a relatively coherent figure, articulating a clear world view \u2013 but one that was deeply paranoid and out of the mainstream, where the press was no longer a stalking horse but simply the enemy.<br></p>",

Facebook and Twitter\u2019s systems for reporting abuse are garbage, by the way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hayhoe is the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where she teaches and conducts research as an atmospheric scientist and an associate professor of political science.</p> <p>As a Texas-dwelling, evangelical Christian, atmospheric scientist, Hayhoe can often win the ears of many religious communities, receive invitations to address students at Christian colleges, or have conversations with mega-church-going Republican climate cynics she otherwise mightn\u2019t meet or who wouldn\u2019t listen.</p> <p>Her faith and, now, her web series, has led many people to tell her they had believed or suspected that human-influenced climate change was a liberal hoax but that she has changed their minds, she said.</p> <p>But Global Weirding has also brought increased hate mail.</p> <p>\u201cI did have, a few years ago, a death threat, which I reported to the police,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Now new floods of insults are pouring in since she launched the web series last month.</p> <p>She\u2019s coping partly by seeing it as a \u201csort of encouraging, in a strange way\u201d sign that she\u2019s hitting new audiences, drawing contrarians and environmental converts alike.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd7bc637031f629e6451ee891d7c5794fb756026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7bc637031f629e6451ee891d7c5794fb756026/0_23_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katharine Hayhoe speaks about climate change to students and faculty at Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katharine Hayhoe speaks about climate change to students and faculty at Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chicago Tribune/MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hayhoe has made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=global+weirding\">Global Weirding</a> in conjunction with her local PBS TV station, KTTZ, and it\u2019s released via YouTube.</p> <p>The short installments are released every other Wednesday, with the fourth one of the inaugural season due the day after the 8 November presidential election.</p> <p> The series delivers a carefully calibrated, humorous, light-hearted lecture underpinned with serious science, featuring cartoons and Hayhoe talking on screen.</p> <p>The first episode sought to \u201cbust the myth\u201d of stereotypical \u201cgreen liberals\u201d having a monopoly on environmentalism. The second explained the history of climate science and why global warming isn\u2019t a blip, a natural cycle or a leftwing conspiracy.</p> <p>And the third pointed out that while Texas emits more carbon than Germany, it\u2019s also the US\u2019s leading producer of wind energy and \u201chas the potential to lead the nation in solar energy\u201d.</p> <p>Forthcoming episodes explore themes such as \u201cit\u2019s not just polar bears\u201d, \u201cwhat happened in Paris?\u201d and \u201creligion in relation to climate change\u201d.</p> <p>Evangelical Christians in the US are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/11/climatechange.religion\">split</a> on whether climate change is real and whether it\u2019s mankind\u2019s fault.</p> <p>The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) supports the science but that body only represents a portion of the born-again faithful in America.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to draw a very clear line between US evangelicals and those in the rest of the world,\u201d said Hayhoe.</p> <p>\u201cI went to the Paris climate talks last December and the head of the World Evangelical Alliance, Efraim Tendero, was an official delegate.

  "<p>The restaurant at the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington wasn\u2019t empty on Thursday night. But it wasn\u2019t full either. The handful of diners could look down on the marbled lobby and bar and see four TVs: two tuned to American football, one to basketball and a fourth to conservative Fox News \u2013 including election ads for the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe style is jubilant,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dominicvorvlaw1\">Dominic Vorv</a>, 50, a lawyer with a cowboy hat who dined on ribeye steak as banal pop music wafted through the former post office. \u201cMy clients are impressed. My voice does not reverberate here because it\u2019s a large place. You can talk and no one listens to your business to find out: are you a Republican, are you a Democrat?\u201d</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\">The glitzy hotel</a> on Pennsylvania Avenue stands 723 short steps from the White House. Vorv, a Latino from New Mexico who says his legal clients include strippers, hopes that Trump will add the Oval Office to his portfolio on Tuesday. \u201cThe city has been waiting for a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we get is politicians.\u201d</p> <p>Washington has been home to every US president since <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/johnadams\">John Adams</a>, the second president, in 1800. He and his successors have variously embraced the city or seldom ventured beyond the mansion grounds. George W Bush was rarely seen out at night, whereas Barack Obama has helped DC unbutton its collar. So how would Trump or Hillary Clinton fit in?</p> <p>Politically, at least, one would feel right at home while the other would be a square peg in a round hole. Nine in 10 residents of the District of Columbia <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/district-of-columbia/\">vote Democratic</a>. \u201cTrump would be at war with the city and the population of the city,\u201d said one party stalwart, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThis would be an occupied capital. People in Washington would be regarded as Parisians under the Nazis, with fewer collaborators.\u201d</p> <p>Culturally, it is less certain how Washington would reflect the personality of either would-be commander-in-chief. The brash New York businessman\u2019s travelling circus of celebrity, braggadocio and vulgarity would not be likely to impress the capital\u2019s liberal intellectuals, and Trump\u2019s aesthetic taste clashes with the city\u2019s austere marble and concrete. Even his $212m hotel, with its share of chandeliers and gold leaf, is relatively toned down from the faux Versailles aspirations of his properties in Florida and New York.</p> <p>Nor would Trump find similarities between his voters and the city\u2019s demographics: almost half the population of Washington is African American, part of a group that has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">for months</a> rejected him.

Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts. She\u2019s nervous so prepping more and performing better. Got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden assented: \u201cAlmost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible.\u201d</p> <p>When the seemingly innocuous leftwing senator Bernie Sanders came out of nowhere to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primary, there were fears of a repeat of her shock defeat by Obama in 2008. Tanden warned Podesta against attacking Sanders too aggressively.</p> <p>\u201cJust game out what that does to Hillary,\u201d <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3193\">she wrote in August last year.</a> \u201cWhen we went after Obama, she got killed for it. Reaffirmed all her negatives, strengthened him. We had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that, but it was. I don\u2019t know if it was Obama or Hillary (I suspected Hillary), but it\u2019s really something to focus group beforehand.\u201d</p> <p>In December, when Tanden wrote in praise of the Paris climate deal, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35133\">Podesta responded:</a> \u201cCan you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it?\u201d</p> <p>Then, in March this year, Clinton strategist <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33579\">Minyon Moore opined:</a> \u201cI think Sanders is a rule breaker and has no institutional loyalty to the Democratic Party; we should expect him to ignore the rules and persist in his quest to flip superdelegates despite overwhelming evidence that reflects his considerable weaknesses with the Democratic base and no doubt in the general.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden, meanwhile, pulled no punches when Clinton\u2019s campaign hesitated over whether to condemn Democratic activist David Brock for demanding Sanders\u2019 medical records. She wrote: \u201cHillary. God. Her instincts are suboptimal.\u201d</p> <p>A stout defender of Clinton in public, in private Tanden injects some bracing honesty that suggests the candidate is not surrounded by sycophants. After the former first lady described herself as a moderate, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41455\">Tanden asked of Podesta:</a> \u201cWhy did she call herself a moderate?\u201d</p> <p>He wrote back: \u201cI pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn\u2019t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden replied: \u201cI mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she\u2019s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn\u2019t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The daily dump of stolen emails has uncovered Clinton\u2019s lucrative Wall Street speeches, lists of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/clinton-vice-president-wikileaks.html\">39 potential vice-presidents</a> and 84 potential campaign slogans, fresh questions over a conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation and alleged advance warnings of debate questions. But there have been few revelations likely to alter the course of the race for the White House.</p> <p>In fact, just as WikiLeaks\u2019 release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-us-embassy-cables\">US embassy cables</a> often showed diplomats\u2019 judgment in a flattering light, so the Podesta emails have illuminated a micromanaged campaign operation with a laser-like focus and little by way of ill-discipline or even foul language. The nerve centre is, however, all too aware of its candidate\u2019s weaknesses and sensitive to media criticism, and as prone as any other office to personality clashes, terse exchanges and mutual exasperation.</p> <p>The email treasure trove also lifts the lid on the complications of celebrity endorsements. In August 2015, Betsy Jones, assistant to the hip-hop star Q-Tip, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39998\">wrote to Podesta</a> to propose a meeting with Clinton \u201cto discuss ways he can be used as bridge to the hip-hop generation during the 2016 presidential campaign\u201d. Q-Tip \u201ceven served as DJ for Chelsea Clinton\u2019s 25th birthday party in 2005\u201d, she noted.</p> <p>Podesta forwarded the email to colleagues, one of whom was Weiner\u2019s wife Huma Abedin. \u201cQ-Tip? Seriously?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am so old.\u201d</p> <p>Another, Kristina Schake, weighed in: \u201cI\u2019ve actually seen Q-tip in concert and if this meeting happens I would like to staff her.\u201d She elaborated: \u201cWith both the Beastie Boys and the Chemical Brothers!\u201d</p> <p>But then the conversation took a darker turn when another member of Clinton staff, presumably responsible for background checks, raised concerns over Q-Tip: \u201cThere are a couple of altercations he pleaded guilty to, but they were from a while back. However, more recently shouted \u2018pigs\u2019 at NYPD officers while protesting the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson.\u201d</p> <p>It took a while, but the meeting did go ahead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5azaz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2871825\"            data-video-name=\"'Vote for someone who cares': Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581d7fc2e4b0d073c27d1b2e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\">\u2018Vote for someone who cares\u2019: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Then there are campaign surrogates who go rogue. Lanny Davis, a lawyer and former special counsel to Bill Clinton during his presidency, put his foot in it when talking about Clinton\u2019s email server on TV. Later that day Robby Mook, now the campaign manager, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41556\">emailed Podesta:</a> \u201cWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can\u2019t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\u201d</p> <p>In May last year, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6370\">Podesta wrote</a> of longtime Clinton family friend Sidney Blumenthal: \u201cIt always amazes me that people like Sid either completely lack self awareness or self respect. Maybe both. Will you promise to shoot me if I ever end up like that?\u201d</p> <p>Podesta, 67, runs a tight ship and has an unenviable job. Countless people want to give him advice or meet him for dinner. In September last year, columnist Brent Budowsky wrote <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40328\">a long, panicked email</a> about visiting a university campus where Sanders had a booth but Clinton did not. \u201cThis is happening at every major campus in America,\u201d he warned darkly.</p> <p>Referring to a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-2016-proxies-attack-bernie-sanders-213359\">Politico story</a> about attacks on Sanders by Clinton surrogates, Budowsky went on: \u201cThe way NOT to handle Bernie is to telegraph how afraid the Clinton campaign is of him, and then dispense covert talking points that cannot be put in writing that embody the oldest politics that will only infuriate many liberal Democrats and give an already-biased media a legitimate story line to push.\u201d</p> <p>Podesta gave a characterically brisk response that ended: \u201cWhy do you think that story is not just a bunch of hyped up BS intended to have exactly the kind of reaction you are exhibiting?\u201d </p>",

An election in which the leading candidates have been a protectionist nationalist, an avowed socialist and a Democrat who can\u2019t explain how she is not a socialist has put an end to such talk. Still, Gallup finds <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/gallup-finds-more-libertarians-electorate\">rising numbers</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/libertarian-vote-ebook-shows-libertarian-growth\">libertarian-leaning voters</a> in the electorate, which should put some constraints on the next president\u2019s agenda. </p> <p>Eight years after the financial crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s policies of more taxes, debt, and regulation have understandably kept GDP growth very slow. Neither Donald Trump\u2019s promise of trade war and immigration cutoffs nor Hillary Clinton\u2019s doubling down on Obama\u2019s policies will help. Meanwhile, Washington hawks think that Obama, who has bombed seven countries, hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough. They\u2019re looking forward to a more assertive Clinton foreign policy. But Trump proved that you can get the Republican nomination by opposing the Iraq war and global interventionism, and that may lead to more resistance to endless war and more congressional constraints on presidential war powers.</p> <h2>Supreme court: <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/m/john-malcolm\">John Malcolm</a></h2> <p><em>Director, Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"787ee3be60fbab8780b706b758d990f728b39e2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787ee3be60fbab8780b706b758d990f728b39e2d/0_0_500_700/357.jpg\" alt=\"John Malcolm.\" width=\"357\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Malcolm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no question that the future of the supreme court is on the ballot.

The stakes are therefore quite high in terms of who will fill his seat. Beyond that, three other justices \u2013 Ginsburg, Kennedy and Breyer \u2013 have already surpassed the average life expectancy for men and women in this country. Additional vacancies are thus likely to occur over the next four to eight years.</p> <p>And who sits in the Oval Office makes a big difference.

Median incomes have gone up and the poverty rate is falling. People are not wrong that there has been a long period of economic stagnation and increasing inequality, but we seem to be turning a corner. This is exactly the wrong time to adopt policies that are going to throw the economy into a tailspin.</p> <p>Threatening to shut down trade negotiations or promising to renegotiate settled trade agreements, for example the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), makes no sense if the imperative is to build on the gathering momentum of the US economy. The case for the TPP has as much to do with America\u2019s political influence and interest in Asia as it does with economics. Abandoning the TPP would be a huge gift to China. The other Asian countries will make accommodations to China, and America\u2019s influence will plummet.</p> <p>That is the situation Hillary Clinton will inherit if she wins. The question, then, is how to reconcile the need to tap into those growing Asian markets with her shift on trade during the campaign.</p> <h2>Middle East: <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/anthony-h-cordesman\">Anthony Cordesman</a></h2> <p><em>Arleigh Burke chair in strategy, Center for Strategic and International Studies</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf/61_0_403_504/400.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Cordesman.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Cordesman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Center for Strategic &amp; International\u200b Studies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next administration will confront serious security challenges across the Middle East.

If Isis is defeated in Iraq, which it may well be by the time the next administration is in place, that immediately means he or she will have to decide how to secure Iraq and how to proceed in Syria. </p> <p>Isis has never been the only \u2013 or even the dominant \u2013 terrorist threat in the region. In 2015, estimates indicate that Isis accounted for about 20% of the terrorist incidents in the region. So when Isis is defeated as a proto-state, we will have to consider new threats. Do people migrate to other extremist movements? Do we see al-Qaida, which has made serious gains in Yemen and has a strong affiliate in Syria, grow? Does this expose new sectarian, ethnic or tribal tensions?</p> <p>There is a need to restructure US-Arab cooperation, with a consideration toward creating lasting civil stability. The Arab spring showed how civil forces \u2013 poor governance, lagging economic development, high youth unemployment \u2013 exacerbated regional upheaval and violence.

Mr Trump thinks he can get a \u201cdeal\u201d but there is reason to believe that will prove far more challenging that he anticipates, and in the process he could upend a lot of relationships with US allies.</p> <p>For Secretary Clinton, given the series of hacks on the Democratic party and her campaign, she will probably take a very different position. The question then is: how much tougher will she get and how specifically she will engage with Russia? This will probably result in much more of an emphasis on countering disinformation and lead to much more intelligence gathering in collaboration with Europeans.</p> <p>Another major challenge for the US will be to get Europe to focus on something other than its own internal affairs: Brexit, slow economic growth and domestic politics, which have taken a sharp turn to the right.</p> <p>Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany hold elections. If Mr Trump is elected, I believe there is more of a chance that rightwing parties will come to power. In a sense, his election gives permission to these movements to become more anti-American, creating a political dynamic in Europe that is more rightwing and more hostile to the US.</p> <p>Brexit has put the US in a position of trying to remain friends with both parties in a messy divorce. The US will have to build new relationships with Europe and with the UK, and this will take effort.</p> <h2>Women\u2019s healthcare: Heather Boonstra</h2> <p><em>Director of public policy, Guttmacher Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c/0_0_288_360/288.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Boonstra\" width=\"288\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather Boonstra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guttmacher Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abortion has been legal throughout the US for more than 40 years, but it remains one of the country\u2019s hottest political flashpoints. Donald Trump certainly has stumbled on the issue, especially when he said in a TV interview that if abortion were made illegal, women seeking one should be criminally punished \u2013 a statement that he later tried to reframe as \u201cpro-life with exceptions\u201d. </p> <p>The Republican platform, however, is quite clear: it affirms \u201cthat the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\u201d and it supports a human life amendment to the constitution. The Democratic platform supports a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion \u201cregardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured\u201d.</p> <p>In addition to abortion, access to contraceptive services and reproductive healthcare generally is also at stake. The Republicans have called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and have also targeted the Title X national family planning program and Planned Parenthood health clinics. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for the reproductive health and rights of women. We should recall that she coined a now famous phrase \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d.</p> <h2>Poverty: Caroline Ratcliffe</h2> <p><em>Senior fellow and economist, Center on Labor, Human Services and Population at the Urban Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde/18_0_264_330/264.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Ratcliffe\" width=\"264\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Ratcliffe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urban Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost 14% of all Americans, and nearly 20% of American children, are poor. <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/low-income-working-families/projects/children-persistent-poverty\">Child poverty can have lifelong consequences</a> for health, education, earnings and more. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/seven-things-you-should-know-about-childhood-poverty\">Addressing the needs of poor young children and their parents is key</a>.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/06/14/fact-sheet-universal-preschool/\">to double the investment in Early Head Start</a> would expand the reach of educational and other supports for younger children and their families, such as home-visiting programs for new mothers.

The next president will face a pressing to-do list and we are sadly running out time to prevent unmanageable climate change.</p> <p>Whoever wins the election will need to move quickly to meet the US commitment under the Paris agreement on climate change to reduce emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2020.

The next president will also have to set a foreign policy agenda that will reduce the risk of conflict and migration in a warming world.</p> <p>The question before us this election is: who is the most fit to take these crucial domestic and international steps? Hillary Clinton understands the very real and costly threat of climate change. She has committed to implement an \u201caggressive response\u201d that will support clean energy innovation and jobs in the US.</p> <p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, believes extreme weather does not hurt people and that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d created by the Chinese. He has also said he would \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement and aggressively pursue fossil fuel extraction.</p> <p>The US and the world need an American president who will continue to lead domestic and international efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton has a unique talent to make people viscerally angry. Just look at the footage from Trump rallies: supporters carry \u201c<a href=\"https://lyinhillarydoll.com/\">Lyin Hillary\u201d</a> dolls hung from miniature nooses, cry \u201cLock her up\u201d and \u201cHang her in the streets\u201d, and wear Trump That Bitch T-shirts. You could chalk this up to Trump\u2019s toxicity, but some of it also haunted the Democratic primaries, in the over-the-top depictions of Clinton as a cold-blooded murderer or criminal mastermind promulgated by the most fanatical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> supporters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary\u2019s critics insist there is something wrong with her sexually</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So why is it, exactly, that Clinton gets under our skin? We could blame it on sexism \u2013 personally, sexism is one of my favourite things to blame stuff on; I recommend it highly \u2013 and that would be correct. Still, that diagnosis is a little too blunt to really get at the problem. Women and men, left-wingers and right-wingers alike, all dissolve into spasms of rabid conspiracy theorising and ranting when Clinton\u2019s name comes up.</p> <p>I would argue that Clinton irritates people not just because of her gender, but because we simply can\u2019t process her narrative. There are no stories that prepare us for her trajectory through life and, therefore, we react to her as if she\u2019s a disruption in our reality, rather than a person. We love public women best when they are losers, when they\u2019re humiliated, defeated, or (in some instances) just plain killed. Yet Clinton, despite the disapproval that rains down on her, continues to go out there and chalk up wins.</p> <p>Aversion to successful or ambitious women is nothing new. It\u2019s baked into our cultural DNA. Consider the myth of <a href=\"http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Atalanta.html\">Atalanta</a>. She was the fastest runner in her kingdom, forced men to race her for her hand, and defeated every one of them. She would have gotten away with it, too, if some man hadn\u2019t booby-trapped the course with apples to slow her down, which is presented as a happy ending. By taking away her ability to excel, he also takes away her loneliness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a922734a8da356101e21532d7d953d39f82ce38f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a922734a8da356101e21532d7d953d39f82ce38f/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pushed to the edge: (clockwise from top left) Diana Spencer; Britney Spears; Marilyn Monroe; and Amy Winehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pushed to the edge: (clockwise from top left) Diana Spencer; Britney Spears; Marilyn Monroe; and Amy Winehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Karen Robinson; Getty; Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, there\u2019s the story of <a href=\"https://people.ucsc.edu/~rosewood/writing/tales/orion.htm\">Artemis and Orion</a>: He\u2019s the most handsome hunter in all Greece, and she\u2019s the Virgin Goddess of the Hunt, who\u2019s ready to get rid of the \u201cvirgin\u201d portion for him. Until, that is, her jealous brother Apollo tricks her into an archery contest \u2013 she\u2019s so proud of her aim that she lets Apollo taunt her into shooting at a barely visible speck on the horizon and, therefore, winds up shooting her lover in the head.</p> <p>The lesson is clear, and has been reiterated in countless hacky comedies about cold, loveless career women ever since. Success and love are incompatible for women. For a woman, taking pride in her own talents \u2013 especially talents seen as \u201cmasculine\u201d \u2013 is a sin that will perpetually cut her off from human relationships and social acceptance. She can be good, or liked, not both. The only answer is to let a man beat her, thereby accepting her proper feminine role.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that the people who insist there\u2019s \u201cjust something\u201d off about Hillary Clinton as a politician are so eager to buy the idea there is something sexually wrong with her: frigidity (Hillary Sucks, But Not Like Monica, as per one popular T-shirt); or top-secret lesbianism (why is she so often photographed with political staffer <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/10/07/a-rare-look-inside-huma-abedins-relationship-with-hillary-clinton/\">Huma Abedin</a>?); or simply an Artemis-esque tendency to slaughter her boyfriends, as with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Foster\">deputy White House counsel Vince Foster</a>, who conspiracy theorists have long claimed she had an affair with, then had him killed to keep him from revealing her dark secrets.</p> <p>Yet, though Clinton activates the darkest parts of her critics\u2019 sexual imagination, our yearning for her downfall goes beyond even that. It\u2019s not just that her success makes her unattractive or \u201cunlikable\u201d, it\u2019s that, on some level, we cannot believe her success even exists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a8d3505d985e7f87bde336e6fa371b40c305556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8d3505d985e7f87bde336e6fa371b40c305556/0_754_5291_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We loathe and mock addicted women until the day they die\u2019: Amy Winehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We loathe and mock addicted women until the day they die\u2019: Amy Winehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You hear that disbelief in the frantic insistence of certain Sanders supporters that the primary was \u201crigged\u201d, simply because Clinton won it. You hear it when Trump sputters that Clinton \u201cshould never have been allowed to run\u201d, making her very presence in the race a violation of the accepted order. You can hear it when pundits such as <a href=\"http://pavementpieces.com/author/jwalczak/\">Jonathan Walczak</a> argue that even if Clinton is elected, she should voluntarily resign after one term \u201cfor her own good\u201d. (Also, presumably, good for George Clooney, whom Walczak offers up as a plausible replacement.) Even when we imagine her winning, we can\u2019t imagine her really winning. Unadulterated female success and power, on the level Clinton has experienced, is simply not in our shared playbook. So, even when a Clinton victory is right in front of our eyes, we react, not as if it\u2019s undesirable, but as if it is simply not real. And the thing is, it might not be. Or at least, it might only be temporary: the rise before the big, spectacular, sexism-affirming fall.</p> <p>When I wrote my book, <em>Trainwreck</em>, I was interested in how our culture treats failed women. The answer is that we rarely allow women to be anything else. From the moment a woman arrives in the public eye, we scrutinise her for signs of deviant sexuality, out-of-control emotions, or both. Not surprisingly, when put under constant surveillance and deprived of meaningful privacy, most people eventually reveal human flaws. Which we then broadcast and publicise \u2013 the nip slip, the up-skirt, the broken engagement, the drinking binge \u2013 until the flaws become more famous than the woman herself, until they come to define and contain her, and render her a trainwreck.</p> <p>We don\u2019t just want women to fail, we need it. Female failure is a live demonstration of all our stereotypes about female weakness, and a confirmation of all our old prejudices against women entering the public sphere. When I say old, I mean Paleolithic \u2013 injunctions against female self-expression or fame are everywhere in ancient history. The Christian New Testament \u201c[suffers] not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man;\u201d Pericles wrote that the greatest womanly virtue was \u201cnot to be talked of for good or evil among men\u201d. In the colonial United States and Britain, women who talked too much and started fights were labelled \u201ccommon scolds\u201d \u2013 recommended punishments included making them wear gags or repeatedly dunking them in water to simulate drowning.</p> <p>Nowadays, we can\u2019t literally outlaw the act of women becoming visible, successful or famous. But we still punish the women who do \u2013 by turning their very visibility against them, and making their time in the public eye a reputation destroying misery. The more successful a woman is, the more pleasure we take in demolishing her and turning her into a two-dimensional villain. Hillary Clinton\u2019s extraordinary success may only be tempting the God of Trainwrecks to make her our biggest and best catastrophe yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ea4532a37010207ec3b3c340ba11945891f581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ea4532a37010207ec3b3c340ba11945891f581/414_538_2766_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter holds up a sign as Trump rallies in Tallahassee, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing dirty: a pro-Trump supporter holds up a sign in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If elected, Clinton would not be the first or only female head of state in the world. As the existence of Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel shows, it is possible for female leaders to get along \u2014 with a practiced dullness that prevents them from attracting too much of the limelight and, therefore, too much public rage. But Clinton\u2019s presidency is not likely to follow those patterns. For a look at how her time in the Oval Office might go, and how it might go wrong, we\u2019d do best to look at the fate of Australian Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julia-gillard\">Julia Gillard</a>.</p> <p>Gillard, too, was the first woman of her kind \u2013 at least as far as her home country was concerned. And Gillard, too, was greeted with a tremendous amount of resentment, even hatred, when she made it to the top. Most notoriously, conservatives held a fundraising dinner with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/menu-quail-julia-gillard-liberal\">Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail</a>\u201d on the menu. It featured \u201cSmall breasts, huge thighs and a big red box.\u201d (The same joke has been repurposed at Trump rallies: the \u201cKFC Hillary Special\u201d contains \u201cTwo fat thighs, two small breasts\u2026 left wing.\u201d Look, no one ever said sexists were a laugh riot.)</p> <p>Gillard\u2019s response, initially, was to ignore all this, and attempt to rise above it: \u201cMy essential view was that it was because I\u2019m the first woman, I\u2019m unusual, and it will wash itself out of the system,\u201d she said. This attempt at nobility was her fatal flaw. Without resistance, the sexism escalated to epic proportions. \u201cDitch the Witch\u201d signs were distributed, pornographic cartoons of her circulated online, and her childless status became a national topic, with some commentators alleging she\u2019d rendered herself \u201cdeliberately barren\u201d. Meanwhile, her political rivals whipped up false charges of corruption \u2013 widely regarded now as sheer political calculation \u2013 and began calling her \u201cJu-Liar Gillard\u201d. She responded to some of this in a speech about her experience with sexism that went viral, but it wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 by that time, the trainwreck narrative had firmly taken hold and the speech only made things worse, with rivals declaring she had \u201cdemeaned every woman in [the] parliament\u201d by \u201cplaying the gender card\u201d. Within three years, her own party had ousted her from office, and Gillard not only resigned as prime minister, but left politics for good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gillard failed and provided us with the spectacular flameout we all wanted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb244e1e8a8432a778960f2cd74d5406f5e831f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb244e1e8a8432a778960f2cd74d5406f5e831f/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Abbott speaking at a rally with a banner behind him saying \"JuLiar Bob Browns BITCH'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gender gains: Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott campaigning against Julia Gillard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gillard, in other words, provided us with the spectacular flameout we were looking for. She failed publicly and therefore affirmed that female success and ambition would always rebound on the woman in question, and ruin her life. Of course, these kinds of humiliation aren\u2019t inevitable. They\u2019re consciously inflicted by sexist people on female targets. But the illusion of inevitability comforts us. Witness: as soon as Gillard had been publicly demolished to the point she could not recover, people started liking her.</p> <p>It\u2019s this, the tendency to hate women when they\u2019re up and love them when they\u2019re down, which is the most perverse feature of trainwreck culture and our aversion to female success. Often, with the true centrepieces of trainwreck media \u2013 mentally ill or addicted women, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\">Amy Winehouse</a> or Marilyn Monroe \u2013 we loathe and mock them until the very day they die, then transform them into beloved angels and martyrs after their deaths. Alive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/diana\">Diana, Princess of Wales</a> was a tabloid fixture, a madwoman who featured in stories about throwing up all her food and driving through Paris in only her underpants. Dead, she was England\u2019s Rose.</p> <p>Clinton may not have to go quite that far to win us over. But she fits the pattern. Over and over, we embrace her once we think she\u2019s down for the count. When Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed \u2013 making Hillary appear before the nation as the betrayed and humiliated \u201clittle woman\u201d she\u2019d infamously sworn never to be \u2013 her approval ratings soared, from 42 to 64%. When she ran against Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, people hated her even more feverishly than they do now, yet when he beat her, and she accepted a subordinate position in his administration, she became one of the US\u2019s most popular politicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"545b029b839cdba81ca5e0806f80a2b5846bcba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/545b029b839cdba81ca5e0806f80a2b5846bcba4/0_34_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Gillard in a public forum, smiling and with her hand raised\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As soon as Julia Gillard had been publicly demolished to the point she could not recover, people started liking her.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why does Hillary still get up and apply for the big jobs? Why, when she could so easily garner our love by accepting humiliation and a role in the background, does she persist in stepping forward and aiming for what she wants? All she has to do is let a man beat her \u2013 any man; her husband, a political opponent, anyone \u2013 and she can be loved again. Why does she insist on winning?</p> <p>It\u2019s a feverish gender-politics Catch-22. If Clinton gives up and lets herself be beaten, she\u2019ll experience less sexism which will, in and of itself, be proof of sexism. If she continues being openly, visibly successful, she\u2019ll experience more sexism, but the very fact of her success will demonstrate that sexism is less powerful than we thought.</p> <p>Given the option, Clinton has apparently chosen the harder road \u2013 to keep warping the narrative, keep challenging the idea that disreputable women always end in ruin and wreck and flame. She still may, of course \u2013 there are many, many people rooting for her to fall. But there is something profoundly admirable to how she keeps plugging ahead, looking to provide the world with a new kind of story.</p> <p>Trainwreck<em> by Sady Doyle is published by Melville House at \u00a318.99.

  "<p>There are already winners in this race to the White House \u2013 though their triumph mixes smiles with frowns. They are America\u2019s news media, both TV and digital, which have grown headily on the strength of one magic ingredient: that potent concoction called Trump. Because Trump, for them, means swelling audiences and swelling bank balances. See them smiling? Wait to look deeper, and start to frown.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a smiling Jeff Zucker, boss of CNN, on the wonder of 2016, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-zucker-talks-trump-tv-cnns-ratings-hot-streak-weve-shined-everybody-941575\">\u201cthe best year ever\u201d for cable news</a>. His primetime viewing figures are up 50%. Look at the age range that advertisers like best \u2013 people between 25 and 54 \u2013 and there\u2019s a 90% primetime rise. The gap on Fox News is closing, he tells the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> exultantly\u2013 although, to repeat, all cable news is enjoying record results as it wallows in the great Donald trough.</p> <p>Just watch the money roll in. CNN is said to be forecasting a $100m revenue boost this year to help titillate AT&amp;T\u2019s $85bn appetite as it moves to swallow Time Warner. Hail Trump!</p> <p>Naturally, what works on TV also works whenever a laptop or mobile clicks on. One media planning expert tells the specialist ad industry site Digiday that an overall increase of only 5% in readers and viewers could mean an extra $9.6bn for media publishers. \u201cTrump is a sugar rush. They\u2019re making so much money with these rising audiences addicted to Trump news.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear that all this loot and interest are a Trump phenomenon. The content management research team at Keywee (backed by the New York Times Company) reports that \u201carticles about Trump have higher click-through rates, shares and likes on Facebook than those about Hillary Clinton. A story about Trump garners more than eight times as many likes on Facebook than those about Clinton\u201d.</p> <p>Which is where, of course, the frowning starts. Many blame the media \u2013 whether supportive or antagonistic \u2013 for the wave of publicity that has buoyed the barrage balloon of Trump. Some are bitterly angry that the first woman with a realistic chance of winning the White House has gained so little attention.</p> <p>Others decry the \u201cfairness and balance\u201d rituals of coverage which appear to mean that bad stories about Donald have to be balanced by grey stories about Hillary. (Would the latest ruckus over emails have even registered on the Trump scale of infamy?) A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/01/why-its-entirely-predictable-that-hillary-clintons-emails-are-back-in-the-news/?ref=patrick.net\">grisly riff on this theme </a>is explored by distinguished academics in the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p> <p>The certainty of an October surprise increased as soon as Hillary began coasting to victory, they say. \u201cThe media\u2019s urgency to maintain drama in an election that was increasingly looking like a blowout made [it] all but inevitable \u2026 By definition, to be \u2018news,\u2019 a story must be new. Pursuit of novel stories is thus a core media news value. A dramatic horse race in which the outcome is uncertain and continually fluctuating is perpetually novel.\u201d</p> <p>Seize on the email tale for all \u2013 or more \u2013 than it\u2019s worth then. Keep the audience \u201cengaged\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s one additional frown - nay, Poldarkian scowl - that goes beyond any of these frailties. The media, even Fox News, couldn\u2019t make Trump eight times better Facebook fodder than Clinton. The media couldn\u2019t build Donald up any more than, these past few tumultuous days, it could tear him down. The mighty <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>New York Times</em> can blast away at monster man, but curiously he survives, perhaps rebounds.</p> <p>Context matters. Trump plays big beast in a celebrity-strewn world. This Trump makes TV campaign ads seem soggy and dated. This Trump stirs up all the publicity for himself. He opens his mouth and goes viral in seconds. Do we get the leaders we deserve? Frown over one unpalatable truth: we may all deserve Donald Trump.</p>",
  "<p>Alicia Keys has taken over Times Square, bringing five blocks of one of the busiest areas of the western world to its knees. Her \u201csecret\u201d gig tonight is not so secret. She\u2019ll commandeer the epic digital billboards and her face \u2013 lightly freckled and without makeup, as is her way these days \u2013 will flash all over American Eagle Outfitters.</p> <p>Times Square is Keys\u2019s back yard. She was born in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 1981 and grew up in a one-bedroom apartment on 43rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenue. Her teenage years coincided with the tenure of Mayor Rudy Giuliani: the street is now quietly gentrified, and features the Manhattan Plaza Health Club.</p> <p>She has booked the entire 57th floor of the W hotel to dress for the gig, rest, and do this interview in promotion of <a href=\"http://www.aliciakeys.com/alicia-announces-new-album-and-debuts-new-single/\"><em>Here</em></a>, her first album in four years.

These are the streets that I walked, and learned my lessons on, and heard the music, and witnessed disenfranchised people, and people who just had dreams and hopes. Every pimp, every prostitute, every drug dealer, every Broadway dreamer wishing they could be a writer, or a musician, or an actor.\u201d</p> <p>Her white, Italian-Irish mother, Terria Augello (now Joseph), raised her alone, working as a legal assistant at the Chadbourne and Parke law firm at the Rockefeller Center from the year before she was born until 2001, when her daughter\u2019s debut album, <em>Songs in A Minor</em>, was released (it went on to sell 12m copies). Mum had attended NYU\u2019s School of the Arts and worked on and off as an actor. She started her daughter young: at four, Alicia got a part in <em>The Cosby Show</em>, as one of Rudy Huxtable\u2019s sleepover guests, and can be seen, small and giggling, riding Bill\u2019s leg like a bucking bronco.</p> <p>At 12, in 1993, she attended the newly created, publicly funded Professional Performing Arts School, 10 minutes walk from home and just off Broadway. Claire Danes and Britney Spears were pupils at one time. She was tutored by \u201cMiss Aziza\u2026\u201d she says wistfully. <a href=\"http://www.azizamiller.com/\">Aziza Miller</a> \u2013 \u201cOne of the most phenomenal women jazz instructors ever to be born. She was a pianist, an arranger, a producer, a composer, and she had so much vocal prowess. She was badass. And I know for a fact that she influenced a large part of what I became.\u201d</p> <p>The school kept her off the streets. \u201cYou walked out the door, you had to be ready to protect yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cBe covered up, just get to where you were going.

When Keys released her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc\">Fallin\u2019</a>, in 2001 she already had a certain kind of pedigree.

There was this energy to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a huge divide within the party, because that would have been devastating. I remember just wanting to relay that.\u201d</p> <p>She says she sees in Clinton the possibility for \u201chow powerful women can be\u201d, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s emotional for me as a black woman, wanting to make sure that all the issues are addressed in America when it comes to race, when it comes to black people \u2013 wanting to make sure that message isn\u2019t lost. And that it is continuously on all our agendas \u2013 particularly Hillary\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Is she confident (we are talking four weeks ahead of the election) about the outcome?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just refuse to believe that anything else is going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also know it\u2019s only going to happen if we\u2019re getting out and registering to vote.

She might have to start something herself, she mused at the time \u2013 then Black Lives Matter came along and she didn\u2019t have to. Tidal donated $1.5m this year, on what would have been Trayvon Martin\u2019s 21st birthday. In July, Keys\u2019s charitable foundation, <a href=\"http://weareheremovement.com/\">We Are Here,</a> put together a protest film \u2013<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_VaNhI4CLo\"> \u201c23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\u201d</a> \u2013 which featured Rihanna and Pharrell Williams.

Artists reach people at their heart; it\u2019s the only time we meet in one place and put our differences aside. When you\u2019re in a forum listening to music, all you feel in that moment is love and the understanding.\u201d</p> <p>Keys has known her husband, the producer <a href=\"http://www.swizzworld.com/\">Swizz Beatz</a> (Kasseem Dean), since she was about 16, though they took years to get together. Kanye West once called Dean, 38, the best rap producer of all time. His more unusual accolades include global ambassador for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a place at Harvard Business School. Dean already had three children when he married Keys in 2010. His first son, Prince Nasir, with Nicole Levy, is 16. There\u2019s another, Kasseem, with Harlem songwriter Mashonda Tifrere, singer of the song <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/30612707\">No Panties</a>. And a girl, Nicole, by Jahna Sebastian, whose website claims she helped bring grime to Russia.</p> <p>Keys faced her share of scandal with the relationship, and covers it in the new single B<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\">lended Family (What You Do for Love)</a>, which includes a direct address to her stepchildren: \u201cI know it started with a little drama/ I hate you had to read it in the paper/ But everything\u2019s alright with me and your momma\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my personal journey with my family, and creating a family that\u2019s built on compassion and understanding,\u201d she says, in her broad, new age-y way. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy road. A lot of the modern family is children from different relationships. That\u2019s what family is today, and there\u2019s never been a song about how beautiful it is. There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love for the kids. \u201d</p> <p>Her stepchildren, she says, call her Umi, which is Arabic for mother. Kasseem Dean is Muslim: \u201c4 years of greatness and cheers to 100 plus more inshallah\u201d he Instagrammed, on their anniversary. I ask her if she has converted to Islam. There is a pause, then she says:</p> <p>\u201cI love learning about different religions, and discovering the different ways to worship, and to love the greatness and the higher being that surrounds us all. I definitely believe in a bigger presence, and I really respect all religions; at their core they all teach the same message \u2013 community and kindness and looking out for each other.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HazJhPnrB8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\">Watch the video for Alicia Keys\u2019s In Common.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Growing up, she rarely saw her own father, Craig Cook \u2013 an air steward of Jamaican background, who became a masseur \u2013 but she maintained a close relationship with his parents (though her father\u2019s absence was not, she points out, \u201cexactly a topic for the dinner table\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cI did have a deeper relationship with my nana than I did with my father, and again, that\u2019s how life goes. There\u2019s no rulebook. My grandmother was a very loving woman. The table would be filled with Christmas cards. She could cook really well too \u2013 and then one day, she just decided to stop. My grandfather had passed. Something just changes, you know?\u201d</p> <p>When her grandmother became terminally ill in 2006, Keys took off for Egypt for three weeks by herself. That a single holiday had such a formative impact on her reminds you how young she was when fame hit. She named the first of her two sons Egypt, five years later. Like his namesake with its \u201cimpossible structures\u201d, Egypt Dean loves to build. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s obsessed. He\u2019s like an architect.\u201d</p> <p>At five years old, the tot already has a co-credit producing a song for Kendrick Lamar \u2013 untitled 07, on Lamar\u2019s <em>untitled unmastered</em> album (sample lyric: \u201cshut your fucking mouth and get some cash you bitch!\u201d). He was <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/6898221/swizz-beatz-son-egypt-dean-kendrick-lamar-untitled-unmastered-project\">posted on Instagram by his father</a>, playing a piano intro. \u201cHe really did it,\u201d she assures me. \u201cHe came up with it, heard the melody, picked it out on his piano, and brought it to the studio. Played it, programmed it. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Egypt watched Superbowl 50 sitting next to Kendrick, Jay Z and Usher.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t listen to anything Donald Trump says.\u00a0Does anybody care what he thinks about women?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Keys has said that having children has made her feel more womanly. \u201cAs I grow and I get older I\u2019m realising more and more that there\u2019s such a beautiful, sensual power that we have as women,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really unbelievable and that\u2019s why everybody falls to our feet.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.lennyletter.com/style/a410/alicia-keys-time-to-uncover/\">a piece for Lena Dunham\u2019s Lenny newsletter</a>, she explained the decision to go without makeup which has gripped the world \u2013 from the TV hosts on NBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> morning news show, who <a href=\"http://www.today.com/style/tamron-hall-take-anchors-shed-makeup-after-alicia-keys-performance-t102506\">wiped their own off in solidarity</a>, to the messageboards of Muslim girls debating the difference between liberation and empowerment. The stuff made her feel like a \u201cchameleon\u201d, she says. Going without it is a terrific marketing trick: she even wrote a lyric that goes, \u201cMaybe all this Maybelline is covering my esteem\u201d. And her makeup artist recently revealed that the no-makeup look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/alicia-keys-no-makeup-look-not-quite-real\">actually requires quite a bit of makeup</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8/0_0_6208_6934/895.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Keys\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Keys: \u2018Mary J Blige really resonated with me because she was from New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Kudacki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the campaign certainly suits Keys\u2019s muted, delicately retro R&amp;B persona. Like an American Neneh Cherry, what she was doing 15 years ago feels significant now. Compared with the modern-day vogue for ironic sluttiness, and the subsequent nail-biting over what it means to be feminist in pop, Keys and many of her contemporaries around the millennium offered something comparatively nuanced. Like TLC, her style was boyish \u2013 trousers, boots and braids \u2013 but her lyrics examined love and its vulnerability. One of her signature songs, You Don\u2019t Know My Name, feels almost quaint now, as she poses as a waitress and rings the guy in the \u201cfly blue suit\u201d to ask him out: \u201cI know girls don\u2019t usually do this\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was a relaxed kind of self-possession, girl power without a soapbox. When I ask her what was going on, she lights up.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, it was so good,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1990s, with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, those really big female artists were very glamorous, it was all about the glamour at that time. And so there was a big switch, the desire to be more who you were, not so beholden to this whole standard of beauty. It was a liberation. You see Mary J Blige \u2013 she did the same, wearing the combat boots.\u201d</p> <p>So it was an attitude, as much as a fashion?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, definitely. Mary really resonated with me because she was from New York, and that\u2019s what New York looked like: it wasn\u2019t like a beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly. That represented the type of girl that I was, so that worked for me.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think there\u2019s been a change, in the way female R&amp;B looks now?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/alicia-keys-review-roundhouse-london\">Alicia Keys review \u2013 soul singer opens door to blistering basement bash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes. To me, it just seems like there\u2019s a lot less variety,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the TLCs, or the Marys, you had a chance to see women in different orbits. [TLC\u2019s] Chilli was one way, T-Boz had a whole other style. Now, I think we see almost only one thing when it comes to female performers. Obviously they\u2019re beautiful, so you want to emulate that. But I think there\u2019s some confusion as to what beauty looks like \u2013 it can only be oversexualised. What\u2019s refreshing is when you see people who know how to express themselves in a multitude of ways.</p> <p>\u201cWe think \u2013 or maybe we\u2019re shown \u2013 that the only way to express ourselves is through that very sexy energy. I think there\u2019s more than that which shows our power. For me, I sometimes feel the most sexy when I\u2019m totally covered head to toe.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in the week that it was revealed that Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-howard-stern-tapes-women-35_uk_57fa46e1e4b01fa2b904368b\">acknowledged that his daughter is a piece of ass \u2013 and that 35 is the age he tends to check out on a woman</a>.</p> <p>She cracks her knuckles unnervingly loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to anything that he says.

The judgment had been \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to those who had been \u201cwalking around with smiles on their faces\u201d since the referendum, he said. It had become clear during the Conservative party conference that the government was intent on a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, involving the removal of the UK from the customs union and the single market, and that it believed the referendum gave it a mandate, if not a democratic duty, to deliver.</p> <p>There had been a period of sniping from the Remainers, but it had been judged of little consequence, Flynn suggested. But now the phoney war was over. Or, as one senior Brexiter, a former government minister not at the event, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe Remainers have won this first battle. Now we have to win the war\u201d.</p> <p>It was shortly after 10am on Thursday that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live\">high court\u2019s ruling was delivered</a>. Its impact proved to be all the greater due to the assumption that the challenge was a lost cause, a last futile attempt to turn the Brexit tide. There had also been an unusual level of secrecy around the verdict. None of the lawyers involved had been given the normal advance drafts of the judgment to check for mistakes and to prepare their submissions.</p> <p>The government had argued during a three-day hearing that nothing in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/introduction\">European Communities Act of 1972</a> restricted the crown\u2019s power to withdraw from EU treaties using the royal prerogative without recourse to parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d984fc6b149c6d2c2df4291ee86fb6e151de31b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d984fc6b149c6d2c2df4291ee86fb6e151de31b4/0_0_660_1042/633.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Telegraph with headline 'The judges versus the people'\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Telegraph makes its feelings known on the matter of the high court ruling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the lord chief justice was having none of it.

A No 10 spokesman said May had explained to European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel that \u201cwhile the government is disappointed by the judgment, we remain of the firm belief that we have strong legal arguments ahead of the case which will be moving to the supreme court next month\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister also confirmed that the planned timetable for notification of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">article 50</a> remains the same,\u201d the spokesman added. Whether that proves to be the case \u2013 May has promised to trigger article 50 by the end of March \u2013 is very much open to question.</p> <p>The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has confirmed that a parliamentary bill will most likely be necessary if the high court\u2019s ruling is upheld, and such a bill could be amended with stipulations over everything from a second referendum on the terms of the final deal to mere reassurances on general goals. The proposed legislation may bounce between the Commons and the Lords over weeks and months. \u201cWe will make sure that we build into that bill a referendum that will take place before the UK leaves the EU to give us the opportunity to endorse or reject that deal,\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d3248d4a96ec690cebe272b9d2daff67cf5deb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3248d4a96ec690cebe272b9d2daff67cf5deb7/0_65_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, the prime minister\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, the prime minister, has told European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel that she believes the government has strong legal arguments to take to the supreme court next month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sign of the import</strong> of the moment, for the first time since the court was established in 2009, all 11 justices of the supreme court will now sit to hear the government\u2019s appeal over four days in early December.</p> <p>On which way the judges will fall, every politician has a view. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and justice secretary, said he felt that the verdict was \u201cin line with modern constitutional law\u201d. \u201cNobody starts a war nowadays without getting parliamentary approval, and nobody should completely break economic and trade links with our closest allies without parliamentary approval\u201d, he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThe referendum was always supposed to be advisory.\u201d</p> <p>The former cabinet minister, John Redwood, one of John Major\u2019s famous Maastricht \u201cbastards\u201d, who made the then prime minister\u2019s attempts to sign that EU treaty such a torture, insisted that the decision would be swiftly seen as a piece of \u201cshoddy work\u201d and rejected. \u201cI assume the government is right and they will reverse the lower court\u2019s decision, because it is such a bad decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe passage on the referendum is just laughable.

The supreme court has every reason to say \u2018You haven\u2019t understood referenda\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On Monday the government</strong> will make a statement in parliament on the matter, and a cross-party meeting of MPs who had campaigned for Remain concluded that they would wait until the new ruling to take any decisions on the way forward. But already even those who say they will not block article 50 out of respect to their constituents are citing an array of reassurances that they will require in any upcoming bill. Parliament has been jolted back to life. \u201cCentral government is dominated by the London perspective and the London economy,\u201d said Andy Burnham, the MP for Leigh who is standing to be the mayor of Manchester. \u201cWe can\u2019t have trade deals that protect the City of London but sacrifice other sectors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4176f00b2eb62e77540e25da5bccf14b3bb9ec9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4176f00b2eb62e77540e25da5bccf14b3bb9ec9d/0_199_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We can\u2019t have trade deals that protect the City of London but sacrifice other sectors,\u2019 says former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke added: \u201cI will vote against article 50. That shouldn\u2019t shock anybody. I have believed it is in the national interest to be in the EU for the last 50 years, and big events have proved me overwhelmingly right over that period. The key thing is where we move on from that. To start holding the government to account.</p> <p>\u201cThe referendum decided we would leave but no two ministers are agreed on what steps are and what alternative we are putting in place. Once the government has agreed on a policy on our economic and trading relations with the wider world, it seems to be plain that it is accountable to parliament for that policy.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative MP Stephen Phillips, who campaigned to leave the EU, quit his seat on Friday in protest at the government\u2019s attempt to sideline parliament\u2019s role in shaping Brexit.</p> <p><strong>But as parliament stirs</strong>, so have many of the people who voted for leaving the EU but who came to believe last week, with encouragement from some in the media and political classes, that something undemocratic is afoot. It is even believed by some that those who are celebrating last week\u2019s victory may come to reap a whirlwind, especially if the prime minister feels that she needs a general election to change the nature of parliament in favour of her goals. \u201cThe Lib Dems think defying the referendum result is an electoral ticket back to the big time,\u201d said former justice minister Dominic Raab. \u201cTheir antics just look like irresponsible opportunism, precisely when the country needs to see some unity of purpose behind the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>In the country at large, the mood has become newly toxic. Waiting for his wife outside Gloucester\u2019s historic New Inn on Friday, Ray Marchmont said he was fed up with politicians, politics, the judiciary and probably the media. Gloucester voted Leave by 58.5% to Remain\u2019s 41.5% in June, and Marchmont supported the winning side. \u201cMy vote\u2019s gone out of the window,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken it away from us. I didn\u2019t know anything about this court case. It was a shock when I heard about it, I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. They\u2019ve just said, stuff it, we\u2019re going to do what we want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67fbbd655c624f336dd047f7b31535de1ee27084\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67fbbd655c624f336dd047f7b31535de1ee27084/806_0_2419_3024/800.jpg\" alt=\"MP Stephen Phillips\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Conservative MP Stephen Phillips quit his seat in protest at the government\u2019s attempt to sideline parliament\u2019s role in shaping Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 66-year-old Ukip supporter, added: \u201cI think a lot of it is sour grapes. They\u2019ve said \u2018you have your vote, now we\u2019re going to decide\u2019. If they do vote to turn it over, then I think there could be repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqui Robins, who like Marchmont lives in the city and was one of the 37,776 people to vote Leave in Gloucester, also expressed bewilderment. \u201cIf it\u2019s the people\u2019s choice, then the politicians shouldn\u2019t go against it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy ask the people if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do? It seems like a waste of money and time.\u201d</p> <p>Robins had been intending to vote Remain but had changed her mind during the campaign. \u201cI was going to vote to stay, but then I thought change is good. But if we\u2019re going to go out, then out means out,\u201d she declared, echoing the prime minister\u2019s Brexit utterance.</p> <p>Back in Green Park, O\u2019Flynn, who since leaving Farage\u2019s side has become a Ukip MEP for the East of England, said there was no need for the newspapers to apologise for their attacks on the judiciary \u2013 in fact, he wants more of it. \u201cJudges have this particular conceit of themselves that they\u2019re so lofty that they\u2019re immune to the vulgarity of public opinion. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true\u201d, he said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I was delighted by the newspaper coverage. We need to harness the public outrage. What can Ukip do? I\u2019ve come to the rather happy conclusion that it is our solemn duty to be shamelessly populist.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>From the day that she stepped into Number 10, it has been a no-brainer to some of her colleagues that Theresa May ought to call an early general election. As it has also been to many MPs on the other side of the Commons. Her majority in parliament is slender and just became slimmer with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips</a>, a disillusioned Outer. The Conservatives are favourites to retake his seat, but they won\u2019t be so fortunate with other byelections. John Major started with a larger majority in the parliament that began in 1992 and had lost it by the time he was done. Another reason for her to go to the country early is that the Tory majority doesn\u2019t really belong to Mrs May. It was won by Whatshisname, that bloke who used to live at Number 10. She lacks the personal mandate that flows to a prime minister who has won an election in her own right.</p> <p>The way she has behaved towards senior members of the old regime has created a big club of enemies on her backbenches. Asked recently what he was up to, one very senior figure in the Cameron cabinet smiled: \u201cBiding my time.\u201d Then there is Brexit. At some point in this parliament, probably at several points, there will be torrid political and constitutional crises over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. There will be resignations by ministers. There will be deadlocks and breakdowns in the negotiations. It is highly likely that there will be serious economic convulsions as well. Better, so goes an argument popular with Tory MPs, for Mrs May to armour herself with the much larger majority that the opinion polls indicate can be hers for the asking. That would give her five clear years to get through Brexit and all its havocs.</p> <p>Mrs May has heard those arguments \u2013 and used to dismiss them. She said the voters weren\u2019t clamouring for an election. She thought that what the country most wanted was stability. It didn\u2019t fit with her image of herself to do something that would look opportunistic. Nor did it suit her risk-averse temperament. Her team calculated that Labour was in such a dreadful state that the Tories didn\u2019t need to rush for a quick kill.</p> <p>Has that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\" title=\"\">calculus been changed</a> by the high court ruling that the government must secure parliamentary approval before it can formally trigger divorce proceedings with the European Union? It has. The court ruling was not, as the more hysterical Brextremists have been frothing, an example of elitist judges frustrating the will of the people. The court was reasserting the fundamental principle that the executive cannot rule by monarchical decree, but must seek the consent of parliament if it wants to change the law. There is an alternative to the rule of law \u2013 it is called dictatorship. Those who campaigned to leave the EU in the name of restoring parliamentary sovereignty ought to be able to grasp this.</p> <p>The government might overturn the ruling with a successful appeal to the supreme court, but that looks unlikely. If the supremes agree that the government has to ask parliament before it can activate Article 50, it is as yet unclear how Mrs May intends to conform to the instruction. Some in government seem to think that they might get away with tabling a crude take-it-or-leave-it motion demanding that parliament simply rubber-stamps her decision. That would be defiant of the spirit of the court ruling and perhaps also of its letter. Which is why some ministers think they will have to bring forward legislation.</p> <p>Parliament would not take that as an opportunity to block Brexit. Most MPs were Remainers and so were the majority of peers, but they are not going to flatly defy the referendum result. Parliament might have something to say about the timing of the departure. March is a lousy choice of month to start the countdown to withdrawal. There is a presidential election in France next spring and German elections are due in the early autumn. Nothing meaningful will be negotiated until these are over, which means Mrs May\u2019s current plan simply diminishes the time available to try to make a success of it. MPs and peers could be doing both her and Britain a favour if they slowed her down by a few months.</p> <p>What parliament will definitely do is demand to know more about the government\u2019s exit strategy, if I am not being naive in imagining that such a thing exists. For more than a hundred days, Mrs May has sheltered behind the meaningless mantra \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election\" title=\"\">As one of the first to mock</a> the vacuity of that tautology, I have to confess that it has proved a more durable blocking mechanism than I anticipated, a testimony to the potency of stubborn repetition. One explanation for this long silence could be that the government has an exit plan of such elegance that it is being kept concealed to build up the suspense and increase our collective awe when it is revealed in all its brilliance. No, me neither.</p> <p>I was at the <em>Spectator</em> parliamentary awards dinner when Boris Johnson had the audience in involuntary spasms by declaring that the government would make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-will-be-titanic-success-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">a \u201ctitanic success\u201d of Brexit.</a> There are some deckchairs over there that need rearranging, foreign secretary. The prime minister responded with a threat that was no less vicious for coming in the guise of a joke. Mr Johnson had unwisely compared himself with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/michael-heseltine-confesses-strangling-mothers-dog-to-death-kim-alsatian\" title=\"\">alsatian throttled by Michael Heseltine.</a> Mrs May said: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37863003\" title=\"\">\u201cBoris, the dog was put down when its master decided it wasn\u2019t needed any more.\u201d</a> Yes. She really did. In a room crowded with senior politicians and journalists, the prime minister told her foreign secretary that she would kill him when it pleased her.</p> <p>The government is concealing its intentions not to keep the EU guessing but to try to hide its internal confusions and divisions.</p> <p>When the negotiations begin, and that will be in less than six months\u2019 time if Mrs May preserves her timetable, a lot of it will become very public anyway. She will have to tell all the key actors in the EU, including the commission and the heads of government, what sort of deal she is looking for. It will not stay secret for five minutes. The big trade-off at the heart of the negotiation will be between immigration and trade. That is already known, as are the various permutations of a deal. One of the arguments for not calling an election was that it would force an early reveal of precisely what Mrs May wants from the negotiation and that would inflame Tory divisions. If the consequence of the court ruling is that she has to show more of her hand anyway, that reason for avoiding an early election falls away. The Fixed Term Parliament Act is often cited as an obstacle. Written into the statute book during the coalition years to stop the Tories doing the dirty on the Lib Dems or vice-versa, the legislation does make it more laborious to trigger an election. In the old days, the prime minister could just pop down to Buck House to ask for a dissolution and her majesty would oblige. To get an early election, the government would have to engineer a confidence vote and deliberately lose it. That would look strange. It might try to repeal the Act, but that could run into trouble in the Lords. Alternatively, an election can be triggered if two-thirds of MPs vote to have one. That would be hard for the opposition parties to frustrate. As one senior Labour figure puts it: \u201cOppositions don\u2019t vote against elections.\u201d</p> <p>Labour and the Lib Dems, having both called for an election when Mrs May became prime minister, would find it difficult to explain why they didn\u2019t want one. You might think that Labour would nevertheless try to prevent an election when its poll rating is so dire and the Tories <a href=\"https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016_oct2_guardian.pdf\" title=\"\">have a robust lead</a> often in double figures. Mrs May is <a href=\"https://www.the guardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/twice-voters-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-economy-brexit%E2%80%94opinium-observer-poll\" title=\"\">trusted by more than twice as many voters</a> as Jeremy Corbyn to run the economy successfully and handle Brexit effectively.</p> <p>That suggests an election would see the obliteration of a substantial chunk of Labour MPs. Yet such is the state of the party that a surprisingly large number of its MPs ache for an election, if only to be put out of their misery. \u201cI guess about half of my colleagues secretly want an early election,\u201d says one Labour MP. \u201cThey think, \u2018What the hell, let\u2019s roll the dice, things couldn\u2019t be any worse.\u2019\u201d Though they could, you know. An election in the first half of next year is not yet a certainty, but it has become quite a lot likelier. And, unusually, although for very different reasons, it would be welcome to many MPs on both sides of the Commons.</p> <p>I also detect a subtle, but significant, change in the language coming out of Downing Street when it is asked the question. On Friday, a Number 10 spokesperson declared: \u201cWe have been very clear: there is no requirement for a general election before 2020.\u201d That\u2019s not really clear at all. That\u2019s not the same as saying that there definitely won\u2019t be one. There\u2019s no requirement for me to have steak and chips for my dinner, but I might choose to do so all the same.</p>",

He has blamed a nonexistent crime wave on Mexican immigrants and pledged to get tough with, yes, refugees from Syria.

Were you to draw a Venn diagram of the three groups whose interaction defines the modern-day Democratic party \u2013 liberals, meritocrats and plutocrats \u2013 the space where they intersect would be an island seven miles off the coast of Massachusetts called Martha\u2019s Vineyard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e3b7c69db4a0986f05d80fe34954ce503ea3305\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e3b7c69db4a0986f05d80fe34954ce503ea3305/0_0_3008_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A patriotic house in Martha's Vineyard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying the flag in Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2013 a place of yachts, celebrities and closed-off beaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A little bit smaller in area than Staten Island but many times greater in magnitude of wealth, Martha\u2019s Vineyard is a resort whose population swells each summer as the wealthy return to their vacation villas. It is a place of yachts and celebrities and fussy shrubbery; of waterfront mansions and Ivy League professors and closed-off beaches. The markers of lifestyle enlightenment are all around you: foods that are organic. Clothing that is tasteful. A conspicuous absence of cigarette butts. Sometimes, the perversity of the place is capable of slapping you right in the face. I was reminded of this as I strolled through one of the polished, stately towns on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and came across a shop selling reproductions of old T-shirts, sports memorabilia and the like. On the outside wall of the shop hung a poem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/24/charles-bukowski-on-cats-book-published\">Charles Bukowski</a>, because, of course, nothing goes better with tasteful clothing than transgressive poetry. It\u2019s about the horror of blue-collar life, about \u201cmen I\u2019ve known\u201d who work in factories and who do the kind of dehumanising labour that no one who passes by here ever does any more.</p> <p>When I think of the men I\u2019ve known who work in factories, I often think of a group of locked-out workers I met in Decatur, Illinois, in 1994, during the early days of the Bill Clinton administration. Their quintessentially average town was embroiled in three industrial actions: in addition to a lockout at Tate &amp; Lyle\u2019s Staley plant, there were strikes at Caterpillar and at Firestone. The contests grew bitter; the police grew violent; the workers made common cause with one another; people started referring to Decatur as the \u201cwar zone\u201d.</p> <p>What they meant by this phrase was not merely that cops could be mean, but that capitalism had declared war on blue-collar prosperity itself. As a locked-out worker told me in 1994, after reflecting on industrial struggles of the past: \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn. And if we don\u2019t do it, then the middle class as we know it in this country will die. There will be two classes and it will be the very very poor and the very very rich.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a34db05701005f475596d6ec45d1bfdbfa591d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a34db05701005f475596d6ec45d1bfdbfa591d4/0_173_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striking UAW members picket the Caterpillar factory in Decatur, Illinois in November 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking UAW members picket the Caterpillar factory in Decatur, Illinois in November 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Perlman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he ever right about that. In a scholarly paper about social class published in 1946, the sociologist <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/22115\">C Wright Mills</a> found that \u201cbig business and executives\u201d in Decatur earned a little more than two times as much as the town\u2019s \u201cwage workers\u201d. In 2014, by contrast, the CEO of Archer Daniels Midland, a company that dominates Decatur today, earned an estimated 261 times as much as average-wage workers. The CEO of Caterpillar, the focus of one of the \u201cwar-zone\u201d strikes, made 486 times as much. Caterpillar\u2019s share price, meanwhile, is roughly 10 times what it was at the time of the strike.</p> <p>Other changes to sweep that town since the war-zone days of the 90s are just as familiar, just as awful. For one thing, Decatur\u2019s population has shrunk by about 12% since then. Despite this outflow of people, in early 2015, the place still had the highest unemployment rate in Illinois.</p> <p>In 2015, I went back to Decatur to catch up with veterans of the war zone such as Larry Solomon, who had been the leader of the local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/13/new-generation-of-united-auto-workers-push-to-end-second-tier-union-status\">United Automobile Workers</a> union at the Caterpillar plant. He went back in after the strike ended but retired in 1998. When I met Solomon in his tidy suburban home, he talked in detail about the many times he got crossways with management in days long past, about all the grievances he filed for his co-workers over the years and all the puffed-up company officials he recalls facing down.</p> <p>Think about that for a moment: a blue-collar worker who has retired fairly comfortably, despite having spent years confronting his employer on picket lines and in grievance hearings. How is such a thing possible? I know we\u2019re all supposed to show nothing but love for the job creators nowadays, but listening to Solomon, it occurred to me that maybe his attitude worked better. Maybe it was that attitude, repeated in workplace after workplace across the country, which made possible the middle-class prosperity that once marked America as a nation.</p> <p>\u201cWe were promised, all during the time we worked at Caterpillar, that when you retire, you\u2019re going to have a pension and full benefits at no cost to you,\u201d Solomon recalled. He told about a round of contract negotiations he and his colleagues attended in the 1960s during which a management official complained: \u201cWe already take care of you from the cradle to the grave. What more could you want?\u201d</p> <p>Today, that old social contract is gone or, at least, the part of it that ensured healthcare and retirement for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/zero-hours-contracts-worse-jobs-for-life-work-unions\">blue-collar workers</a>. Now, as Solomon sees it, companies can say: \u201cWe want your life, and when your work life is over, then goodbye. We thank you for your life, but we\u2019re not responsible for you after we turn you out.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Griffin had been another outspoken union activist, in his case during the lockout at Tate &amp; Lyle. When we met up last year, we talked about the situation that faces the younger generation in Decatur, people for whom the basic components of middle-class life are growing further and further out of reach. Though they might not always get it politically, Griffin said, those workers can most definitely see how screwed they are. \u201cOne of the things that they do understand is that they got shit jobs with shit wages and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/09/federal-contract-workers-complaint-new-minimum-wage-standard\">no benefits and no health insurance</a>,\u201d he told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafe92c586e5ca8b6142e085c542644eb273e2b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafe92c586e5ca8b6142e085c542644eb273e2b4/0_353_4268_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s in Albany, New York State.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s in Albany, New York State.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Groll/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd they understand,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat they\u2019re working two and three jobs just to get by, a lot of them can\u2019t own anything and they understand seeing Mom and Dad forced into retirement or forced out of their job, now they\u2019re working at <a href=\"http://www.hardees.com/\">Hardee\u2019s</a> or McDonald\u2019s to make ends meet so they can retire in poverty. People understand that. They see that.\u201d</p> <p>Those awful words are a fairly accurate account of the situation faced by a vast part of the population in America, a population that was brought up expecting to enjoy life in what it is often told is the richest country in the world. It is not really the fault of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/obama-support-minimum-wage-inequality-speech\">Barack Obama</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/07/clinton-era-welfare-reforms-american-poor-bernie-sanders\">Bill Clinton</a> that things have unfolded in such a lousy way for these people. As everyone knows, it is the Republicans that ushered the world into the neoliberal age; that cut the taxes of the rich with a kind of religious conviction; that did so much to unleash Wall Street and deregulate everything else; that declared eternal war on the welfare state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/obama-support-minimum-wage-inequality-speech\">Obama throws support to minimum wage movement in economy speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But history works in strange ways. Another thing the Republicans did, beginning in the late 60s, was to present themselves as the party of ordinary, unaffected people, of what Richard Nixon (and now Donald Trump) called the \u201csilent majority\u201d. They cast the war between right and left as a kind of inverted class struggle, in which humble, hard-working, God-fearing citizens would choose to align themselves with the party of Herbert Hoover.</p> <p>And so Republicans smashed unions and cut the taxes of the rich even as they praised blue-collar citizens for their patriotism and their \u201cfamily values\u201d.

In 2004, I went back to my home state of Kansas to ask why it had moved so far to the right since the days of Dwight Eisenhower; the answer, I discovered, was the culture wars \u2013 abortion, gun control, obscenity, education and so on.</p> <p>And beneath every one of these culture war issues lay the burning insult of snobbery. A \u201cliberal elite\u201d, it seemed, was forever conspiring against the values of ordinary people, telling them what to do and how to do it without any concern for what they actually believed. The best thing about the culture wars was that they required the Republicans to deliver very little to their growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">blue-collar base</a>; the wars were unwinnable almost by definition, a matter of entertainment rather than politics in the traditional sense. The ones who got tangible gains out of this form of populism were the party\u2019s clients among the business elite.</p> <p>In the decades I am describing, Republicans also perfected the ugly art of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/trump-clinton-gun-control-policies-race-policing\">concealed racist appeal</a>, which helped them to win many of the southern states and plenty of white votes in other places and whose echoes we hear so distinctly in the Trump campaign. Between that nasty strategy and the working-class outreach I am describing, Republicans enjoyed years of electoral success. At the top of the party structure stood the interests it served \u2013 big business, the very rich \u2013 and at the bottom was its mass constituency, which seemed to grow more proletarian and more frustrated as the years passed.</p> <p>This mixture of cultural populism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-brexit-anti-establishment-politics\">free-market orthodoxy</a> was not a stable one. Doing favours for the rich while encouraging fruitless, culture-based class grievances among working people was a contradiction difficult to sustain, a delicate balancing act that could only be pulled off as long as the economy stayed reasonably good and the price tag of inequality remained bearable.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">financial crisis of 2008</a> and the lingering recession shattered the whole thing. By 2016, as blue-collar wages continued to stagnate and inequality to worsen, the base of the Republican party had lost its appetite for pointless culture crusades: they demanded something real. And of the 17 Republican candidates for president this year, Donald Trump offered exactly that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-brexit-anti-establishment-politics\">Trump, Brexit and demand for change: the year of the political outsider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He railed against a rotten political establishment that did nothing for working people; he promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/guardian-view-on-us-presidency-time-is-right-for-female-leader-hillary-clinton\">defend social security</a> and to renegotiate the trade deals that are widely blamed for the deindustrialisation of the midwest. He also scapegoated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall\">Muslims and illegal immigrants</a>, blaming them falsely for all manner of offences. And he did it all in the bluntest terms, with a self-absorbed way of speaking that somehow captured the imagination of this unhappy era. Even his grotesque, bombastic style seemed to confirm his appeal; at the Republican convention in July, I heard him described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/republican-reaction-donald-trump-speech-convention\">blue-collar billionaire</a>\u201d.</p> <p>From one perspective, Trump\u2019s rise has merely marked the evolution of Republican populism. It has always been a form of entertainment, and Trump is a captivating entertainer. Traditional Republican leaders, however, regard Trump as a pariah, thanks to his market-offending stands on trade, social security and bank regulation. These leaders have abandoned him in droves, while he has promised to remake the Republicans into a \u201cworkers\u2019 party.\u201d</p> <p>But what has also made Trumpism possible is the simultaneous evolution of the Democrats, the traditional workers\u2019 party, over the period I have been describing. They went from being the party of Decatur to the party of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and they did so at roughly the same time that the Republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the \u201cliberal elite\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b70e18ca01d3a772107cfc0f3709611da7670155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70e18ca01d3a772107cfc0f3709611da7670155/0_16_3921_2353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at a CNN Democratic presidential debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at a TV debate: the Democratic party has \u2018mounted notable efforts to cajole or shame\u2019 young former Sanders supporters to vote for Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so the reversal is complete and the worst choice ever is upon us. We are invited to select between a populist demagogue and a liberal royalist, a woman whose every step on the campaign trail has been planned and debated and smoothed and arranged by powerful manipulators.

  "<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t say the A-word here anymore,\u201d a social worker once told me when I dared to ask why there are hardly any adoptions in Australia.</p> <p>But, with our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/22/labor-criticises-85m-reform-plans-for-foster-care-homes-after-girl-x-failures\">foster care system in crisis</a>, it\u2019s time to talk about an alternative option for the increasing number of children removed from their home due to abuse or neglect.</p> <p>Adoption is so tainted by its dark history in Australia that it remains a taboo. To many, it conjures images of rich white couples sauntering into orphanages, picking out the cutest brown babies and whisking them away before the impoverished birth mothers know what\u2019s happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/06/queensland-proposes-new-laws-for-same-sex-couples-to-adopt-children\">Queensland proposes new laws for same-sex couples to adopt children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In reality, many ordinary Australians spend years fighting bureaucracy and making sacrifices to earn the right to take care of traumatised children nobody else wants.</p> <p>It is appropriate that National Adoption Awareness Week<em> </em>in Australia coincides with Hillary Clinton\u2019s likely election as president. </p> <p>Clinton helped transform the US child protection system to favour (permanent) adoption of children in preference to (temporary) foster care.</p> <p>In her 1996 book, It Takes a Village, she expressed concern at the number of kids yo-yoing between different homes. She highlighted the need to \u201cmake decisions about terminating parental rights of abusive parents more quickly, rather than removing and returning abused children time and again\u201d.</p> <p>Her work underpinned the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, signed by the then president, Bill Clinton. The new law provided for fast-tracking of decisions on permanency for children. Importantly, the reforms included provisions for financial assistance for both birth families (to help them keep their kids) and adoptive families (for post-care support).</p> <p>The Washington Post hailed the act as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/april99/fosterlaw011898.htm\">the most significant change in federal child protection policy in almost two decades</a>\u201d because it turned an adult-focused system into one that made child safety a \u201cparamount concern\u201d. The new law led to a big drop in the number of children in foster care and a corresponding rise in those adopted.</p> <p>Australia has moved in the opposite direction. The number of children in foster care has skyrocketed \u2013 there are now 43,000 kids living without a permanent home. Many spend their entire childhood being handballed from one placement to another before transiting <a href=\"http://vcoss.org.au/documents/2013/06/Insight.CheStockley.Final_.pdf\">into juvenile justice</a>. Yet there were fewer than 100 foster care adoptions last year and just seven outside NSW.</p> <p>Adoption is not viable for all foster kids. Some have been so damaged by constant moves and <a href=\"https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/case-study/cde18d1b-fade-43f4-83f4-46e9af48b543/case-study-24,-march-2015,-sydney\">re-abuse in care</a>, they\u2019re now unable to settle in a family home. Others remain emotionally attached to birth families and could be returned if it weren\u2019t for our woeful underfunding of social support services. </p> <p>But there\u2019s a third subset of children whose parents are deceased, remorsefully abusive or simply unwilling to care for them. In most states, adoption is not pursued even for them.</p> <p>This is typified by the case of the former AFL player Brad Murphy, who grew up in state care because his dad was in jail and his mum didn\u2019t want him. He desperately wanted to be adopted by his loving foster parents but the Victorian government wouldn\u2019t allow it because his birth father wouldn\u2019t provide consent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/17/adoption-at-all-time-low-in-australia-because-of-focus-on-family-reunion\">Adoption at all-time low in Australia 'because of focus on family reunion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Murphy remained in the oxymoronic state of \u201cpermanent care\u201d, where care rights are granted to one family for 18 years. Such rights can be challenged in court. He was in constant fear of hearing a knock on the door from someone who might take him away. He felt he never truly belonged to anyone. His athletic prowess and determination allowed him to become a rare foster care success story but he\u2019s aware of four others who transited through his home that have since taken their own life. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s pre-1980s history of forced adoptions \u2013 where Aboriginal and single women were coerced into handing over their babies and denied future contact \u2013 helps explain today\u2019s status quo. NSW has been the only state to pursue pro-adoption reforms and this led to cries <a href=\"http://www.wlsnsw.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Child-protection-Open-letter-to-Minister-Gowardf.pdf\">that government is once again trying to steal children</a>.</p> <p>But adoption as practised today is different from the past. Laws mandate transparency and contact with birth families is maintained wherever possible. Indeed, there is so much rigour and paperwork that an adoption takes, on average, four years to process, according to the lobby group Adopt Change. This deters many prospective adoptive parents. If state bureaucrats are trying to steal children, they ought to appear on an episode of World\u2019s Dumbest Criminals.</p> <p>Four years is a long, uncertain time in the life of child. There is an urgent need for laws, practices and attitudes to change to put children\u2019s interests first and enable timely processing of adoption for those who want it. On this issue, we are 20 years behind Clinton. Our most vulnerable children should wait no longer.</p> <p><em>National Adoption Awareness Week is between 6 and 12 November.</em></p>",
  "<p>If Bono, being a man, is not everyone\u2019s ideal <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/women-of-the-year-bono\" title=\"\">Woman of the Year</a>, the publishers of <em>Glamour</em> magazine, Cond\u00e9 Nast, should be congratulated on stimulating a sudden surge of interest in a title that, contending with a generally declining sector, amid a welter of competing awards, definitely needed the attention. Take a bow, Cond\u00e9 Nast executives Charles, Robert, Anna (Wintour), David and Fred. Like Bono, you guys (and Anna) remind us, in the words of <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s editor, of the \u201cmany men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days\u201d.</p> <p>The only difficulty will come next year, when <em>Glamour</em> must outdo itself to get noticed or appear to go backwards. Maybe it could make the whole Women of the Year list male, or feature a few brave pets or children in the line-up, assuming that has not already been attempted, given the acute talented woman shortage, by its rivals.</p> <p>Anyway, thousands must have rushed to the <em>Glamour</em> website, the better to comprehend how Bono, the singer, humanitarian and pious tax-avoider, had beaten all contenders, male and female to this honour, and then stayed, as I did, to read its <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/heres-your-love-horoscope-for-november-2016\" title=\"\">Love Horoscopes</a>. It was like going back to 1980. \u201cNovember starts off with Venus travelling through your ambition angle, increasing the appeal of powerful or older men.\u201d Not, you gather, that the current editors of <em>Glamour</em> appear to need any encouragement in that respect.</p> <p>Explaining the Bono award, Cindi Leive, the magazine\u2019s editor, pointed out that this powerful older man, unlike <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s female winners, \u201ccould select any cause in the world to call his own\u201d. Name a noble cause \u2013 peace, the climate, saving honey bees \u2013 and Bono might have chosen it. Yet, like a Mills and Boon surgeon or mighty sheikh, entitled to date only the beautiful, Bono, the tireless philanthropist, a man as revered by world leaders as he is by top accountants, has actively chosen to spend time with the poorest, mousiest, most bespectacled of all causes: women.</p> <p>Can it be true? Yes, writes Cindi: \u201cWhen a major male rock star who could do anything at all with his life decides to focus on the rights of women and girls worldwide \u2013 well, all that\u2019s worth celebrating.\u201d</p> <p><em>Glamour</em> contributor Christiane Amanpour underlined to readers the true significance of this compliment. \u201cBono is making clear that powerful men can, and should, take on these deep-rooted issues.\u201d If his message catches on, maybe the whole feminist business could ultimately be outsourced to powerful men, at least until women get better at doing it themselves?</p> <p>The prizewinner sounded willing enough. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for this award as a chance to say the battle for gender equality can\u2019t be won unless men lead it as well as women,\u201d Bono said. Perhaps aware that this might not sound ideally he-for-she, or even plausible, given the history of, say, the male-dominated, gender-equalising Labour party, he explained: \u201cWe\u2019re largely responsible for the problem, so we have to be involved in the solutions.\u201d Maybe he\u2019s not up to speed with Liam Fox, post-Brexit.</p> <p>So what does gender-equality leadership mean to Bono? By way of a clue, he recently, as an ally of the pope, urged us to \u201c<a href=\"http://aleteia.org/2015/06/04/bono-listen-to-pope-francis-and-it-will-end-corruption-and-hunger/\" title=\"\">listen to Papa Francisco</a>\u201d. Specifically, on eradicating poverty and ending corruption.</p> <p>Though the contrast between Bono\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/15/bono-defends-u2-corporation-tax-arrangements\" title=\"\">fascinating taxation arrangements</a> and his objections to those of, say, Exxon Mobil will not disqualify him, in all women\u2019s eyes, from being their gender-equality leader, <em>Glamour</em> might have looked more closely at Papa Francisco\u2019s latest statements on women priests. With a notable unwillingness, unlike <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s Women of the Year judges, to challenge tradition, the pope has just reaffirmed that since Jesus\u2019s apostles were men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/pope-francis-women-never-roman-catholic-priests-church\" title=\"\">women must forever be second-class </a>believers.</p> <p>Then again, with <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s new interest in paternalism, we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the pope is bang on trend. The idea that men enjoy too much power, and thus have no place on all-women shortlists, is, Cindi Leive explained, \u201can outdated way of looking at things\u201d. Actually, <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s excitement about getting its hands on Bono was more redolent than anything of <em>Cosmo</em>, in the magazine era when Helen Gurley Brown was writing articles such as \u201cHow to Get Men to Give You Presents\u201d. \u201cHe talks, you listen,\u201d she once said, on pleasing men. \u201cYou can talk to your girlfriends, your boss, your secretary. But you may not do all the talking you would like to do with him.\u201d It was a process she called \u201csinking in\u201d. For all Gurley Brown\u2019s boosterish words on female independence, her biographer, Gerri Hirshey, has written: \u201cShe was a realist, not a revolutionary.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair to <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s judges, though no previous woman\u2019s award panel has done as much to reach out to the rich, entitled, white men routinely excluded from all-women awards, they were not the first to suggest that the women\u2019s movement could benefit from alpha \u2013 even beta \u2013 male approval.</p> <p>Had they sounded more like Emma Watson, or picked Obama, rather than Papa Francisco\u2019s co-worker, as their first-ever male woman of the year, the magazine might have enjoyed the sort of delirious reception that recently greeted the president\u2019s identification of himself as <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/glamour-exclusive-president-barack-obama-says-this-is-what-a-feminist-looks-like\" title=\"\">a male feminist</a>. It would be difficult for any feminist to resist that quality of leadership alliance, not that Obama would have been so tone deaf as to propose one. Maybe it does not need saying, outside <em>Glamour</em>, that any male feminist who volunteers to represent feminists, as opposed to join them, either does not get feminism or is having a laugh.</p> <p>As with <em>Glamour</em> snagging Bono, and campaigners who believed Russell Brand to be an anti-Page 3 asset, <em>Elle</em> and the Fawcett Society were well pleased, a couple of years ago, when they got Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, and assorted successful men, to model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/david-cameron-this-is-not-what-a-feminist-looks-like\" title=\"\">This is What a Feminist Looks Like</a> T-shirts.</p> <p>Even then, there was an obvious issue of quality control, not to speak of the contradictions. If a man owed his prominence to discrimination against women, why seek his blessing? And whether or not you liked, or respected them, how was the support of two doomed losers \u2013 Miliband being already among the most unpopular Labour leaders in history \u2013 not more advantageous to them than to feminism? How comically mediocre did men have to be before it outweighed the great prize of their maleness? Miliband, whose traceless ascent came courtesy of all-male Blair and Brown elites, went on to demonstrate his feminist commitment by relying on almost exclusively male advice in his tragic \u201cEd Stone\u201d election campaign. The legacy of his fellow feminist, Clegg, would be a party of eight men and another discarded T-shirt.</p> <p>As for the more sought-after male feminists, notably Benedict Cumberbatch, the very exultation over their recruitment only added to an impression of girlish longing for male approval: see, an important man likes us! Bono likes us! There\u2019s glamour for you.</p>",

However, in a reflection of both candidates\u2019 underlying unpopularity, almost a third of respondents (32%) said they would not vote for either.</p> <p>The findings also suggest that the election is widely considered a foregone conclusion despite a late surge in support for Trump: 48% of UK adults expect Clinton to win the presidency, while 18% think a Trump victory is most likely.</p> <p>Of supporters of the major UK parties, only among Ukip voters did supporters of Trump outnumber those of Clinton: 43% of the party\u2019s voters would back the divisive billionaire, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\" title=\"\">enlisted the support of Nigel Farage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\" title=\"\">compared his campaign to the Brexit movement.</a></p> <p>The survey shows the Democratic candidate soundly beating Trump on a range of issues, including relations with Britain and global security. The Republican candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin\" title=\"\">who has praised Vladimir Putin</a> and suggested the US could withdraw from Nato under his presidency, is deemed a risk to international stability by 62% of Britons.</p> <p>Similarly, few voters believe a Trump victory would be good for Britain\u2019s so-called special relationship with the US. Just 16% of those surveyed said he would be a friend to the UK as president, compared with 41% for Clinton. Meanwhile, 53% think the British government should seek to improve its relationships with countries other than the US if Trump wins.</p> <p>Widespread dislike for Trump among the British public is also reflected by the words most commonly associated with the candidate. Dangerous (71%) was the most common word, followed by hate (61%) and fear (60%). Clinton inspires a more positive reaction. According to the poll, she is most associated with intelligence (58%), maturity (55%), and competence (50%).</p>",
  "<p>Once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago, small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or, as we called it then, \u201cdisruptive\u201d. Now? Not so much. In 2016, it\u2019s cool to be disruptive. It\u2019s what every startup in Silicon Valley is straining to do.</p> <p>It\u2019s what Airbnb has done \u2013 disrupting the hotel industry as Uber has disrupted taxis and Amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else. Two years ago I went to a conference in San Francisco, TechCrunch Disrupt, and met many people claiming to disrupt many things, including, in one case, socks.</p> <p>But what no one anticipated was that, though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to one\u2019s home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk, it might also lead to where we are now: 6 November 2016. Two days, potentially, before the world changes forever.</p> <p>Because Donald Trump is not just an over-tanned reality-TV star gone rogue. He is not a weaponised version of Lord Sugar. He is what happens when technology changes everything. \u201cDisruption,\u201d wrote Clayton Christensen, the professor at Harvard Business School who coined the idea, is the \u201ctechnology mudslide hypothesis\u201d. It\u2019s how some scrappy little upstart like Microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was IBM. It\u2019s how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge, unexpected, world-changing consequences.</p> <p>It\u2019s Donald Trump. The living, breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry. Only this time it\u2019s not an industry, it\u2019s democracy.</p> <p>We have fetishised \u201cdisruption\u201d. Governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path \u2013 the market must do what the market must do. Only now, the wave is breaking on its shore.</p> <p>Because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted, is disrupting, is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself \u2013 the best, most stable, most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with.</p> <p>In many crucial ways, it doesn\u2019t even matter who wins on Tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about Trump is that if it hadn\u2019t been him it would have been someone else. It\u2019s the opposite of the Great Man theory of history: a misogynistic ex-reality TV star is not the game-changer here, it\u2019s technology.</p> <p>Two days ago, the same hackers who took down Twitter and Netflix and the <em>Guardian</em> and Reddit and CNN last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen, started practising on a country. Computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes \u2013 the connected devices that comprise the so-called internet of things and that, it\u2019s been discovered, a bit late, are hopelessly insecure.</p> <p>It has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet-destroying machine, the so-called Mirai botnet, and it\u2019s honing its power. Last week it took aim at an entire country \u2013 Liberia. A huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west African country \u2014 bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt.</p> <p>The worst case scenario? That the hackers behind it are \u201cpractising\u201d for Tuesday, when they\u2019ll aim their massed computing power against America.</p> <p>This is everyday objects in our own homes, \u201csmart\u201d objects, intenet-enabled toasters and refrigerators. Because this is where we are: our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on Earth.</p> <p>And if that reads like the most lunatic sentence you\u2019ve ever read, you maybe haven\u2019t been paying close enough attention to 2016.</p> <p>Because this is possibly, finally, the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium-coloured gadget in our pockets. It\u2019s the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same. That has enabled thousands of Twitterbots \u2013 algorithms \u2013 to scrape the internet for stories about Trump and then retweet them.</p> <p>It was robot accounts that caused \u201c#TrumpWon\u201d to trend after each TV debate and allowed Trump to claim \u201cvictory\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s how a man who hasn\u2019t set foot on the street for four years, can, with just his laptop, create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign. By leaking emails that potentially implicate Hillary Clinton, Julian Assange has inserted himself \u2013 like computer malware \u2014 into the heart of the American democratic process. He\u2019s infected it. He is, like Donald Trump, the law of unintended consequences writ large, in human form.</p> <p>In 2010, we didn\u2019t mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen. Here in the liberal press, we championed it. Because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities. Or, at least mine. And now? Not so much.</p> <p>But then technology is neutral. There is no left or right. There is only hackers and Twitterbots and 16-year-olds in Macedonia who, Buzzfeed reported last week, earn money via Google AdSense for writing made-up stories about Trump and making them go viral on Facebook.</p> <p>In a single Macedonian town \u2014 Veles \u2013 there are at least 140 websites about American politics run by Macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories. Teenagers can earn up to $5,000 a month by making up things about Trump. They don\u2019t care about Trump or Clinton or anyone else. They\u2019ve just worked out what the US public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether it\u2019s true or not.</p> <p>The best way of making money via Google is to write clickbait, and the best clickbait they\u2019ve discovered, the stories that are spread widest and furthest in Facebook and Twitter, are stories about Trump. More specifically, false stories about Trump.</p> <p>Because in 2016 we read the news we want to read. The so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d, the means by which Google and Facebook give us more of what we want, or what we already know \u2013 our searches and our newsfeeds are programmed to reflect our previous searches and newsfeeds \u2014 is becoming not so much a bubble as a ghetto. Walled in, closed off, airless.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that search engines have been shown to influence election results \u2013 the higher up a candidate\u2019s name is listed in any search, the more likely they are to win. It\u2019s also that the less we know about how other people think, the less we know.</p> <p>We\u2019re increasingly living in an echo chamber, exposed only to views which chime with our own. The impression this gives is that everyone is like us, thinks like us, wants to be like us.</p> <p>Yet most people are not like us. Maybe that\u2019s what 2016 has come to teach us. That and the idea that Google and Facebook are out to make the world a better place is both absurd and irrelevant.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter what Mark Zuckerberg wants or what Sergey Brin intends. The people who donated to WikiLeaks didn\u2019t intend to get the first potential female US president investigated by the FBI. Nobody wanted their fridge to bring down CNN.</p> <p>Google didn\u2019t intend to drive all newspapers out of business. It\u2019s just something that is happening along the way.</p> <p>And this time, it\u2019s the big one. The Great Disruption. With Trump the Great Disruptor.</p> <p>Will democracy survive? Will Nato? Is a free and fair election possible in a post-truth world when every word any candidate has ever written can be stolen and exposed and distorted? Who knows?</p> <p>It\u2019s a crapshoot from here on in. Go tell that to your filter bubble. Because that\u2019s all you can do. No one else is listening.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Could the ruling lead to no Brexit?</strong><br></h2> <p>In itself no, because this is a ruling about how Brexit is achieved \u2013 the process \u2013 not the desirability or otherwise of it. The decision to leave has been taken and would require another referendum to reverse. What the judges decided was how the process of leaving had to be carried out. They determined that parliament should be the body that decides on matters to do with UK law, in this case the triggering of article 50, which sets the UK on a two-year path to exit and will mean EU laws no longer apply here. The government had argued this could be done by royal prerogative, effectively side-stepping parliament. The judges disagreed.</p> <p>There is no doubt, however, that the judgment gives the Remain side, which has a majority in the Commons and Lords, new opportunities to try to ensure Brexit is not too hard, that we remain tied into as many of the EU\u2019s projects \u2013 the single market, police cooperation, and research \u2013 as possible, while leaving full membership of the club. Longer term, some Remainers believe there is a chance that the public will turn against Brexit if and when people see that the rosy future they were promised outside the EU is not quite so easy to achieve after all. If the judgment means the dangers of leaving come more into the public mind, it is possible it could mark a turning point.</p> <h2><strong>What does the ruling mean the government now has to do?</strong></h2> <p>Theresa May made clear last week that she will appeal against the decision in the supreme court. The case will be heard next month, and a ruling made quite swiftly. If, as most people assume, that appeal fails, ministers will have to prepare legislation so that parliament can play the role the judges said it must, in setting in motion article 50.</p> <p>The nightmare for the prime minister, however, is that she will no longer be able to hide behind her stock, stalling phrases, \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d and \u201cwe won\u2019t give a running commentary\u201d \u2013 that have covered the fact that ministers are unclear how to proceed as they never expected the public to vote to leave.</p> <p>If May does not reveal quickly what kind of Brexit she wants (single market membership or not?), MPs will use the parliamentary process which the courts have insisted on to force decisions and clarity on her. They can seek to amend the bill which will have to be presented to them, to shape Brexit as they want to see it. A majority of MPs across all parties could then force her hand. If the Commons does not amend the bill, the House of Lords certainly will seek to do so.</p> <p>Ministers have to try to find a position on Brexit that will win the backing of MPs and peers. How they do it, no one knows.</p> <h2><strong>Will it be a free vote?</strong></h2> <p>This will be the subject of great debate in both the Tory and Labour parties. Cabinet ministers were allowed to campaign as they wished before the referendum vote so it is difficult to see how Conservative MPs can be forced to vote against their wishes at this stage, particularly if amendments are submitted on issues such as single market membership. The Tory manifesto committed the party to safeguard the UK\u2019s position in the single market, whether we left or stayed in the EU. So to force MPs to vote to leave it would not be popular with many. The danger of imposing a whip on MPs is that many will rebel. Informal cross-party alliances will be more important than the strictures of the whips.</p> <h2><strong>Does the ruling mean an early election?</strong></h2> <p>It makes it more likely because the ruling has undermined the government (it lost in the courts) and highlighted May\u2019s lack of a personal mandate and weakness in parliament. Her tiny Commons majority, shrunk further by the resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips, leaves her in a perilous position in any contentious vote.</p> <p>As she has insisted she does not intend to go to the country before 2020, doing so would be seen as a sign of her being buffeted around by events. An election \u2013 while likely to deliver a larger Tory majority \u2013 would be no easy fix, however. It would highlight profound splits in the Conservative party in parliament and between its MPs and supporters in the country.</p> <p>Brexit would be put on hold for three months of national debate and squabbling and the economy could be harmed by more uncertainty. Labour would have to back an early election which most of its MPs would dread. It would be an election that nobody wanted. Rather than healing the divide over Brexit it could well deepen it.</p> <h2><strong>Could the row do lasting constitutional damage and further erode faith in the institutions that run the country?</strong></h2> <p> The irony behind the arguments over the judges\u2019 ruling is that Leave campaigners insist that \u2013 above all else \u2013 they want to \u201ctake back control\u201d from European institutions and vest it again in British ones. But now that the UK\u2019s own courts have made a ruling that complicates the passage towards a hard Brexit and argues for the very thing that Leave campaigners wanted most (parliament to be given back control) they complain that the judges\u2019 assessment is a betrayal of the people. The danger now is that it will not just be faith in politicians that is harmed, but faith in the UK legal system as well.</p> <p>The country\u2019s unwritten constitution operates a delicate set of checks and balances, determined through precedent, involving the Crown, parliament, the executive and the judiciary. The call by the Bar Council for justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn attacks on the judges was the opening salvo in what could become a toxic and hugely destabilising inter-institutional war between key components of the system. The Brexit debate has asked fundamental questions about where power lies in the UK. It was simpler when parliamentary democracy operated on well trodden paths. But on 23 June the people spoke and the system is uncertain as to how to deliver their will.</p> <p>Sensing that it could stir the Brexit-backing part of the population into a mass revolt against the judges, the <em>Daily Mail</em> labelled them \u201cenemies of the people\u201d on Friday and pointed out that one, Sir Terence Etherton, was \u201copenly gay\u201d.</p> <p>What began as a question about the EU\u2019s power has become a potentially very dangerous one about the power of the people and how far it can trump that of parliament and the courts.</p>",
  "<p>Melania Trump appears to have spent the entire US election as a sort of anti-Michelle Obama \u2013 whatever she does, however hard she tries. Not that she\u2019s been that visible \u2013 her husband has mainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/ivanka-trump-speech-republican-convention-women-gender-pay-mothers\" title=\"\">put his daughter, Ivanka,</a> in the first lady spot on his campaigning chain-gang. When Melania has been thrust into the spotlight, it\u2019s been to do a manifestly sub-par nerve-racked turn, before scurrying back into the shadows, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\" title=\"\">accusations (at the mildest) of speech-plagiarism.</a></p> <p>Now Melania has made another so-so speech (keeping to the relatively safe topic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/melania-trump-cyberbullying-campaign-speech\" title=\"\">childhood bullying</a>). There have also been further allegations about Melania <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/melania-trump-was-paid-modeling-before-work-visa-records-show#img-1\" title=\"\">working as a model</a> before officially obtaining her US work visa. Does it matter? Of course it does (it makes a mockery of her husband\u2019s relentless anti-immigrant rhetoric). Another question could be: does Melania matter? After all this time, does she even exist as a legitimate separate entity outside of her husband\u2019s swirling toxic orbit?</p> <p>Throughout the Trump campaign, Melania has been simultaneously defined and eclipsed by her husband, which, considering his well-documented views on women, probably suits him just fine. With a man like Trump (an ego driven by a sonic blast of narcissistic personality disorder), it makes a weird kind of sense that his daughter (his issue, his blood) is given pole female position, validating his genetic grandiloquence (subtext: everything that is of Trump is magnificent!), while his third wife (with her \u201cchequered\u201d past) is given tasks and duties almost as an afterthought.</p> <p>Melania has been bounced down the Republican campaigning ranks from player to mere decorative human accessory, given as much significance and influence as Trump\u2019s choice of tie at a rally. At the same time, in every negative, dehumanising way possible, Melania has been completely defined by her husband. Of course, something similar also happened to Hillary Clinton \u2013 an actual candidate \u2013 who\u2019s spent her entire campaign being pelted by rocks for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\" title=\"\">\u201csins of Bill\u201d.</a></p> <p>The difference is that Hillary has at least (small mercies) also been attacked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton-why-hate-unlikeable-us-election\" title=\"\">who she is</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\" title=\"\">what she\u2019s done.</a> Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/29/michelle-obama-we-need-an-adult-in-the-white-house-video\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama,</a> whose charisma seems at once amplified by her husband, while also robustly being independent of him. By contrast, from start to finish, the pressure has been on Melania to atone publicly for all her husband is and everything he represents, her every word and deed viewed and judged entirely via the omnipresent prism of the Donald.</p> <p>So what? you might ask. As the saying goes, if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. But although associations are important, ultimately, only Donald Trump should be attacked for being Donald Trump.</p> <p>Certainly, it seems too easy and dangerous to assess women solely via the medium of their men. You can already see it happening with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/02/when-harry-met-meghan-markle-and-dragged-the-royals-into-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Prince Harry and his new partner, Meghan Markel</a>, a successful, attractive biracial actress being systematically reduced to how she, her heritage and achievements fit in with The Almighty Him. As a feminist, it makes me feel uneasy watching Markel being defined via her \u201csuitability\u201d for Harry, as if this were her only pertinent characteristic, all other nuance and agency of a living, breathing, thirtysomething individual cheapened or obliterated.</p> <p>If this makes a soul uneasy, then perhaps the same courtesy should be extended to Melania Trump. Melania probably wouldn\u2019t make a great first lady. (Not so much the anti-Michelle, as simply inadequate). However, the fact remains that during a wild, dirty election, Hillary Clinton emerged hurt by Bill, but not felled by him, Michelle gloriously stepped out of Barack\u2019s shadow and even Ivanka is relatively unscathed. Only Melania wafts around like an election phantom whose only function is to be viewed and judged entirely via the medium of her husband. While it\u2019s not surprising that this happened, it\u2019s telling that nobody seems to mind a bit.</p> <h2>Salute Sting for relaunching the Bataclan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c/0_134_4770_2862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatan Syuflana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sting will be the first musician to perform at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan theatre</a> in Paris since the terrorist attacks last November that killed 130 people, 89 of them at the venue.</p> <p>A separate event has been planned, according to ed reports, to mark the anniversary of the attacks, attended by survivors and the band that performed on the night of the attack, the American group Eagles of Death Metal, whose roadie Nick Alexander died.

  "<p>Donald Trump is coming to the end of one of the most dramatic and unpredictable US presidential campaigns in living memory, scouring swing states for the undecided voters who might make a difference and who might be persuaded by his inflammatory message and swingeing assaults on his Democratic rival.</p> <p>But as he campaigned in Ohio, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on Friday, a new side of the Republican candidate emerged. He was doing something no-one expected: he was being predictable.</p> <p>As Tuesday\u2019s vote nears, Trump\u2019s rallies are still raucous and he still fills them with wild accusations against Hillary Clinton. A recent favourite is that \u201cif she ever gets into the Oval Office, Hillary and her corrupt friends would rob this country blind\u201d. But his words have become more scripted and controlled, resembling less a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo, full of improvisation, more a jazz musician riffing off a standard tune from the songbook.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of Trump\u2019s crowds has not diminished \u2013 thousands swarm at every stop. On Friday they came to Atkinson, New Hampshire, Wilmington, Ohio, and Hershey, the home of the chocolate giant, in Pennsylvania. When the candidate asked \u201cwho is going to pay for the wall\u201d, they shouted \u201cMexico\u201d deliriously. Dressed in Trump merchandise, they were ready at the slightest provocation to chant \u201cLock her up\u201d or \u201cCNN sucks\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\" data-alt=\"pennsylvania\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\">pennsylvania</a> </figure>  <p>But Trump seemed to sense something had changed. When trotting out his newest line, \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d, both a jibe at what he describes as a corrupt establishment in Washington and a description of his willingness to clean it up, the candidate seemed almost unenthusiastic. He has taken to apologising when the line comes up in speeches.</p> <p>\u201cI hated the expression,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s so hokey.\u201d</p> <p>Trump often notes how Frank Sinatra hated singing My Way, before he realised how much his audience loved it. For Trump the \u201cswamp\u201d slogan, which could come from almost any insurgent political campaign, mounted by either party, is the same thing. If his crowds chant it, he will go along.</p> <p>Yet he is by no means hostage to his crowds. On Friday he guided them along, ensuring they booed the correct villain at the right time, be it Clinton, the media or nondescript globalists intent on taking away US jobs and prosperity.</p> <p>Members of the press corps have become his unwitting accessories. They are penned in, surrounded, while Trump falsely insists that TV cameras are not showing the size of his rallies. That claim goads the crowd into booing the press, who he insists are \u201cthe most dishonest people\u201d. At times, he will even call out reporters by name.</p> <p>This has not provoked any incidents of physical violence \u2013 yet. The sensation is more like that of being an animal on display at the zoo. Trump supporters stand on the other side of the fence, gaping, making faces and occasionally shouting abuse.</p> <p>Things tend to intensify as the hour gets later and Trump, who has rarely been punctual in recent months, falls further behind schedule. By then the crowds, subjected to a loop of the same five songs for several hours, are ready to let loose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=OH\" data-alt=\"ohio\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=OH\">ohio</a> </figure>  <p>But for all the passion and rage that Trump stokes, there is a lack of the bizarre creativity that defined his early campaigning. The candidate who compared the acclaimed neurosurgeon Ben Carson to a child molester and falsely said Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-denies-ted-cruz-father-assassination-jfk\">was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy</a> has been left claiming, wrongly, that Clinton is the subject of multiple criminal investigations. While he has made \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d a Homeric epithet to rival his labelling of former Florida governor Jeb Bush as \u201cLow Energy\u201d or his nicknaming Florida senator Marco Rubio \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and Cruz \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d, it has not had the same effect.</p> <p>The issue is perhaps the lack of any new villains to accompany Clinton, one of the most famous women in the world. Veering away from President Obama, Trump rails against nameless \u201cglobal special interests\u201d who he says ship jobs overseas and leave US borders open. But these attacks are not delivered with the gusto he uses for individuals. He is far more animated when calling for Clinton to fire her campaign chairman, John Podesta, because Podesta described his candidate as having \u201cbad instincts\u201d in a hacked email, than he is when reading a scripted attack on globalists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\" data-alt=\"new hampshire\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\">new hampshire</a> </figure>  <p>The overall effect is of an ageing rock star, living off the glory of past hits. Trump still takes time to recall 16 June 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">when he came down \u201cthat famous escalator\u201d</a> at Trump Tower in New York City to announce his campaign. He will often relive moments of glory in his bid for the Republican nomination. Ardent fans show up and buy the merchandise and the star is able to put on a show. But it is an increasingly mechanical exercise.</p> <p>Trump has always been an awkward fit, somewhere between entertainer and politician. After all, the best shows and the most applause-worthy lines don\u2019t always poll the best. At least for the next few days, though, he is willing to repeat his intent to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d, in order to maintain his shot at winning the White House.</p>",
  "<h2>Latin America<br></h2> <p>Governments have often preferred Republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade, but this time, politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about Donald Trump, who has alarmed many with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">dismissive comments about Latinos</a>, plans to build a wall on the Mexican border, and his unpredictable behaviour.</p> <p>Dem\u00e9trio Magnoli, a sociologist and prominent voice of Brazil\u2019s \u201cnew right\u201d, said a Trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake. \u201cTrump is the closest the US has gotten to fascism. You would have an American president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations, and a wall being built, which is likely since he will most likely not deport 11 million people.\u201d</p> <p>He predicted this would force Mexico to turn more towards Latin America and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced. We have no idea what he will do, but he seems authoritarian, sexist and contemptuous about Latinos,\u201d said Violeta Granera, of the opposition alliance in Nicaragua.</p> <p>By comparison, Hillary Clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the Obama administration.</p> <p>Carlos Lins da Silva, a senior consultant for the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation, said US regional policies were unlikely to see a major change, but added: \u201cThe election of Trump would \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 cause dramatic impacts on the international system \u2026 if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating. Brazil won\u2019t come away unscathed. For example, if he makes the entrance of Muslim people more difficult, builds a wall between Mexico and the US, has Nato members pay for US defence, encourages Japan to have a nuclear bomb, gets tougher on Nafta and other free trade deals. All of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries.</p> <p>Diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in Washington\u2019s Latin American policy regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton knows Brazil better than Trump, as she has been here before and knows people here, but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with South America are a low priority for the US,\u201d said Rubens Barbosa, former Brazilian ambassador to Washington.</p> <p>The country with most at stake may be Cuba, which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the US under Barack Obama. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro weighed in with an article last month in the <em>Granma</em> newspaper in which he awarded Trump \u201cthe medal of mud\u201d, but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the Democrats.</p> <h2>Middle East<br></h2> <p>Trump outraged the Arab world with his comments on Muslim immigration \u2013 and regional public opinion certainly reflects this. A survey of 3,017 people in the Middle East and North Africa found that \u2013 if they had a vote \u2013 half would snub both Trump and Clinton.</p> <p>On the fight against Islamic State, Clinton has pledged to never send troops back to Iraq, and ruled out boots on the ground in Syria. Trump has been less specific about his plan to fight Isis, but said in March that the US has \u201cno choice\u201d but to send 20,000 to 30,000 combat troops to the region.</p> <p>In the survey, from the Jeddah-based daily <em>Arab News</em> and pollsters YouGov, 46% said the US should send troops to fight Isis and collaborate closely with Russia on Syria. The rest did not want a US presence on the ground but did feel that Washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for Syrian refugees, arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on Isis. Clinton was most popular, with 78% saying she would be the best for the Arab world.</p> <p>On the candidates\u2019 policies, Arab opinion is much more balanced. Clinton\u2019s stance on climate change and US Israel policy found strong support in the poll. But Arabs overwhelmingly back Trump\u2019s stance on abortion and, ironically perhaps, border controls.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain\">was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election,</a> and whatever the result, it will please the Kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief. How much of this was down to direct Kremlin meddling, we will perhaps never know, although the state media\u2019s bias towards Trump has been fairly clear.</p> <p>Most Russian analysts believe the US is systemically set up to oppose Russia, and while there is an understanding that Trump is an unusual candidate, many believe a Trump presidency would not change things much. Other more sober heads are well aware that for all Trump\u2019s friendly rhetoric, as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than Clinton, the devil they know.</p> <p>To go on the public rhetoric alone, the casual observer would think the Russian establishment is banking on Trump. Russian television has been giving airtime to many of Trump\u2019s claims that the election could be rigged, but this is as much to help discredit the US system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for Trump. He has been backed not because of his politics, but because he is the chaos candidate; in the same way Russia was also keen on Brexit. Even if Clinton wins, Russia knows that after this divisive campaign, US democracy is in for a period of soul-searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats.</p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>If Africa has barely featured in the campaign, then the continent has, in part, returned the compliment. But though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in US policies in Africa, there is still widespread anxiety and Trump has already alienated many, particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cFew Africans are putting any store on Trump if he wins the election, that is if he remembers we exist once he\u2019s done with Mexicans and illegal immigrants,\u201d wrote Gitau Warigi, in Kenya\u2019s <em>Daily Nation</em>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US received widespread coverage and provoked outrage. The Somalia-based Islamic militant group, al-Shabaab, included a clip of Trump proposing the temporary ban in one of its recruiting videos.</p> <p>The tycoon does have supporters. <a href=\"http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/WINGIA_Global_Poll_on_US_Election_-_FINALIZED_Revised_Global_Press_Release.pdf\">Although a poll </a>in Nigeria found that 77% would vote Clinton and only 19% Trump, while in South Africa the proportion was 59% to 15%, some African commentators see Trump as an anti-establishment candidate of a sort they would welcome: one who could disrupt an unjust status quo.</p> <p>\u201cThe world and nations don\u2019t reform when they are comfortable. They only do so when they are afraid or have been severely injured \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.africareview.com/opinion/Bring-on-Donald-Trump-he-will-change-our-rotten-ways-/979188-3184656-rs3h5n/index.html\">bring on Trump</a>,\u201d wrote Charles Onyango-Obbo, a Kenyan publisher and columnist.</p> <p>However, neither candidate has given any real clues to their attitude on Africa. On trade, there is speculation that Trump\u2019s support for greater protection of US industries could mean higher tariffs that would <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Africa-unsure-how-a-post-Obama-regime-will-treat-Agoa/1068-3434786-x65cxy/index.html\">damage some African economies</a>, local analysts say. Nearly 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa can export goods to the US duty-free under legislation from 2000. In some, the regime has served as a catalyst for industrial production.</p> <p>On aid, there are fears for the funding of projects to prevent and treat HIV and Aids which have helped millions. Clinton is seen as backing continued, or enhanced, public health assistance.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s allegations of vote rigging in the US have prompted strong reactions in a continent where manipulation of electoral process is widespread.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere,\u201d Zimbabwean opposition leader Tendai Biti told Reuters news agency last week. However, it is a fake quote which has caused the biggest stir. Trump has been widely reported to have pledged to \u201clock up\u201d both Robert Mugabe, the veteran president of Zimbabwe, and Museveni. The false comment was not questioned and prompted anger, hope, ridicule, excitement and hilarity \u2013 as well as a small demonstration of support in Uganda where five protesters waved placards outside the US embassy.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>A new video by German comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann was released last week, entitled Grab US by the Pussy. It waxes lyrical about the foreign policy that Washington might pursue if Trump were in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe like the new spirit of your nation / Let\u2019s walk hand in hand into isolation\u201d goes one of the lines.</p> <p>In reality, the majority of Germans view the prospect of a Republican victory on Tuesday with fear. Some 65% of respondents in a YouGov survey released last week said that they were afraid of such an outcome. If Germans could vote, a poll by the magazine <em>Stern</em> found that only 5% would cast their vote for Trump.</p> <p>In political circles, Germany\u2019s biggest concerns relate to how much damage a Trump presidency would do to the transatlantic alliance. The US is the key contributor to the UN budget and has the highest military budget within Nato, yet during his campaign Trump has described Nato as \u201cobsolete\u201d and indicated that he would, at the very least, seek to renegotiate its framework.</p> <p>If the Republican wins and lives up to his own words, Germany and France would, after Brexit, be the two countries expected to try to fill the geopolitical vacuum in Europe. Hope remains that Trump\u2019s rhetoric would prove more dramatic than his actions.</p> <p>\u201cIn Berlin government circles,\u201d <em>Der Spiegel</em> recently wrote, \u201cofficials are more concerned about Trump\u2019s character than the radical political about-face he might introduce.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A lot has happened since Nicholas Stern, then a permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">landmark review</a> of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming.</p> <p>Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\" title=\"\">such as south Florida </a>and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet\u2019s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world\u2019s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\">Stern report: the key points</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been too slow in acting on climate change,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIn particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming \u2013 like ice sheet and glacier melting \u2013 are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. \u201cWith hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\">Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\" title=\"\">Paris climate talks</a> last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: \u201cIt has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol</a>, into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved \u2013 in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example \u2013 would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review.</p> <p>Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. \u201cApart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThe consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day.</p> <p>\u201cWe are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.\u201d</p> <p>As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogot\u00e1 have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. \u201cWe have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,\u201d says Stern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51/81_0_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets, says Stern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure \u2013 roads, buildings, ports and airports \u2013 that will more than double what already exists.</p> <p>The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. \u201cIf it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/indigenous-rights-forests-climate-change-study\" title=\"\">talks in Marrakech</a>. India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives \u2013 but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created \u201cby and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive\u201d and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern\u2019s response is diplomatic: \u201cIt would make things very much more difficult,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771/0_241_3404_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plane takes off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK could still cut its carbon emissions from aircraft by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 \u2013 despite the \u201cpolicy wobbles\u201d of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-deal\" title=\"\">Green Deal</a> to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. \u201cTo behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThat is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government\u2019s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/heathrow-third-runway-davies-commission\" title=\"\">proposed new runway for Heathrow</a> is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. \u201cHowever, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK\u2019s targets are altered \u2013 as I believe they should be \u2013 to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,\u201d adds Stern.</p> <p>The Paris agreement remains central to Stern\u2019s sense of cautious optimism. \u201cIt was the honesty of the delegates\u2019 awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement\u2019s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the markets tremble, the polls tighten, the bookies scramble to adjust the odds, and the US presidential race enters its final, frantic days, the rhetoric \u2013 from the president down \u2013 grows more hysterical by the hour.

It too was held on 8 November.</p> <p>Trump may have plumbed the depths of vulgarity, sleaze and pig-ignorance, but he is anticipated by the politics of the 1850s, in the decade before Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency. Not many now remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\" title=\"\">Millard Fillmore</a> or his supporters, the self-styled \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d, but these wild patriots, the forefathers of the angry white males who chant \u201clock her up\u201d, prefigure many aspects of the Trump campaign, promising to \u201cpurify\u201d American politics.</p> <p>The Know Nothings exploited popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by immigrants, who were seen as enemies of the republic and, more sinister still, controlled by the pope. The party was most active from 1854 to 1856 and had a champion in Fillmore (one of the worst US presidents). <a href=\"http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm\" title=\"\">Lincoln himself wrote</a> to a friend, \u201cI am not a Know Nothing. How could I be? \u2026 Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.

At least he did not, as Aaron Burr did in 1804, actually fight a duel with one of his political adversaries. Burr, who was Thomas Jefferson\u2019s vice-president at the time, mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton, and charged with murder had to flee to safety in the south.</p> <p>Rhetorically, the mudslinging inspired by Jefferson\u2019s two successful campaigns for the presidency was often as ugly as anything heard on the stump with Trump and \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d. In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson fought John Adams, whose supporters charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French. This election was said to have been \u201cone of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\u201d.</p> <p>More than 200 years later, many commentators believe that the US system is broken. But it has seemed broken before and somehow staggers on. From some points of view, the ferocity of Trump v Clinton is evidence of vigour not breakdown.

It wilfully misunderstands the relationship between parliament, government and the judiciary. Partisanship is understandable, but this level of stupidity is unforgivable. It misleads and distorts \u2013 either deliberately or out of ignorance. As Hilary Benn pointed out yesterday, the high court judgment has nothing to do with defying the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. As he explained, \u201cthe judgment is not to do with the fact that we will be leaving the European Union. It was a ruling on who starts the process, who fires the starting gun and in upholding the principle of parliamentary sovereignty\u2026 the judges said that since it was legislation that took us in, it should be parliament that takes the decision to start that process and not the government.\u201d</p> <p>Or here is Conservative MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve speaking on <em>Newsnight </em>on Friday: \u201cI was horrified at the newspaper coverage, which reminded me of Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe. The judges did exactly what was asked of them \u2013 they highlighted that our constitution does not allow you to overturn statute law by decree.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The judiciary are at the heart of our commitment to the rule of law and those who question their legitimacy (because they disagree with their view) threaten to undermine a critical institution vital to our democracy. Yesterday, the Bar Council took the extraordinary step of asking the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to condemn the \u201cserious and unjustified\u201d attacks on senior judges over the Brexit court ruling. Senior judges having to appeal to the lord chancellor to defend them from unjustified attacks, in Britain, in 2016?</p> <p>Since 23 June, the country has loosed itself from tolerant, civil discourse - on both sides. The world has often looked to Britain as an example of a pluralist, inclusive democracy and a cultured, ordered and civil society. But that is changing. As the world looked at the response of politicians and the popular press to last week\u2019s court judgment, many will have concluded that it had more in common with Sisi\u2019s Egypt or Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey than the Britain they thought they knew. A&#xa0;country that hounds, demonises and implicitly threatens its independent judiciary is one that toys menacingly with the very tenets of democracy.</p> <p>We noted in these columns some weeks ago that Theresa May, who coined the phrase the \u201cnasty party\u201d to describe the Conservatives some years ago, was threatening to turn Britain into the nasty country. That is increasingly the message being sent across the world. It is also the message being sent to foreigners living here, including long-resident EU nationals now afraid to speak openly for fear of rebuke or worse.</p> <p>Many more reasonable Brexit supporters have rightly distanced themselves from campaign to demonise the judges responsible for last week\u2019s ruling. But the government\u2019s ill-advised decision to appeal to the supreme court means judges sitting on England\u2019s highest bench, who will consider the matter next month, may now also be subject to overt political pressure and similarly contemptuous, intimidatory invective. In Turkey or Burundi, such tactics by the state and its surrogates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">might not be considered surprising</a>. But here?</p> <p>What sort of country is Britain becoming that this sort of menacing behaviour is not only tolerated but implicitly encouraged by senior government ministers who fear, correctly, they are losing the argument? As has been repeated ad nauseam, the issue is not about reversing or somehow sabotaging the referendum result. It is about ensuring proper democratic scrutiny of the government\u2019s negotiating positions, about ascertaining whether its approach advances the national interest rather than sectional, business and City interests. It is about getting the best deal for Britain.</p> <p>The concerted assault on the judiciary comes in the context of wider institutional vandalism indulged by the hard Tory Brexiters and their international sympathisers and emulators. They would recklessly tear up nearly 45 years of carefully navigated British relationships with our European neighbours. The resulting damage to the economy and living standards is mounting fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59/0_0_4919_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much worse is to come. In America, Donald Trump runs a presidential campaign based on fear, prejudice, ignorance and xenophobia, which he claims represents change, not abject regression, and threatens to reject the election outcome if it goes against him. The dire cost of Trumpism to America\u2019s national unity and cohesion is already plain.</p> <p>Across Europe, iconoclastic extremist and nationalist parties compete to demonstrate who is most intolerant, most hateful and best at scaring people. In France, their vile message may be working as presidential elections approach and the Front National gains ground. But hard Tory Brexiters do not see the link, deny any crossover, cannot understand how their institutional dumpster fire stokes nihilism and chauvinism. They dwell in their Little England bubble, detached from the real world or, as the high court said of their article 50 arguments, \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. Anybody who disturbs their narrative, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">Stephen Phillips, who resigned as a Conservative MP on Friday</a>, is shunned as a blood foe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/legally-protected-uk-food-products-brexit-threat-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a>, for daring to add his voice to the democratic debate over Brexit, is ridiculed. Will these people who hound reasonable public figures ever understand what a mature democracy involves? Formidable, robust, intelligent and reasoned debate.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/theresa-may-told-to-act-to-calm-brexit-mob-anger\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve</a> said: \u201cDebate helps outcomes, suppressing it destroys it.\u201d Would they rather our public discourse \u2013 and hence, public life \u2013 be characterised by childish slurs, homophobia, distortions and vicious rhetoric? That is where Britain is being driven by a new hard Brexit elite.</p> <p>It behoves any sensible, reasonable public figure to recognise that a 52-48 referendum result is one where national cohesiveness matters. And while it delivered a mandate to exit the European Union, it did not give sweeping powers to brush aside challenges on the nature, timing and texture of that exit. There is a lack of reason on both sides of this debate and there is a danger that the public fissures that have opened up since June 23rd become wider still. We all have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen. As Iain Martin says elsewhere on these pages, \u201cNeither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483/0_93_2944_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister, Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister, Theresa May: \u2018She has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an unerring instinct for the bad call.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, hard Tory Brexiters are fearful of losing the argument. The truth is there is little confidence that May can keep her head and rein in the irresponsible fantasies of her more wild-eyed colleagues. The truth is, May has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an instinct for the bad call, as seen with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, child obesity and Nissan subsidies. She appears unable to grasp the EU\u2019s blunt insistence that access to the single market cannot be divorced from freedom of movement.</p> <p>The disdain, scepticism and bewilderment of Britain\u2019s EU partners is wounding. At last month\u2019s Brussels summit, her first, May was kept waiting until the early morning before being allowed to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\" title=\"\">short statement on Brexit</a>. She was listened to in silence. Nobody deigned to respond. On Friday, her calls to Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and the commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, when she tried to persuade them, implausibly, that her March deadline for article 50 still stood, were embarrassingly brief. Few in Europe now believe Britain\u2019s government has a roadmap.</p> <p>In such circumstances, it is imperative that parliament, now given its chance \u2013 and reminded of its duty \u2013 to shape Britain\u2019s future course by the high court, steps up to the mark. For too long, too many MPs who support continued EU membership (a majority overall) have been cowering in silence, fearful that any expression of unease over the Brexit process will be misrepresented as a bid to overturn the referendum result. No one disputes the result of the referendum, or the social, cultural and political tensions that delivered it, but it is right that the manner of our exit are properly scrutinised. That has yet to be decided. And parliament, rightly, has a role to play.</p> <p>To be worthy of its sovereign status, both Houses of Parliament should now inject themselves into the Brexit process. This means cross-examining ministers and demanding a green paper on the government\u2019s plans. It means proposing alternative strategies. It means amending and, if need be, discarding wrong-headed approaches. And it means the holding of binding votes not only on when article 50 should be triggered but also on the final terms of any eventual exit agreement.</p> <p>In short, parliament must be ready to exercise veto power over any Brexit deal that does not ultimately serve the national interest \u2013 because this government simply cannot be trusted not to deliver serious economic self-harm on the altar of blind ideology. It is a tall order. The growing prospect of an early general election, should May continue to trip, fumble and flop, presents many MPs with an existential dilemma: whether to vote with their conscience and uphold the democratic rights of parliament and their constituents or be pushed and pulled along by a populist tide, propelled by lies. Most Labour MPs, for example, represent constituencies where a majority voted Leave. It is still likely that last week\u2019s ruling proves a pyrrhic victory, by provoking an early election that, with the current dire state of the Labour party, will give May an enhanced majority. Thus, we will have a parliament with fewer teeth and providing less scrutiny or push-back than is required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/nicola-sturgeon-scotland-mps-joining-article-50-legal-battle-brexit-high-court\">Nicola Sturgeon deciding whether to join article 50 legal battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps prodded by the shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could be stirred from his lethargic ambivalence over Europe.
