  "<p>Hurricane Matthew, weakened but still a formidable storm, continued to pound the northern Florida coastline on Friday afternoon, renewing fears of life-threatening flooding in Jacksonville and other low-lying, heavily populated cities further north, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.<br></p> <p>After the category 3 storm\u2019s punishing slow crawl up Florida\u2019s eastern coast earlier in the day, which left more than a million residents without power, focus turned away from the strength of its wide wind field and towards the threat posed by the substantial storm surge.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center downgraded Matthew to a category 2 storm in its 5pm advisory but said that the surge, forecast to reach up to nine feet in vulnerable areas such as the St John\u2019s river that runs through central Jacksonville, could lead to \u201clife-threatening inundation\u201d during the next 36 hours as far as Cape Fear, North Carolina.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/06/hurricane-tracker-frontend/v1/?name=Hurricane%20Matthew&amp;id=matthew&amp;type=at4&amp;zoom=4&amp;lat=32&amp;lon=-79&amp;speed=64\" data-alt=\"hurricane matthew's path\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/06/hurricane-tracker-frontend/v1/?name=Hurricane%20Matthew&id=matthew&type=at4&zoom=4&lat=32&lon=-79&speed=64\">hurricane matthew's path</a> </figure>  <p>NHC senior hurricane specialist Lixion Avila said that Matthew, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/it-was-like-a-monster-hurricane-matthew-leaves-haiti-in-crisis\">killed hundreds in Haiti</a> during its earlier march through the Caribbean, still had more misery to spread. \u201cWe have been very fortunate that Matthew\u2019s strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida coast thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/072046.shtml?\">he said in the advisory</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe water hazards remain, even if the core of Matthew remains offshore.\u201d</p> <p>More than 300,000 coastal residents of South Carolina were urged to evacuate ahead of the forecast arrival of the storm early on Saturday, with the state\u2019s governor, Nikki Haley, warning: \u201cThis is going to hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur barrier islands, it\u2019s the biggest concern we have right now, the fact that we need people to move. It will start to be too late for anyone to evacuate so we still encourage all of you to take shelter somewhere above ground.\u201d</p> <p>Her fears were echoed by Barack Obama in a Friday afternoon address. \u201cMany of you will remember <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/24380-hurricane-sandy-status-data.html\">Hurricane Sandy</a>, where initially people thought, \u2018this doesn\u2019t look as bad as we thought,\u2019 and then suddenly you get a massive storm surge and a lot of people were severely affected,\u201d the US president said.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane [and] that the potential for storm surge, flooding, loss of life and severe property damage continues to exist.\u201d</p> <p>Obama also urged Americans to support the efforts of the Red Cross and other aid agencies to provide disaster relief in Haiti, where hundreds of thousands are homeless and in need of immediate assistance, according to the United Nations.</p> <p>\u201cHaiti is one of the poorest countries in the world,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe know that hundreds of people have lost their lives and that there\u2019s been severe property damage and they\u2019re going to need help rebuilding.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8880a60e961850f47e10bb84940a2bee6ca8362\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8880a60e961850f47e10bb84940a2bee6ca8362/0_359_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A damaged sign reads \u2018Get Out Now\u2019 in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A damaged sign reads \u2018Get Out Now\u2019 in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friday afternoon\u2019s further downgrading of Matthew to a category 2 storm, with sustained winds down to 110 miles an hour, continued the trend through the day, which started with the storm as a 165mph monster, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in living memory.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have a long way to go. It could be the worst part of this is still to come,\u201d Florida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, said at a late-morning briefing. \u201cThe eye has not made direct landfall, [but] it still has time to make a direct hit.\u201d</p> <p>Scott said assessments from more southerly parts of Florida, battered overnight by tropical storm-force winds, were just beginning to come in, but earlier fears of potentially catastrophic damage appeared to be unfounded.</p> <p>But authorities reported <a href=\"http://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/st-lucie-county-woman-is-1st-storm-related-death-from-hurricane-matthew\">five storm-related deaths in Florida</a>, four in St Lucie County. A 58-year-woman and an 82-year-old man died in separate incidents when first responders were unable to go out at the height of the storm, and an elderly couple died in hospital after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator they were running in a garage. In Volusia County a woman was reportedly killed after a tree fell on her house.</p> <p>Late on Thursday and through Friday, Matthew lashed Volusia and Brevard counties in Florida, including the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, with torrential rain and sustained winds as the storm\u2019s outer eyewall nudged parallel to the coast. Nasa reported limited roof damage from 107mph gusts, but no effect to its launchpads, which are constructed to withstand 125mph winds.</p> <p>Downed power lines and fallen trees appeared to be the worst of the damage in Martin and St Lucie counties to the south.

It\u2019s a political ploy,\u201d said Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project of Sacramento.</p> <p>Under Backpage\u2019s \u201cadult\u201d section, people can advertise a range of services, including escorts and fetishes. According to sex worker groups, consenting adults use the platform for legal activities such as massages, as well as illegal paid sexual encounters.</p> <p>But California\u2019s attorney general, Kamala Harris, who is running for US Senate, alleged that \u201cmany\u201d ads for prostitution involve sex trafficking victims, including minors. She claimed that Ferrer, along with shareholders Michael Lacey and James Larkin, have profited from these crimes and that Backpage is \u201cessentially operating as an online brothel\u201d. All three men are accused of conspiracy to commit pimping.</p> <p>David Greene, civil liberties director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the law is clear that \u201cthose who provide internet services cannot be considered publishers of content that they didn\u2019t create themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that has had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/airbnb-lawsuit-san-francisco-regulation-internet-porn\">profound impact on the internet</a>, outlines these protections. The act, for example, has established that <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/successes/yelp\">Yelp is not responsible</a> for negative reviews and that <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/cases/gentry-v-ebay-inc\">eBay is not liable</a> when people sell counterfeit items. </p> <p>Airbnb, the home-sharing startup, has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/airbnb-lawsuit-san-francisco-regulation-internet-porn\">argued</a> that the law shields the tech platform when users violate local housing laws.</p> <p>Backpage has repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2016/03/17/big-win-for-free-speech-online-in-backpage-lawsuit/#3be657153a54\">won</a> legal <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/backpagecom-lawsuit-idUSL1N13P2OG20151130\">victories</a> based on free speech <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/07/27/backpagecom-wins-injunction-against-new-washington-law-on-underage-sex-trafficking\">arguments</a>. </p> <p>\u201cYou can think that child trafficking is a horrible thing \u2026 and still think that prosecutors have overreached by going after the CEO of a classified advertising service,\u201d Greene said.</p> <p>DiAngelo argued that targeting a web platform was a \u201cslippery slope\u201d and that prosecutors could go after landlords of buildings where sex work may be occurring or newspapers that print ads for services that turn out to be illegal.</p> <p>Spokespeople for the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, and Harris declined to comment.</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian, Liz McDougall, Backpage\u2019s lawyer, said the arrest \u201cis an election-year stunt, not a good-faith action by law enforcement\u201d and noted that the company has policies against \u201cillegal content\u201d and removes ads when contacted by police.</p> <p>\u201cThe actions of the California and Texas attorneys general are flatly illegal,\u201d she wrote, adding that \u201cBackpage.com will take all steps necessary to end this frivolous prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>Legal arguments aside, activists have argued that targeting Backpage is a misguided approach that conflates trafficking with adult sex work. Critics also say that closing the site won\u2019t eliminate the exploitation, but simply move it further to the margins.</p> <p>Maxine Doogan, president of the Erotic Service Provider Legal, Educational and Research Project, said that Backpage allows sex workers to control their own businesses online without having to rely on pimps or work in the streets. Workers also use the site to warn each other about dangerous or violent clients, she said, noting one woman who was robbed by a man and then posted his name and photo on the site.</p> <p>Often, she said, that can be the only way for workers to protect themselves since reporting to police can get them arrested for prostitution.</p> <p>Doogan, who is based in California, noted that the Backpage criminal charges aren\u2019t even about trafficking and accused Harris of using the case to bolster her campaign. \u201cThe underpinnings of the pimping laws is the criminalization of prostitution.\u201d</p> <p>Kimberlee Cline, a sex worker based in Sacramento, said Backpage allows her to get references from other workers about whether a certain client is safe, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed605932fe242f75241a26b63fd6541ea55be31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed605932fe242f75241a26b63fd6541ea55be31/0_32_801_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"kimberlee cline backpage\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Backpage is \u2018absolutely vital\u2019: Kimberlee Cline, a sex worker based in Sacramento.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bella Elle Boudoir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cline added: \u201cThe saddest part of all of this is the amount of time and energy and resources they are spending that are supposedly intended to protect real victims of sexual exploitation \u2026 These efforts are only about arresting sex workers, not stopping human trafficking.\u201d</p> <p>After authorities <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Shutdown-of-MyRedbook-com-sparks-legal-debate-5588516.php\">shut down</a> a similar adult services site called MyRedbook.com, according to DiAngelo, her organization surveyed 44 workers and found that 18% had transitioned to the street and subsequently experienced rape, arrest or both.</p> <p>\u201cIf they keep marginalizing the people who are in the sex trade \u2026 there\u2019s no way they can stand up and say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this to save you,\u2019\u201d DiAngelo said, noting that the state should instead invest in social services for victims.</p> <p>Some activists have also argued that traffickers can be exposed and arrested through Backpage.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhy would the government want to shut down a resource that they can use to actually go after people who are selling minors?\u201d said Norma Jean Almodovar, a California sex worker activist.</p> <p>Critics said that if California prosecutors were serious about supporting victims, they would have done a much better job handling the recent scandal in which more than a dozen police officers throughout the Bay Area have been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/oakland-police-sex-scandal-charges\">exploiting and paying a teenager</a> for sex.</p> <p>While the state has aggressively targeted the Backpage CEO, many of the officers in the Bay Area case have <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/months-later-still-no-charges-against-oakland-cops-who-sexually-exploited-celeste-guap/Content?oid=4955623\">avoided serious consequences</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got cops that are wildly abusing sex workers and nothing happens to them,\u201d Almodovar said. \u201cThat says you really don\u2019t care about us at all.\u201d </p>",

Rosie and I were keen to continue these negotiations this week and tried to arrange meetings with the leader\u2019s office to come to an agreement as soon as possible.</p> <p>However, it became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was underway, which had not been discussed or mentioned.</p> <p>It now seems to me that the party\u2019s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.</p> <p>Obviously, I deeply regret this turn of events.

He said the meeting had become heated and he had asked Hookem to continue to deal with the matter outside the room which the Ukip MEP read \u201ctotally the wrong way\u201d. He said Hookem then hit him and he bashed himself on the door frame. <br></p> <p>He told the Daily Mail: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mike was obviously very angry and lost his temper. </p> <p>I wasn\u2019t bruising for a scrap. I asked to deal with the matter outside of the room because it was flaring up in the meeting and upsetting everybody, and Mike clearly read that totally the wrong way. It was a completely unexpected incident. </p> <p>Mike came at me and landed a blow. The door frame took the biggest hit after I was shoved into it and I knew I\u2019d taken a whack and was pretty shaken.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022Mike Hookem</strong> reportedly told the Mail that he hadn\u2019t hit Woolfe, and didn\u2019t see him hit is head, while a spokeswoman insisted it had been a \u2018verbal altercation\u2019 and denied that Hookem had punched Woolfe. \u2018Mike did not touch him,\u2019 she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I did not hit Steven and I did not see him hit his head.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022Neil Hamilton</strong>, Ukip\u2019s leader in the Welsh assembly, said he had been told by colleagues in the European parliament that Woolfe had \u201cpicked a fight with one of them and came off worse\u201d.</p> <p>Hamilton told the BBC:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He toppled over and hit his head on a glass window so it must have been quite a wallop</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022A source</strong> close to the party put it this way: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Steven Woolfe has then taken his jacket off, walked over and said: \u2018Right you, outside now\u2019 or words to that effect. </p> <p>They went outside and Steven Woolfe got the brunt of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>So that\u2019s clear then.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has used his post-victory reshuffle to assert his authority by wresting back control of Labour\u2019s national executive committee and ensuring his closest allies retained the most senior shadow cabinet roles.</p> <p>The Labour leader reached out to his deputy, Tom Watson, with whom he has had a tense relationship throughout the summer, appointing him shadow culture, media and sports secretary in addition to his existing position.</p> <p>He also promoted Jonathan Ashworth to the role of shadow health secretary but stripped the MP, who is not seen as an ally, of his role on Labour\u2019s NEC, appointing the supportive Kate Osamor instead.</p> <p>But as the final team was announced, Corbyn \u2013 who began the shake-up by sacking his chief whip, Rosie Winterton, and appointing Nick Brown \u2013 faced an immediate backlash. </p> <p>John Cryer, chair of the parliamentary Labour party, wrote to colleagues to say he and Winterton had entered discussions in good faith about the possibility of MPs electing at least part of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>The proposals were presented as a peace package between Corbyn and MPs after they backed a motion of no confidence in his leadership during the summer.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was under way, which had not been discussed or mentioned,\u201d Cryer wrote in an email.</p> <p>\u201cIt now seems to me that the party\u2019s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.\u201d</p> <p>Responding, a spokesperson for the Labour leader said the talks could continue with Cryer and Brown. \u201cShadow cabinet elections will be considered by Labour\u2019s national executive committee as part of a wider party democratisation at a special meeting next month,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Of the 63 MPs who stepped down as part of a mass resignation in June, only five have returned so far, although Corbyn has dozens more junior frontbench positions to fill.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The shadow cabinet has kept all MPs who served during the acrimonious leadership battle, if they wanted to stay, although there are a handful of more critical voices.</p> <p>The reshuffle saw Diane Abbott become shadow home secretary, while the former director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, became the highest profile new member as shadow Brexit secretary.</p> <p>Clive Lewis told the Guardian that he was disappointed to be moved from the shadow defence brief, given his history serving in the army, but said he was looking forward to taking on the shadow business role. The shift in position came after Lewis told the Labour party conference that he would not seek to change the party\u2019s position in support of the renewal of Trident, despite Corbyn\u2019s opposition to the policy.</p> <p>The MP said he had not \u201csuddenly become an enthusiast for unilateral rearmament\u201d but was simply being realistic given that parliament had already given the green light to the policy.</p> <p>Other names tipped to join up including Dan Jarvis, Lucy Powell and Vernon Coaker were not in the final line-up.</p> <p>Replacing Ashworth with Osamor on Labour\u2019s governing board means Corbyn has stopped the finely balanced NEC from tipping against him.</p> <p>The move could be critical in weeks and months to come. Some speculated that Ashworth was given the choice of a promotion or the NEC position, but sources told the Guardian that his alternative was to be sacked completely.</p> <p>Corbyn said his new team had for the first time \u201ctwo of the three great offices of state shadowed by women\u201d and record numbers of non-white politicians. On Thursday, he appointed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/nick-brown-labour-frontbench-return-chief-whip-rosie-winterton\">Diane Abbott as shadow home secretary</a>, while Emily Thornberry remains as shadow foreign secretary.

  "<p>Donald Trump faces a must-win presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 days left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states.<br></p> <p>With early voting already under way, the Republican candidate <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">has seen his September polling gains wiped out</a> and is fast running out of time to shift momentum back his way in the race for the White House.</p> <p>A live debate always raises the prospect of the ill-disciplined Trump allowing Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could throw his campaign into disarray. The bombastic billionaire stirred fresh controversy on Friday when, in a meeting with a union representing border patrol agents, he floated a new conspiracy theory, saying that immigration officials were trying to expand the pool of American voters.</p> <p>Trump directly challenged the media to report his remarks, which followed comments by union vice-president Art Del Cueto in a meeting in Trump Tower in New York. Del Cueto told the celebrity businessman: \u201cImmigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected ... so they can go ahead and vote before the election.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig statement, fellas,\u201d Trump said, motioning to reporters. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to write it. That\u2019s huge. But they\u2019re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was widely judged the winner of the first debate.

She comes across as cold, but she has more skills than he does.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Real Clear Politics polling average</a>, Clinton is currently 4.5 points ahead of her Republican opponent in a two-way race, a poll position that would <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">translate to</a> at least 237 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs to win firmly in the bag, with 165 for Trump and 136 to play for. </p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope for Trump, however, in polls that show him down but not out in the key swing states that are likely to determine the election outcome, and that suggest his dismal showing in the first debate had only a marginal impact.</p> <p>A survey by Quinnipiac University on 8 September, taking smaller parties into account, gave Clinton a 46-41% lead over Trump in Florida, 46-43% in North Carolina and 45-41% in Pennsylvania. It had Trump up by 47-42% in Ohio.</p> <p>Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, told a conference call on Friday: \u201cDebates are obviously the kind of events that make it possible to have election-changing influence. Right now it\u2019s a pretty fair consensus of our polls and other people\u2019s polls that Secretary Clinton seems to have a small lead, maybe three, four, five points nationally.</p> <p>\u201cIn some of the swing states, there\u2019s some results that are just plain different. So we enter the next debate with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead but not gigantically ahead. The other interesting question is how the debates will affect the presidential race.\u201d</p> <p>The Quinnipiac survey found that likely voters said by margins of more than two-to-one that Clinton won the first debate. Brown added: \u201cThe poll taken right after that debate happened found there had been a relatively small increase in support for Mrs Clinton, not nearly as large as one might expected given the overwhelming consensus that Mrs Clinton won that debate.\u201d</p> <p>Brown noted that a large percentage of the electorate in states such as Florida and Ohio will have voted by election day due to early-voting provisions in those states. This is likely to intensify pressure on Trump to arrest Clinton\u2019s momentum.</p> <p>Ahead of Sunday, Trump has reportedly reviewed video of the first presidential debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not get riled. He limbered up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-the-clear-winner-in-town-hall-debate-featuring-only-himself\">a real town hall on Thursday night in New Hampshire</a> but did not interact directly with the audience, taking questions only from a moderator.</p> <p>Trump told the small crowd: \u201cThis isn\u2019t practice; this has nothing to do with Sunday. This isn\u2019t practice, we just wanted to be here.\u201d<br></p> <p>And he made fun of Clinton for preparing in depth. \u201cI said, \u2018Forget debate prep.\u2019 I mean, give me a break. She\u2019s resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That\u2019s fine. But the narrative is so foolish.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was joined by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who performed well in the town hall format during his failed presidential campaign and is helping the nominee get ready.</p> <p>The Clinton camp has said it expects Trump to have done more homework this time. \u201cBut even if he does show up a little more disciplined than last time, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get a second chance to make a first impression,\u201d Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said.</p>",
  "<p>After his nine-year-old brother was shot dead by a St Louis crack dealer, but before one of his friends was killed in a hail of police gunfire, it occurred to Bruce Franks that he didn\u2019t really cry any more. So he had a teardrop tattooed under each eye to replace his own.<br></p> <p>His facial ink stood out on the streets of Ferguson, where he carried a handwritten sign telling those who would typecast him that he was also a college-educated business owner, a husband and a father. In case they didn\u2019t get the message, next he is taking it to the Missouri legislature. </p> <p>\u201cWe can march all day, but eventually marching is not going to change things,\u201d said Franks, the newly installed Democratic nominee for an ultra-safe seat in the state house of representatives. \u201cWe can protest all day, and protest is much needed. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d<br></p> <p>Franks, 32, is one of a band of young protesters, blooded in Ferguson following the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown two years ago, who have pushed their way into the political system of St Louis, the troubled town\u2019s closest major city, where the second US presidential debate will be held on Sunday evening.<br></p> <p>As they try to reform the criminal justice system from the inside, however, Franks and his fellow protester-politicians are troubled by the prospect of waking up on 9 November to something that they say would jeopardize their plans and like-minded efforts across the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cElecting Donald Trump as president would take this country back to the 1950s,\u201d Franks said of the Republican nominee for the White House. </p> <p>\u201cI \u2026 I can\u2019t even find the words to describe how bad it would be for what we\u2019re trying to achieve,\u201d said Rasheen Aldridge, a 22-year-old Ferguson activist who is running to be a committeeman.</p> <p>Amid a fiery national debate about race, crime and shootings by police, Trump has aggressively styled himself as the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d, pledging to further empower officers, as his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, allies herself with the mothers of black men killed by police and declines to seek the support of the nation\u2019s biggest police union.</p> <p>Trump has said that a recent spike in murders in Chicago could be stopped \u201cin one week\u201d if the city\u2019s police department, which is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/justice-department-investigation-chicago-police\">under investigation by the US justice department</a> over potential racial disparities in its use of force, simply got \u201ctougher\u201d.<br></p> <p>He opposes federal sentencing reforms that have been embraced not only by Clinton but even by some rightwing Republicans who share her desire to reduce the prison population nationally and abandon draconian mandatory punishments for drug offenders.<br></p> <p>He has promised to direct the Pentagon to resume supplying police with the kind of controversial military equipment deployed against protesters in Ferguson.

He was a thug,\u201d said Jason Klobe, 44. </p> <p>Billy Bruns, a 90-year-old veteran of the second world war and a Ferguson resident for more than 50 years, who cast ballots for FDR, Truman and JFK, said: \u201cBrown deserved to be shot by the policeman, who was protecting his own life.\u201d Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown because the 18-year-old turned and charged at him after running away from a physical struggle at Wilson\u2019s patrol vehicle.<br></p> <p>Clinton is in no realistic danger of losing in November to Trump in St Louis County, the million-resident grouping of 90 municipalities including Ferguson.

As a result, we have tax laws that subsidize risk and allow billionaires to amass perverse profits that have helped the top 0.1% of the population <a href=\"http://inequality.org/01-percent/\">accumulate</a> as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Trump may be the most imbecilic person that has ever run for president, but his tax shenanigans are the norm for people in his bracket. Billionaire-investor Warren Buffet flashed a spotlight on this absurdity in 2013 when he <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/\">complained</a> that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary.</p> <p>Meanwhile, working-class people \u2013 people who can\u2019t <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-hillary-clinton-fundraising-20160824-snap-story.html\">afford</a> a $50,000-a-plate dinner with politicians \u2013 are keeping the lights on in Congress with their tax dollars. It\u2019s a system that Republican senator John McCain and former president Jimmy Carter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/03/carter-says-campaign-finance-2010-citizens-united-ruling-legalised-bribery\">refer</a> to as \u201clegalized bribery\u201d.</p> <p>That system works great for people like Trump. According to a study by the Sunlight Foundation, for every dollar <a href=\"https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/11/17/fixed-fortunes-biggest-corporate-political-interests-spend-billions-get-trillions/\">spent</a> to influence politics, for-profit corporations received $760 in benefits from the government. In other words, the system isn\u2019t broken, it\u2019s fixed. </p> <p>The problem is that this type of pay-to-play politics is business as usual \u2013 businesses and wealthy people manipulate laws to benefit themselves every day of the year.</p> <p>There is no free market. The market is \u201cfree\u201d only to those who can afford to rig it in their favor.</p> <p>That\u2019s where the government comes in. We need representatives and policymakers in Washington with backbone who can stand up against corporate greed and malfeasance. We need lawmakers who will ensure that the common good comes first \u2013 that means supporting a $15 minimum wage, stopping bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and supporting a progressive tax rate that ensures everyone pays their fair share, where people who earn the most contribute the most. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s problems go beyond his tax returns. And Lord knows if we let Trump anywhere near the White House it will be a major setback for civilization as we know it. But the problem that has been exposed by the way Trump does his taxes is endemic and encouraged by the laws that our politicians \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 have passed.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough to simply defeat Trump. We need to end a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires and corporations to profit at the expense of everyone else. And that work is bigger than any one election. We cannot depend on a slim majority of supreme court justices to solve the problem that they created in misguided rulings such as Buckley v Valeo and Citizens United v FEC. We need a 28th amendment to constitution that requires all federal elections to be financed exclusively by democracy vouchers \u2013 a $100 tax credit that every citizen of voting age will be able to donate to the politicians of their choice.</p> <p>And in order to win an amendment, we need to demonstrate mass, unstoppable, public demand to <a href=\"http://www.stampstampede.org\">stamp</a> money out of politics.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Matthew lost some of its might early on Friday after a long and punishing overnight crawl up Florida\u2019s eastern coast, but authorities warned the deadly storm was still capable of causing destruction and loss of life as it continued to menace central and northern parts of the state and set its sights on Georgia.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re only halfway through,\u201d the Florida governor, Rick Scott, said at a morning briefing, as Matthew, now a category 3 storm with wind gusts of 150mph, edged closer to Jacksonville.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have a long way to go.

Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT \u2013 or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began.</p> \n   <p>That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a \u201cmarket low\u201d where a \u201cgood amount\u201d \u2013 ie, \u00a35m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window.

They are embarrassed about what\u2019s happening to the party,\u201d Duffy told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. </p> <p>\u201cDo we want a leader who will get himself involved in an altercation, or do we want a leader who is going to be rational and reflect and deal with things in an appropriate manner? Violence or any kind of offering to go outside is not the way to deal with problems.\u201d <br></p> <p>Duffy said she had spoken to Hookem, who denied throwing any punches. He told her the incident was sparked by a row over Woolfe\u2019s admission that he had considered defecting to the Tories. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cSteven then said \u2018let\u2019s take this outside\u2019 and started taking his jacket off.

Church\u2019s portrayal of Jack, a womanizing, washed-up actor who cheats on his fianc\u00e9e while on a road trip with his depressed, wine-obsessed pal, earned him an Oscar nomination. It also raised his profile and brought him new opportunities \u2013 including, he says, his latest project: the <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/divorce\">HBO series Divorce</a>, which premieres this month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/06/divorce-hbo-review-sarah-jessica-parker-comeback\">Divorce review \u2013 Sarah Jessica Parker shines in bleak and bitter HBO comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cTwelve years later, a lot of what comes my way I attribute to [Sideways] kind of kickstarting everything,\u201d Church told me, speaking on the phone from his Texas ranch. Sideways led to a role on the movie Smart People, where he worked alongside Sarah Jessica Parker. When they were promoting the film in 2008, the two \u201cjust really hit it off\u201d, Church said. So much, in fact, that when Parker signed on to do Divorce, her first major return to TV after 12 years, Church was her first choice for \u2018man I\u2019d most like to have an acrimonious on-screen divorce with\u2019, it has been reported.</p> <p>She sent him the script last year and persuaded him to get on board. The two star opposite each other as a suburban couple whose marriage has dramatically broken down. </p> <p>Why did Parker think he might be such a good fit for the role, I ask? \u201cPurely out of working together before and getting along great,\u201d Church says before adding: \u201cAlso, I was age-appropriate.\u201d </p> <p>But was there also something divorce-appropriate about his persona? Church often seems to play the guy who doesn\u2019t really seem to want a happily ever after. In Wings<em>,</em> for example, he played Lowell, a divorced, dim-witted mechanic whose former wife had cheated on him. In Ned and Stacey he\u2019s in a marriage of convenience; Stacey married him for his fancy apartment. In George of the Jungle he plays a rich villain who is duped by his fianc\u00e9e into marrying a gorilla. \u201cIt seems like in most of my movies I play a loner,\u201d Church muses.</p> <p> Church seems to be something of a loner in real life as well \u2013 or, at least, he holds his privacy dear. He likes to stay at home on his ranch and avoids LA and New York as much as he can. He\u2019s also been focusing more on off-camera work such as writing and directing recently. Divorce will mark the first time in 18 years that he has starred in a television series. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed7154956a2ca10d7146cc7d21f94bbb6f74e03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7154956a2ca10d7146cc7d21f94bbb6f74e03c/0_102_4050_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker in Divorce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker in Divorce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, what was it about Divorce that lured him back to the small screen? </p> <p>The \u201csharpness of the script\u201d, for one (the pilot was written by Sharon Horgan, the producer and co-star of Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/20/catastrophe-review-sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-channel-4\">Catastrophe</a>.) The way in which the script examines divorce, he explains, was intriguing, humorous but \u201cit wasn\u2019t going to be a knee-slapping hilarathon. Meaning funny \u2013 not Hillary Clinton.\u201d (There\u2019s no escaping the election these days.)</p> <p> Church also cites the Divorce team\u2019s singular commitment to collaboration as a reason for his enthusiasm. \u201cThey were immediately embracing of my ideas. Not just about Robert, the character, but about how the story was told and my perspective on examining, dramatically and comedically, what those characters were going through.\u201d</p> <p>What perspective on divorce did Church bring, exactly? As he points out, he has never been divorced (or married). \u201cBut I did go through a pretty significant upheaval several years ago. I have an ex with two children. So having gone through something as sort of life-changing as that myself \u2026 \u201d he trails off a bit, sounding uncomfortable, and pivots to something less personal. \u201cAlso, as a middle-aged man, I would say the majority of my close friends have gone through divorce. And business colleagues, and parents at school. My writing partner has been through two divorces. My surroundings are littered with the detritus of divorce.\u201d </p> <p>And Church has channeled this detritus into his art, apparently. Ultimately, he stresses, divorce is more than a legal process, \u201cit\u2019s a family being torn apart at its foundation\u201d.</p> <p>People tend to take sides in divorces; should we expect to be Team Church or Team Parker? Part of the point of Divorce, Church explains, is to show how the breakdown of a marriage is rarely just one person\u2019s fault. \u201cI think initially the audience is like, OK, that\u2019s the bad guy in this marriage,\u201d Church says. \u201cThen I think it\u2019s like, wait, we were wrong about that. It becomes a card game of who did what to whom, the audience starts to keep score of who is ultimately at fault, who gets the blame.\u201d Ultimately, he says, quoting Jim Morrison, \u201cWith any divorce nobody really gets out alive, nobody gets out clean.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps not even the audience will get out clean. What we see on-screen can often influence our real lives. Take Sideways, for example. It didn\u2019t just have an effect on Church\u2019s career; it had a measurable impact on people\u2019s drinking habits. The film caused a <a href=\"http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=features&amp;content=61265\">16% increase in pinot noir wines</a> immediately after its release, its popularity increasing ever since. Merlot, on the other hand, was much maligned in the movie (\u201cIf anyone orders merlot I am leaving. I am not drinking fucking merlot!\u201d), and a decrease in the wine\u2019s popularity has been attributed to the movie.</p> <p>I wonder if Divorce will have any impact on US divorce rates. \u201cOffhand, I would say no,\u201d Church replies. \u201cBut maybe it will cause somebody to pause and reflect and re-examine the state of their marriage or relationship.\u201d </p> <p>You have been cautioned: Divorce might not be the best date night viewing if you\u2019re in a rocky relationship. And whatever you do, don\u2019t watch it with a glass of merlot.</p>",

While Clinton\u2019s campaign acknowledged Democrats were unlikely to overtake their opponents overall in early voting this cycle, they were optimistic about closing the gap.</p> <p>Mook also said the campaign was requesting that officials in Florida extend its Oct. 11 voter registration deadline in light of Hurricane Matthew. The Category 4 deadly storm, which is making its up up the Florida coast, prompted its governor to declare a state of emergency. </p> <p>Mook additionally previewed the next presidential debate, slated for Sunday evening in St. Louis, Missouri. While Clinton was near unanimously regarded as the winner of the first debate, Mook said the campaign did not anticipate Trump to be as undisciplined.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect a more focused, more prepared Trump at this debate,\u201d Mook said.</p> <p>And while Trump has foreshadowed bringing up controversial issues such as Bill Clinton\u2019s previous infidelities, Mook was less convinced. \u201cWe do not expect him to come with the personal and harsh attacks he\u2019s been threatening,\u201d he said.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f6a96be4b0e4aaeaa8cb6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ryan-felton\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T19:44:35.249Z\">8.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bernie Sanders blasted Donald Trump as a billionaire who exemplifies a \u201ccorrupt American political system\u201d in the Vermont senator\u2019s first visit to Michigan on the campaign trail for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> today.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f294ed3ab7a52fc7c5bd05b0db8b73da48afbb44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f294ed3ab7a52fc7c5bd05b0db8b73da48afbb44/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kelsey Kremer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a local United Auto Workers chapter in Dearborn, the first of four campaign stops across the state, Sanders\u2019 appearance on behalf of Clinton came several months after he eked out a shocking victory in Michigan\u2019s primary election.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a> has been in the eye of many storms this year. The state of emergency declared by Governor Pat McCrory ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Matthew this weekend follows similar civil measures in September when the police killing of a black man set off a wave of angry protests on the streets of the state\u2019s largest city, Charlotte.</p> <p>Few of the tempests to sweep by in 2016 have defined the national mood quite as much, though, as the political maelstrom battering this state. A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> <p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/battleground-states-north-carolina-trump-clinton-sharp-divisions\">Battleground states: North Carolina's sharp divides put election on knife-edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South \u2013 race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of America\u2019s major transport and financial hubs.</p> <p>Pride in North Carolina\u2019s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality. Drive into the state from the north, and road signs quickly herald its repeated ability to win Nobel prizes, celebrating last year\u2019s award of the chemistry prize to a Turkish American biochemist, Aziz Sancar, based at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill.

He casts his guests in a burlesque he scripts for them, and cattle-prods them into playing their parts, first fawning over them until they feel like celebrities, then bringing down the hammer of humiliation. He\u2019s a diabolically domineering scene partner. No interviewer has ever been as adroit with treacherous leading questions in the vein of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d Stern, in other words, gets people to publicly embrace their worst selves\u2014and say things they live to regret.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what happened with Trump. Today, as the Republican nominee, he may fashion himself as a boss and a master of the universe. But what comes across in old tapes of the show, resurfaced recently by BuzzFeed and other outlets, is that Trump, like many of Stern\u2019s guests, was often the one being played. By nailing him as a buffoon and then\u2014unkindest cut\u2014forcing him to kiss the Howard Stern ring, Stern and his co-anchor, Robin Quivers, created a series of broadcasts that today showcase not just Trump\u2019s misogyny but his ready submission to sharper minds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/howard-stern-donald-trump-2016-214322#ixzz4MK5DCjOP\">full piece here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f674cae4b03b0685c083de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T16:06:40.025Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul Ryan to campaign with Donald Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for every Republican running away from Trump.

But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html\">full piece here</a>.</p> <p>Update: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/784047532833923072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New: 30 former GOP members of Congress come out against Trump, saying they won&#39;t vote for him. <a href=\"https://t.co/7H3Nyi5pDI\">pic.twitter.com/7H3Nyi5pDI</a></p>&mdash; Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/784047532833923072\">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T15:28:13.302Z\">at 4.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f66355e4b0352b9d54c4de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T14:45:27.987Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s New York Daily News editorial cartoonist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillBramhall\">Bill Bramhall</a> on the veep debate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joshgreenman/status/784029606378672128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillBramhall\">@billbramhall</a> cartoon: <a href=\"https://t.co/6jDB4vdsnd\">https://t.co/6jDB4vdsnd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/x1iVC8aCTJ\">pic.twitter.com/x1iVC8aCTJ</a></p>&mdash; Josh Greenman (@joshgreenman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshgreenman/status/784029606378672128\">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f65f29e4b03b0685c08357\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T14:31:38.824Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We really don\u2019t want to know any more about this apparent meeting between comedienne Rosie O\u2019Donnell and the daughter of a man with whom she is engaged in an ongoing and epic flame war \u2013 \u201corange anus,\u201d she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosie/status/780616540395859968\">called him last month</a> \u2013 except that it happened and they appear to have gotten along just fine. #healing #bless</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/783848742759829510\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump\">@IvankaTrump</a> in a city of 8 million - we meet face 2 face - i thank u 4 listening - mother 2 mother - on this new years week -  my best 2 u</p>&mdash; Rosie (@Rosie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/783848742759829510\">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>(thx <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fahima_haque?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@fahima_haque</a>)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f65a67e4b0bb4a5a8cc95e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T14:25:11.521Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>How charming is this guy?
