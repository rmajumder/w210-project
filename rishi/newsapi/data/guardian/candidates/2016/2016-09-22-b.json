  "<p>Women\u2019s rights campaigners in Jordan believe the country is slowly moving towards more progressive political representation after female MPs won 20 of 130 seats in parliamentary elections on Tuesday, compared with 18 out of 150 in the previous parliament.</p> <p>The growing relevance of women in Jordanian politics, evident in campaign posters clustered at roundabouts and lining roadsides countrywide in the buildup to polling, was reflected in a contest that featured 252 female candidates, the highest number to date.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/10/jordan-first-self-defence-centre-women-fight-for-rights\">Jordan's first self-defence centre for women boosts fight for rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou could feel the change,\u201d said Layla Naffa, director of programmes at the <a href=\"http://english.arabwomenorg.org/\">Arab Women Organisation</a>, an NGO that fought for the introduction of a women\u2019s quota <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/marta-pietrobelli/politics-of-women%E2%80%99s-rights-promotion-in-jordan\">in 2003</a>. Naffa attributed the shift partly to the replacement of the controversial \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d system with proportional representation, as a result of which women have become \u201can asset\u201d, she said. <br></p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://iec.jo/sites/default/files/2ParliamentaryElectionLawMay2016EN.docx%20%281%29_0.pdf\">new electoral law</a>, passed last year, Jordan has been divided into 23 districts. Citizens select from competing lists in their constituency and vote for individual candidates from the same ticket. There is a minimum quota of 15 female members of parliament, at least one from each governorate.<br></p> <p>The changes, designed to strengthen political parties and discourage a tradition of voting based on tribal allegiance rather than policy platforms, benefited female candidates on several levels, said Dr Amer Bani Amer, director of Al-Hayat Center, a civil society group that monitors elections through its <a href=\"http://www.hayatcenter.org/programs/accountability-governance-and-participation-%E2%80%93-rased-the-observer/\">RASED programme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cFor the first time, we had a large number of female candidates, [with] men and women running together in partnership,\u201d said Amer. </p> <p>Women appeared in all but six of the 226 party lists, including those of Islamist groups. The increased number of female candidates was accompanied by a vital shift in the perception of women. In the buildup to the election, coalitions anxious to tap into the female vote scrambled to incorporate a woman on their lists. Several all-male groups, slower to recognise the increased advantage of aligning with women, returned after the first day of registration to add a female face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing acceptance among the public,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.whoisshe-women.jo/expert-profile/asma-khader\">Asma Khader</a>, a former minister in Jordan\u2019s government and chairwoman of the <a href=\"https://sigi.org/\">Sisterhood is Global Institute</a> (Sigi), which monitored the election from a gender perspective. \u201cPeople are now ready to see women\u2019s names and photographs on political campaign posters around the country.\u201d<br></p> <p>There were still six lists on which the image of the female candidate was conspicuously absent \u2013 replaced by a picture of flowers or animals in deference to conservative sensitivities.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere, a more progressive stance was epitomised by two national lists composed solely of women. \u201cI wanted to make the point that women can match men in politics; that we have a vital role to play in determining this country\u2019s future,\u201d said Dr Noor Zaza, who formed a three-woman list in the country\u2019s capital, Amman. </p> <p>The strong performance of high-profile female MPs in the previous parliament has contributed to a belief in \u201cwomen\u2019s ability to do good\u201d and effect change, said Naffa. While some female MPs have simply been \u201cmouthpieces\u201d for the tribes they represent, a few, such as <a href=\"http://www.jordanpolitics.org/en/lower-house-member/146/wafa-saed-bani-mustafa/2\">Wafa Bani Mustafa</a>, have taken up pressing causes, including the campaign to overturn the notorious Article 308 of the Penal Code, which grants rapists clemency if they marry their victims.<br></p> <p>\u201cMen are not going to raise these issues,\u201d added Naffa, who emphasised the need for more women in the political arena to confront the inequalities women face in Jordan\u2019s justice system.<br></p> <p>A campaign to increase the female quota to 23 seats, in line with the re-division of districts under the new law, failed earlier this year. Across Jordan, the <a href=\"http://www.entikhabat.jo/en/content/2016\">allocation</a> for quota seats remains disproportionate, with competition significantly stiffer in certain governorates.</p> <p>In Amman, Rula al-Hroub, a prominent former MP, lost her seat. A strong voice against corruption and widely known as a fearless critic of the government, al-Hroub made three thwarted attempts to form lists before securing running mates just 24 hours before registration closed.</p> <p>\u201cNone of the men wanted to run with me \u2013 they saw me as a threat to their chances of winning the seat,\u201d she said, claiming that strong female candidates are at a disadvantage under the new system.<br></p> <p>While the new law is \u201ca good step\u201d, the system needs \u201cfurther editing\u201d to place women on an equal footing with men, said Dr Amer, citing the <a href=\"http://www.quotaproject.org/country/tunisia\">example of Tunisia</a>, where lists are required to be gender-equal.<br></p> <p>In terms of female representation in parliament, Jordan still lags behind other countries in the region, ranking 13th in the Arab world and 141st globally, according to research conducted by Sigi.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is not something that one election can solve,\u201d said Asma Khader, prescribing a \u201clong process of activism\u201d and greater \u201cinvolvement of women in public and political life.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Disgraced former US congressman Anthony Weiner is being investigated by the New York police department and also reportedly by the federal authorities after <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anthony-weiner-latest-sexting-scandal-probed-nypd-article-1.2802042\">reports</a> emerged that he was allegedly conducting an online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old in another state earlier this year.<br></p> <p>Weiner, whose career previously nosedived after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/anthony-weiner-twitter-pictures-new-york\">caught sending sexually explicit texts and images</a> to women while he was still married, allegedly spent several months this year in highly explicit exchanges with the 15-year-old girl.<br></p> <p>The former politician and failed New York mayoral candidate asked her to undress for him during a video call and engage in rape fantasies among a plethora of explicit exchanges that began in January 2016, the Daily Mail <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html#ixzz4Ku5mkVQq\">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/anthony-weiner-sexually-explicit-messages-teen-daily-mail\">Anthony Weiner sent sexually explicit messages to 15-year-old, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Weiner is still married to Huma Abedin, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s longtime aide and campaign vice-chairman, although the two are now separated.</p> <p>A spokesman for the NYPD confirmed on Thursday afternoon that Weiner, 51, who lives in the city, was under investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware of the allegations against him and we are looking into it,\u201d the spokesman said, without releasing any further details.</p> <p>The girl in question had given a lengthy interview, accompanied by her father, to the Daily Mail and provided pictures and other records of messages she says she exchanged with Weiner.</p> <p>Federal prosecutors at the US attorney\u2019s office in New York declined to comment and an inquiry to the FBI office in New York was not immediately returned, but if the alleged suspect was in one state and the alleged victim was in another, that would trigger the involvement of federal authorities in a criminal investigation.</p> <p>\u201cA situation such as this could involve an array of crimes, depending on what is done and what a minor is asked for,\u201d said John Wilkinson, an attorney adviser and former prosecutor with Aequitas, a consultancy and research organization that advises on prosecuting violence against women.</p> <p>Any investigation into Weiner could involve child sex abuse, child endangerment or child abuse image statutes, depending on the nature and content of the exchanges.</p> <p>There are also relevant federal laws prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children and other statutes involving the transfer of obscene materials to a minor. Wilkinson also explained that even if an adult claims a teenager initiated contact and they did not realize their young age, that is not accepted as a defense in court.</p> <p>Abedin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal\">announced</a> in August that she was separating from her husband after Weiner was <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/\">revealed in another report</a> to have sent another woman a provocative picture of himself in his underwear, with his young son next to him.</p> <p>After the August scandal, Weiner first denied and then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/nyregion/anthony-weiner-confirms-child-welfare-agency-is-\">admitted</a> that he was being investigated by New York\u2019s child services authorities.</p> <p>It was but the most recent in a series of scandals involving Weiner.</p> <p>The couple are apparently still sharing a home in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> and were photographed by the Daily Mail leaving separately on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Weiner allegedly communicated with the girl, who appeared to live in a state other than New York, using Twitter, Skype, Facebook and other digital platforms to exchange videos, texts, photographs and have voice calls.</p> <p>The girl \u2013 who was not named in the report in order to protect her identity as a minor \u2013 reportedly approached the publication and, along with her father, who is also not named, gave detailed interviews and shared messages, images and screen grabs of communications exchanged with Weiner.</p> <p>She said she struck up the initial contact with Weiner but discontinued it after the August revelation of pictures <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/\">in the New York Post</a>, which he is said to have sent to a 40-year-old woman.</p> <p>The law of consent in most states is between 16 and 18, although in many states teens younger than 16 can have consensual sexual contact with each other provided the age gap is not more than four years.</p> <p>By all accounts Weiner and the 15-year-old did not meet or have any physical contact. He allegedly sent her explicitly sexual messages and asked her to undress and masturbate over video chat. When an exchange escalated and he allegedly tried to engage her in talk of a rape fantasy, she objected and he dropped the subject, according to the Daily Mail\u2019s report.</p> <p>Weiner reportedly admitted to the Daily Mail that he had engaged in flirtatious exchanges with the girl but did not comment further on any of the specific allegations. He maintained that some of the details may be a hoax.</p> <p>In some screenshots accompanying the report, Weiner\u2019s picture and name can be seen on screen. In a statement to the Daily Mail, Weiner said, in part: \u201cI have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.\u201d</p> <p>He sent a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/21/new-low-disgraced-dem-anthony-weiner-sorry-after-texts-to-15-year-old-revealed.html\">similar</a> statement to Fox News and also apologized for his behavior, while repeating that he may be the subject of a hoax.</p>",

There is a reason that one of the phrases most often used by the pro-choice community is \u201ctrust women\u201d.</p> <p>When it comes to sexual assault or domestic violence, victims \u2013 the vast majority of whom are women \u2013 are still widely disbelieved. When Amber Heard brought charges against her then-husband Johnny Depp, she was accused of fabricating the allegations to <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/05/29/johnny-depp-amber-heard-inventing-domestic-violence-allegations-win-millions-divorce/\">extort him in their divorce settlement</a>. Only when a video of Depp appearing to behave aggressively was released and Heard donated millions from the settlement to a charity did the scrutiny slow. There are literally dozens of women who have accused Bill Cosby of rape, and still there are people who believe every single one of them is making it up, something I find barely credible. The way that the police doubt sexual assault victims has even been shown to be part of the reason we have such a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/14/why-police-ignored-80000-kits\">backlog of untested rape kits</a>: officers treat women shoddily and they don\u2019t want to come back to pursue charges.</p> <p>When we don\u2019t trust women, when we disbelieve them even in the face of thoroughly convincing evidence, everyone suffers.</p> <p>Clinton has been deemed untrustworthy by the public long before Trump came into the political picture, it\u2019s true. And like most politicians, she\u2019s given the public reasons to question her. But it\u2019s impossible to divorce the way that voters view her from the misogyny she\u2019s faced over decades. She\u2019s considered \u201cguarded\u201d \u2013 but how could she not be after years of sexist smears and slights? Trump, on the other hand, is lauded for \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d even as so much of what he says is shown to be untrue.</p> <p>The act of trusting women shouldn\u2019t be a radical act, and women shouldn\u2019t have to jump through hoops to be considered credible.

A reference to Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state, it was blocked by Democrats.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s reluctance to make public his tax returns has nonetheless drawn scrutiny from both political parties. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Republican leaders in the Senate and the House, have both said Trump should release the returns, pointing to longstanding precedent.</p> <p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/page/tax-returns\">released personal tax returns</a> covering 2007 to 2014; her family\u2019s tax returns from 2000 to 2006 were made public during her 2008 presidential run. She and her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s records <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-releases-eight-years-of-tax-returns-120882\">dating back to 1977</a> are now available to the public. Last month, Clinton disclosed her federal income tax return for 2015. Her running mate, Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton released 10 years of their own returns. <br></p> <p>Trump, whose running mate, Mike Pence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/mike-pence-tax-returns-trump-campaign\">has released 10 years of tax returns</a>, is the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/may/18/chris-wallace/most-gop-nominees-1970s-have-released-their-tax-re/\">first major-party nominee</a> to withhold his tax records since Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency following the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. Ford released a summary of data from eight years of tax returns but never disclosed the full documents. Nixon released his tax returns in 1973 <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/11/pf/taxes/nixon-trump-tax-returns/\">while they were under audit</a>.<br></p> <p>Romney has also called upon Trump to release his returns, calling the failure to do so \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. In 2012, Trump urged Romney to release his tax returns after the former Massachusetts governor was reluctant to do so. Romney eventually put out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/romney-releases-tax-return-summaries\">limited information on his taxes</a> after the Republican convention. </p> <p>In their Thursday press conference, Democrats said Trump was \u201cafraid\u201d of what his returns would reveal about his business practices, charitable giving and ties to foreign governments.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely those tax returns will show major income for Trump and his family from Russia \u2013 from Russian business interests, from Russian oligarchs,\u201d said Chris Murphy, a senator from Connecticut.</p> <p>\u201cIt will show that the decisions he will make on whether to turn on or off sanctions against Russia could have a multimillion-dollar impact on his wealth.

While the extent of Trump\u2019s investments in Russia is not fully known, there is evidence that Trump businesses have received substantial funding from Russian investors.</p> <p>His charitable foundation has also emerged as a point of contention, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?tid=pm_pop_b\">the Washington Post</a> reporting this week that Trump used $250,000 from his family charity to settle legal problems involving his own for-profit businesses.

When Corbyn&#xa0;took over from Ed Miliband in September 2015, his <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/88/Political-Monitor-Satisfaction-Ratings-1997Present.aspx?view=wide\" title=\"\">satisfaction rating</a> among voters in Mori\u2019s poll series was&#xa0;-3. Today it is&#xa0;-31. Among Labour voters a year ago Corbyn was at +31. Today <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/ipsos-mori-political-monitor-september-2016-tables.pdf\" title=\"\">he is at&#xa0;+1</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-second-coming-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/547h2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2741501\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn: the second coming \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e4032de4b052c716b30df8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922LabourLeadershipNEW_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922LabourLeadershipNEW_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922LabourLeadershipNEW.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-second-coming-video\">Jeremy Corbyn: the second coming</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Labour members were asked in&#xa0;late June what the party\u2019s chances of winning the next general election were, the&#xa0;score was \u201clikely\u201d 35% and \u201cunlikely\u201d 57%. This is a place from which it is very hard to return.</p> <p>It is possible of course that all this will change if, as assumed, Corbyn is re-elected Labour leader on Saturday. But&#xa0;it would also be a surprise. One problem is that people have formed their view of Corbyn. They like him or they don\u2019t. John Curtice, a political scientist who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-not-unpopular-but-divisive\" title=\"\">right about most things</a> in these matters, says Corbyn is no longer an unpopular Labour leader but&#xa0;simply a divisive one. Over the weekend we will hear a lot about the section of the public that thinks Corbyn&#xa0;is great. But as Curtice says, that&#xa0;section is simply too small.</p> <p>But Corbyn has two great problems, not just one. He isn\u2019t popular enough, as&#xa0;his challenger Owen Smith kept saying. And, as Smith didn\u2019t say enough, he is wrong about too many things. On&#xa0;Europe, Corbyn is halfhearted. On Syria he can see only western wickedness, not Syrian or Russian. On Nato he is evasive. On Ireland he is naive.</p> <p>On economic policy he simply seems&#xa0;to favour nationalisation, and to&#xa0;think that the money tree will pay for&#xa0;everything. Why is May trusted more&#xa0;than Corbyn on the NHS?&#xa0;Because&#xa0;people don\u2019t believe the&#xa0;money tree is the answer.</p> <p>Assuming that it wants to turn all this&#xa0;around, what can Labour actually do about it? There will be lots of appeals for unity at the party conference over the next few days. They have started already in Corbyn\u2019s interviews. Unity is good. It is better than disunity.</p> <p>But unity has to mean more than simply demanding that those who disagree with Corbyn fall into line and say things they don\u2019t believe and aren\u2019t true. A man with Corbyn\u2019s long years of&#xa0;not falling into line will struggle to make this sound credible.</p> <p>Corbyn could certainly claim himself a bit of moral high ground by saying on Saturday that the venomous verbal and&#xa0;sometimes physical attacks on his critics do not speak for him. He could tell them to stop or face the consequences. He could also give himself some political elbow-room by calling off the dogs on the deselection of&#xa0;MPs. He could welcome a return to MPs electing the shadow cabinet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Few politicians are less curious about the changes that have happened in Britain in his lifetime than Corbyn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Above all, he could invite his party to help him make a priority of finding an answer to the most difficult question facing the centre left in every developed country and certainly in Britain: how can political institutions shape globalisation in ways that ordinary people feel part of and confident&#xa0;about?</p> <p>If he took that kind of open and conciliatory approach, Corbyn would be entitled to ask for something in return from those who oppose him. Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom, as Edmund Burke <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/eburke.html\" title=\"\">once observed</a>. But the question is whether that is what Corbyn wants.</p> <p>Few politicians are less curious about the changes that have happened in Britain in his lifetime than Corbyn. Few seem less ready to compromise. And anyway, so far the strategy has been the opposite \u2013 to intimidate, harass and bully critics out of their posts and even out of the party, not to bind them in. \u201cI have realised in the past year that John McDonnell is the real leader of the Labour party, not Corbyn,\u201d says one former shadow cabinet member. \u201cAnd McDonnell\u2019s strategy is simply to take over the party.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-not-unpopular-but-divisive\">Jeremy Corbyn is not unpopular \u2013 but he is divisive | John Curtice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf there is hope, it lies in the proles,\u201d&#xa0;writes Winston Smith in George&#xa0;Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four.&#xa0;\u201cIf there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85% of the population of Oceania, could&#xa0;the force to destroy the Party ever&#xa0;be generated.

  "<p>While Hillary Clinton has spent weeks huddled with advisers ahead of the first presidential debate, Donald Trump\u2019s preparation has been rather more laissez- faire.<br></p> <p>In August Trump told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate.html\">New York Times</a> that \u201cyou can prep too much for these things\u201d and he has reportedly favored informal conversations over dress rehearsal-style grillings.</p> <p>Instead Trump seems to be relying on his supporters\u2019 input, sending out a \u201cTrump debate preparation survey\u201d this week.</p> <p>The survey, which was emailed to Trump adherents this week and <a href=\"https://action.trump2016.com/debate-prep-survey/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ELC_elections-2016_debate-prep-survey&amp;utm_content=092216-debate-prep-inh-v1-jfc-t-t-hf-e&amp;utm_source=e_t-t\">is available online</a>, asks 30 questions on a range of issues.

  "<p>When Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump square off on television next week it will be the largest audience of their long careers, which both have lived in the glare of limelight. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/296818-trump-clinton-debate-expected-to-shatter-ratings-records\" title=\"\">More than 100 million Americans are expected to tune in</a> on the evening of 26 September \u2013 an astonishing viewership that would rank the event as among one of the most watched television broadcasts in US history. The rest have been Super Bowls. Monday\u2019s debate, 56 years to the day after the first televised duel between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, will almost certainly be a&#xa0;turning point in a turbulent election year in&#xa0;America \u2013 12 months that have thrown into sharp relief the country\u2019s deep polarisation and the breakdown of the Republican party. The course of debates can turn on personal defects, such as <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/sixties/essays/great-debate-kennedy-nixon-and-television-1960-race-for-presidency\" title=\"\">Richard Nixon\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow</a> in 1960. The screen can magnify character flaws and highlight a candidate\u2019s competence. Ronald Reagan\u2019s much-quoted putdown of Jimmy Carter \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_you_go_again\" title=\"\">\u201cthere you go again\u201d</a> \u2013 underlined the fact he was offering not only change, but opened viewers\u2019 eyes to&#xa0;his vision of America. Bill Clinton, then the insurgent outsider, pulled off the same trick in making then president George HW Bush look <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/17/a-damaging-impatience\" title=\"\">out of touch</a> in 1992.</p> <p>In this election the TV debate offers a chance for each candidate a chance to reset the narrative of their campaign. Mr Trump, a businessman-demagogue trading in crude economic populism, has less reason to do so. Last week\u2019s terrorist attacks play into his claims that America is under siege. Democrat Hilary Clinton\u2019s recent bout of pneumonia bolstered his nod-and-wink comments about her failing health. While Mrs Clinton has endured some of the worst weeks of her campaign, her Republican rival has been stealing headlines. <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\" title=\"\">While Mrs Clinton remains ahead in the polls</a>, the momentum is with her rumour-mongering opponent. On paper Mrs Clinton should be able to swat away her opponent. She has the experience, the public policy competence and the chance to make history as the first female commander-in-chief of the most powerful nation on earth. She is also a better debater than retail politician.</p> <p>The trouble with Mrs Clinton is twofold. One is biography. Thanks to being a public figure for decades, her positions today often contradict her publicly stated beliefs. Is she <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/09/21/clinton_campaign_manager_repeatedly_fails_to_answer_questions_about_clintons_syria_policy.html\" title=\"\">for intervention in Syria</a> or not? Is she repudiating <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-bill-clinton-case-for-tpp-1474479987-htmlstory.html\" title=\"\">free trade deals</a> she once championed or not? Does she want more government help in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-health-care-public-option.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">healthcare</a> \u2013 or not? Little wonder, perhaps, that key voter groups such as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/hillary-clinton-millennials-philadelphia/500540/\" title=\"\">millennials fail to warm</a> to Mrs Clinton. The second problem for the former first lady and ex-secretary of state is that she is the continuity candidate in this election. She promises more of the same.</p> <p>Her opponent does not. Mr Trump\u2019s dog-whistle campaign has torn America apart along lines of race, gender and education. This is not just a break with the past, but threatens to splinter the country into warring parts. It would be a mistake to underestimate the real estate magnate. Mr Trump\u2019s skill is his appeal to reptilian instincts. These reflexive inherent tendencies developed in humans to override a brain\u2019s more sophisticated emotional response in times of crisis. This may explain why Mr Trump favours chaos over stability. The billionaire is also an accomplished television performer, bringing out the inner reptile on 14 seasons of his US reality show The Apprentice. Cruel patter as entertainment was his trademark. In the Republican primaries he wiped out opponents used to playing by different rules.</p> <p>What Trumpism projects is pretty clear: building a wall; taking on China; Americanism not globalism. Mrs Clinton seems to have a hundred carefully costed policies but not one eye-catching slogan. She radiates a sensible incrementalism. She campaigns in prose, leaving poetry to her predecessor. This is a mistake. She needs to focus on what is driving discontent in America: an economic system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. Mrs Clinton may argue that after years of watching their incomes go nowhere, America\u2019s middle class <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">finally got a big raise last year</a> \u2013 the first increase since 2007, the year before the Great Recession started. However, the middle classes remain poorer than in 2000. That\u2019s 15 years of going backward. Mrs Clinton needs to find a resonant theme to sum up her policies: a Marshall Plan for the middle classes would not be a bad idea. Monday is her chance to show she is motivated by the common good. Mrs Clinton should seize it.</p>",
  "<p>The US attorney general has warned against escalating violence in North Carolina, as politicians reacted cautiously to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/charlotte-protests-north-carolina-governor-declares-state-of-emergency\">second night of protests</a> against the fatal police shooting of black man in Charlotte. <br></p> <p>\u201cViolence often only begets violence,\u201d said Loretta Lynch, who is from North Carolina and has led the White House response to a string of such killings, as she acknowledged the grievances of demonstrators but called for calm on both sides.</p> <p>\u201cI know these are difficult times and the events of recent days are painfully unclear and call out for answers but the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days,\u201d said the attorney general in a statement in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the demonstrators gathered last night were exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest \u2013 we need your voice, we need your passion, we need your commitment,\u201d she added. \u201cI urge those responsible for bringing violence to these demonstrations to stop, because you are drowning out the voices of commitment and change and you are ushering in more tragedy and grief in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Justice is sending four members of its community relations service to Charlotte and offering \u201ccrowd mediation\u201d services to local police but has so far not stepped further than to say it is \u201cmonitoring\u201d the initial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#keith-scott-2016796\">shooting of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott</a>.</p> <p>But Lynch made clear she that she viewed this and the killing of an apparently unarmed driver in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as potentially linked.</p> <p>\u201cThe tragic events in Charlotte and Oklahoma earlier this week once again underscore the divisions that persist between law enforcement officers and the communities that we serve, particularly communities of colour,\u201d said Lynch.</p> <p>\u201cWe have come together with thoughts and prayers far too many times for a victim of violence. Too many times we have allowed ourselves to be pulled down the easy path of blame and accusation rather than the harder path of empathy and understanding.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bee504bf60a9327355ec742846f395e7139debd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bee504bf60a9327355ec742846f395e7139debd0/0_97_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte protest damage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A car is reflected in the damaged window of a building after the protests in Charlotte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Miczek/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DoJ response follows a muted reaction from the presidential candidates, caught between expressing sympathy for the families of those killed by police, but not wishing to be seen as taking more overt stances against law enforcement.</p> <p>Earlier, Donald Trump said the country \u201cdesperately needs unity and the spirit of togetherness\u201d, though he stood by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/donald-trump-stop-frisk-\">controversial calls for more use of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d tactics</a> by police.</p> <p>He also acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but said \u201cthere is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the peace and safety of others.\u201d </p> <p> \u201cThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African American residents who live in these communities where crime is so rampant,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton was at her home in New York preparing for Monday\u2019s televised presidential debate, but has also tried to appeal to both sides in a politically fraught situation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still much we don\u2019t know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It\u2019s unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable,\u201d she said in a speech on Florida on Wednesday. \u201cWe also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota,\u201d she added. \u201cOur police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I\u2019ve spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign did not respond to further requests for comment on Thursday.</p> <p>The White House sought to remain even handed in voicing support for both protesters and police. Barack Obama received an update from Pat McCrory, the governor of North Carolina, on Thursday afternoon and offered his condolences for the loss of life, press secretary Josh Earnest said.</p> <p>\u201cThe president has also articulated his administration\u2019s support for communities that are grappling with these difficult questions,\u201d Earnest told reporters. \u201cThe president believes strongly in the right of individuals to publicly protest, to voice their concerns in public. Those rights are protected in the United States constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Law enforcement officials have an important duty to protect those rights, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also important that people don\u2019t use a public protest as an excuse to engage in violence or to engage in vandalism. There\u2019s no excuse for that.\u201d</p> <p>Violence distracts from issues that deserve full public scrutiny, Earnest said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e93252a57b51ef6f73039bfe5d2b0c0c07c7b4b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e93252a57b51ef6f73039bfe5d2b0c0c07c7b4b9/0_64_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte protester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester stands with fist raised as she confronts police officers in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin Penna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked about Obama\u2019s response to repeated flare-ups over policing and racial discrimination, Earnest told a press briefing: \u201cThe president has, unfortunately, had numerous opportunities to address this topic, not just over the last couple of years but over the summer. What\u2019s clear is that there is important work to be done in communities all across the country to build trust and strengthen relationships between individual law enforcement agencies and the communities they\u2019re sworn to serve and protect.\u201d</p> <p>Obama has made this work a priority, Earnest added. \u201cThis is a particularly complex set of issues, in part because we know the vast majority of men and women who work in law enforcement are genuine public servants who work to keep their communities safe.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s also true is that there are legitimate concerns that have been raised about inequities in our criminal justice system, inequities that break down in many cases along racial lines, and those are difficult questions that must be confronted. They cannot be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>He said Obama had spoken publicly about such issues on numerous occasions and convened a 21st century policing taskforce to offer suggestions for law enforcement agencies across the country to build trust. The federal government has shared \u201cbest practices\u201d, helping some communities to make important progress, and would welcome additional resources from Congress.</p> <p>Asked about Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to increase stop-and-frisk, Earnest replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to comments by a Republican nominee on the campaign trail.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the police taskforce, he added: \u201cExpanding and doubling down on stop-and-frisk policies is not among the suggestions, for rather obvious reasons.\u201d<br></p> <p>The press secretary also denied that Obama could have done more to address the persistent tensions across the country. \u201cThe president has spoken more about these issues all across the country over the last couple of years than any other public official that comes to my mind. Part of that is because he\u2019s got a responsibility as president of the United States, part of that is because of his strongly held personal views on that topic, part of that is the president\u2019s strong commitment to doing something about it ... I\u2019m confident you\u2019ve not heard from him on this topic for the last time.\u201d<br></p>",

But Carney\u2019s comments in a speech in Berlin offer little enlightenment on that subject, being more concerned with green financing. Katie Allen reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney has thrown his weight behind taking the fledgling market in green investments mainstream to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth at the same time.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Carney used a speech in Berlin on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change.</p> <p>He made no reference to the Bank\u2019s current stance on interest rates in the UK, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. But Carney did discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and and projects to cut emissions could help raise interest rates.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,\u201d Carney said in his Arthur Burns memorial lecture in the German capital.</p> <p>That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation \u2013 the \u201cequilibrium\u201d interest rate - was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality.</p> <p>Reprising his own recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world\u2019s economic problems.</p> <p>\u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policy makers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,\u201d Carney said.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

The 2015 dot plot indicated expectations of 4 hikes this year, and the big shift in expectations shows the committee is likely to implement higher rates at a much slower rate than previously forecast.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/778661135620960256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New dots vs old dots <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TMUZV9zhVu\">pic.twitter.com/TMUZV9zhVu</a></p>&mdash; Danske Bank Research (@Danske_Research) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/778661135620960256\">September 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T09:56:36.598Z\">at 10.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e3a445e4b011f2eb712092\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T09:38:10.745Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Brexit and China are both worries</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d30e1976105be7b495215d7c8bbda51dea9fe33e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30e1976105be7b495215d7c8bbda51dea9fe33e/0_0_4085_2852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Rumpenhorst/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not to be outdone, the European Central Bank has also warned that the Brexit vote is weighing down the UK economy.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/eb201606.en.html\">In its new Economic Bulletin</a></strong>, the ECB cites the EU referendum and the Chinese rebalancing as key risks</p> <p>They say:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, global growth is expected to recover gradually.

It\u2019s holding up a funhouse mirror to society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2c929b766ec60a5169052dd47b7df1ba92d9e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c929b766ec60a5169052dd47b7df1ba92d9e29/0_0_926_509/500.jpg\" alt=\"Seven tombs of gloom: a screengrab from Doomocracy\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seven tombs of gloom: a screengrab from Doomocracy\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reyes and Nato hope to offer about 400-500 people a night a ghastly, dramatic interactive trip that takes in gun nuts, genetically modified crops, climate change, deadly fast-food chains and, looming over Doomocracy\u2019s entrance, a chimeric effigy that\u2019s part Statue of Liberty, part Trojan Horse, and, in Reyes\u2019 view, entirely the embodiment of American foreign policy. \u201cThe USA doesn\u2019t have true representation,\u201d he argues, \u201cand yet they say they\u2019re exporting democracy around the world.\u201d</p> <p>That may all sound as satirical as it is scary. Nevertheless the artist \u2013 who has previously staged a fine-art version of <a href=\"http://camstl.org/about-pedro-reyes-and-sanatorium/\">a psychiatric sanatorium at different galleries around the world</a> and overseen <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/25/265794611/artist-transforms-guns-to-make-music-literally\">a programme to repurpose firearms as musical instruments</a> \u2013 is deeply serious in his examination of fear within today\u2019s political landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThese days, politicians are trying to create fear in order to take power,\u201d Reyes says, \u201cso it\u2019s quite an experiment to be dealing with the production of fear and its political uses.\u201d</p> <p>He is also highly respectful of the funhouse trope, partly because it is so familiar to people who might not necessarily be avid gallery goers.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone can picture a horror house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will, if you forgive the paradox, deal with political issues in a very democratic way. Everyone can engage with the form.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes and Thompson are keen to ensure Doomocracy keeps pace with events and have been writing and rewriting the dramatic scenarios to reflect the changing nature of the electoral race.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been workshopping the scripts today,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid process. The ground is moving fast this election, it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes, who visited both commercial haunted houses and guerrilla theatre groups in preparation for the show, also says Doomocracy reflects a general hopelessness within contemporary politics, both in the US and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do people vote against their own interests?\u201d Reyes says. \u201cIs it that we have brainwashed people to make the wrong decisions? There\u2019s a feeling in the US that it\u2019s a downer to have to choose between the [presidential] options. But it\u2019s elsewhere too; it can be said of Mexico and many other places around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> was almost like a democratic, rightwing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this gloomy view, Doomocracy is still able to engage with some of the norms of campaign fundraising. Its <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2026016011/doomocracy-a-haunted-house-with-pedro-reyes-and-cr\">Kickstarter page</a> looks set to reach its goal of $80,000 by its deadline of 29 September, offering suitably doom-laden swag for its pledgers, including Doomocracy pennants and buttons, and \u201cYes We Can\u2019t\u201d bumper stickers.</p> <p>With all this left-leaning pessimism, Reyes\u2019 haunted house looks unlikely to attract many Trump voters. However, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, Katie Hollander, argues that the work doesn\u2019t favour either side. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commentary on the candidates, more a commentary on the issues,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Indeed, Reyes hopes to take in wider political issues unlikely to be addressed by either party this election year. \u201cIt will deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/-sp-americas-mental-health-care-system-crisis\">mental health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/03/us-war-on-drugs-impact-in-latin-american\">excessive criminalisation of drug use</a>, and the increasing role of the medical industry as a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/20/healthcare-drugspolicy\">white-collar drug dealer</a>,\u201d the artist says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be stuff on the food industry too, and equity or the lack of social mobility \u2013 those universal issues, that are experienced in every part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>While this all may sound nihilistic, Reyes hopes Doomocracy could be liberating too. \u201cUsually my art is more about hope, but on this occasion it is a dark project, and offers more of a space for catharsis,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, Halloween is a moment to go crazy. That is the role of carnival.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, does he genuinely expect Doomocracy to actually change any visitors\u2019 minds about the issues examined? Won\u2019t most already agree with his position on, say, pharmaceuticals and gun crime?</p> <p>\u201cThere will be people who love it, people who hate it, people who feel empowered, and people who feel offended,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cMaking art is one way to elaborate and engage with reality.\u201d</p> <p>And this autumn, at a time when truth seems if not stranger, then at least as spooky as fiction, one route for meaningful political engagement appears to lie through Doomocracy\u2019s funhouse doors.</p>",

Because all you can rely on is what you walk on to that stage with.</p> <p>I have moderated two presidential debates (in 1988 and 1992), but back then there were three questioners and one moderator keeping time.

I would not only go back and look at exactly what each candidate said on the important issues but also where they later changed their tune even slightly \u2013 because you can\u2019t allow a candidate to wiggle out of discrepancies and flip flops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/green-party-jill-stein-presidential-debates-hofstra-new-york\">Green party may try to \u2018escort\u2019 Jill Stein into the presidential debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A good question allows the candidate to reveal more about an issue or a leadership characteristic than the audience previously knew. Just repeating campaign platform positions on issues is a debate that has not served its purpose. It\u2019s all about illuminating information that the American voter didn\u2019t know before the debate started. Ninety percent of the debate no one will remember, but people will remember how the candidate handled the tough questions. </p> <p>Every moderator will hit a moment when he knows the question is not being answered, or that the factual answer being given is wrong. And in every single case, the moderator has to decide \u2013 how hard to I push? Do I move on? Or do I allow the other candidate an opening to correct the factual record? In a perfect world, if I were asking Hillary Clinton a question, I would give Trump an opportunity to call her out. But sometimes the timing doesn\u2019t work that way, and you can\u2019t stay on a question forever. Two follow-ups is about as far as you can go. Every moderator knows there is a danger that you will look up and find that you\u2019ve done 15 minutes on something you wanted to do only five on. After two, you have to leave it there. The audience understands. This person is not answering the question.</p> <p>The most advice for the moderator: don\u2019t over eat and use the bathroom before you get out there. You\u2019ve got 90 minutes without a break. Ninety minutes of sitting there. That\u2019s a long time \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to be at your sharpest. </p> <p>\u2013<em> <a href=\"http://iop.harvard.edu/fellows/ann-compton\">Ann Compton</a> is a veteran White House correspondent for ABC News (1973-2014) and current fellow at Harvard Institute of Policitcs.</em></p> <h2>\u2018People go to a baseball game to watch the game, not the umpire\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62fe9d9dd44deed0447192211d988194c5f5ef9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62fe9d9dd44deed0447192211d988194c5f5ef9f/921_13_1397_1398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Schieffer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Schieffer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If I was walking into a debate with Trump and Clinton, I\u2019d make sure to have a lot of questions. Debates are always hard to predict, and this one especially \u2013 so I\u2019d be sure that I\u2019m ready for any scenario. When I did my first debate in 2004, I had this dream that I got to my last question and looked at the clock and there was still 20 minutes left. I was terrified. I woke up in a cold sweat!

I had 300 questions ready!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The important thing for the moderator to remember is that people go to a baseball game to watch the game, not the umpire. We\u2019re not electing the moderator. We\u2019re electing the president of the United States. You want each person to answer the question, yes, but you have to let the other candidate be the first fact-checker first. If the audience hears a lie, they first want to see if the opponent has picked up on it. If he doesn\u2019t, then I think you can step in. But people wanna hear from the other guy more than they want to hear from you. If the moderator understands there\u2019s been an egregious statement of fact or totally contradicted what they\u2019ve said earlier, he or she should say so. You don\u2019t say: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely wrong.\u201d You bring up the evidence, and say something like: \u201cYou said the opposite three weeks ago.\u201d It\u2019s your obligation to point that out. But it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re doing this in real-time.</p> <p>What you try to do as a moderator is act as a guiding hand. You give each person a chance to show their best \u2013 and if their worst shows up well, that\u2019s part of the story too.

There\u2019s a very limited amount of time to begin with. The focus is on the candidate \u2013 and the moderator should not be a protagonist in the debate. There are other ways to introduce fact-checking. If Trump says \u201cI\u2019ve always been against the Iraq war\u201d and you as a moderator know that\u2019s not the case, what you can do is say \u201cthere are others that dispute that\u201d or \u201cthis has been thoroughly fact checked and I would encourage others to look that up\u201d.

  "<p>\u201cIf you want to become French, you speak French, you live like the French. We will no longer settle for integration that does not work, we will require assimilation.\u201d These <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/20/nicolas-sarkozy-says-immigrants-should-live-like-the-french/\">were the words of</a> former French president Nicolas Sarkozy this week. He went on: \u201cOnce you become French, your ancestors are the Gauls. \u2018I love France, I learned the history of France, I see myself as French,\u2019 is what you must say.\u201d</p> <p>This week, personalities from both sides of the political spectrum expressed their concern over this statement, made by Sarkozy on Monday night during a meeting in Franconville, a north Paris suburb. Curiously, the part that stirred up most controversy was the idea that, once you become French, the Gauls are your ancestors. This declaration is historically incorrect: Gaul is actually a geographical construct conceptualised by the Romans to refer to a territory bringing people of varied origins together. This notion was later used by the Third Republic, after defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, to rally the French around symbols such as courage and strength.</p> <p>This over-simplification of French roots was removed from the school curriculum in the 1960s in favour of a more inclusive reading of French history after decolonisation, following Max Marchand\u2019s publication of one of the first school textbooks on the history of Algeria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5148a8e97b9670ab962f9ef2318525e16f57344a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5148a8e97b9670ab962f9ef2318525e16f57344a/0_462_2600_1784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martinican writer and philosopher Edouard Glissant: \u2018Speaking French is more important than saying something.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martinican writer and philosopher Edouard Glissant: \u2018Speaking French is more important than saying something.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarkozy is only continuing a trend he made popular; after all, he is the president who created the controversial National Identity and Immigration ministry in 2007. Unsurprisingly, the rest of his comments didn\u2019t receive the same criticism. The selective outrage ignores the rehabilitation of the principle of assimilation, setting whiteness as the ideal and erasing people of colour once again. While the majority may think that Sarkozy simply meant that those who move to France must obey the laws of the republic, his comments silence all non-white French people and deny the violence of assimilation. The word \u201cassimilation\u201d itself refers to the second phase of the colonisation process, the first step being \u201cconquest\u201d and the last \u201cpacification\u201d. As Martinican writer and philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/edouard-glissant-obituary\">Edouard Glissant</a> said: \u201cSpeaking French is more important than saying something.\u201d Young writer Fanta Sylla comments on that relationship with the French language in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMlhTknxf4xoSgDyScWT6QoQfN9nTqHamXmfSsLpBg8/mobilebasic\">her essay</a> A Year in France: \u201cWho knew better than the Caribbean, Martinican poets what French colonial occupation and assimilation does to one\u2019s ability to speak and express oneself?

It never left completely, but the approaching presidential election seems to have unleashed something. Two weeks ago, it was Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the ex-prime minister, publicly stating that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poZyJc6IC3E\">colonisation was merely a sharing of culture</a>\u201d. This is historical revisionism, nothing more.

And he\u2019s more rightwing than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This desperate hunt to reclaim myths and symbols of whiteness wouldn\u2019t be so hurtful if every type of gathering between people of colour wasn\u2019t seen as self-ghettoisation, wouldn\u2019t be so senseless if those of us with layered identities didn\u2019t feel as though we are constantly ordered to somehow shrink ourselves, wouldn\u2019t be so hypocritical coming from a self-proclaimed colourblind country. A \u201crhizome identity\u201d \u2013 one that is forced to grow underground \u2013 is the only way to think outside the binary and nostalgic narrative of French politicians. Glissant <a href=\"http://www.edouardglissant.fr/rhizome.html\">applied this idea</a> to post-structuralists Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari: the image of the rhizome (multiple root in one plant) was used to qualify the plural identity as opposed to the single root identity. In contrast to the model of atavistic cultures, the silhouette of the rhizome places identity in the development of composite cultures through a networking of external inputs.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear, Sarkozy is not the problem. He is not the only one who promotes these notions of enmity. We must remain united against the constant infantilisation of French people, the ban of the critical mind. The only way children of immigrants can fight is to refuse assimilation, to familiarise ourselves with the idea of creolisation and to stop defining ourselves and our worth as a reaction to bigotry.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 23 September 2016 to remove an incorrect reference to Napoleon.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>A new opinion poll showing that Hillary Clinton has a six-point lead over Donald Trump was, unsurprisingly, headline news in the United States.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-leads-donald-trump-by-6-points-in-latest-wsj-nbc-poll-1474491609\">authoritative NBC/WSJ poll</a> put Clinton on 43% with Trump on 37%.

  "<p>No one cares about the gifts. So what that the Astros gave David Ortiz a cowboy hat and the Royals some barbecue sauce and the Twins some peanut butter and the Mariners 34lbs of salmon. Ortiz shouldn\u2019t not come back because he\u2019s worried the Padres will be upset they bought him a surfboard as a retirement gift and then he didn\u2019t retire. They probably still have the receipt. </p> <p>\u201cI thought a lot about it,\u201d Ortiz said in November 2015, announcing this would be his final season after back-to-back last place finishes. \u201cEvery single one of us, athletes-wise, we run out of time at some point. Life is based on different chapters and I think I\u2019m ready to experience the next one in my life.\u201d Ortiz said all that on his 40th birthday, undoubtedly assuming that his skills would begin to noticeably erode in his age 40 season. </p> <p>But they haven\u2019t. In fact, Ortiz is having a career year and the best season in baseball history for a 40-year old. Name the stat \u2013 batting average, OBP, OPS, home runs, RBI \u2013 and it\u2019s well above Ortiz\u2019s career average. Meanwhile, the Red Sox have the second-best record in the American League and are a lock for the postseason. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/21/house-of-david-baseball-religious-sect\">The religious sect that became baseball's answer to the Harlem Globetrotters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are zero reasons for Ortiz to retire after this season. Or at least zero good reasons. The farewell tour was a bad idea from the start, as Ortiz admitted himself back in June. If he ultimately decides to return for 2017, maybe his change of heart will put an end to these forced gift-giving tours for good. That alone would deserve a Hall of Fame nod.</p> <p>That leaves the notion that Ortiz should retire so he can \u201cgo out on top.\u201d Blecch. Going out on top is overrated. Sandy Koufax was forced to end his career because of arthritis after going 27-9 with a 1.73 ERA in 1966. Jim Brown and Barry Sanders cut their careers short in football while still among the best in their sports. Every discussion of the careers of Koufax, Brown and Sanders is hit with questions of \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if they had kept playing? What else could they have done? What records could they have broken? No one says: \u201cWasn\u2019t it awesome how we didn\u2019t get to watch them play as long as we could have?\u201d </p> <p>Ortiz was supposedly done in 2009 after back-to-back subpar seasons. Now, seven years later, he\u2019ll get MVP votes. If he\u2019s hitting like this at 40, why can\u2019t he do it at 41 or 42 or 45? It\u2019s not like the role he has on the Red Sox is a physically taxing one. He stands up to hit four times a game and occasionally has to run full-speed on a double. In between it\u2019s massages and hot tubs and first class flights and five-star hotels. He doesn\u2019t have to endure pounding on his knees like a position player, or on his arm like a pitcher, or on his brain like a football player. If 40 is the new 30 for everyone else, it\u2019s 25 for career-long designated hitters. So what\u2019s the point of retiring? DH and pro golfer are the only two jobs in sports where playing at the highest level is not too far off from being retired. </p> <p>Keep the surfboard and cowboy hat and 34lbs of salmon, Big Papi. Or give them back. It doesn\u2019t matter. Just please come back. No one will be upset.

Repeated injuries have kept him from reproducing the kind of numbers he put up in 2014 that spurred the deal. But if the Marlins ever regret paying him all that money \u2013 and team owner Jeffrey Loria most definitely regrets every dollar he has ever paid to someone other than Jeffrey Loria \u2013 they can pass a hat at every stadium they visit to help cover the cost. Fans will happily pay, because when Stanton is healthy and connects, there\u2019s no one else with his power in baseball right now and maybe ever. (Or at least not until Tim Tebow arrived in the sport, right?)<br><br></p> <h2>Quote of the week</h2> <p><br>\u201cPeople say to me: \u2018What are you going to do [in retirement]? What are you going to do?\u2019 And I say the same thing. You know if, you retire at the age of 65, the chances are you\u2019re going to have 20 more years. And so \u2018what are you going to do\u2019 is important to fill 20 years. When you retire at 89, the only answer to \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 is \u2018Try to live.\u2019\u201d - <em>Vin Scully</em><br><br><br>Feel free to take a few minutes away from the rest of the column to sob uncontrollably and then pick up from here. <br><br></p> <h2>Who\u2019s closer to victory: Donald Trump or the Cubs? </h2> <p><br>It has been argued in this space before that Donald Trump has a much easier path to victory because he only has to beat one opponent, while the Cubs will have to through three rounds to win it all. And that\u2019s true. But in the divisional round, the Cubs will get to play the winner of the National League wildcard game. Have you seen the teams currently fighting for the wildcard spots? They are a true <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basket-of-deplorables/\">basket of deplorables</a>. Advantage: Cubs. <br><br></p> <h2>How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week? </h2> <p><br>While many of today\u2019s whippersnappers undoubtedly enrage the man named Goose with their carefree approach to life, he can find solace in the knowledge that prominent players like Madison Bumgarner still want to enforce the olds ways. After retiring Yasiel Puig of the rival Dodgers on Monday night, Bumgarner said \u201cDon\u2019t look at me!\u201d to the outfielder as he walked off the field. Then, per the unwritten rules of baseball, Bumgarner strategically positioned himself behind a team-mate and proceeded to pretend he was being held back from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5BRNhkKaY\">giving Puig the whooping he so deserved</a>. This is a man who can shoot and field dress a coyote, but can\u2019t handle another man looking at him? That makes no sense at all. Which means it makes perfect sense for baseball\u2019s code. </p> <h2>Nine things in order</h2> <p><br>1) Some in baseball remain very bitter that Tebow is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jp_crawford/status/778363473860317184\">getting a look from the Mets</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s taking a spot from a deserving player,\u201d the argument usually goes. It\u2019s a bad argument and one that really doesn\u2019t deserve to be addressed, but let\u2019s do it anyway. Yes, it\u2019s true Tebow is taking someone else\u2019s spot, but he\u2019s taking the spot of the absolute worst player at the lowest-level of the organization. If Tebow didn\u2019t take it, that person was going to lose his spot tomorrow due to his lack of skill and the arrival of absolutely anyone else who might not be as bad. The Mets aren\u2019t cutting the next David Wright for an old quarterback. <br><br>2) There is zero downside for baseball with Tebow. The best-case scenario is that Tebow earns a ton of media attention for the game while failing out of the minors, thereby reminding everyone that hitting is an incredibly difficult skill a select few humans can master. The other option is that Tebow proves to be a capable player, makes it to the majors and ... generates exponentially more publicity for the sport. There is no worst-case scenario. To borrow a Tebowian phrase, baseball is \u201cblessed.\u201d <br><br>3) While the rest of the United States votes on whether to become an international joke on 8 November, the residents of Arlington, Texas, will also be determining if they want to build a new, retractable roof stadium for the Rangers to replace the 22-year old Globe Life Park. Commissioner Rob Manfred appeared in town this week to push for the new stadium, saying the current one puts the Rangers at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d and the heat in an open-air stadium in Texas \u201cmakes it harder getting players to play there.\u201d That is some Trump-level bullshit from the commissioner. </p> <p>As for being \u201ccompetitive,\u201d the Rangers are set to win the AL West and make the playoffs for fifth time in seven years. They also made the playoffs three times in the first six years the stadium opened. And if it\u2019s hard for the Rangers to get players to play in the Texas heat, why did Prince Fielder waive his no-trade clause to get there from frigid Detroit? Why did Cole Hamels do the same to come from Philadelphia? Or Carlos Beltran from New York? Why did Yu Darvish sign there? Why did Adrian Beltre sign a six-year contract to leave Boston and play there? Is the Texas heat appreciably worse for someone who grew up in the Dominican Republic? The Rangers have the eighth-highest payroll in baseball, so perhaps players are OK with the heat. Or maybe they\u2019ve decided they can handle a bit of sweating in exchange for zero state taxes. Either way, the Rangers \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d hasn\u2019t prevented the organization from being valued at $1.225bn by Forbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/mlb-valuations/list/#tab:overall\">11th highest in all of baseball</a>.</p> <p>But, yes, let\u2019s get the Rangers a new stadium. One with a retractable roof. One to rival Jerry Jones\u2019 monstrosity. By the way, that Cowboys stadium has been open for more than seven years now, right? And Dallas haven\u2019t won anything. The Cowboys are at an obvious competitive disadvantage. Time to replace it.<br><br>4) Cubs second baseman Ben Zobrist rode his bike to Wrigley Field on Saturday in full uniform save for a pair of PF Flyers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4305555556% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKdz1dTjGV9/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">My man is an old soul who plays old school baseball.  @cubs</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A video posted by Julianna Zobrist (@juliannazobrist) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-09-17T17:41:06+00:00\">Sep 17, 2016 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s come to this.

But even without that odd historical coincidence, the Giants had the most wins in the majors at the All-Star break. But in the second half of the season they\u2019re tied for the fewest wins in baseball and are in danger of failing to even grab a wildcard spot. The inability to score runs and the struggles of the bullpen are the obvious reasons for San Francisco\u2019s downfall, but there\u2019s something else out there that can be blamed by a sports columnist desperate enough for page-views. Yep, you guessed it: San Francisco has obviously been distracted by Colin Kaepernick. <br><br>9) It\u2019s not quite the 1998 home run chase as far as excitement goes, but the 2016 MLB season is on pace to set the all-time record for strikeouts.

For those who walk on the sunny side of the street, this was an assured film directed by Laverne &amp; Shirley\u2019s Penny Marshall which brought America up to speed on an untold sports story from the second world war.

Despite the film\u2019s flaws \u2013 Eastwood hogs much of the screen time, the other female boxers include a rather un-nuanced German ex-prostitute \u2013 Swank\u2019s portrayal is still one of the most compelling of any female athlete on the big or small screen. </p> <h2>Whip It</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c90ebed1ae1347e92bcbb425f440d3cd97e61e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c90ebed1ae1347e92bcbb425f440d3cd97e61e76/0_84_3120_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drew Barrymore, Ellen Page and Kristen Wiig in Whip It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drew Barrymore, Ellen Page and Kristen Wiig in Whip It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike most other films in the subgenre, Whip It doesn\u2019t deal with a woman trying to thrive in a field typically dominated by men. In Drew Barrymore\u2019s energetic directorial debut, the sport of roller derby is filled with nothing <em>but </em>women, marking this out as something of a greased-up unicorn. The grungy world was one that ultimately proved a bit too niche for audiences (the film crashed with $16m worldwide) but critics agreed that it was fertile and untapped ground for an updated tale of against all odds achievement, as Ellen Page\u2019s spunky teen swapped her pageant crown for a pair of skates. Sexism was still on the agenda but rather than a bitter male contingent, it came from Marcia Gay Harden\u2019s small-town mother who wanted her daughter to embrace a more traditional concept of femininity.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Love &amp; Basketball</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWwvDxo-O48\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWwvDxo-O48?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A muted release back in 2000 might not have been the slam-dunk that producer Spike Lee had hoped for, but this romantic drama has developed a curiously large cult following ever since. It\u2019s easy to see why, given writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s unique and authentically realized story of a couple (Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps) falling in and out of love while trying to reach their separate dreams of basketball stardom. Up until that point, women shooting hoops on the big screen was unheard of (it\u2019s been equally unexplored ever since) and it remains refreshing to see a sports movie playing out from a woman\u2019s point of view and especially one that refuses to indulge our more traditionalist view of the genre, focusing on the long game rather than the easy win.</p> <h2>Hang Time </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafaf5a38dfa2bbb6330a9d9fc0a64419c1c4f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafaf5a38dfa2bbb6330a9d9fc0a64419c1c4f12/0_76_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Hang Time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Hang Time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hang Time was not a particularly sophisticated show but in the barren wasteland of fictional female characters playing sports on the small screen, it stands out as an important one nonetheless. It was a Saturday morning comedy that ran on NBC from 1995 to 2000 and focused on Julie Connor (played by Daniella Deutscher), who moves to Deering high school in Indiana from Chicago. She wants to join the basketball team and of course the boys have a major problem with that \u2013 so their coach and real-life former NBA player (played by Reggie Theus) has to convince them all that Julie is talented enough to join. Because this was essentially a show for kids, she manages to make the team in the very first episode. It\u2019s a crude oversimplification of what would be an incredibly difficult process but it helped to show the captive young female audience that they could be something other than cheerleaders. Given that there are still so few examples of women as successful athletes on screen now, Hang Time deserves applause for attempting to change the game in 1995.</p> <h2>Bend it Like Beckham</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5SrjFVQIM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dk5SrjFVQIM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Released during a period in British cinema when most comedies came with the word romantic attached, Gurinder Chadha\u2019s breakout hit played out on a very different field. While protagonist Jess (played by Parminder Nagra) does have a very dashing love interest (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers), her biggest passion is soccer, against her traditional Indian family\u2019s wishes. It\u2019s notable that her camaraderie with fellow team-mate Jules (played by Keira Knightley) is also what shines brighter than her romance. They don\u2019t fall prey to a catty competitiveness that so often plagues women portrayed onscreen. They provide support and stability when outside characters are doing everything to break that. They are both actually good at soccer and integral to the team. Admittedly, there is a dramatic argument over a man but it\u2019s swiftly resolved and the ultimate satisfaction at watching two young women excel on the soccer field is worth the odd quibble.</p>",
  "<p>China is the future \u2013 in cinema terms at least. As Hollywood expansionist strategy makes clear, most film-industry insiders believe that China is where the money is, and will be. Despite a recent dip in takings, the Chinese box office is expected to outgross the US\u2019s in 2017 for the first time: projections suggest that Chinese cinemas will earn $10.4bn, as opposed to $10.2bn in the US. In February, the huge totals for the Stephen Chow film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/global-box-office-the-mermaid-china-record-zootopia-how-to-be-single\">The Mermaid</a> helped China\u2019s monthly gross \u2013 $1.05bn \u2013 surpass that of all of North America (including Canada), which was $790m for the same period.<br></p> <p>China is moving towards Hollywood, too. In an effort spearheaded by billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/chairman-wang-jianlin-process-of-pursuing-wealth\">Wang Jianlin</a>, the Dalian Wanda Group has been investing in anything that is for sale in Tinseltown, including Batman producers Legendary Entertainment and the cinema chain AMC, and is currently angling to acquire Paramount. Meanwhile, Hollywood increasingly has to comply with China\u2019s written and unwritten regulations, and make countless compromises, to produce audience-pleasing blockbusters that satisfy the censors. And in order to bypass the quota that China sets for foreign movies (34 a year), US studios have started to make co-productions with Chinese ones \u2013 adapting further to China\u2019s requests, censorship and regulations in order to do so. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvMk7Z0Sp7E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UvMk7Z0Sp7E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trailer for the box office record-breaking Stephen Chow film The Mermaid.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is an exercise fraught with unexpected consequences, as the Hong Kong film industry \u2013 until recently one of the most productive and vibrant in the world \u2013 knows only too well.

Whole studios emigrated from Shanghai (formerly China\u2019s film-making centre) and settled in what was then a British colony. Hong Kong produced Mandarin- and Cantonese-language movies until the 1960s; gradually thereafter, Cantonese began to dominate. But language seemed almost irrelevant: Hong Kong cinema had entered its golden era, and, as Shu Kei, film critic and professor at the Academy of Performing Arts in Hong Kong, recalls, \u201cactors would be busy on nearly 10 sets in a single day\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe golden era had an output of up to 250 films a year, and the slowdown only started in the 90s,\u201d says Kei. \u201cQuality was problematic, but the craze was such that cinemas were screening movies at a slightly faster pace, in order to squeeze in one extra show, while film directors and actors just improvised with no script.\u201d Profits were so high that organised crime became an active part of the industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9de903f4604016bf7f18afd0e8a921ff942c9464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de903f4604016bf7f18afd0e8a921ff942c9464/48_0_1576_1968/801.jpg\" alt=\"Brigitte Lin in Chungking Express (1994)\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brigitte Lin in Chungking Express (1994)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the late 90s, just at the point at which audiences became more discriminating and DVDs started to eat into profits, China began opening up, changing the game entirely. Hong Kong\u2019s movie stars were highly attractive and recognisable, but to remain relevant, Hong Kong cinema had to shift its attention to mainland audiences, and cut back on some of its more eccentric traits. \u201cWhen Wong Kar Wai shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1995/sep/14/1\">Chungking Express</a> in 1994, Brigitte Lin was dressed up in a wig, sunglasses and a raincoat because she was busy on a period movie set, and had no time to go through makeup and costume again. But it worked!\u201d says Shu Kei with a giggle. That era was soon over. </p> <p>\u201cThe first movie I shot in China was in the 80s, and I required no permits to film there. I didn\u2019t need to submit my script either,\u201d recalls Mabel Cheung, another of Hong Kong\u2019s most important auteur film makers. \u201cI needed to shoot in China for my trilogy on illegal migrants, and the only issue was people crowding the set as they were so excited to see Hong Kong film stars. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zja-rkeXUxk\">Sammo Hung</a> was the male lead, and that meant we were followed around all the way into the hotel, and filming was a challenge.\u201d </p> <p>Some years later, Cheung was back in China filming a major historical drama, The Soong Sisters (1997), based on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19910975\">real-life story</a> of three sisters married to three of the most important men in modern Chinese history \u2013 the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, China\u2019s first president Sun Yat-sen, and HH Kung, China\u2019s first finance minister. It was a co-production with the Beijing Film Studio. \u201cI had to submit the script and get permission, but the Chinese film industry at the time was not strong: money had to be entirely provided by us, and they supplied the crew and the film studio. But when we submitted the film to the censorship bureau, we were told we had to go to the Important Affairs Commission, since it was a historical movie.\u201d</p> <p>It ended up with Cheung losing the last 18 minutes of her movie, in spite of her long pleadings with the censors\u2019 office: \u201cI never got my ending back. I had to reconstruct an ending I could live with from leftover material they agreed to return. They said it was not possible for Soong Mei-ling and Soong Ai-ling to hug, because one was married to a nationalist and the other to the father of the nation; so we had an argument about history. But I managed to get my film, and [Chinese] mainland distribution.\u201d While waiting however, Cheung filmed Beijing Rocks (2001), about the Chinese capital\u2019s booming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/11/popandrock.chinaarts2008\">underground music scene</a>. \u201cThat got banned,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I could take it to Hong Kong, and after that I could go back to China.

Then, while the former colony was recovering from the devastating economic effects of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars epidemic</a> in 2003, Beijing announced the establishment of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, a free-trade agreement which granted preferential access for Hong Kong films to the Chinese market.

In 2002, Hong Kong\u2019s filmgoers were queuing up to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/feb/27/dvdreviews.shopping1\">Infernal Affairs</a>, co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak \u2013 the beginning of a double-agent cop trilogy in the greatest tradition, with an exhilarating succession of twists. To break into the mainland market, it had three different endings for the censors to choose from. \u201cIn a mainland China movie, you cannot have a bad guy who gets away with his crimes,\u201d explains film-maker Jevons Au. \u201cMultiple endings to suit the mainland market used to be OK. No more. Now, if you want to distribute in China, you must have only one approved ending worldwide. You can step on the line. But you cannot cross it.\u201d</p> <p>Au knows all about being banned: he is one of the five co-directors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/ten-years-the-terrifying-vision-of-hong-kong-that-beijing-wants-obscured\">Ten Years</a>, a politically uncompromising dystopian tale which imagines Hong Kong under an ever-more repressive regime. All five have been banned from China, despite Ten Years winning best film at the Hong Kong film awards and being feted in critics\u2019 circles as the harbinger of a local renaissance in small-budget productions that talk to local audiences, and are not geared to grossing millions in China. </p> <p>\u201cFor us, it is complicated,\u201d says Au. \u201cThe uniqueness of Hong Kong is our freedom of speech, of creativity, of expression. You can do and say anything you want. To make a co-production with China, you have to follow ever stricter rules: half of the cast and crew has to be Chinese. The censors have the last word. Crime stories cannot have too many details. Stories of corruption must end with the bad guy behind bars. No ghosts. No gay love stories. No religion. No nudity. No politics\u2026\u201d He counts on his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a trap. The moment you fall into it, you change. You hurt your creativity.\u201d </p> <p>Other films suggest, however, that obstacles can stimulate creativity, and not necessarily crush it. Director Stephen Chow shifted his operation to China, and had enormous box office success. The Mermaid became the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time. And it got around the prohibition of films about the supernatural by reclassifying itself as a science-fiction movie. Likewise, Barbara Wong Chun-Chun, who started her career as an independent film-maker with thought-provoking movies such as Women\u2019s Private Parts (2000), a documentary discussion of female sexuality, has now abandoned small-budget productions to make some of the most successful Chinese movies. Her film The Secret (2016) is a love story among what seem to be ghosts, but could get into theatres thanks to its final line: when one of the characters wakes up from a coma, she asks if she dreamed it all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVxwLy8t21s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rVxwLy8t21s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Was it all just a dream? \u2026 The Secret (2016), directed by Barbara Wong Chun-Chun.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cYou have to try to understand China\u2019s censorship,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIn Hong Kong you have category I, II and III movies. In China, there is no such system. So you must make movies that a five year old can watch without feeling scared. Can you make a movie with a bad cop in it in China? Of course. But then he has to end up in jail. Can you have much blood? No. A kid is going to see it. Foreigners who want to make movies in China need to understand the country first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay you want to make a film about corruption,\u201d Wong continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive theme. But the regulations are blurry, you can tackle things in a different way: shoot a film where the corruption is in America, not in China. Then it\u2019s OK. As an artist, you must find ways of getting around it.\u201d</p> <p>Another limitation is established by Chinese moviegoers\u2019 own tastes. Roger Garcia, executive director of the Hong Kong film festival, says: \u201cIn China, you are making either a romance or a big special-effects movie. If you want to do horror, or other genres, you cannot be in China. You can make a budget sci-fi movie in Hollywood, but Chinese audiences will not like that. They like huge, costly productions. So I think that China should not be the total sum of everything, it is a mistake. It is limiting. For Hong Kong, it was a mistake to obsess about China. And things are changing now that Hollywood is doing the same.\u201d</p> <p>Johnnie To agrees that film-makers are presented with a difficult choice: \u201cYou have to recognise that China is way more open now. The first film I shot there was in 1978 \u2013 the change is obvious, very big.\u201d Milkyway Image, his production company in Kwun Tong, the movie district of Hong Kong, has produced films that have been allowed into the mainland, as well as others that were banned \u2013 like the recent Trivisa (2016), co-directed by Ten Years\u2019 Jevons Au. </p> <p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d says To, \u201cyou must ask yourself: can China accept this movie? We are different in Hong Kong, we are free, we can do and say what we want. Not them. So, you must be prepared to accept their point of view. But you cannot escape this fact: today, if you want to make a big budget movie, you can no longer make it only for Hong Kong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqChehmFdqs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CqChehmFdqs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trivisia (2016), directed by Johnny To and Jevons Au, has been banned in China. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDoes it mean compromises? Yes, very many. But the alternative is no movie in China. There are many political issues that China is still stuck with, because it has an old-fashioned system of government, and even if there is more freedom than there used to be, the Communist party is unable to relax. Yet you see it very clearly \u2013 everybody is ready to shut up to make money.\u201d </p> <p>Despite To\u2019s high profile, some of his films were denied a release in China. Neither Election (2005) nor Election 2 (2006), which deal with power struggles in a triad gang, made it. \u201cI am going to wait until I am 65 to make Election 3,\u201d says To, now 61, \u201cas I already know that, after that, I will be banned from China. But it will be OK: I\u2019ll be able to really describe the rot in our government through that film.\u201d</p> <p>While film industries from Hollywood and Italy to the UK and India continue to court this booming source of revenue, To is not optimistic about cinema. \u201cTo make it really big, a film has to be one the Chinese censors can approve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe range of films that the world will get to see will be restricted.\u201d</p>",

Any new legislation needs to pass through both houses of parliament. </p> <p>\u201cIt is up to the commonwealth to amend legislation and the commonwealth can determine to do what it wants,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cBut for most of the last two decades, the conditions included national agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThe Hawke government started the national agreement idea and it was carried on by John Howard, but in principle the commonwealth can decide any conditions that it wants.\u201d</p> <p>Education ministers meet in Adelaide on Thursday evening and Friday morning to begin to thrash out the agreements for 2018-19. Those years represent the final two years of the six-year so-called Gonski funding agreements. </p> <p>At issue is the funding formula and whether to extend formulas based on the Gonski recommendations of baseline funding for individual students, loaded for any disadvantage.</p> <p>The Gonski funding plan was considered Julia Gillard\u2019s signature policy but of the current agreements, half of the states were signed up by the Gillard government prior to the 2013 election and half by the incoming Abbott government.</p> <p>Birmingham has argued that far from delivering a baseline national schooling resource standard (SRS) with loading for disadvantages, the current state and territory agreements provide different amounts for equivalent students in different states. He argues this is a corruption of the Gonski ideals.</p> <p>While Birmingham has talked about the importance of funding based on students\u2019 needs, the Coalition has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/03/naplan-results-writing-reading-numeracy-scores-plateaued-gonski-funding-link\">consistently</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/07/experts-say-malcolm-turnbull-using-flimsy-evidence-on-school-funding\">distanced itself</a> from the Gonski model. </p> <p>Queensland\u2019s acting Labor premier and education minister, Curtis Pitt, said Birmingham was turning his back on education in Queensland and trying to lecture the states when \u201cthey don\u2019t run a single school\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe educate more than 380,000 students in regional and rural areas with more than 1,000 schools outside the Brisbane metropolitan area,\u201d Pitt said.</p> <p>\u201cWe also educate around one third of the nation\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and some of these students live in the most remote areas of the country.</p> <p>\u201cQueensland is also a growth state and we need funding to keep pace with our growing population.\u201d</p> <p>Australian Education Union federal president Correna Haythorpe said the federal government\u2019s refusal to honour years five and six of the Gonski agreements with the states would see schools lose $3.9bn in funding.</p> <p>\u201cNo state has yet reached the minimum resourcing standards for schools that were outlined in the Gonski report,\u201d Haythorpe said.</p> <p>\u201cThat is because under the Gonski agreements, two-thirds of the extra funding to schools was to be delivered in 2018 and 2019. We don\u2019t need to reinvent Gonski, we need to fund it in full.\u201d<br></p>",

Although Trump seemingly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States on Friday at a peculiar press event held in a Washington hotel, he <a href=\"http://abc6onyourside.com/news/election/1-on-1-with-donald-trump\">told an interviewer</a> on Wednesday that he only abandoned the birther conspiracy theory because \u201cI wanted to get on with the campaign. A lot of people were asking me questions.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Hannity, who has appeared in a campaign ad for Trump, asked fawning questions of the Republican nominee and repeatedly praised him in the course of the hour-long interview.

King, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/don-king-donald-trump-cleveland-rally\">used the N-word at</a> one Trump campaign event earlier on Wednesday and compared the Republican nominee to John the Baptist at another, was more restrained with Hannity.

Clayborne Carson, director of the Martin Luther King Jr Research and Education Institute at Stanford University, said \u201cthe theme of his remarks seem to be that I know better than African American leaders what\u2019s best for black Americans. And that kind of arrogance just doesn\u2019t play very well.\u201d Carson noted that Trump\u2019s birtherism made him <em>persona non grata </em>in the African American community as well. \u201cI think for many African American that puts you beyond the pale, that Donald Trump came to national attention in American politics as a person who challenged whether the first black president was really an American,\u201d said Carson.

Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for inaction.</p> <p>Clarke noted that Wednesday\u2019s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She warned: \u201cWhat I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5. <br></p> <p>\u201cEach day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.<br><br>\u201cVoter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is \u201cminuscule\u201d.</p> <p>Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during this year\u2019s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but were told to vote at separate polling stations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the past few months and years I\u2019ve traveled across the country and I know that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural voters to participate in the democratic process.

The law of consent in most states is between 16 and 18, although in many states teens younger than 16 can have consensual sexual contact with each other provided the age gap is not more than four years.</p> <p>By all accounts Weiner and the 15-year-old did not meet or have any physical contact. He allegedly sent her explicitly sexual messages and asked her to undress and masturbate over video chat. When an exchange escalated and he allegedly tried to engage her in talk of a rape fantasy, she objected and he dropped the subject, according to the Daily Mail\u2019s report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c0c45942499bd2316d40665a6c6f33a22eaa249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c0c45942499bd2316d40665a6c6f33a22eaa249/75_0_1603_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Weiner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Weiner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weiner reportedly admitted to the Daily Mail that he had engaged in flirtatious exchanges with the girl but did not comment further on any of the specific allegations. He maintained that some of the details may be a hoax.</p> <p>In some screenshots accompanying the report, Weiner\u2019s picture and name can be seen on screen. In a statement to the Daily Mail, Weiner said, in part: \u201cI have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.\u201d</p> <p>He sent a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/21/new-low-disgraced-dem-anthony-weiner-sorry-after-texts-to-15-year-old-revealed.html\">similar</a> statement to Fox News and also apologized for his behavior, while repeating that he may be the subject of a hoax.</p> <p>According to Wednesday\u2019s report, Weiner and the 15-year-old used apps such as Kik and Confide where much of the material exchanged or the identity of the sender is automatically deleted.</p> <p>But the girl reportedly took some screenshots of certain images and words.</p> <p>\u201cA situation such as this could involve an array of crimes, depending on what is done and what a minor is asked for,\u201d said John Wilkinson, an attorney adviser and former prosecutor with Aequitas, a consultancy and research organization that advises on prosecuting violence against women.</p> <p>Any investigation into Weiner could involve child sex abuse images or child endangerment statutes. There are also federal laws prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children and other statutes involving the transfer of obscene materials to a minor. Wilkinson also explained that even if an adult claims a teenager initiated contact and they did not realize their young age, that is not accepted as a defense in court.</p> <p>If the two people are in different states, or even if they are in the same state but use digital services such as Skype, which often have their servers located in another state, then a situation involving a 51-year-old and a 15-year-old could be investigated under federal as well as state criminal laws.</p> <p>Azi Paybarah, a senior reporter at Politico, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Azi/status/778671013039144960\">posted</a> on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had been asked about the latest scandal and Cuomo said that if the latest report was true it was \u201csick\u201d and potentially \u201ccriminal\u201d.</p> <p>After the August scandal, Weiner first denied and then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/nyregion/anthony-weiner-confirms-child-welfare-agency-is-\">admitted</a> that he was being investigated by New York\u2019s child services authorities.</p>"
