  "<p>France\u2019s opposition party will field eight candidates in primaries to decide who will lead it in next year\u2019s presidential election. Polls suggest the winner of the November two-round party vote will become the country\u2019s next leader.</p> <p>After Les R\u00e9publicains (LR) party nominations closed on Friday evening, the stage was set for a rightwing \u201cduel\u201d between former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9, now mayor of Bordeaux.</p> <p>Polls predict that whoever wins the primary will be in the second-round runoff next May against the Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen; the latest show Jupp\u00e9, 71, still the favourite with LR voters, but Sarkozy, 61, snapping at his heels. According to market researchers TNS Sofres, if the election were held tomorrow Jupp\u00e9 would win the second round against Le Pen with 55% of votes, but pollsters agree that former Socialist finance minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a> could seriously upset the contest if he decides to stand. Macron, an ex-banker, resigned from the Socialist government last month but has not said if he will join the presidential race. <em>Le Figaro</em> suggests he would knock out Sarkozy to take third place.</p> <p>The only woman among the eight LR candidates, former minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, 43, is an outside bet.</p> <p>It was the first time the mainstream right (party names have changed over the years) has organised a primary. The vote will be open to all on the electoral roll who pay \u20ac2 towards organisation costs \u2013 for each round \u2013 and declare \u201con their honour \u2026 to share the republican values of the right and centre\u201d, but this is unlikely to deter non-supporters\u2019 attempts to skew the result.</p> <p>Ga\u00ebl Sliman, president of the Odoxa polling institute, said the eight candidates represented the gamut of the centre-right in France. \u201cThe turnout will be a major factor. It should be massive; if it tops four million voters it will be a great success,\u201d Sliman told <em>La D\u00e9p\u00eache</em> newspaper.</p> <p>He warned the polls were not an infallible prognosis. \u201cThe debates between candidates, the campaign, can change views \u2026 let\u2019s not forget, for primary voters, the important thing is to choose the person who has the best chance of winning the presidential, and among right voters the idea is fixed that either Jupp\u00e9 or Sarkozy will win.\u201d</p> <p>Over on the left, <em>les frondeurs</em> (rebels) of the Socialist party (PS) met yesterday to agree on a candidate to stand against Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. A serving president would normally go forward for a second term without serious challenge from his own ranks, but Hollande\u2019s popularity rating, according to the latest Ifop poll, is a disastrous 18%.</p> <p>Under the banner \u201cTurn left to win\u201d, former ministers and presidential hopefuls Arnaud Montebourg and Beno\u00eet Hamon, both sacked from government two years ago, were expected to slug it out for the PS nomination.The French Communist Party (PCF), which held its traditional F\u00eate de l\u2019Humanit\u00e9 this weekend, is also in disarray. In 2012 the party backed Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of the Front de Gauche, the first time since 1981 it did not field its own candidate in a presidential election.</p> <p>Yves Thr\u00e9ard, deputy director of the right-leaning <em>Figaro</em> newspaper speaking on Europe 1 radio, lambasted the PCF as \u201cinfested with Trostkyists\u201d and said the weekend event was nothing more than a \u201cmusic festival\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe class struggle has given way to a defence of local (food) products. Already in the 1970s, when the Soviet Union was still standing \u2026 people came mainly to listen to the greatest rock bands on the planet. who were filthy rich and pure products of decadent capitalism,\u201d Thr\u00e9ard railed.</p>",
  "<p>America has never been entirely sure what to do with its white poor. For complicated historical and political reasons, we associate \u201cpoor\u201d in our public consciousness with \u201cblack\u201d. Terms such as \u201cwelfare queen\u201d and \u201cculture of poverty\u201d became associated uniquely with the social maladies of African Americans in urban ghettos, despite the fact that poor whites outnumbered poor blacks.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always thus. When <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/lbj-union64/\" title=\"\">President Lyndon Baines Johnson </a>launched his \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d in the 1960s, he did so from eastern Kentucky coal country, then and now one of the poorest regions of the country. That region is my ancestral homeland, the place from which my grandparents emigrated to avoid the sort of material destitution President Johnson highlighted. Like millions of southern and Appalachian migrants, they moved north to the booming industrial economies of Ohio, Pennsylvania and similar states.</p> <p>They moved in the hope of finding better jobs and higher wages and for a time they found those things. Yet in the wake of a long-term decline in manufacturing in the United States, the economic boomtown my grandparents migrated to began to struggle in many of the same ways as the eastern Kentucky town they left behind. By the time their grandchildren reached adulthood in the early 2000s, joblessness and despair had replaced the optimism that characterised my grandparents 50 years earlier. And though the local economies of each region differed \u2013 in Detroit, automobile manufacturing; in southern Ohio, steel and paper mills; in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, coal mining \u2013 the social problems looked eerily similar. All across Appalachia and the Rust Belt, opioid addiction, family breakdown and rising mortality set in. And the ills afflicting the white working class, so similar to those stereotypically assigned to the black poor, became impossible to ignore.</p> <p>To many commentators, these problems are statistics to be analysed, but to me, they were the backdrop of my youth. As a kid, I sorted Middletown into three basic geographic regions. First, the area surrounding the high school, which opened in 1969. The \u201crich\u201d kids lived here. Large homes mixed comfortably with well-kept parks and office complexes. If your dad was a doctor, he almost certainly owned a home or had an office here, if not both. I dreamed that I\u2019d own a house in Manchester Manor, a relatively new development not a mile from the high school, where a nice home went for less than a fifth of the price of a decent house in San Francisco. Next, the poor kids (the really poor kids) lived near Armco, where even the nice homes had been converted into multi-family apartment units. I didn\u2019t know until recently that this neighbourhood was actually two neighbourhoods \u2013 one inhabited by Middletown\u2019s working-class black population, the other by its poorest white population. Middletown\u2019s few housing projects stood there.</p> <p>Then there was the area where we lived \u2013 mostly single-family homes, with abandoned warehouses and factories within walking distance. Looking back, I don\u2019t know if the \u201creally poor\u201d areas and my block were any different or whether these divisions were the constructs of a mind that didn\u2019t want to believe we were really poor.</p> <p>Across the street from our house was Miami Park, a single city block with a swing set, a tennis court, a baseball field and a basketball court. As I grew up, I noticed that the tennis court lines faded with each passing month and that the city had stopped filling in the cracks or replacing the nets on the basketball courts. I was still young when the tennis court became little more than a cement block littered with grass patches. I learned that our neighbourhood had \u201cgone downhill\u201d after two bikes were stolen in the course of the week. For years, Mamaw said, her children had left their bikes unchained in the yard with no problems. Now we woke to find thick locks cracked in two by deadbolt cutters. From that point forward, I walked.</p> <h2><strong>Downtown Middletown is little more than a relic </strong></h2> <p>If Middletown had changed little by the time I was born, the writing was on the wall almost immediately thereafter. It\u2019s easy even for residents to miss how much Middletown has changed because the change has been gradual \u2013 more erosion than mudslide. But it\u2019s obvious if you know where to look and a common refrain for those of us who return intermittently is: \u201cGeez, Middletown is not looking good.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, Middletown had a proud, almost idyllic downtown: a bustling shopping centre, restaurants that had operated since before the Second World War and a few bars where men like Papaw would gather and have a beer (or sometimes many) after a hard day at the steel mill. My favourite store was the local Kmart, which was the main attraction in a strip mall, near a branch of Dillman\u2019s, a local grocer with three or four locations. Now the strip mall is mostly bare: Kmart stands empty and the Dillman family closed that big store and all the rest, too. The last I checked, there was only an Arby\u2019s, a discount grocery store, and a Chinese buffet in what was once a Middletown centre of commerce. The scene at that strip mall is hardly uncommon. Few Middletown businesses are doing well and many have ceased operating altogether. Twenty years ago, there were two malls. Now one of those malls is a parking lot and the other serves as a walking course for the elderly.</p> <p>Today, downtown Middletown is little more than a relic of American industrial glory. Abandoned shops line the heart of downtown Middletown, where Central Avenue and Main Street meet. Richie\u2019s pawnshop has long since closed, though the hideous yellow and green sign still marks the site, last time I checked. Richie\u2019s isn\u2019t far from an old pharmacy that, in its heyday, had a soda bar and served root beer floats. Across the street is a building that looks like a theatre, with one of those giant triangular signs that reads \u201cST\u2013L\u201d because the letters in the middle were shattered and not replaced. A little farther down the road is a cash-for-gold store and not far from that is a payday lending outfit.</p> <p>Not far from the main drag of empty shops and boarded-up windows is the Sorg mansion. The Sorgs, a powerful and wealthy industrial family dating back to the 19th century, operated a large paper mill in Middletown. They donated enough money to put their names on the local opera house and helped build Middletown into a respectable enough city to attract Armco. Their mansion, a gigantic manor home, sits near a formerly proud Middletown country club. Despite its beauty, a Maryland couple recently purchased the mansion for $225,000 or about half of what a decent multi-room apartment sets you back in Washington DC.</p> <p>Located quite literally on Main Street, the Sorg mansion is just up the road from a number of opulent homes that housed Middletown\u2019s wealthy in their heyday. Most have fallen into disrepair. Those that haven\u2019t have been subdivided into small apartments for Middletown\u2019s poorest residents. A street that was once the pride of Middletown is now a notorious spot for druggies and dealers. Main Street is now the place you avoid after dark.</p> <h2><strong>The white working class had grown angry. And it had no heroes</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>City leaders have tried in vain to revive Middle-town\u2019s downtown, though in recent years they\u2019ve met with some limited success, as a few businesses have opened near the newest branch of a local community college. Despite some progress, efforts to reinvent downtown Middletown are likely futile. People didn\u2019t leave because our downtown lacked trendy cultural amenities. The trendy cultural amenities left because there weren\u2019t enough consumers in Middletown to support them. And why weren\u2019t there enough well-paying consumers? Because there weren\u2019t enough jobs to employ those consumers. Downtown Middletown\u2019s struggles were a symptom of everything else happening to Middletown\u2019s people, especially the collapsing importance of the local steel mill.</p> <p>Unfortunately, very few of America\u2019s political or financial classes understood what was happening in towns such as Middletown. And this ignorance comes in part from their increasing segregation from working- and middle-class families. In booming Washington DC, cosmopolitan New York and hi-tech San Francisco, people rarely come face to face with the poor, with the possible exception of the random beggar. Their interactions with the poor of rural and suburban America are rarer still. Meanwhile, as a 2011 Brookings Institute study found, \u201ccompared to 2000, residents of extreme-poverty neighbourhoods in 2005\u20132009 were more likely to be white, native-born, high-school or college graduates, homeowners and not receiving public assistance\u201d. The white poor always existed, but they were rapidly growing in numbers and America\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful residents seemed unaware.</p> <p>Indeed, if they deigned to care much about the white working class, they often expressed little more than condescension or outright disdain. As my grandma once told me, \u201chillbillies\u201d \u2013 by which she meant poor whites with some connection to Appalachia \u2013 were the only group of people that elites felt comfortable stereotyping and looking down upon. From MTV\u2019s chronicle of a \u201cwild\u201d white family in West Virginia to <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/tv/article44150238.html\" title=\"\"><em>Justified</em></a>, a popular show about eastern Kentucky, the media\u2019s interest in the region seemed confined to entertaining caricature.</p> <p>The political system\u2019s response was even worse. While candidate Obama in 2007 secretly chastised poor whites for \u201cclinging to their guns and religion,\u201d the Republican party, where most white, working-class Americans made a political home, seemed completely unaware that its own base was struggling. In 2012, Mitt Romney ran on a platform that celebrated the noble business owner, even as polls showed that the white working class increasingly mistrusted the business owners perceived to push them from their work.</p> <p>And in late 2015, the party appeared ready to crown <a href=\"https://jeb2016.com\" title=\"\">Jeb Bush</a>, the scion of a wealthy family whose policy programme differed little from Mitt Romney\u2019s, even as his tone did. This was the brother of a man who started two unsuccessful wars, wars whose burden was disproportionately shouldered by the white middle and working class. And though a number of putative challengers offered stylistic contrasts with the younger Bush brother, no one challenged the core premise at the heart of his candidacy: tax cuts and deregulation at home combined with an active, military-focused foreign policy abroad. Just eight years after George W Bush left office to historically low approval numbers, the party appeared primed to double down on Bush, both in policy and in genetics. And no one seemed that interested in stopping it.</p> <p>Except for Donald Trump.</p> <p>In a now famous September debate among Republican presidential candidates, Jeb offered a robust defence of his brother\u2019s foreign policy: \u201cAs it relates to my brother, there\u2019s one thing I know for sure: he kept us safe.\u201d In interviews after the debate and on social media, Trump filleted Bush repeatedly, noting the failures of the war and even blaming Bush for his failure to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was the third rail of Republican politics and television commentators predicated that it was the end of Trump\u2019s candidacy. How, many asked, could Trump survive such an aggressive criticism of the party\u2019s most recent president? Instead, Trump thrived, building on his lead in the polls and cruising to the Republican nomination.</p> <p>What so many commentators failed to understand was that the Republican party of George W Bush had changed. In the eight years since Obama\u2019s election, the white working class had grown angry: at the economy that failed to deliver good jobs, at the failed prosecution of two wars, at a government bureaucracy that failed to deliver good healthcare for veterans, at policy-makers who bailed out megabanks in the 2008 financial crisis even as many Americans lost their homes. The party didn\u2019t want another Mitt Romney and it sure as hell didn\u2019t want another Bush. It wanted, most of all, a man whose very existence is the opposite of everything prior nominees stood for.</p> <p>This was about more than finances and the macroeconomy problem. As a culture, working-class white Americans like myself had no heroes. We loved the military but had no George S Patton figure in the modern army. I doubt my neighbours could even name a high-ranking military officer. The space programme, long a source of pride, had gone the way of the dodo and with it the celebrity astronauts. We had lost any trust in the media as guardians of truth and consequently many were willing to believe all manner of conspiracies about our allegedly foreign-born president and his supposed grabs for power.</p> <h2><strong>In style and tone Trump reminds blue-collar workers of themselves</strong></h2> <p>To understand the significance of this cultural detachment, you must appreciate that much of my family\u2019s, my neighbourhood\u2019s and my community\u2019s identity derives from our love of country. I once interviewed my grandma for a class project about the Second World War. After 70 years filled with marriage, children, grandchildren, death, poverty and triumph, the thing about which she was unquestionably the proudest and most excited was that she and her family did their part during the war.</p> <p>We spoke for minutes about everything else; we spoke for hours about war rations, <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/rosie-the-riveter-95-real-life-inspiration-iconic-poster\" title=\"\">Rosie the Riveter</a>, her dad\u2019s wartime love letters to her mother from the Pacific and the day \u201cwe dropped the bomb\u201d. My grandma always had two gods: Jesus Christ and the United States of America. I was no different and neither was anyone else I knew.</p> <p>Many in the US and abroad marvel that a showy billionaire could inspire such allegiance among relatively poor voters. Yet in style and tone, Trump reminds blue-collar workers of themselves. Gone are the poll-tested and consultant-approved political lines, replaced with a backslapping swashbuckler unafraid of saying what\u2019s on his mind. The elites of DC and NY see an offensive madman, blowing through decades of political convention with his every word. His voters, on the other hand, see a man who\u2019s refreshingly relatable, who talks about politics and policy as if he were sitting around the dinner table.</p> <p>More important is Trump\u2019s message. Implicit in the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a belief that one\u2019s country is not especially great right now and that\u2019s certainly how many of Middletown\u2019s residents felt. In the wake of the Great Recession, there was something almost spiritual about the cynicism of the community at large. If America was the lynchpin of a civic faith, then many in the white working class were losing something like a religion.</p> <p>In America, commentators have devoted dozens of essays and think pieces to the question of whether Trump\u2019s rise is primarily a function of economic insecurity or racial anxiety. The question is easy to answer \u2013 it\u2019s both \u2013 and yet not especially helpful. Donald Trump isn\u2019t just the candidate of economically dispossessed whites, though he is that. Nor is he just the candidate of racially anxious whites, though he is also that.</p> <p>He\u2019s the candidate of the man who opens his morning paper to find that another of his neighbours has died of a heroin overdose; of the woman who proudly sent her son to fight in Iraq only to watch it break his body and mind; of the father who spends hours on the phone with the Department of Veterans Affairs, begging for medical care that his former Marine nephew is owed both legally and morally; of the proud coal miner who voted for Bill Clinton and then watched as his wife promised to \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\u201d. Donald Trump is the candidate of a patriotic people who feel an almost apocalyptic apprehension about the future. His great insight was to recognise and exploit that apprehension.</p> <p>The tragedy of Trump\u2019s candidacy is that, embedded in his furious exhortations against Muslims and Mexicans and trade deals gone awry is a message that America\u2019s white poor don\u2019t need: that everything wrong in your life is someone else\u2019s fault. No one doubts that globalisation and automation have disproportionately had an impact on the white working class and no responsible politics should fail to appreciate and address that fact. Yet our neighbourhoods and our communities create certain pressures and instil certain values that make it harder for our children to lead happy lives.</p> <h2><strong>Trump\u2019s entire candidacy consists of pointing the finger at someone else</strong><br><br></h2> <p>During my junior year of high school, our neighbour Pattie called her landlord to report a leaky roof. The landlord arrived and found Pattie topless, stoned and unconscious on her living-room couch. Upstairs, the bathtub was overflowing, thus the leaking roof. Pattie had apparently drawn herself a bath, taken a few prescription painkillers and passed out. The top floor of her home and many of her family\u2019s possessions were ruined. This is the reality of our community. It\u2019s not just about hard-working people dispossessed by globalisation, though that\u2019s undoubtedly true for many people. It\u2019s also about a naked druggie destroying what little of value exists in her life. It\u2019s about children who lose their toys and clothes to a mother\u2019s addiction. It\u2019s about families torn apart by domestic violence and students afraid to go home when the school bell rings at the end of the day.</p> <p>Psychologists call it \u201clearned helplessness\u201d when a person believes, as I did during my youth, that their choices have no effect on their life\u2019s outcomes. We acquired that sense of helplessness from a number of sources: from families who felt that you had to pretend to be \u201cblack or liberal\u201d to get into an Ivy League school; from the home life that showed us the world could be turned upside down in an instant; from seeing so few of our neighbours succeed in the modern economy that we wondered whether success was even possible for those like us.</p> <p>To recognise that these neighbourhoods and attitudes affect us is not to place moral blame on the poor. Indeed, many of the obstacles folks like me perceive are quite real. But it is dangerous, even destructive, to give up completely on the role of agency. The white working class must build a set of values that recognises life\u2019s unfairness while constructively engaging with it \u2013 in our community institutions, in our government and in our families. Yet Trump\u2019s message for the white voter so desperately in need of introspection and self-reflection is: it\u2019s all someone else\u2019s fault. His rallies may be cathartic, as he screams and yells at conjured enemies, but he offers no solutions. His entire candidacy is an exercise in pointing the finger at someone else.</p> <p>In pointing that finger so repeatedly and enthusiastically, Donald Trump has debased our entire political culture. On the right, the party of robust American global leadership now finds itself apologising for a man who apologises for Vladimir Putin even as he scares our staunchest European allies.</p> <p>The Republican speaker of the house, a brilliant, respected leader, regularly repudiates some noxious statement of Trump\u2019s even as he cannot politically repudiate the man himself. On the left, the cosmopolitan elites of the Democratic party have taken to Facebook and Twitter to denounce half of their fellow citizens, people they rarely see, much less know. In the eyes of American elites, Trump\u2019s voters are racist rednecks, finally reaping what they\u2019ve sown.</p> <p>In this age of Trump, each tribe has lost the ability to show even a hint of compassion for the other side.</p> <p>The great irony is that the people who may make Trump president are among those who most need a constructive politics and an engaged leader. They need a life raft and a mirror. Trump instead offers a political high, a promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d without a single good idea regarding how.</p> <p>Hillbilly Elegy by JD Vance is published by William Collins on 22 September, \u00a316.99</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>European leaders will <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/institutional/134931\" title=\"\">meet in Bratislava</a> next Friday at an informal summit intended to map a new path for the EU in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave. Yet while the unwelcome outcome of June\u2019s referendum was a trigger for the talks, this review, or re-evaluation, of the European project is long overdue. Modern-day Europe faces enormous challenges not remotely envisaged by the EU\u2019s founding fathers when they signed the Treaty of Rome 60 years ago next year. A new consensus on how to address these shared problems, in principle and in practice, is urgently needed as the treaty anniversary approaches.</p> <p>Britain, unfortunately, will have little or no say over what happens next. Theresa May is not invited to Bratislava. The summit will take place without her. The government is not being asked for it views on the crucial issues confronting Europe and, if it chooses to air them, it is increasingly likely, as time goes by, that it will be ignored. The EU wants only one thing from Britain right now, as Donald Tusk, the European council president,<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/08/donald-tusk-tells-theresa-may-the-ball-is-in-your-court-as-he-ur/\" title=\"\"> reminded May last week</a>: a firm date for starting exit negotiations. And this, unfortunately again, May is unwilling or unable to give them. To pretend the outcome of Bratislava and ensuing discussions will not have a big impact on British interests is to perpetuate the wilful blindness that led to the calamitous Brexit vote. A major struggle, years in the making, is coming to a head. It pits the \u201cold\u201d liberal, open-markets, open-borders EU, led by Germany, France and Italy, against the \u201cnew\u201d, conservative, nationalist EU, states such as <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/visegrad-group-to-table-proposals-at-bratislava-summit/\" title=\"\">Poland, Hungary and Slovakia</a> that are more recent entrants. At issue is the future of the EU\u2019s so-called four freedoms \u2013 the free movement of labour, goods, services and capital.</p> <p>Claiming to be responding to public concerns about immigration, Islamist terrorism, economic security and the erosion of cultural traditions, the Poles and their allies in the <a href=\"http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about\" title=\"\">Visegr\u00e1d</a> group are resisting the migrant quota system championed by Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. They want greater autonomy for national parliaments, more oversight of transnational corporations and investment, the scrapping of plans for visa-free EU travel for Turks, and greater recognition of what Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s rightwing prime minister, calls \u201chistoric, religious and national identity\u201d.</p> <p>These objectives are shared by advancing, populist and nationalist movements across western Europe, too, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\" title=\"\">humiliated Merkel</a> in elections in her home state last week. And if this agenda sounds familiar, it is. It echoes many of the positions adopted by Leave campaigners and their Ukip allies. How all these issues are tackled really matters for Britain. The irony is, if they had not cut and run, the views espoused by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson would have had much more influence in reshaping Europe\u2019s aims and priorities at this moment. As it is, they, and Britain, have no say.</p> <p>The Bratislava 27 face other tests. One is what to do about the eurozone\u2019s problems, mushrooming national deficits and the widening gap between the wealthier north and poorer south. Yet it is foolish to separate broader, pan-European post-crash worries, such as high youth unemployment and reduced foreign investment, from problems in the global economy, such as lower demand in China. Britain shares these problems. And it continues to have a strong interest in a prosperous, thriving European trading bloc of 500 million consumers, purchasers of 44% of UK exports in 2014. But in this area, too, Britain will have no voice and no say.</p> <p>Agreeing on the need to reform and revive the EU, Bratislava will consider a range of other proposals, including more rather than less integration and, for example, strengthening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/european-union-plans-military-battlegroups-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">EU defence and security policy</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move forward to a European defence union, which is basically a \u2018Schengen of defence\u2019,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/german-minister-in-lithuania-backs-european-defence-union/\" title=\"\">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, the German defence minister, while visiting Lithuania last week. Such statements of intent must ring alarm bells in Whitehall. As the EU\u2019s heaviest hitter on defence, Britain habitually took the lead, prioritising Nato and pouring cold water on previous, often French-inspired EU co-operation initiatives. But soon, London will have no say at all.</p> <p>What price now the Brexiters\u2019 repeated assurances that breaking with the EU would not undermine Nato and Britain\u2019s defences? How will this dismaying abdication of responsibility play with Washington?

They\u2019re what I call the deplorables. The racists and the haters and the people who are drawn because they think he can somehow restore an America that no longer exists.\u201d The Democratic nominee went on to suggest these voters represented \u201cthe paranoiac prejudicial element within our politics\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/donald-trump-calls-clinton-unstable-putin-relationship-russia-florida-pensacola\">Donald Trump labels Clinton 'unstable' as he edges away from Putin relationship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton insisted that the \u201cother basket of people\u201d consisted simply of those \u201cwho feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they\u2019re just desperate for change. It doesn\u2019t really even matter where it comes from.\u201d She added that these Trump supporters \u201cdon\u2019t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different.\u201c</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has repeatedly played dogwhistle politics with far-right elements, including the so-called Alt Right, a fringe internet movement with close links to a website run by Trump\u2019s newly hired campaign CEO, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/steve-bannon-profile-breitbart-trump-campaign-manager\">Steve Bannon</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Republican nominee came to political prominence in 2011 by repeatedly suggesting without any evidence that Barack Obama was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-birth-certificate-released\">born in Kenya </a>and launched his campaign by suggesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">Mexico was deliberately sending rapists</a> into the US. This has long been fodder for attack for Clinton who, in an August speech in Reno, Nevada, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada\">railed against Trump</a> as \u201ca man with a long history of racial discrimination\u201d.</p> <p>However, Clinton had never tried to tie Trump\u2019s voters to the Republican nominee, insisting in the Reno speech \u201cthis is not conservatism as we have known it. This is not Republicanism as we have known it.\u201d Instead, she characterized Trump as the vanguard of a \u201cparanoid fringe\u201d which had taken control of the Republican party.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee\u2019s remarks seem to suggest a shift from that tone of conciliation towards Republicans and her attempt to paint Trump as an outlier with her suggestion that half of the GOP nominee\u2019s supporters were consumed entirely by the politics of racial grievance. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s travelling press secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickMerrill\">stood by her statements,</a> noting on Twitter \u201cObviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt right, but alt right leaders are with Trump\u201d, and: \u201cTheir supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.\u201d </p> <p>In a statement, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, attacked Clinton\u2019s approach. \u201cJust when Hillary Clinton said she was going to start running a positive campaign, she ripped off her mask and revealed her true contempt for everyday Americans,\u201d said Miller.</p>",

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>During the winter of early 2014 Jones\u2019s only chance for serenity was these late hours. The CIA was demanding his boss, Senate intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, fire him. Feinstein\u2019s Republican colleagues, once supportive of Jones, were demanding he testify.</p> <p>Testimony was treacherous. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island senator and former federal prosecutor, warned Jones that asserting his rights against self-incrimination or seeking a lawyer\u2019s counsel could give committee Republicans a political lever against his highly controversial work. The CIA would soon formally insist that the US justice department actually prosecute Jones, the Senate staffer who had devoted over six years of his life to investigating the CIA\u2019s infamous post-9/11 torture program.<br></p> <p>Jones, a former FBI counter-terrorism analyst, wanted to testify. The CIA had pushed him past the point where he could back down. Its lies, documented in a 6,700-page secret report which Jones was constantly rewriting that winter, were compounding: to Congress, to Barack Obama, to George W Bush, to the press, to the public. The lies were not random misstatements. They were directional, in the service of covering up the brutality of what it did to at least 119 terrorist suspects \u2013 some clearly innocent \u2013 it held in a global network of secret prisons. Jones was on the verge of exposing the coverup. As he saw it, the personalized intensity of the CIA\u2019s attacks on him, and the unprecedented steps they were taking, validated the account he had compiled after combing through over 6m classified CIA documents. </p> <p>Jones put his Bose earbuds in, cued up a Tragically Hip record, and ran. </p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be that long of a lap, just enough to clear his head and work the frustrations out. Jones would need to be back in the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s secured, classified offices very soon. Each day brought a new calculation: it might be the last that the committee had access to its own classified report. The CIA had gone \u201cinto war mode\u201d with its congressional overseers, Jones told the Guardian. There was no choice but to work deeply into the night, leaving Capitol Hill at 3 or 4 in the morning, with breaks only for a run, and then back to work by 8 or 9 to repeat the cycle.</p> <p>Less than a year had passed since the CIA had communicated to the Senate that its exhaustive torture report, drawn from millions of the agency\u2019s own documents, was significantly incorrect. Less than a year had passed since Jones, unbeknownst to the CIA, had locked in a committee safe crucial portions of one such record, called the Panetta Review, in which the CIA had come to the same conclusions about torture as Jones had. But now the agency was letting the committee know it was not playing around \u2013 and that it was coming for Jones himself. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>From August to September 2013 Jones had more than a dozen meetings with agency officials lasting 60 hours to attempt to reconcile their objections with findings in his 6,700-page classified report. It got to the point where Jones would take a whiteboard with him. That way, he could sketch out the timelines he found in CIA cables for when the agency learned specific aspects of its terrorism intelligence. He attempted to demonstrate contradictions from what the CIA said publicly \u2013 and how the claimed basis for those CIA statements occurred before this-or-that torture session the agency said was the genesis of the information. </p> <p>\u201cIt should be noted that at no point in those discussions did [Senate] staff ask CIA to reconcile the CIA June 2013 response to the Panetta Review,\u201d said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani. \u201cIn fact, at no time in those discussions did [committee] staff indicate that they had a copy of the Panetta Review.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

Feinstein was concerned Jones was too close to the report to be objective, but she backed his decision. With the report stuck in limbo, she gave him a new challenge: redo the report, incorporating aspects of the CIA\u2019s response, and putting what they found to be wrong about that response in the footnotes.<br></p> <p>\u201cBasically, her thing was: make them own their response,\u201d Jones said. The effect was to expand a 250-page executive summary to over 500 pages, \u201cdoubling the amount of information\u201d, all as the CIA continued to object. The agency and the committee were arraying for battle.</p> <p>Just before Thanksgiving, Feinstein formally wrote to CIA director John Brennan requesting the entire 1,000-plus page Panetta Review. Jones had not taken the full document back from the satellite location, only the sections necessary to show busy senators that the agency concluded it had misled its political masters about the futility of its torture. The CIA said it would not provide it. This time, it would be Feinstein\u2019s allies on the committee who escalated.</p> <p>On 17 December, the CIA sent its choice for its next top attorney, Caroline Krass, to the committee for a nomination hearing. Shortly before the hearing, a CIA attorney, Darrin Hostetler, met with Jones in private, once again sparring over the agency\u2019s response. Once again, Jones reminded Hostetler that the Panetta Review supported his conclusions. \u201cI\u2019m done talking to you, Dan,\u201d Hostetler said, ending the meeting. An agency official who worked with Jones at the satellite location apologized to Jones for Hostetler\u2019s behavior.<br></p> <p>During the hearing, Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, lit into Krass. Unexpectedly, Udall mentioned the existence of the Panetta Review in public for the first time, demanding the disclosure of the document. Among the reasons for Udall\u2019s fervor: in August 2013, after the CIA had condemned the committee report in contradiction of the Panetta Review, its former chief lawyer Stephen Preston told Udall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/799469-qfr-udall-preston-8-09-13-responses.html\">in writing</a> that the agency provided the committee with \u201cinaccurate information related to aspects of the [torture] program\u201d \u2013 a major point the CIA was now disputing.<br> </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3ut21ksJ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qk3ut21ksJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Jones was <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?316835-1/senate-intelligence-cmte-considers-cia-state-nominees\">visible on the staff dias behind Udall</a>. Hostetler walked out of the hearing. </p> <p>\u201cThen things totally went to hell,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Unbeknownst to Jones, Udall or Feinstein, the public reference to the Panetta Review so alarmed the CIA as to prompt a milestone event in its history. Since 2009, the CIA had maintained a firewalled network on which the Senate could view internal documents relevant to its torture inquiry. It was known as RDINet, for \u201crendition, detention and interrogation.\u201d By mutual agreement, the CIA was not supposed to access the Senate\u2019s side of the network for any reason aside from picayune IT help. But at least five agency officials would surreptitiously transgress the network firewalls, view the Senate investigators\u2019 work, and reconstruct Jones\u2019s emails. Their rationale, established in a subsequent internal investigation, was to determine if the Senate deliberately exploited an evident flaw in the architecture of the network to digitally acquire the Panetta Review \u2013 which they did not want the Senate to have.</p> <p>It was an extreme step. After Congress overhauled the CIA in the 1970s, the agency was not supposed to spy on Americans domestically except in extremely circumscribed circumstances. Now it was turning its spywork onto the elected officials tasked with overseeing it.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The CIA had gone into war mode</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery officer is clearly, I would say rigorously, trained that CIA is a foreign intelligence service. We have a legal mandate to conduct intelligence operations on non-American entities ... It\u2019s very clear, the distinction, and then elaborate, the working out of what may and may not be done,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer.</p> <p>Carle continued: \u201cFor the agency to<strong> </strong>penetrate a firewalled network used by the United States Senate is flat criminal activity. There\u2019s no discussion about it. I\u2019m literally laughing. You can\u2019t rationalize that.\u201d</p> <p>Oregon Democratic senator Ron Wyden flatly called it \u201cspying on our staff\u201d. The CIA vigorously disputes that characterization. CIA director Brennan, whom Carle praises as an \u201chonorable guy\u201d, was informed about the firewall breach almost as soon as the agency began its fateful operations. </p> <p>Beginning on 9 January 2014, agency officials created a \u201cdummy account\u201d that looked to the network like it came from Jones\u2019s team, something beyond the limits of the 2009 agreements between the committee and the CIA about network access. They logged in, searched for the Panetta Review on the Senate side of the network and found it. The next day, they searched their own side to determine if they had the Panetta Review. They didn\u2019t find it, presumed they might have been hacked, and set to find out what happened. They took screenshots of what they found. Yet never once did they discuss their findings with Jones, whose technical ineptitude might have disabused them of the theory that he had either deliberately hacked a classified network or been savvy enough to exploit a vulnerability.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1b0b329a698f3da2a602d8fca479d11c5bc219d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0b329a698f3da2a602d8fca479d11c5bc219d5/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>CIA headquarters at Langley. 9 January 2014</h2> <p>According to a subsequent inspector-general report, an unnamed CIA official \u2013 whom <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-google-search-that-made-the-cia-spy-on-the-us-senate\">Vice News\u2019s Jason Leopold has reported is Hostetler</a> \u2013 got the agency\u2019s Counterintelligence Center involved on 9 January by saying there was a \u201cforthcoming D/CIA tasking\u201d, a reference to Brennan. The unnamed official said Brennan wanted a report by \u201cthat afternoon\u201d into Senate use of the network, stretching from 1 March 2009 to 31 December 2013. The CIA inspector general, David Buckley, would later find that \u201cconflicting information\u201d prevented him from determining \u201cwhether any of D/CIA Brennan\u2019s senior staff, much less the DCI himself, approved any of the taskings.\u201d But an agency attorney, unusually, gave an operational order. </p> <p>Brennan learned at least the outline of what would become the breach on 9 January, the very first day it was conceived. The director would later say he knew then of some review, but did not specifically recall if anyone briefing him explained how they knew the location of, among other documents, the Panetta Review. Brennan discussed the issue with CIA personnel over the next two days, and tasked them to \u201cuse whatever means necessary\u201d to find out how it was that the documents appeared on the Senate side of the firewall. Brennan said he only asked \u201care we sure\u201d the documents were genuine CIA material and that he desired a better understanding of how RDINet worked. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[The CIA] was turning its spywork onto the elected officials tasked with overseeing it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Brennan would later say he denied directing anyone at the CIA to examine the Senate\u2019s use of the system, the technical staff, examined and passed around screenshots of what was on the Senate network drives. By 11 January \u2013 a Saturday \u2013 the CIA official Vice identified as Hostetler spoke with Brennan and learned Brennan had discussed the issue with Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff and a powerful ally. The official would later say he believed himself authorized by Brennan \u201cto gather the necessary agency personnel and components who would normally be involved in such an effort\u201d.</p> <p>Hostetler, through a representative, declined to speak with the Guardian. Nor did the White House make McDonough available for an interview. But an official said: \u201cNeither Denis McDonough nor anyone else at the White House was notified of the searches before they began. As such, and to be sure, the White House did not authorize them.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, 13 January, a meeting gathered, chaired by the third-highest ranking official at CIA, Meroe Park, and attended by Counterintelligence Center personnel. Their concern was determining if there was an \u201cinnocent\u201d or nefarious explanation for the Senate\u2019s acquisition of the Panetta Review, something Brennan would need to know. The meeting heard how it would be possible to perform an operation to find out, one that would involve intrusive digital forensics on their Senate overseers. An attendee would later say no one in attendance objected. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0d2bcfd91db88d7924a1900732a9144bea6d3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0d2bcfd91db88d7924a1900732a9144bea6d3c/231_750_848_453/500.jpg\" alt=\"From a report released by the CIA inspector general in July 2014\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>Brennan learned of this discussion the next day, 14 January. Multiple official accounts have Brennan essentially alarmed to hear that senior counterintelligence officials were involved in what could easily be understood as spying on the Senate. Brennan indicated a concern that the optics of the situation were perilous for the CIA. He ordered the work stopped \u2013 what he would tell the inspector general was a \u201cstand down\u201d order. The official Vice reported is Hostetler characterized it merely as a \u201cpause\u201d.<br></p> <p>On 15 January 2014, Brennan called an emergency discussion with Feinstein and top committee Republican Saxby Chambliss. They met in a secured room on the Hill. Brennan had brought the acting top CIA lawyer, Robert Eatinger, whom Jones had discovered had provided legal advice to the agency\u2019s Counterterrorist Center, which was deeply involved in the torture. If Brennan was worried, he did not convey that to the senators. </p> <p>Brennan read a statement. He revealed that the agency had conducted a \u201csearch\u201d of the computer network it had set up for the Senate \u2013 unlike every previous investigation at the agency, the CIA had demanded it only produce documentation on torture at a facility it controlled \u2013 and discovered that the Senate investigators had inappropriate access to the Panetta Review. The staffers, he said, had to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d. A CIA network, Brennan was implying, had been compromised. (The CIA would not comment on this meeting, but pointed to <a href=\"http://images.politico.com/global/2014/03/11/brennanltrrereview.pdf\">a 27 January letter from Brennan to Feinstein</a> to characterize it.)</p> <p>Jones understood Brennan\u2019s statement to be a demand for the senators to fire him. Brennan didn\u2019t use his name, but Jones was the chief investigator, the one constantly and most consistently working at the CIA facility. On multiple levels, Jones was shocked. Not only was the director of the CIA telling his legislative overseers that their choice to conduct oversight was unacceptable, he was revealing that the network operated in a manner that the Senate thought \u201cwas impossible\u201d, with the CIA able to access the Senate\u2019s investigative work. </p> <p>Even more startling: although someone at the CIA in 2010 had placed the Panetta Review on the Senate side of the network, Brennan was suggesting that Jones was a master hacker, able to force his way into the CIA\u2019s classified files. In truth, Jones was barely tech-literate: \u201cI am really good at Microsoft Word. That\u2019s it.\u201d </p> <p>But Brennan wasn\u2019t describing the basis for believing his claims. Instead, he told Chambliss and Feinstein the search would not be the CIA\u2019s last. To protect the security of an agency network, Brennan said, the agency would need to conduct more searches, ostensibly to find whatever vulnerability he implied Jones had exploited, and proposed a joint search with Senate assistance. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d31105e43837eec3c79dff16b0a4cf33a65a841e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31105e43837eec3c79dff16b0a4cf33a65a841e/0_107_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CIA director John Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Feinstein, in a letter sent two days later, refused. She requested that Brennan not conduct the searches, offering to suspend staff access to the network, and reminded him of the \u201cseparation of powers issues\u201d at stake in the CIA taking such an aggressive step against the Senate. </p> <p>But despite both Feinstein\u2019s refusal and Brennan\u2019s \u201cstand down\u201d order, the CIA continued looking deeper into the Senate\u2019s use of the network. </p> <p>On 16 January, according to CIA documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/274285608/Senate-Docs-Syp-Wm#from_embed\">by Vice News\u2019s Leopold</a>, the agency called upon a digital unit called the Cyber Blue Team, which hunts for vulnerabilities in agency networks. The next day \u2013 the day Feinstein put her refusal to join an inquiry into her staff in writing to Brennan \u2013 Cyber Blue Team reviewed \u201cforensically reconstructed emails\u201d between Senate staffers only accessible on their side of RDINet. The team prepared a report that same day assessing the Senate use of the network, delivering it to \u201csenior agency leadership\u201d on 21 January. </p> <p>Jones had been able to convince Senate Republicans naturally inclined to believe the CIA that his meager tech skills undermined Brennan\u2019s accusation. But that could hardly win them over in what they were seeing as a battle between the CIA and Senate Democrats. Combative, Jones was prepared to testify about the episode. But while he had no family and little to lose, several of his colleagues on the investigative staff had spouses, children and career ambitions. They would be the casualties of escalation. He opted against testimony. The option would ultimately be overtaken by events. </p> <p>The CIA\u2019s move against the Senate committee quickly showed signs of backfiring. In late January, Buckley, the CIA\u2019s inspector general, confronted Brennan about the on-network searches of the Senate investigators. He told Brennan that he needed to open an investigation \u2013 and Brennan responded by ordering Buckley to investigate. But Buckley went further than Brennan apparently calculated, and referred the matter to the US justice department. Suddenly, the CIA was back in a position its leaders thought it had escaped \u2013 in the crosshairs of potential prosecution.</p> <p>Buckley \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 told the committee of his referral on 4 February, only a week after he started examine the breach. It <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/us/new-inquiry-into-cia-employees-amid-clashes-over-interrogation-program.html\">leaked to the New York Times</a> on 4 March.</p> <p>Agency attorney Eatinger launched what the CIA considered a response necessitated by a theft concern and the committee considered a counter-gambit. On 7 February, the senior lawyer made his own criminal referral to the justice department: this one on Jones, ostensibly for improper network access. Eatinger had a conflict: Jones\u2019s narrative referred to his role in the torture program 1,600 times. It took mere weeks for an account of Senate staff taking the Panetta Review from the CIA offsite location to <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article24764827.html\">leak to reporters</a>. To Jones, the whole thing validated the apocryphal credo of spywork: deny everything, admit nothing, make counter-accusations.</p> <p>Everything had escalated past the point of no return. Jones had finished his edits and rewrites to the committee report. It awaited a Senate vote on declassification. But now all of that was overshadowed by a fight with the CIA that had moved into the realm of back and forth criminal accusation. </p> <p>Jones thought the accusation was self-evidently absurd, enough to discredit the agency as engaged in bald-faced retaliation and wounding itself politically. \u201cI was wrong about that. It was actually pretty astute of them,\u201d he recollected.</p> <p>Efforts at de-escalation failed. In mid-January, within days of the network search, Brennan briefed the Senate majority leader, Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. Reid, who is close to Feinstein, told him that in the interests of avoiding a crisis, Brennan ought to apologize. Brennan flatly refused, insisting the agency had nothing to apologize for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70a557fee2a6c73b5805f1d1585c08814f22ac9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70a557fee2a6c73b5805f1d1585c08814f22ac9b/0_327_3899_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Harry Reid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, attempted to contain the damage. Ruemmler came to the Hill that winter, in a series of meetings with both the full committee and its leadership, to take the temperature of Senate-CIA relations down from their white-hot level. According to participants in those meetings, if Brennan was unyielding, Ruemmler was balanced. Feinstein brought up the 2010 document disappearance as a prologue for the current imbroglio. Ruemmler told her she had a valid point. </p> <p>Reid, a pivotal ally for the White House on Capitol Hill, did not want to be backed into a corner. After the criminal referral, Reid spoke to McDonough and conveyed that if Brennan was unwilling to apologize, he was not willing to defend Brennan should the episode become public. McDonough was noncommittal. A week later, Reid received a phone call from Barack Obama.<br></p> <p>To Reid\u2019s surprise, the president defended the CIA\u2019s actions. Obama rattled off the CIA\u2019s side of the story: the Senate staff had taken CIA documents and the agency had no choice but to handle the matter as it did. </p> <p>\u201cMr President,\u201d Reid said, \u201cI wish you could hear yourself.\u201d</p> <p>According to a former senior Senate aide, the episode stiffened Reid\u2019s inclination to defend Feinstein to the hilt. In early March, Reid contacted Feinstein, who was considering exposing the episode, and assured her of his full support in the battle to come. \u201cWe gave them ample opportunity\u201d to settle the issue, he told her. </p> <p>On 11 March, Jones got word that Feinstein was going to say something on the Senate floor. He had written her a speech detailing the origins and developments of the oversight battle with Langley, but he didn\u2019t know if Feinstein would actually deliver it. Feinstein got along well with Brennan on other matters, and taking on Brennan carried the risk of taking on Obama, the president Brennan had cultivated since Obama\u2019s first campaign. </p> <p>Instead, Feinstein laid into the CIA with an intensity unseen since the 1970s Church Committee, where legislators described an unbridled agency that spied on Americans as eagerly as they spied on foreign adversaries. The agency searches \u201cmay have undermined the constitutional framework essential to effective congressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other government function,\u201d Feinstein charged. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/09/dianne-feinstein-cia-torture-report-stain-americas-value-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4439j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2206945\"            data-video-name=\"Dianne Feinstein on CIA torture report: 'A stain on America's values' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418145193706/Dianne-Feinstein-015.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453298225\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418145193706/Dianne-Feinstein-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/09/dianne-feinstein-cia-torture-report-stain-americas-value-video\">Dianne Feinstein on CIA torture report: \u2018A stain on America\u2019s values\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She foreshadowed the next fight within the committee and wrapped it in the constitution: declassifying the torture report. Not only would a public version ensure torture \u201cwill never again be considered or permitted\u201d, Feinstein said, but the CIA\u2019s reprisal against Jones meant the Senate faced a \u201cdefining moment\u201d testing whether the committee could effectively perform its oversight, \u201cor whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee\u201d.</p> <p>Feinstein\u2019s speech occurred hours before Brennan had committed to a public appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations. Moderator Andrea Mitchell could not refrain from soliciting a response to Feinstein. To the incredulity of Jones, Brennan, who had been at the very least briefed on all of this from inception \u2013 who had told Feinstein and Chambliss on 15 January it had happened \u2013 denied everything. </p> <p>\u201cAs far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, that\u2019s just beyond the \u2013 you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do,\u201d Brennan said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr President, I wish you could hear yourself</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Harry Reid</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The years of clashing with the CIA behind closed doors had now exploded into public view. The CIA contacted reporters to provide the agency\u2019s preferred version of events, and observers took a scalpel to distinctions between searching and hacking. The implications of Feinstein\u2019s charges were profound. If the CIA would lie about torture, what else would it lie about? If it would spy on its legislative overseers, who wouldn\u2019t the agency spy on? </p> <p>Shocked by Brennan\u2019s denial, Reid had the Senate sergeant-at-arms conduct his own investigation. Reid wrote to the attorney general, Eric Holder, on 19 March to take into account the \u201cserious separation of powers implications\u201d of the CIA\u2019s search, which he said \u201cseemingly attempted to intimidate [the agency\u2019s] overseers\u201d.</p> <p>The sergeant-at-arms inquiry has been a forgotten aspect of the saga. One knowledgeable source said it ended up inconclusive. CIA\u2019s Trapani noted: \u201cDespite pledges of an investigation by the Senate sergeant-at-arms, there is no corresponding public record that sheds light on or explains fully the actions of [committee] staff.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Feinstein\u2019s speech had another impact, this one intentional. On 3 April, the committee voted 11-3 to authorize a declassified version of the torture report. Senate Republicans who had long rejected the report\u2019s findings joined Democrats who embraced them. Even Chambliss voted in favor of declassification, saying : \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/senate-votes-declassify-cia-torture-report\">We need to get this behind us</a>.\u201d </p> <p>Yet the CIA had an ally Feinstein may not have appreciated: the Oval Office. The White House announced that same day that the CIA itself would lead the declassification review. Formally, a White House official told the Guardian, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spearheaded it. The intelligence community would effectively choose which of its embarrassments to spare the public from learning. </p> <p>Carl Levin, a longtime Democratic senator from Michigan who retired in 2015, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the White House\u2019s overall lack of support for the committee.</p> <p>\u201cThe White House declined to lead the declassification effort, and instead gave the declassification review to the very agency, the CIA, that the Senate committee was investigating,\u201d Levin told the Guardian.</p> <p>Brennan\u2019s major ally at the White House was someone Jones knew well from a decade before. Chief of staff McDonough had encouraged Jones to join the security apparatus when Jones was an aspirant Senate staffer and McDonough was a Senate leadership aide. McDonough was one of Obama\u2019s closest confidants, with him on his Senate staff , through the presidential campaign and to his tenure as a deputy national security adviser. He assumed his current job right as Brennan, another White House senior staffer and campaign veteran, went to Langley. </p> <p>\u201cDenis played a much more central role in this than any of us thought he would,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe feeling was that he just backed CIA.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A criminal prosecution does not have to advance particularly far to ruin someone\u2019s life. The arcane provisions of Senate rules place senior staff in an exquisite financial bind. Such staff are banned from receiving gifts worth more than a pittance, as those gifts might be used to purchase influence. But included in that category is pro-bono legal assistance. </p> <p>While senators themselves can get legal aid if needed through campaign funding, they cannot themselves provide it to their staff. Feinstein and her predecessor as committee chair, Jay Rockefeller, set up a defense fund, according to a knowledgable source, but couldn\u2019t actually use it to protect aides facing legal jeopardy.</p> <p>Jones learned all of that when he had to seek legal representation. The cost of the retainer quoted to him made him wince: as a teacher, an FBI officer and a Senate staffer, \u201cI had not amassed a large amount of wealth.\u201d </p> <p>But Jones was single. He did not have children. The potential prosecution of his colleagues on the committee staff who did was having a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect. Emotionally, psychologically, the search scandal hung over everything they did, especially as they were about to do final battle with the CIA over declassification. The longer the process draws out, he said, \u201cyou can destroy someone financially.\u201d </p> <p>But on 30 April, less than a month after the committee voted to declassify the report\u2019s executive summary, the justice department sent word to the CIA attorney that it had \u201cno prosecutorial interest\u201d in pursuing a case against the Senate staffers. It would be the beginning of the Senate\u2019s vindication on this controversy. </p> <p>Jones took no victory lap. His pace was grueling, and they had not even begun the declassification discussions. The Republican senators were still musing about making him testify. The CIA-Senate fight loomed over every conversation with the White House, and in the committee. During that spring and summer, Brennan would still arrive on Capitol Hill to brief the senators on various intelligence matters. Substantive discussion would be consumed by legislators demanding more information about the various investigations around the search, and Brennan declining. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Brennan\u2019s position became untenable on 18 July. Buckley, the inspector general, concluded in a classified report that at least five CIA officials \u2013 including, conspicuously, two attorneys \u2013 \u201cimproperly accessed [committee] Majority staff shared drives on the RDINet\u201d. In an ironic echo of the torture report\u2019s findings that the CIA misled the government about its detainee abuse, Buckley called out a \u201clack of candor\u201d among the three technical staff he interviewed. And he found that Eatinger\u2019s prosecutorial referral from February was \u201cunfounded\u201d as it went beyond the findings that the Cyber Blue Team had reached about Senate behavior on RDINet. </p> <p>Although Buckley concluded that the committee and the CIA did not reach \u201csigned memorand[a] of understanding\u201d, his report attached several 2009-era CIA-Senate letters referring to consensus that the only CIA access to RDINet\u2019s committee side would come from IT staff \u201cfor IT maintenance and support\u201d. (\u201cI think we are all in agreement on the computer issue,\u201d an unnamed CIA official had written to the committee back on 8 June 2009.) One of those CIA documents was even called Memorandum of Understanding. It would be an issue in a skirmish to come. </p> <p>The CIA didn\u2019t want the committee staff to have access to Buckley\u2019s report, even in classified form, as it contained the names of agency officials and sensitive units implicated in the episode. But within days, Buckley conveyed his findings to committee senators. While Jones could not attend a members-only briefing, he quickly learned that senators were told, unequivocally, that he had done nothing wrong. </p> <p>\u201cAt that point, I felt significantly vindicated,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA\u2019s own inspector general found that CIA inappropriately searched the Senate\u2019s computers,\u201d said Levin, the former senator. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA and the White House held no one accountable for these actions.\u201d</p> <p>Feinstein had a conversation with Brennan shortly afterward. On 31 July, Feinstein put out a statement that included a devastating line: \u201cDirector Brennan apologized for these actions.\u201d It was less categorical than many on the committee wanted. Vice\u2019s Leopold would ultimately acquire and publish a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-google-search-that-made-the-cia-spy-on-the-us-senate\">letter from Brennan formally apologizing</a>, but the director never sent it, opting to apologize \u201cin person for the specific search that went beyond his instructions at the time,\u201d the CIA\u2019s Trapani said. But Feinstein got her desired result: <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-director-brennan-apologizes-senate-leaders-computer-hack-n169706\">headlines</a> around the world indicated Brennan had taken a step back. Udall immediately called on Brennan to resign. Speculation shot through Washington over whether he would.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe admitted that the CIA\u2019s actions were inappropriate, but he continues to deny that searching through a Senate committee\u2019s files and emails is spying on the committee. It\u2019s pretty bizarre when the CIA director doesn\u2019t seem to know what the word \u2018spying\u2019 means,\u201d said Wyden.</p> <p>Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat and former committee chairman, did not join Udall in calling for Brennan\u2019s resignation. But, he said, \u201cI did express my profound disappointment to Director Brennan on more than one occasion. My assessment at the time was that, despite Director Brennan having perhaps irreparably damaged his credibility with much of the committee, he was still capable of at least partially redeeming himself by holding people at the CIA accountable and publicly apologizing.\u201d There would be no such public apology.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The CIA and the White House held no one accountable for these actions</p> <footer> <cite>Former senator Carl Levin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barely half a year after the CIA had turned its powers against its overseers, the committee had won two consecutive victories. Chambliss, the panel\u2019s top Republican, called on the CIA to deal with the five offending officials \u201cvery harshly\u201d. But the fight was far from over. </p> <p>Brennan announced he would convene an \u201caccountability board\u201d to examine the network-search debacle. More crucially, the very next day, the CIA was set to deliver to the committee the version of the torture report it was comfortable with the public seeing, as Congress and the political world departed for the traditional August recess. If the committee had wanted to release that heavily blacked-out version, it could have done so, and avoided its next battle with the CIA \u2013 and the White House. </p> <p>Unlike in 2010, the White House would not mediate between the agency and the committee. It would simply back John Brennan.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Barack Obama, the president who ended the CIA\u2019s torture program by <a href=\"http:// https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations\">executive order</a> his second full day in office, entered the White House briefing room on 1 August 2014. \u201cWe tortured some folks,\u201d he memorably said. </p> <p>What Obama said afterward received less attention, but Jones can recount it to this day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job those folks [at the CIA] had,\u201d said the president. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e7fbb151cda21a6994e7f783379676d7cba52d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7fbb151cda21a6994e7f783379676d7cba52d98/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obama White House briefing August 1 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>White House briefing room. 1 August 2014</h2> <p>The proposed declassifications the CIA would deliver back to the committee reflected that sentiment and far more. It would be difficult for a reader to feel \u201csanctimonious\u201d about torture, as it would be difficult to understand what the CIA had actually done.<br></p> <p>When Jones had drafted the report over the years, he had not taken a hardline approach to transparency. The former FBI official deliberately obscured many things he considered reasonably outside the public\u2019s knowledge. No draft of the report had ever contained the true name of a CIA official involved in the program, nor the countries where the black sites were. All were given cover names, and not even the agency\u2019s official cover names at that. It was how it had been in previous committee reports. Jones considered it uncontroversial. </p> <p>But the CIA fought release of all of that. The entire saga of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted 9/11 mastermind whom the CIA waterboarded the most \u2013 a story the report told at great length \u2013 was blacked out, known in official parlance as \u201credaction\u201d. The CIA would not permit publication of the names of the 119 detainees the committee could find the agency detained. No country\u2019s cover name could be public. No pseudonym of a CIA officer could be public. </p> <p>\u201cThey redacted all references to Allah,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLike, really? Under what national security concern?\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the redactions was to obscure the story of what happened. CIA officials involved in the torture had persisted, thrived and been promoted within the agency, including individuals whom Jones had concluded helped mislead the Bush administration and the public. Jones had told, with cover names, that aspect of the story. Readers would have found it difficult to follow detainees from black site to black site, and more so to place pseudonymous interrogators at any. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t follow the narrative arc,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>The CIA\u2019s black magic marker looked cynical when considering that numerous senior agency officials involved with torture had published memoirs covering much of this material. CIA director George Tenet, ex-lawyer John Rizzo, even Jose Rodriguez, whose destruction of videotaped evidence of torture had occasioned the report \u2013 all had books out, books that had been cleared by the CIA\u2019s pre-publication review. The agency, with support from the White House, had permitted Hollywood film-makers unprecedented access for the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, which told the CIA\u2019s torture story the way the agency wanted it told \u2013 and in contradiction of what the Senate had found actually happened. </p> <p>After years of fighting with the CIA for access and accuracy, and brawling over accusations of criminality, Jones\u2019s new brief was to argue for rolling back the redactions. In 2010, when the CIA removed documents from the Senate side of RDINet, both sides turned to the White House to mediate the dispute. Now, the Senate negotiators were across the table from the CIA and the White House together. Meetings that lasted \u201chours and hours\u201d from August to December occurred at the White House \u2013 some even in the Situation Room \u2013 or on Capitol Hill, not the CIA. Jones remembered going practically paragraph by paragraph over declassification in the 525-page executive summary.</p> <p>For the CIA\u2019s part, cover names for agency officials would end up being fig leaves, once attentive readers began poring over the report. </p> <p>\u201cA pseudonym itself is little protection when a host of other information about that officer is made public and will be seen and possibly utilized by adversaries and foreign intelligence services,\u201d said agency spokesman Trapani.</p> <p>Trapani called the declassification discussions \u201cdesigned to preserve the committee\u2019s narrative of the CIA program for the public, while also protecting critical national security interests \u2013 including the safety and security of US personnel and ongoing intelligence operations.\u201d<br></p> <p>McDonough was a presence in the meetings, even those where he delegated attendance to National Security Council staffers or White House attorneys. The fact that the White House chief of staff would personally oversee the negotiations spoke to the gravity of the issue. Jones cannot recall a single issue on which McDonough or his team backed the Senate, and only when the agency would agree to relent would McDonough concur. There would be no help from the White House. </p> <p>\u201cDuring the process,\u201d a White House official said, \u201cDenis represented the views of the president and advocated on behalf of the redactions the inter-agency [process] assessed necessary to protect sensitive information.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62dc5b69a4518d4d0d18fdd43cf202829fbcae0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62dc5b69a4518d4d0d18fdd43cf202829fbcae0b/0_53_3584_2150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis McDonough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>McDonough\u2019s position was particularly startling to Jones considering that Obama had taken an explicit position on classification. An executive order Obama issued in December 2009, intended to enforce his pledge to run the \u201cmost transparent administration in history\u201d, explicitly barred the agencies from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information\">conceal[ing] violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error</a>\u201d. Citing national security exemptions required an argument for why release would harm US \u201cnational defense or foreign relations\u201d, rather than being an end of discussion. </p> <p>\u201cThe administration didn\u2019t come to us with arguments for why they were redacting information, other than \u2018this is hurtful to national security.\u2019 What we would do would be to go to the statute and say, \u2018This is unclassified, because the law says this, this, this and this,\u2019 and they would just say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a national security issue, we can\u2019t release this,\u201d Jones said. \u201c\u2018The world will end if this information is out,\u2019 and then you find out it\u2019s been out for four years \u2013 either they\u2019ve officially declassified it, or they allowed CIA officers to talk about it in books.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes the administration wouldn\u2019t even do that; or after the negotiators conceded to the Senate there was no national security basis for classification, the White House and CIA had a fallback contention, one for which Jones said made the discussions like beating his head against a wall.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s two arguments. You would put the lives of the CIA officers at risk, the lives of their families at risk. And then, the latter one, which always seemed to be the real reason because the other stuff just didn\u2019t hold any water, was that this will really hurt morale at the CIA, this is a morale issue. And they would openly say that, as if that was a reasonable response to making something classified,\u201d said Jones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018The world will end if this information is out,\u2019 and then you find out it\u2019s been out for years</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At those points, Jones would pull out Obama\u2019s own executive order and quote it to the CIA, the White House staff, even McDonough. \u201cWe had it with us at every one of our meetings,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Nor was the agency consistent. It would not permit the Senate to publish pseudonyms of its officers. But it relented on allowing the report to use them for the contractor psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who designed the torture program and even participated in interrogations. Although any argument about protecting the safety of the lives and families of agency officials would apply equally to Mitchell and Jessen, the report calls them, unlike any CIA employee, \u201cSwigert\u201d and \u201cDunbar\u201d.</p> <p>The drawn-out discussions would not always involve staff. In mid-October, McDonough flew to San Francisco to speak with Feinstein without Jones present. Feinstein pleaded for the use of agency cover names to appear in the report, but McDonough refused, even as she asked for fewer and fewer of them. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a battle we ended up losing. We wanted to include our own pseudonyms so you could follow a particular individual through the report. We went right up until the end,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>But the White House and the CIA could afford a drawn-out process in a way Feinstein and her staff could not. It was a midterm election year, and the Democrats were widely forecast to lose the Senate, a circumstance that came to pass on election day, 4 November. Feinstein lost her gavel. A GOP that had vacillated between unsupportive of the torture inquiry and hostile to it would be in power come January. The race was truly on. </p> <p>\u201cAfter the election, the declassification of the report is at stake, whether it ever becomes public,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe were not in a position of power.\u201d </p> <p>Exasperation with McDonough exploded immediately after the Democrats lost the election. McDonough attended a Senate Democratic caucus meeting. Feinstein, whose demeanor is universally described as calm, excoriated him \u2013 \u201cjust fucking floored him\u201d, the former senior Senate aide said \u2013 accusing McDonough of being relieved the Democrats lost the chamber because now the administration could run out the clock on making the report public. Feinstein said McDonough had violated agreements they had reached on redactions and called the administration duplicitous. </p> <p>McDonough\u2019s response echoed Obama\u2019s August press conference. He said that the families of hardworking CIA officials would be vulnerable in the event that the Senate\u2019s disclosure of their identities led to physical danger. It was an incendiary charge, given that no CIA agent\u2019s real name appeared even in the classified version of the report.</p> <p>Most party-caucus meetings center around a lunch discussion and break when senators need to leave for votes. But anger at McDonough, both personal and as a proxy for the White House, was white-hot. They held McDonough at the meeting through the voting and came back to vent more spleen. </p> <p>\u201cThey really said flat out to McDonough, \u2018You\u2019re protecting what happened, you\u2019re no better than what had happened in the Bush administration,\u2019\u201d said the ex-senior aide present. </p> <p>\u201cThis was a very spirited conversation,\u201d said Wyden, who was in attendance.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very tense,\u201d said Jones, one of the few staffers at the meeting.</p> <p>There was another issue, one not before revealed, that went down to the wire \u2013 the very last thing on which McDonough and the CIA would not yield an inch. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s pretty bizarre when the CIA director doesn\u2019t seem to know what the word \u2018spying\u2019 means</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Ron Wyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Senior CIA officials had assured the Senate that the personnel performing the interrogations were vetted rigorously. Former director Michael Hayden told the committee in 2007 that \u201call of those involved in the questioning of detainees are carefully chosen and screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity.\u201d </p> <p>It was not always true. The committee had learned that some CIA interrogators had records of violent acts in their personal lives \u2013 to include domestic abuse and even sexual assault. Even without listing names or pseudonyms, Langley refused to let that fact become public, no matter how tenuously connected to US national security it was. </p> <p>\u201cCIA conducted extensive analysis of the possible use of possible pseudonyms in the [Senate] report and determined that to do so would risk publicly revealing the true names of those officers, as well as the names of officers not associated with the program, and the identification of their family members,\u201d said the CIA\u2019s Trapani. \u201cThe administration did not support making disclosures that would put US government personnel and their families at additional risk.\u201d</p> <p>It was Friday 5 December 2014. The lame-duck session of Congress was nearly ended, and with it, Democratic control of the Senate. The committee, the CIA and McDonough had reached agreement on the entire report, except for the section \u2013 a single paragraph \u2013 alluding to the questionable backgrounds of its interrogators. </p> <p>McDonough would not back down. \u201cIt was a long meeting,\u201d Jones remembered, and the CIA was not even present. McDonough said the administration would agree to release the report \u201cas is\u201d. But first the paragraph had to change. </p> <p>The meeting became an endurance test. Finally, the committee representatives found a degree of acceptable language from McDonough. </p> <p>Page 470 of the report, long after the narrative had ended, referred to \u201ca number of personnel whose backgrounds include notable derogatory information calling into question their eligibility for employment, their access to classified information, and their participation in CIA interrogation activities.\u201d Most of that information was known to the agency. The report continued: \u201cThis group of officers included individuals who, among other issues, had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018Alright, this doesn\u2019t do it justice, but at least people will get the idea,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis was done to water down the backgrounds of people involved in the program.\u201d</p> <p>Six years after Jones began looking into CIA torture, it seemed like a section of the Senate report would finally see the light of day. But at the end of the meeting, the committee received an unexpected surprise. John Kerry, the secretary of state, longtime Massachusetts senator, war hero and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, called Feinstein. It would be a near-death experience for the torture inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612906daf554534931869de02cd89c0ffcc30394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612906daf554534931869de02cd89c0ffcc30394/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US secretary of state John Kerry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Kerry was urging his old Senate colleagues to delay the report\u2019s release. It was a tenuous moment globally, he argued. The coalition against the Islamic State would be jeopardized by an inflammatory report about the CIA torturing Muslims. Americans\u2019 lives and property abroad could be jeopardized. </p> <p>By that point, there were many aspects of the CIA\u2019s entreaties that no longer held sway with Democratic senators. But Kerry could not be dismissed out of hand. Many senators on the committee had close working relationships, even friendships, with Kerry. They knew him not to inflate threats. </p> <p>Technically, all Kerry was asking was a delay in the report\u2019s release. But the political reality, with the Republicans set to take over the Senate, was that delay was fatal. There was another inescapable certainty. Should the worst occur, and violence follow the release of the torture report, every senator whose name graced its cover would have to answer for it.<br></p> <p>Had James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, not intervened at that critical moment, it is possible that the Democratic senators would have capitulated and buried the report. </p> <p>By the weekend, the committee received a five-page document prepared by Clapper\u2019s office (ODNI), the entity nominally in charge of the 16 intelligence agencies. It purported to forecast the outcome of the report\u2019s release. Jones described it as \u201ca farce\u201d.</p> <p>ODNI\u2019s assessment was riddled with factual errors, and from those errors extrapolated dire consequences, including violence and damage to intelligence relationships. It falsely claimed the report, even in classified form, identified countries that hosted black sites. By that point, even committee senators reliant on staff for details of the report could see how wrong it was. When asked, a senior ODNI official telegraphed indifference to the accuracy of the document. Jones recalls the official saying: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s in the report. It matters what people think is.\u201d </p> <p>If the administration\u2019s goal was to suppress the torture report, Clapper pulled defeat from the jaws of victory. No longer were senators fixated on Kerry\u2019s warning. According to multiple sources, they were convinced an administration they wanted badly to believe was on their side was willing to insult their intelligence, all in the service of helping the CIA cover up an act the president himself had vociferously opposed. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a poorly done intelligence product with clear factual errors and it inaccurately described the study we were about to release,\u201d said Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cUltimately, yes, I think for some senators, the angle and clear errors in that intelligence assessment played a role in their decision to support the release of the redacted Executive Summary of the Study. My only regret is we did not work to declassify more.\u201d</p> <p>Timothy Barrett, an ODNI spokesman, said the directorship supported the redacted release of the summary but \u201chad a duty to warn policymakers about the possible consequences of release of the report in order to enable preparation and effective measures to protect American citizens and interests. This assessment could not be limited to the text of the report in a vacuum, but had to consider the effect of its release in light of other information that had already been reported \u2013 and public perceptions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The report that\u2019s out is not the report we would have chosen to put out</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 9 December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released\">the committee released the executive summary</a>.

We did the very best we could at the time with the knowledge we had.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cEvery time it comes around to the anniversary I cringe, because I know people will bring up my name, they blame me, they say that I lied and that people died because I lied, [they say] people have died because I made a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>A week after two hijacked passenger jets were flown into the towers of the World Trade Center, killing 2,753 people \u2013 184 died in the Pentagon in Washington DC and 40 were killed when a United Airlines plane came down in a field in Pennsylvania \u2013 Whitman issued a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/09/09/09greenwire-epa-regulators-say-theyve-learned-from-911-blu-24494.html?pagewanted=all\">statement</a>. It said: \u201cI am glad to reassure the people of New York \u2026 that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink.\u201d</p> <p>She has always maintained that as head of the EPA she was simply passing on what government scientists were telling her, warning those working at Ground Zero itself to wear respirators but dismissing concerns over the surrounding area, which was engulfed in dust and ash.</p> <p>Three days after the attacks, Whitman, who had previously been the Republican governor of New Jersey, told reporters: \u201cThe good news continues to be that air samples we have taken have all been at levels that cause us no concern.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, the EPA inspector general <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/22/AR2008042202807.html\">criticized</a> the agency\u2019s handling of the crisis, finding that the EPA had no basis for its swift pronouncements about air quality. Politicians, including the then New York senator Hillary Clinton, laid into the Bush administration, accusing it of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton-9-11-attacks-response\">deceiving </a>the public.</p> <p>More than 37,000 people registered with the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP), a federal organisation set up in 2011 to oversee those affected by exposure to the toxins released at Ground Zero, have been declared sick.

That number includes first responders who were at Ground Zero and people who lived and worked in the surrounding area.</p> <p>A WTCHP spokeswoman, Christy Spring, said: \u201cWe have a list of health conditions that the program provides medical monitoring and treatment for, established by the government to have been related to exposure to the dust and debris from the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.\u201d</p> <p>Whitman said: \u201cIf people are dying from this \u2013 and I have not seen the data \u2013 and they had believed everything was fine, then you have got to blame the message they were hearing, and what they were hearing was that the ambient air quality in Lower Manhattan at the time was OK.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://nadler.house.gov/\">Jerrold Nadler</a>, a veteran US congressman whose district covers the World Trade Center site, told the Guardian on Thursday that Whitman had never admitted she had been wrong about the air quality. </p> <p>\u201cShe knew or should have known\u201d the air was dangerous, he said. </p> <p>In 2008, Nadler accused Whitman of causing thousands to suffer injury \u201cand in some cases death\u201d due to \u201cunnecessary exposure to toxins released by the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings\u201d. </p> <p>In a ruling in a lawsuit brought by New York residents that year, a federal appeals court ruled that Whitman <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/22/AR2008042202807.html\">could not be held liable</a> for health problems caused by the air around Ground Zero.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/aug/26/911-dust-lady-describes-how-iconic-photo-was-taken-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4bp6f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2360679\"            data-video-name=\"9/11 'Dust Lady' describes how iconic photo was taken \u2013 archive video\"            data-video-provider=\"Mike McGregor\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/8/26/1440601947392/KP_404353_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-55ddd765e4b00a5187d1f245\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/8/26/1440601947392/KP_404353_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/08/26/150826macyborders_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/08/26/150826macyborders_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/08/26/150826macyborders_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/08/26/150826macyborders_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/08/26/150826macyborders.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/aug/26/911-dust-lady-describes-how-iconic-photo-was-taken-video\">9/11 \u2018Dust Lady\u2019 describes how iconic photo was taken \u2013 archive video</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/911-attack-ground-zero-cancer-marcy-borders\">Death of 9/11 'dust lady' Marcy Borders renews worry over related cancers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday, Whitman questioned the level of proof that the air made people sick, but said: \u201cIf this is a direct relation, we all screwed up.\u201d She thought she was right at the time, she said, but added: \u201cI can believe that the scientists may not have had all the information they needed.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the attack on New York, Whitman said it was known that asbestos, lead and other toxins were in the wreckage of the Twin Towers, known as \u201cthe pile\u201d, and that those working on rescue and recovery there should wear respirators.

  "<h2>\u2018Trump is our wakeup call\u2019 </h2> <p><strong>Raul Rodriguez, 74, Apple Valley, California</strong></p> <p>I always carry a bullhorn with me to rallies and campaign events. Into it I shout: \u201cAmerica, wake up!\u201d Americans have been asleep for way too long. We need to realise that the future of our country is at stake.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t elect Donald Trump, we\u2019ll get another four years of Barack Obama and frankly, I don\u2019t know what would happen to this wonderful country of ours. Obama has already done so much to destroy our way of life and Hillary Clinton is promising to carry on where he left off. Like Obama, she wants to change our fundamental values \u2013 the ones people like my father fought to defend.</p> <p>My father was born in Durango, Mexico. When he came to the US he joined the military and served as a medic during the second world war. He was a very proud American \u2013 he truly loved this country. I think I got my sense of patriotism from him.</p> <p>Obama and Hillary Clinton want to have open borders. They let illegal immigrants cross our borders and now they want to accept thousands of Syrians. We don\u2019t know who these people are. If they want to come to this country, they have to do it the right way, like my father did it.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired of politicians telling voters what they want to hear and then returning to Washington and doing whatever their party tells them to do. Politicians are supposed to represent the people \u2013 not their parties or their donors.</p> <p>Part of the reason I like Donald Trump is because he isn\u2019t an established politician. Sometimes that hurts him and people get offended. But the truth hurts. Even if he doesn\u2019t say it well, he\u2019s not wrong. Trump is our wakeup call.</p> <h2>\u2018Democrats treat Latinos as if we\u2019re all one big group\u2019 </h2> <p><strong>Ximena Barreto, 31, San Diego, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1664391d889268076782028fc18866ab4329dab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1664391d889268076782028fc18866ab4329dab0/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ximena Barreto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ximena Barreto</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edoardo Delille and Giulia Piermartiri/Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in primary school in my native Colombia when my father was murdered. I was six \u2013 just one year older than my daughter is now. My father was an officer in the Colombian army at a time when wearing a uniform made you a target for narcoterrorists, Farc fighters and guerrilla groups.</p> <p>What I remember clearly from those early years is the bombing and the terror. I was so afraid, especially after my dad died. At night, I would curl up in my mother\u2019s bed while she held me close. She could not promise me that everything was going to be all right, because it wasn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up like that.</p> <p>But when I turn on my TV, I see terrorist attacks in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-bernardino-shooting\">San Bernardino</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">Orlando</a>. There are dangerous people coming across our borders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> was right. Some are rapists and criminals, but some are good people, too. But how do we know who is who, when you come here illegally?</p> <p>I moved to the US in 2006 on a work permit. It took nearly five years and thousands of dollars to become a US citizen. I know the process is not perfect, but it\u2019s the law. Why would I want illegals coming in when I had to go through this? It\u2019s not fair that they\u2019re allowed to jump the line and take advantage of so many benefits, ones that I pay for with my tax dollars.</p> <p>People assume that because I\u2019m a woman, I should vote for the woman; or that because I\u2019m Latina, I should vote for the Democrat. <a href=\"https://www.democrats.org/\">The Democrats</a> have been pandering to minorities and women for the last 50 years. They treat Latinos as if we\u2019re all one big group. I\u2019m Colombian \u2013 I don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariachi\">Mariachi</a> music. Donald Trump is not just saying what he thinks people want to hear, he\u2019s saying what they\u2019re afraid to say. I believe that he\u2019s the only candidate who can make America strong and safe again.</p> <h2>\u2018Trump beat the system: what\u2019s more American than that?\u2019 <br></h2> <p><strong>Bertran Usher, 20, Inglewood, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c9a789c6ba6d2e81ecc85d4e5b9a044fd800a721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a789c6ba6d2e81ecc85d4e5b9a044fd800a721/0_0_6861_4579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bertran Usher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bertran Usher, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edoardo Delille and Giulia Piermartiri/Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump is the candidate America deserves. For decades, Americans have bemoaned politicians and Washington insiders. We despise political speak and crave fresh, new ideas. When you ask for someone with no experience, this is what you get. It\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t want a doctor to operate on you.</p> <p>But Trump is a big FU to America. He beat the system and proved everyone wrong. What\u2019s more American than that?</p> <p>As a political science student who one day hopes to go into politics, I am studying this election closely. Both candidates are deeply unpopular and people of my generation are not happy with their choices. I believe we can learn what not to do from this election. I see how divided the country is, and it\u2019s the clearest sign that politicians will have to learn to work together to make a difference. It\u2019s not always easy, but I\u2019ve seen this work.</p> <p>I was raised in a multicultural household. My mother, a Democrat, is Latino and African American, raised in the inner city of Los Angeles. My father, a Republican, is an immigrant from Belize. My parents and I don\u2019t always see eye to eye on everything, but our spirited debates have helped add nuance to my politics.</p> <p>I\u2019m in favour of small government, but I support gay rights. I believe welfare is an important service for Americans who need it, but I think our current programme needs to be scaled back. I think we need to have stricter enforcement of people who come to the country illegally, but I don\u2019t think we should deport the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act\">DREAMers</a> [children of immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, named after the 2001 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act].</p> <p>Trump can be a nut, but I think he\u2019s the best candidate in this election. Though there are issues of his I disagree with, at least he says what\u2019s on his mind, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, who hides what she\u2019s thinking behind her smile.</p> <p>It\u2019s up to my generation to fix the political mess we\u2019re in. I plan to be a part of the solution.</p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s The Art Of The Deal inspired me to be a businessman\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Omar Navarro, 27, Torrance, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d2c10107b422012528f905574268315705f19a45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c10107b422012528f905574268315705f19a45/0_0_7207_4810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Navarro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I was a kid, people would ask what I wanted to be when I grew up. I would tell them: I want to be president of the United States. If that doesn\u2019t work out, I want to be a billionaire like Trump.</p> <p>In a way, I supported him long before he announced he was running for president. He was my childhood hero. I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trump-Art-Deal-Tony-Schwartz/dp/0345479173\">The Art Of The Deal</a> as a student; it inspired me to become a businessman. Now I own a small business and am <a href=\"http://www.omarnavarro.com/\">running for Congress</a> in California\u2019s 43rd district.</p> <p>Trump built an empire and a strong brand that\u2019s recognisable all around the world; he\u2019s a household name and a world-class businessman. Almost anywhere you go, you can see the mark of Donald Trump on a building or property. When I see that, I see the American Dream.</p> <p>Some people ask me how I can support Donald Trump as the son of a Mexican and Cuban immigrants. They are categorising me. In this country we label people: Hispanic, African American, Asian, Caucasian. We separate and divide people into social categories based on race, ethnicity, gender and creed. To me, this is a form of racism. I\u2019m proud of my Hispanic heritage but I\u2019m an American, full stop.</p> <p>Like all immigrants, my parents came to this country for a better opportunity. But they did it legally. They didn\u2019t cut the line. They assimilated to the American way of life, learned English and opened small businesses.</p> <p>Why should we allow people to skirt the law? Imagine making a dinner reservation and arriving at the restaurant to find out that another family has been seated at your table. How is that fair?</p> <p>We have to have laws and as a country we must enforce those laws. A society without laws is just anarchy. If someone invited you to their house and asked you to remove your shoes would you keep them on? If we don\u2019t enforce the rules, why would anyone respect them? I believe Donald Trump will enforce the rules.</p> <h2>\u2018He has taken a strong stand against abortion\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jimena Rivera, 20, student at the University of Texas at Brownsville</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"866ac5439ecdffc7b9ae72c603c3cfe422767c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/866ac5439ecdffc7b9ae72c603c3cfe422767c31/0_178_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimena Rivera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m Mexican, so I don\u2019t have a vote, but I support Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who opposes abortion. He may have wavered in the beginning, but since becoming the nominee he has taken a strong stand against abortion.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is running as the leader of a party that has pushed a very pro-choice platform. Even Democrats like her running mate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/tim-kaine-vice-president-hillary-clinton-2016-campaign\">Tim Kaine</a>, who is a devout Catholic, compromise their faith to support abortion.</p> <p>I don\u2019t always agree with his positions on immigration. I see the border wall every day. I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s effective. The people who want to cross will find a way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that they do, but most of them are looking for a better way of life.

I became politically engaged as a political science and economics major at university. By my junior year, I was a member of the campus Republicans\u2019 club. As a student of economics, I am very impressed with Trump\u2019s economic agenda. I believe we must cut taxes for everyone and eliminate the death tax. Lowering taxes and reeling back regulations will create more jobs \u2013 meaning more tax-paying Americans. This in turn will generate more revenue for the Treasury.</p> <p>I also support Trump because he favours strong leadership and promised to preserve the constitution of the United States. We must have a rule of law in this country. We must close our open borders. Like Trump says: \u201ca nation without borders is not a nation.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean we should not allow any immigrants.

They were not educated but they worked hard to make a better life for us and it paid off.</p> <p>I went to school and studied cosmetic surgery. Now I work as a plastic surgeon and have been in practice for the last 40 years. I have a beautiful family and my health. I am Hispanic \u2013 but I am a citizen of the United States and I feel very patriotic for this country that has given me so much.</p> <p>I\u2019m supporting Trump because I agree with his vision for our economy. He has experience at the negotiating table, so he knows what to do to create jobs and increase workers\u2019 salaries. In Trump\u2019s America people would be rewarded for their hard work rather than penalised with hefty taxes.</p> <p>The security of our nation is a top priority for me. I think it would be impossible to deport 11 million people who are here illegally, but we have to do a better job of understanding who is in our country and who is trying to come into our country.</p> <p>A lot of what Trump says, especially about security and immigration, is twisted by the media. What he said about Mexicans, for example, that wasn\u2019t negative \u2013 it was the truth. There are Mexicans bringing over drugs and perpetrating rapes. But what he also said \u2013 and the media completely ignored \u2013 is that many Mexicans are good people coming over for a better quality of life.</p> <p>He may be blunt and occasionally offensive but I find him likable. I was so impressed by Trump and his family at the <a href=\"http://convention.gop/\">Republican National Convention</a>.

I walked over to her and said, \u201cHoney, excuse me, does that look like a garbage can to you?\u201d And you know what she told me? \u201cThere\u2019s already trash in the planter, so what does it matter?\u201d</p> <p>I asked her what part of Mexico she was from. She seemed surprised and asked how I knew she was from Mexico. \u201cLook at what you just did,\u201d I told her. \u201cDonald Trump may sound harsh when he speaks about Mexicans, but he is right. It\u2019s people like you that make everyone look bad.\u201d</p> <p>I moved from Mexico with my family when I was seven. I still carry a photo of my brother and I near our home, to remind people how beautiful the city once was. Now I spend my time erasing graffiti from the walls and picking up trash. Sixty years ago, we accepted immigrants into our country who valued the laws, rules and regulations that made America the land of opportunity. Back in those days, people worked hard to improve themselves and their communities.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired of living in a lawless country. It\u2019s like we put a security guard at the front door, but the Obama administration unlocked the back door. And I have seen what my own people have done to this country. They want to convert America into the country they left behind. This country has given me so many opportunities I wouldn\u2019t have had if my mom had raised her family in Mexico.

  "<p>It\u2019s September, which means \u2013 exciting! \u2013 it\u2019s fashion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/groundhog-day-perfect-comedy-for-ever\">Groundhog Day</a> again. This consists of fashion weeks starting up, followed swiftly by the announcement of a political initiative to protect women against this evil on the catwalk. (Another feature of fashion Groundhog Day, incidentally, is a slew of articles by male columnists expressing bafflement at why the models are so thin, which can be summed up as: \u201cI don\u2019t find this sexy, so why?!\u201d However would we know how to look without men telling us what turns them on?)</p> <p>Anyway, the latest initiative comes courtesy of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/womens-equality-party\">Women\u2019s Equality party</a>, which has launched a campaign demanding, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/04/minimum-bmi-checks-uk-models-womens-equality-party\">that British designers and retailers stop using size zero clothes in shows and photoshoots</a>. This, the WEP claims, \u201cwill tackle negative body image issues and eating disorders\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to ignore the all-too-predictable connection between fashion models and eating disorders here, because I\u2019ve written enough for this lifetime about how absurdly reductive it is to suggest that a mental illness is caused by Vogue. Instead, I\u2019ll say this: the WEP is perfectly within its rights to address this issue, but \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 it will not make a blind bit of difference. There have been efforts to legislate against fashion\u2019s obsession with skinniness in the past; these laws, wherever they\u2019re passed, always get a lot of play, because the media love a story that allows them to run a&#xa0;photo of a skinny model at least as much&#xa0;as the fashion industry likes the skinny model herself.</p> <p>So it would be understandable if you were confused as to why things haven\u2019t changed. The problem is not only that the laws are rarely enforced, but also that they are the equivalent of rearranging the Titanic\u2019s deck chairs. For a start, fashion is too international for one country\u2019s legislation to make a difference \u2013 especially, I\u2019m sorry to say, when it\u2019s this country doing the legislating. With the exception of Burberry, British-based fashion companies simply do not spend enough on international advertising for any laws to have an effect; the rest of the world won\u2019t even see the photographs. Slapping legislation on a tiny British brand will not change the aesthetic if&#xa0;Chanel and Prada can carry on as before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/13/hillary-clinton-parks-and-recreation-hadley-freeman\">Don't like Hillary Clinton? You need to watch Parks And Recreation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While fashion represents the connection between skinniness and perfection in its purest form, it is also the end point. By the time a&#xa0;woman is looking at fashion photography, she\u2019ll have gone through years of indoctrination that the less of her there is, the better. It\u2019s there in all the children\u2019s books and films, in which the evil women are plump and the nice ones are slender (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl\">Roald Dahl</a> is especially bad on this). It\u2019s there in pretty much every film ever made (the only person I\u2019ve interviewed with an evident eating disorder was not a model but an actress). And it\u2019s&#xa0;there in the general atmosphere of being female today, the things you grow up hearing the adult women around you saying about their bodies, the way they decline dessert. According to <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/research/the-good-childhood-report\">a report just published by the Children\u2019s Society</a>, teenage girls are unhappier than ever, especially with their bodies, which they compare unfavourably with those of their friends and celebrities.</p> <p>This masochistic tendency towards self\u2011erasure is a complicated issue, something a&#xa0;well\u2011meaning but overly simplistic campaign against thinness in fashion can\u2019t fix. The WEP has also suggested including body-image lessons as part of the school curriculum, which is a better idea (and, tellingly, it has had less pick-up, what with it lacking the vital excuse for a photograph of a model). But instead of fussing about the meaningless phrase \u201csize zero\u201d, or conflating thinness with anorexia, the WEP would be more effective if it looked at the prevalence of eating disorders in the fashion industry and exposed this. Instead of pretending it can tell fashion editors what to put in their magazines, the WEP could talk to them to get a more realistic sense of&#xa0;the problem, and get them on side.</p> <p>If we really want to end the association between female skinniness and female aspiration, women need to be doing this on an individual, focused level, not leaving it to politicians to act on an amorphous, collective one. Look at the way you talk about your body and what you eat, especially in front of young girls. Call out publications that condescend to larger women and feature photographs only of slim ones. Remind your female friends and your daughters that their jeans size is not a measurement of their&#xa0;personal value.</p> <p>It is easy to damn the fashion industry for promoting skinny as the feminine ideal. It\u2019s harder to admit that it is only echoing back too many of our&#xa0;own darkest thoughts, our own self-loathing.</p>",

Zhukov admits meeting and doing business with some of Odessa\u2019s criminal figures, but says this was before their illegal connections became apparent.</p> <p>However, the case gave a fascinating insight into his background and the company that he kept at the time. </p> <p>In the 1990s, Zhukov co-founded <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/customs/1846-operators-of-cargo-terminal-raise-questions\">Sintez UK</a>, a company involved in shipping Russian crude oil to the port of Odessa, in Ukraine, which was <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/customs/1846-operators-of-cargo-terminal-raise-questions\">allegedly run</a> by mafia gangs at the time.</p> <p>In 1998, Italian police launched a major investigation into the Ukrainian mafia, which concluded that the problem of organised crime in Odessa was very serious, with mobsters \u201cin possession of a great quantity of weapons such as guns, machine guns and explosives\u201d.</p> <p>A report by the special police unit servizio centralo operativo includes a reference to Zhukov in a graphic. It also mentions Alexander Angert, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/armstrade.iantraynor\">violent Odessa godfather </a>who lives in London and still <a href=\"http://crime-ua.com/node/12378\">plays a role</a> in the city\u2019s politics. Angert\u2019s company <a href=\"http://companyformationuk.co/Officers/TRANSCARGO-LIMITED/2910507\">Transcargo</a> shared a Mayfair address with Zhukov\u2019s Sintez UK. </p> <p>Italian police arrested Zhukov at Olbia airport in Sardinia in 2001 as he was heading to his villa in nearby Porto Cervo. Detectives accused him of being part of a ring that tried to smuggle weapons from Ukraine and Belarus to the former Yugoslavia in 1994. The alleged shipment, apparently destined for Venice and hidden aboard the Jadran Express container vessel, was said to have included grenades, anti-tank weapons and 30,0000 Kalashnikovs.</p> <p>While Zhukov spent six months in prison in Turin, he was interviewed by Belgian police and later acquitted. He <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/441351\">told Russian newspaper Kommersant</a>: \u201cI am completely innocent of arms dealing.\u201d The court held that the underlying facts \u201cdid not exist\u201d. His lawyers said the proceedings were \u201ctotally without merit\u201d.</p> <p>According to his spokesman, Zhukov knew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/armstrade.iantraynor\">Angert and Leonid Minin</a>, an international arms dealer, who was one of the inspirations for Yuri Orlov, the fictional character played by Nicolas Cage in the film Lord of War.</p> <p>Minin was arrested in 2000 when police found him in a Milan hotel with four prostitutes, cocaine, $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) in cash and African diamonds worth $500m. He was convicted of drug possession and sentenced to two years in prison. </p> <p>However, Zhukov\u2019s spokesman told the Guardian that his client\u2019s oil companies were only involved in lawful arms-length \u201ccommercial transactions\u201d with Minin\u2019s firms. </p> <p>These were \u201cfully legitimate\u201d, he said, adding that Minin did not have \u201cnasty reputational issues\u201d at the time.</p> <p>Separately, Italy\u2019s parliament named Zhukov in a 464-page report into Russian organised crime in 2005. It called Zhukov an \u201cimportant member\u201d of the Solntsevskaya gang, Russia\u2019s most powerful international crime syndicate, with a base in Rome.</p> <p>Zhukov strongly denies the allegation. He has never been arrested, charged or convicted of any related offences. </p> <p>Zhukov\u2019s UK citizenship will not endear him to Russia\u2019s hawkish president, Vladimir Putin. UK-Russian relations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/russia-and-iran-delighted-at-uks-rejection-of-eu\">have been strained</a> since the murder of the former Russian secret service officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">Alexander Litvinenko</a> in London in 2006. In January, a public inquiry concluded that Putin had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/alexander-litvinenko-was-probably-murdered-on-personal-orders-of-putin\">\u201cprobably approved\u201d</a> the dissident\u2019s killing. Putin has called for \u201cde-offshorisation\u201d and urged rich businesspeople to bring their fortunes home.</p> <p>Since 2014, Russians are obliged to declare foreign citizenship. This follows a law that was introduced as relations with the west worsened when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/russia-and-ukraine-step-up-security-amid-tension-over-crimea\">Russia annexed Crimea</a>. Human rights groups that receive western funding now have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/26/harassed-and-shunned-the-russians-labelled-foreign-agents-by-kremlin\">register as \u201cforeign agents\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Russians with second passports have been weighing up whether to abide by the law or keep quiet and hope that their second citizenship is not discovered. Zhukov says his UK citizenship has been properly declared \u201cin accordance with law\u201d. </p> <p>Zhukov says he \u201cknows well\u201d but is not close to Gennady Trukhanov, the mayor of Odessa, who was named by Italian police as an influential member of the city\u2019s oil mafia. Trukhanov worked in the 1990s for Sintez and has also admitted knowing Minin and Angert. According to Mikheil Saakashvili, Odessa\u2019s regional governor, Angert flew into the city in 2015 on a private jet to influence the mayoral election.</p> <p>Trukhanov\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment. The mayor faced protests in Odessa in April after his Russian passport was found in the Panama Papers.</p>",
  "<p>Voters in the City of Sydney, along with other parts of New South Wales, are voting to elect new local councils on Saturday. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the City of Sydney council election.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been going on in the City of Sydney for the last four years?</strong></p> <p>Independent lord mayor Clover Moore has been leading the council from Town Hall for the last 12 years, since 2004. Moore was a state MP covering the area from 1988 until 2012, and ran for the lord mayoralty in 2004 after the Labor state government expanded the council to cover some of her strongest areas.<br></p> <p>Moore was re-elected lord mayor in 2008 and 2012, with enough councillors elected on her ticket to give her a working majority on the council.</p> <p>In 2012, she comfortably won a third term, with more than 50% of the primary vote in the mayoral election. Another four candidates were elected from her team, alongside two Liberals, one Labor, one Green and one local business independent. Moore\u2019s vote is highest in the north-eastern corner of the City, in suburbs such as Kings Cross, Darlinghurst and Potts Point, and is also quite high in the Newtown and Glebe areas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map 1\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\"src=\"https://benraue.carto.com/viz/88dc0edb-33b8-4c3e-bb9b-bbebeac16f4f/embed_map\" frameborder=\"0\"allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Clover Moore\u2019s primary vote for mayor by booth.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How have the voting rules changed?</strong><br></p> <p>A 2014 bill, sponsored by the Shooters and Fishers party, expanded the rights of businesses to vote in the City. While some businesses were already allowed to vote, most didn\u2019t. Only 1709 non-resident electors were enrolled to vote in the City in 2012.

Sitting Liberal councillor Christine Forster is seen as the main threat, but there is also a strong campaign from independent councillor Angela Vithoulkas, who is running an independent \u2018Sydney Matters\u2019 team focused on winning votes from local businesses.

She\u2019s going to die. She\u2019s having seizures on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Inside, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, stepped up to the podium to warm up the crowd: \u201cA shout out to the military families,\u201d he started. Then \u201ca shout out to our law enforcement professionals\u201d, and finally \u201cto that beautiful flag up there on the wall ... we must respect our flag.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani emerged next and set the tone.

Most candidates, traditionally, would be drumming up votes in areas more likely swing blue or red \u2014 Iowa, or Ohio, or even other parts of Florida. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s methods continue to defy political gravity.

Their song during his last visit to Pensacola became a hit on social media, with lyrics including:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Enemies of freedom</p> <p>Face the music \u2013 come on boys, take \u2019em down!</p> <p>President Donald Trump knows how </p> <p>to make America great</p> <p>Deal from strength or get crushed</p> <p>every time</p> </blockquote> <p>But now the group\u2019s manager and one girl\u2019s father, Jeff Popick, allege Trump \u201cplayed\u201d the girls and didn\u2019t pay them. Last week he filed suit against the campaign, seeking $5,000 to $15,000. </p> <p>The Trump camp has not responded publicly to the suit, but it has 20 days from the receiving it to respond, according to the girls\u2019 lawyer. </p>"
