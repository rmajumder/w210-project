  "<p>In search of answers about plummeting polls and reports of despair within his presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump questioned the role of a free press on Sunday, as his allies struggled to argue that their candidate remained focused on winning the general election.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/14/donald-trump-fairness-balance-falters-bbc-us-media\">Fairness and balance falters before Trump in the US media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a Saturday night rally in Fairfield, Connecticut, Trump went so far as to say that his race is not against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, but against journalists. \u201cI\u2019m not running against Crooked Hillary,\u201d he told a crowd. \u201cI\u2019m running against the crooked media.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, the nominee challenged the application of first amendment rights: \u201cIt is not \u2018freedom of the press\u2019 when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\u201d</p> <p>Trump has previously argued that Congress should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">open up our libel laws</a>\u201d so that people could sue newspapers, although he himself has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-denies-ted-cruz-father-assassination-jfk\">cited tabloid stories without evidence</a>.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, campaign chairman Paul Manafort tried to pour cold water on the reports that had enraged Trump. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is very plugged in,\u201d Manafort told on CNN. \u201cVery connected. We\u2019re seeing crowds that are end of October numbers, not August numbers. He\u2019s appearing to between 10, 15, 20,000 people. That tells you the campaign is working.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign chief also argued that Trump had \u201ca substantive week\u201d, noting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">competing economic plans</a> that he and Clinton each presented. \u201cOur plan very clearly laid out how he was going to cut taxes, lower the tax rates for small businesses, how that would create more jobs. He talked about his trade policy.\u201d</p> <p>But Manafort was also forced to answer for Trump\u2019s remark that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\">second amendment people</a>\u201d might act against Clinton, and a campaign staffer\u2019s criticism of the parents of a US army captain killed in Iraq.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s defence followed a New York Times report <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-gop.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">of confusion</a> at the heart of the Trump campaign, quoting from more than 20 associates who anonymously described the candidate as increasingly angry, glum, and refusing to follow counsel from his advisers. Separately, Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-rnc-support-226987\">reported</a> that Republican party leaders had started private talks about cutting off financial support for their nominee.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has put Politico on<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-media-blacklist/\"> a so-called \u201cblacklist\u201d</a> of organizations it denies press credentials to, and Trump tweeted that the Times \u201chas become a newspaper of fiction\u201d. On Saturday he wondered aloud about banning the outlet from his events.</p> <p>Then Trump spent Sunday morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/764866887511572480\">tweeting aspersions </a><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/764867963845484545\">about the press</a>, critiquing various elements of coverage and largely ignoring his opponent, despite recent, damaging reports about <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/email-batch-provides-additional-evidence-that-clinton-foundation-donors-got-access-at-state-department/2016/08/10/de2c0066-5f1a-11e6-9d2f-b1a3564181a1_story.html\">her relationship with donors </a>and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-senator-clinton-promised-200000-jobs-in-upstate-new-york-her-efforts-fell-flat/2016/08/07/339d3384-58d2-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">her record as a senator.</a> On Sunday, CNN reported that the FBI would give Congress notes from agents\u2019 three-hour interview with Clinton, over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Clinton herself has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/hillary-clinton-media-105901\">quarreled with the press</a> for years, and the Democratic nominee has not held an official press conference in more than 250 days.</p> <p>Yet Trump persisted with his personal crusade, writing: \u201cMy rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rallies are filmed in their entirety <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahGrayCNN/status/764623770128646144\">by a shared camera</a>, and he often spends long sections of his speeches, including Saturday\u2019s, denigrating journalists, sometimes by name. \u201cI am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process,\u201d he added on Sunday.</p> <p>In the background behind Trump and Manafort\u2019s media criticism, new polling data shows Trump falling behind secretary Clinton by five or more points in key swing states, including Virginia, Colorado, Florida and Pennsylvania. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136\">newly released NBC-Wall Street Journal poll</a> shows Clinton leading in Virginia and Colorado by double digits. </p> <p>Nationally, polling averages show Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">with a nearly seven-point lead</a>. Reflecting the average, a recent poll Washington Post/ABC poll showed Clinton leading 50% to 42%. <br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the queue of Republicans looking to abandon Trump grew larger on Sunday. Carlos Gutierrez, a former cabinet member for George W Bush, told CNN that he would vote for Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cI am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not thinking about a Republican. I am thinking about a US citizen. I think, at some point, you have to put the party aside and say, \u2018What\u2019s best for the country?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Maine\u2019s Republican senator Susan Collins, who wrote<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/susan-collins-donald-trump-washington-post-op-ed-republican\"> a scathing op-ed rejecting Trump last week</a>, told CBS that while she respected his candor, \u201cthere\u2019s a big difference between that and treating people with respect and common decency. And there\u2019s where, in my judgment, Donald Trump has failed.\u201d </p> <p>Collins said she was taking a look at the Libertarian ticket \u201cbecause it\u2019s headed by two former Republican governors who are very successful governors\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/trump-recruits-election-observers-voter-intimidation-fears\">Trump recruits 'election observers' as he warns of potential voter fraud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Trump\u2019s few outspoken allies in the Senate, Jeff Sessions, defended the nominee\u2019s erratic campaign in the general election. \u201cHe was so exuberant. He had a lot of fun in the primaries \u2013 he was really hammering away,\u201d Sessions told ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s a different thing to run a presidential election. You\u2019re dealing with a different constituency.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>But as Republican officials scrambled to assert a coherent direction for their candidate\u2019s campaign, Trump himself may have already offered the clearest sign of his strategy.</p> <p>\u201cI just keep doing the same thing I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d Trump said on Thursday, when asked about his plans to catch up to Clinton. \u201cAnd at the end, it\u2019s either going to work or I\u2019m going to have a very, very nice long vacation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Fifty girls believed to be among the Nigerian schoolchildren kidnapped at gunpoint two years ago have appeared in a video released by Boko Haram.</p> <p>In the video, a masked man holding a gun tells the government that the militant group, which has murdered, raped and kidnapped thousands of people in north east Nigeria, would only release the Chibok girls in return for the release of imprisoned Boko Haram fighters.</p> <p>Of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/the-night-boko-haram-kidnapped-our-girls-a-chibok-resident-remembers\">276 girls taken from their dormitories</a> in April 2014, 217 are still missing.</p> <p>One of the girls, who identified herself as Maida Yakubu, spoke in the video of their suffering, but told their families to \u201ctake heart\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo our parents \u2013 please be patient,\u201d Yakubu said. \u201cThere is no kind of suffering we haven\u2019t seen. Our sisters are injured, some of them have wounds on their heads and bodies. Tell the government to give them [Boko Haram] their people, so we can come home to you.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all children. We don\u2019t know what to do. The suffering is too much. Please try. We have been patient. The only thing that can be done is to give them their people so we can go home.\u201d</p> <p>As she spoke, the women sitting and standing behind her cried silently, wiping their faces on their black and grey abayas. One held a child in her arms. Black cloth had been draped behind them, making it impossible to know where the video was filmed.</p> <p>The fighter in the video, who has not been identified, also had a message for the Chibok parents.</p> <p>\u201cThey should know that their children are still in our hands,\u201d he said, his face wrapped in camouflage cloth. Forty of the Chibok girls had been married, the fighter added, letting go of his gun only to wag his finger at the camera and hold a microphone under Yakubu\u2019s chin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-14T13:19:55.html\" data-alt=\"Chibok map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-14T13:19:55.html\">Chibok map</a> </figure>  <p>He complained of government airstrikes against Boko Haram camps.

While his forces have <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/25/471886589/nigerian-military-says-it-rescued-more-than-800-hostages-from-boko-haram\">taken back large amounts of territory</a> from the group, it has remained active, killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings.</p> <p>Footage was attached to the video purporting to show some of the schoolgirls killed in government attacks. However, analysts said the girls\u2019 injuries did not seem consistent with airstrikes, but were more similar to machete wounds, suggesting that the footage could have been staged.</p> <p>The fighter\u2019s message to Buhari was that if his troops tried to rescue the girls, Boko Haram would kill them. He said messages were relayed only through journalists and nobody was authorised to negotiate for Boko Haram.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste time \u2013 release our members in custody and we will release the girls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He was reiterating a demand made in the first video of the girls, released a month after their capture. \u201cI abducted your girls and I will sell them in the market,\u201d Boko Haram\u2019s then undisputed leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/abubakar-shekau-boko-haram-commander-nigeria-kidnap\">Abubakar Shekau</a>, said in the video.</p> <p>Only one other video showing 15 girls, some of them confirmed as Chibok victims by their relatives, has emerged since. A month after the video was released in April, one of the girls escaped. Amina Nkeki was flown directly to the Nigerian capital, Abuja, to meet Buhari and be paraded in a press conference that commentators described as a \u201cdesperate bid to claim credit\u201d for her release.</p> <p>The latest video is believed to have been ordered by Shekau and comes as a battle rages for control of Boko Haram. Ten days ago, Islamic State, to which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/07/boko-haram-suicide-bombers-50-dead-maiduguri\">Boko Haram pledged allegiance</a> last year, announced that its west African affiliate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/05/isis-tries-to-impose-new-leader-on-boko-haram-in-nigeria\">had a new leader</a>. Apparently unhappy with Shekau\u2019s attacks on mosques and Muslim markets, Isis appointed Abu Musab al-Barwani in his place.</p> <p>Shekau released a video in which he appeared to admit defeat, saying in Hausa: \u201cFor me, the end has come.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/family-nigerian-schoolgirl-escaped-boko-haram-bring-back-our-girls\">Family demand news of Nigerian schoolgirl who escaped Boko Haram</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the latest video casts doubt on Shekau\u2019s newfound meekness.</p> <p>Ryan Cummings, a security analyst, said: \u201cIt [the video] refers to Boko Haram by their traditional name.\u201d This name change could suggest that the girls are still being held by Shekau\u2019s faction.</p> <p>Nigeria\u2019s minister of information, Lai Mohammed, said the government was in contact with those behind the video and working to secure the girls\u2019 release.</p> <p>\u201cWe are on top of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are being extremely careful, because the situation has been compounded by the split in the leadership of Boko Haram. We are also being guided by the need to ensure the safety of the girls.</p> <p>\u201cSince this is not the first time we have been contacted over the issue, we want to be doubly sure that those we are in touch with are who they claim to be.\u201d</p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls led to a global campaign, with public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama, calling for their release with the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/nigeria-bringbackourgirls-campaign-one-year-on\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>.</p> <p>The Chibok girls are among the thousands of adults and children that Boko Haram has abducted during its seven-year insurgency.</p> <p>Yakubu\u2019s mother, Esther, wrote a letter to her daughter in April in which she described the effect that the abduction had had on her life.

Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look, and in Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their cases. </p> <p>Soft-spoken and wearing Nikes, Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs. He argued at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, he had a chance: \u201cI might be the next president of the United States.\u201d</p> <p>A just-released <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">WSJ-NBC poll </a> gave Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. In Las Vegas, he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any third-party candidate was somehow wasted. </p> <p> \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change. I hope after having made my pitch today that you\u2019ll realize, if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump, have at it.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who spoke separately at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she dubbed as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominees in US history. <br><br>\u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d <br></p> <p>Stein, who like Johnson represented her party in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100% renewable energy complete by 2030. Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.<br></p> <p>On the Republican side, Evan McMullin, a beneficiary of the grounded \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before he\u2019d even sent out his first campaign release. McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best hope \u2013 and likely his only one \u2013 to make an electoral dent would require Trump\u2019s departure from the race, though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said in his announcement. </p> <p>\u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence, when in 1992, Texan businessman Ross Perot took <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/us/1992-elections-president-overview-clinton-captures-presidency-with-huge.html?pagewanted=all\">18% of the vote</a>, carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory. Some Democrats blamed third-party candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000, but the third-party candidate <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000\">won a paltry 2.74%</a> of the vote, and his supporters were <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-that-love-and-hate-third-party-candidates/\">split</a> between Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he\u2019d seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Their campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>But that was in a relatively tight race. With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third-party candidate could be limited. </p> <p>\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic adviser. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans, he said. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high. Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting. Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton, hinted that a third podium might be needed.</p> <p>\u201cSome of our production people may have said, \u2018Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like,\u2019\u2019 McCurry <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/debates-clinton-trump-johnson-stein-226806\">told Politico</a>. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a nonpartisan polling company, said there was broad support for including even minor candidates. \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included,\u201d he said, \u201cand in an election like this, where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a break with the current two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019 as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarized that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said. </p> <p>Stein advanced a similar argument. \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart,\u201d she said, \u201cand the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d </p> <p>She argued that it was by elections about \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d that the country inherited many of its problems. </p> <p>But first, the two have to get on TV. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that right now, arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",

That is beyond dispute. We can\u2019t deal with this problem until we acknowledge it exists.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, Peter Taaffe, the Socialist party\u2019s leader, and founder member of Militant, told the <em>Guardian</em> that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">hoped to be readmitted to Labour</a>.</p> <p>Corbyn said: \u201cI want people to join for good motives.

But, he hedged, \u201cif they turn negative, I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, Trump has been singing a different tune in the general election, during which he\u2019s mostly trailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Even his moment in the spotlight during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/31/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-convention-speeches-america\">Republican national convention in mid-July</a> was cut short by the Democratic convention just one week later.

How the candidates fare in the polls before election day may yet defy all expectation; this has been a tumultuous election season to say the least. But if history is any guide, Clinton\u2019s current lead hinges on her performance in upcoming debates, the ability to avoid (any more) scandals, and bigger-picture issues like the economy and national security, which are beyond either candidate\u2019s direct control.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>The convention bump: what does it mean, and will it last?</h2> <p>Looking back at previous election years, it\u2019s not unusual to see both candidates rise in the polls after their conventions.

After the Democratic convention, which was first that year, Obama seemed to rise about a point or two in the polls. But a big boost for McCain after the GOP convention the following week gave him about a two-point lead over Obama. In total, McCain got a net gain of about three and a half points but went on to lose to Obama in November.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/07/the-new-postabc-poll-shows-just-how-badly-donald-trump-blew-his-convention/\">nature of Clinton\u2019s gains</a>, combined with Trump\u2019s further stumbles in the past few weeks, could mean that her post-convention rise in the polls marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/upshot/why-a-meaningful-shift-in-the-trump-clinton-race-may-be-at-hand.html\">meaningful shift</a> rather than a temporary gain.<br></p> <p>But even if Clinton\u2019s lead holds for the next few weeks, she shouldn\u2019t get too confident.

After the 2004 and 2012 convention seasons, both George W Bush and Obama were able to hold onto their convention bumps for a few weeks. (For Bush, his post-convention bump lasted about a month. For Obama, his numbers stayed high for two weeks.)<br></p> <p>But, in both cases, the candidates\u2019 poll numbers took a hit after the first debate.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.</a> </figure>  <p>Despite trailing Bush in the polls for much of the fall of 2004, a majority of viewers polled thought John Kerry won the first debate. The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.<br></p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.<br></p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.<br></p> <h2>Economic or geopolitical shocks could move the polls</h2> <p>While it\u2019s easier to predict swings in the polls because of planned events such as conventions and debates, it\u2019s more difficult to forecast how unpredictable factors \u2013 including geopolitical shocks or economic slowdown \u2013 could impact the candidates\u2019 chances of victory.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s reaction to the financial crisis and his association with the outgoing president likely contributed to the collapse of his post-convention polling bounce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-economics/\" data-alt=\"Chart showing McCain's loss in polls after financial crisis comments.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-economics/\">Chart showing McCain's loss in polls after financial crisis comments.</a> </figure>  <p>The morning after Lehman Brothers collapsed, McCain, who was leading in polls at the time, argued that the economy was \u201cfundamentally sound\u201d. The comment caused an uproar. McCain was in the tough position of representing the incumbent party during a financial meltdown and was now on record saying things that further damaged his image. McCain\u2019s poll numbers sank the following week, and he wouldn\u2019t recover his lead again before that year\u2019s election.<br></p> <p>Signs of an economic crisis could particularly hurt Clinton, who has aligned herself closely with Obama\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>Questions of national security \u2013 terrorist attacks or foreign military conflicts \u2013 could throw greater uncertainty into the election, too.<br></p> <p>Security \u2013 and Isis especially \u2013 has been a central issue for both campaigns this year. On terrorism, for instance, some polls show voters believe Clinton would handle such unrest better. Other polls have <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-tied-going-into-conventions-cbsnyt-poll/\">both candidates head to head</a>.<br></p> <h2>Scandals and controversy: will we reach a tipping point?</h2> <p>Scandals and gaffes have hurt candidates before, but whether the same holds true for this election is anyone\u2019s guess. Both Trump and Clinton are trailed by scandal \u2013 the looming Trump University lawsuit and email-gate, respectively.<br></p> <p>The FBI\u2019s decision not to press criminal charges over Clinton\u2019s private email server was a central news story in early July. After FBI director James Comey complained that Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">showed \u201cgross negligence\u201d</a> regarding her emails, Clinton\u2019s poll numbers dropped by a few points, though they\u2019ve bounced back since.

From the day he announced his candidacy, Trump\u2019s speeches, television appearances, and tweets have been rife with insults. But many of his rhetorical barbs didn\u2019t lead to big shifts in his polling numbers \u2013 to the amazement of many analysts.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say that the right insult or combination of controversial statements couldn\u2019t bring down Trump\u2019s chances of getting elected. Just in the past couple weeks, he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">attacked the family</a> of a fallen marine captain, suggested the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">election will be rigged</a>, and hinted at an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">assassination attempt</a> against Clinton. This combination of statements may have contributed to Trump\u2019s dip in the polls after the GOP convention.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But just four years ago, these things mattered.<br></p> <p>In September 2012, Romney was already trailing Obama in the polls when a surreptitiously recorded video leaked of Romney, behind closed doors, describing 47% of Americans as entitled and \u201cdependent upon government, who believe that they are victims\u201d. The polls swung about one percentage point in Obama\u2019s direction shortly thereafter, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sept-27-the-impact-of-the-47-percent/\">Nate Silver estimated</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s still possible that the right controversial statement could cause a shift in this year\u2019s polls, too. After all, there are about three months between now and election day.</p> <ul> <li><em>An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Trump surged to a four-point lead following the Republican convention, when he rose by four points to a one-point lead.</em></li> </ul>",

From my very unscientific sample of half a dozen people, the most common answer was that tickets are too expensive for most locals. The cheapest Olympics tickets are 40Rs (a little under \u00a310) which are mostly for sports that are little known in Brazil such as hockey and rugby. </p> <p>That is a lot for people earning the minimum wage of 880Rs (about \u00a3200), especially when you add the cost of transport to the mostly distant venues. Other answers were that people were opposed to the Olympics on political grounds or that they were not interested in most of the sports.</p> <p>On the subject of ticket give-aways not happening, this may have something to do with a judge\u2019s ruling earlier this year that the Rio government must not hand out tickets in a municipal election year because it might influence votes. I have been trying to get confirmation from Rio2016 but no response yet.<br></p> <p>Finally, it is important to note that this is not just Brazil\u2019s fault. As my colleague Owen Gibson notes part of the problem is that authorised re-sellers (many of whom are based overseas) have not been able to shift tickets. In that case, the empty seats might be caused by the Zika epidemic, crime and other negative stories about Rio in the run-up to the Games.</p> <p>On a separate note, I\u2019m now watching the last two minutes of a cracking basketball game between regional rivals Brazil and Argentina. Just three points in it. The crowd are going crazy. Can\u2019t see an empty seat.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57af7091e4b0c23bfed89310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-13T19:13:52.572Z\">8.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nadal is cooking in the third set, pushing Del Potro on his serve and geeing up the largely pro-Rafa crowd.

You can keep up with all the action as it unfolds on the Guardian live blog, which unlike most events at these Games, never stops.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p> Day seven will go down in history for a number of reasons, not least for the records that fell in the velodrome. In the men\u2019s team pursuit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/team-gb-bradley-wiggins-olympic-gold-mens-team-pursuit-australia\">Team GB triumphed in world record time</a> as <strong>Ed Clancy</strong>, <strong>Steven Burke</strong> and <strong>Owain Doull</strong> played no small part in Bradley Wiggins leaving the arena as Great Britain\u2019s most decorated Olympian. His eight medals \u2013 five of them gold \u2013 lift him above Chris Hoy as the G.O.A.T of Team GB and unless they reintroduce medals for poetry, like the one Pierre de Coubertin won in 1912, there\u2019s little left for the cycling great to achieve. That was bad luck for the Australians, who crossed the line 0.743 seconds slower for silver.</p> <p> Shots have been fired by Team USA\u2019s <strong>Hope Solo</strong>, and we\u2019re not talking about action at the gun range. After Solo and her world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/usa-lose-womens-football-sweden-olympic-quarter-finals-penalty-kicks\">No1-ranked football team-mates were dumped from the Games</a> in a sensational penalty shoot-out, the US goalkeeper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-olympics-football-rio-2016\">accused triumphant victors Sweden of being a bunch of cowards</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it far in the tournament,\u201d Solo said after the game. \u201cI think it was very cowardly. But they won, they moving on and we\u2019re going home.\u201d At least her final thought on the matter rang true: \u201cLosing sucks. I\u2019m really bad at it.\u201d</p> <p> The Games also shift a gear from here on in with action under way in the athletics arena, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/the-athletics-elite-turns-up-on-time-but-rio-seems-still-to-be-in-bed\">but as our own Barney Ronay tells us, there\u2019s just not many people on hand to watch it all</a>. As Olympians compete for gold medals \u2013 and while Ethiopia\u2019s <strong>Almaz Ayana</strong> destroyed the 10,000m world record \u2013 bad weather and what would appear to be local apathy have meant crowds more in line with the Goodwill Games, or perhaps a school sports day.</p> <p>Much happier was the sight of 21-year-old Singaporean <strong>Joseph Schooling</strong> being passed the baton, of sorts, when he usurped <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> for gold in the 100m butterfly, a final in which there was an incredible three-way dead heat for silver. Schooling is yet another in the long line of athletes at these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/michael-phelps-taught-a-lesson-for-once-by-singapores-joseph-schooling\">Games who had their photo taken with Phelps</a> as gawky young children. </p> <p><strong><strong>You should also know:</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/north-korean-weightlifter-says-olympic-gold-will-make-beloved-kim-jong-un-happy\"> North Korean athletes say gold would make Kim Jong-un happy, which seems an understatement.</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/mark-cavendish-british-cycling-row-denial\">British Cycling have been forced to deny a rift between Mark Cavendish and Team GB\u2019s coach</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/sir-bradley-wiggins-pulls-clear-from-roll-of-british-sporting-greats\">Owen Gibson has everything you\u2019ll need to know about Bradley Wiggins reaching the summit.</a> </li> </ul> <h2> Team GB roundup</h2> <p> Putting aside all the gold being won in the velodrome, Team GB has also triumphed in the rowing, where <strong>Helen Glover </strong>and<strong> Heather Stanning</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/helen-glover-heather-stanning-rio-2016-olympics-rowing\">retained their Olympic coxless pairs title</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve been so emotional this week and that\u2019s not me at all,\u201d said Stanning, the army major who followed her 2012 medal with a tour of Helmand Province. A real under-achiever, in other words. </p> <p> After that, <strong>Alex Gregory</strong>, <strong>Constantine Louloudis</strong>, <strong>George </strong><strong>Nash</strong> and <strong>Mo Sbihi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/great-britain-mens-four-olympic-gold\">rowed \u201cthe perfect race\u201d </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/great-britain-mens-four-olympic-gold\">to win gold in the men\u2019s four</a>.

  "<p>The stark media question of June is back,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/business/balance-fairness-and-a-proudly-provocative-presidential-candidate.html\" title=\"\"> demanding answers in August</a>. \u201cIf you\u2019re a working journalist and you believe that Donald J Trump is a demagogue playing to the nation\u2019s worst racist and nationalistic tendencies, that he cosies up to anti-American dictators and that he would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes, how the heck are you supposed to cover him?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s that fairness-and-balance dilemma that haunted the BBC through Brexit, posed in extreme terms. And Jim Rutenberg, the media correspondent of the <em>New York Times</em>, wriggles to find a response. This is \u201cuncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, non-opinion journalist I\u2019ve ever known, and, by normal standards, untenable\u201d. It \u201cupsets balance, that idealistic form of journalism with a capital \u2018J\u2019 we\u2019ve been trained to always strive for\u201d. But, \u201clet\u2019s face it: balance has been on vacation since Mr Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy\u201d.</p> <p>Ah! The wriggle room opens into a broader corridor. Because Trump received so much natural coverage early on, because he was a bird of exotic plumage made for TV sofas, so there\u2019s a sort of justice in watching him being taken apart later on, in the more serious part of the campaign. Fate supposedly supplies a fairness that mere reporters can\u2019t manage.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. But that\u2019s pretty damned convenient. And it doesn\u2019t quite measure up to the challenge. The <em>New York Times</em> has hardly been full of judicious articles examining the deeper meaning and validity of Trumpism, but it\u2019s been a paragon compared with a <em>Washington Post</em> stuffed day after day with pieces taking a chainsaw to the Donald. \u201cTrump\u2019s shallowness runs deep\u201d; how \u201cthe Republican party has lost its soul\u201d; see \u201cthe 30-second video that is absolutely devastating for Trump\u201d; why \u201cDonald Trump is suffering from mushroom breath\u201d. And so on and so balefully forth.</p> <p>There\u2019s no pretence of artificial fairness here, more a howl of foreboding as stumble turns to freefall in a hapless row over assassinating Clinton. \u201cWe have not seen a major-party nominee this determined to lie, this personally erratic or this lacking in self-control. A he said/she said account of the race therefore is misleading,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/08/08/media-objectivity-should-not-mean-indifference-to-truth/?utm_term=.e2c63a49ad1f\" title=\"\">cries Jennifer Rubin in the <em>Post</em></a>.</p> <p>Examine the \u201cmassive confusion about the demands of \u2018objectivity\u2019\u201d, she says. \u201cFalse balance (Vladimir Putin says Russia is not in Ukraine; the US administration says it is) cannot substitute for presentation of ascertainable fact. (Vladimir Putin falsely claims Russia is not in Ukraine; the administration has identified Russian forces...) Ironically, American conservatives used to be critics of postmodernism, arguing that there are knowable, objective facts. It seems to have escaped notice, however, that this standard is as applicable to politics as it is to other endeavours.\u201d</p> <p>Thus, by fair means denouncing foul conduct, the US press that perennially makes a big, often self-regarding issue of its fairness and balance (in contrast to utterly unbalanced cable news) seems to declare Trump a special case where the rules don\u2019t apply. \u201cIt may not always seem fair to Mr Trump or his supporters,\u201d Rutenberg concludes. \u201cBut journalism shouldn\u2019t measure itself against any one campaign\u2019s definition of fairness. It is journalism\u2019s job to be true to the readers and viewers, and true to the facts, in a way that will stand up to history\u2019s judgment. To do anything less would be untenable.\u201d</p> <p>But the difficulty \u2013 the special British Brexit difficulty \u2013 is that what\u2019s untenable in the States is legally impossible here. Laura Kuenssberg\u2019s BBC paddle round the debris of the UK Brexit campaign last week wasn\u2019t particularly revealing because the big beasts of success and failure (Boris, Gove, Osborne and the PM we used to call Dave) had made an excuse and clammed up. But her tour of rival spin doctors at least brought Matthew Elliott, Leave\u2019s supreme director, to our screens, confirming with a smirk that the supposed \u00a3350m heading to Brussels each week was big on the side of the bus because it stirred up controversy over the cost of the EU rather than representing any kind of objective truth about future NHS funding. Oh! And the battle bus itself was deliberately painted red to confuse Labour voters who didn\u2019t know which side their party was on.</p> <p>Mini-Trumpery, you might say. One monster whopper tossed into a foetid pool of mendacity and Remain exaggeration. But the question of principle here \u2013 the question that has America\u2019s editors in a twist \u2013 can\u2019t be brushed away. The BBC in particular and public service in general has Ofcom holding the statutory fairness ring. That\u2019s she said/he said according to the rulebook. You might offer countervailing facts on your website. You might ask hard questions once the campaign is over. But while referendums or elections are live, the room for manoeuvre over truth and fiction is officially defined and patrolled, with licence-fee menaces just offstage.</p> <p>In short, if Trump were prospective PM here and now, then mandatory fairness and balance would be his greatest friend \u2013 just as it drove the notorious Boris bus. And our legislation deems that this must be so because it expects politicians to tell the truth \u2013 or at least heightened, defensible versions of it. Big lies not included.</p> <p>Of course old Remain supporters should just get over the loss and get on with their lives. But that\u2019s no reason not to recognise whopping holes in the media road \u2013 or not to agonise over mending them \u2013 before the next counterfactual disaster of a crash.</p>",
  "<p>The most dangerous phrase in the English language is \u201cbe a man\u201d. To be a man today, says film-maker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, is to fight for success and sex, to reject empathy, and to never, ever cry. The result is depression, anxiety and violence.</p> <p>Siebel Newsom\u2019s first documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/03/feminist-film-maker-taking-on-hollywood\"><em>Miss Representation</em></a>, explored the way the media contributes to the under-representation of women in power, and premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. When she was touring with the film she was pregnant with her second child, a son. And as she discussed the need for positive female role models, she inevitably heard from audiences asking: \u201cBut what about the boys?\u201d Some $100,000 of Kickstarter donations later, she premiered <em>The Mask You Live In</em>. It has just arrived on Netflix, a fast edit of men talking wearily, and boys confused; an attempt to speak to what she calls the \u201cboy crisis\u201d. As a child, one young contributor says quietly, he used to have a group of close friends. Now he\u2019s a teenager he struggles in \u201cfinding people I can talk to... because I feel like I\u2019m not supposed to get help\u201d. \u201cIf you never cry,\u201d says another, \u201cthen you have all these feelings stuffed up inside you and then you can\u2019t get them out.\u201d In this film, Siebel Newsom calls for a whole new masculinity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you never cry, then you have all these feelings stuffed up inside you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The day I spoke to her, I passed three boys sitting at a bus stop. One was describing how gorgeous his wife would be when he grew up. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so hot... and I\u2019m going to cheat on her like crazy.\u201d At 42, Siebel Newsom has recently given birth to her fourth child with husband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-newsom\">Gavin</a>, former mayor of San Francisco, current lieutenant governor of California, and the man best known for greenlighting same-sex marriages long before US courts had sanctioned the practice. She deftly juggles our interview with her son\u2019s insistent attempts to pull her away to play \u2013 what this means is she gets to the point. When she started researching, she found boys were more likely than girls to be diagnosed with a behaviour disorder, more likely to be prescribed stimulant medications, more likely to binge drink, more likely to be expelled from school, and more likely to commit a violent crime. At university entry level in the UK, women outnumber men in two-thirds of subjects. Three to four times as many men take their own lives than women; men aged between 20 and 49 are more likely to die from suicide than any other single form of death. \u201cKnowing all this,\u201d says Siebel Newsom, \u201cand being pregnant with a son, I knew that not only did I want to make sure he didn\u2019t become one of those statistics, but that I had to help change this culture for everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c7d8afeeeaca1fbf93b32eac5cc3ada22f9ad1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c7d8afeeeaca1fbf93b32eac5cc3ada22f9ad1e/14_0_1593_956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life lessons: educator and youth advocate Ashanti Branch discusses feelings with a group of teenage boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life lessons: educator and youth advocate Ashanti Branch discusses feelings with a group of teenage boys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of therepresentationproject-org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019ll take more than a film, she admits. Her nonprofit organisation, The Representation Project, works alongside the films, campaigning to challenge stereotypes. The most persuasive element, though, is Siebel Newsom herself who, in her previous life as an actor, was told to remove her Stanford MBA from her CV because it was \u201cthreatening\u201d, but who still has that actorly skill of talking in a way that will make people listen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Experts link the repression of growing up male with mass shootings and murder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In one scene in the documentary, a teacher gives a group of boys each a piece of paper. On one side they write how they are seen by other people, and on the other what they are feeling. Then they scrunch it up and throw it into the circle. On the outside of all the notes were words like \u201ctough\u201d, \u201cfearless\u201d. Inside, \u201clonely\u201d. It\u2019s with awkward agony that one boy rests a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder as he cries into his fists. The shock comes with the realisation they all feel the same. Experts swiftly link the repression required when growing up male with mass shootings and murder, which makes the film particularly poignant today. But while <em>Miss Representation </em>featured talking heads like Gloria Steinem, Jane Fonda and Condoleezza Rice, there are no recognisable faces in her second film. She pauses when I ask why. \u201cIt was largely because they didn\u2019t exist,\u201d she says. \u201cMen are not speaking publicly about these issues.\u201d The implication is that their silence is part of the problem.</p> <p>Is masculinity really a mask? The film is compelling \u2013 her experts in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, sports, education and media are obviously knowledgeable and passionate \u2013 but the idea that the manliness they discuss is purely cultural isn\u2019t questioned. In <a href=\"http://time.com/2974/masculinity-is-more-than-a-mask/\"><em>Time</em></a> magazine, Christina Hoff Sommers (author of two \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/24/men-women-masculinity-feminism\">meninist</a>\u201d books about boys) worries Siebel Newsom is less concerned with helping boys than with \u201cre-engineering their masculinity according to specifications from some out-of-date gender studies textbook\u201d. She suggests talking about emotions might have less \u201cvalue\u201d for boys, that men\u2019s stoicism is protective. She says the film is misleading, giving the impression that boys are severely depressed, stating contrasting figures showing clinical depression is much lower than in girls. Hoff Sommers\u2019s most persuasive suggestion is that instead of simply critiquing masculinity, Siebel Newsom\u2019s first objective should be to help mental health services to adapt to better meet the needs of men, conditioned or not : to harness that competitiveness, aggression, to reflect the energy back and use them for good. To defeat an enemy, like Captain America with his reflective shield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21ba26846aaf10cb559e5cd1b7ce099fad30c31c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21ba26846aaf10cb559e5cd1b7ce099fad30c31c/0_0_1795_1077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching across the divide: Siebel Newsom during the production of her documentary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reaching across the divide: Siebel Newsom during the production of her documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of therepresentationproject-org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But perhaps that\u2019s next \u2013 Siebel Newsom says this is just the beginning. Since premiering the film, she sees the results of the boy crisis everywhere, from misogynist responses to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to the recent Stanford University rape case, where the father of an athlete convicted on multiple charges of sexual assault said his son should not have to go to prison for \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d. \u201cThe way the father and the judge protected that young boy showed again how we privilege white males and star athletes,\u201d says Siebel Newsom. \u201cAs a society, we need to take a real look at that and recognise the damage that is being done when we continue to privilege those classes, those communities, and blame the victim.\u201d</p> <p>After screenings, Siebel Newsom says men approach her, crying. \u201cThere were men in their 70s saying, \u2018That was my life.\u2019 Men in their 20s and 30s who\u2019d tell us they no longer feel so alone. And men in their 40s who have children who go, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to raise my own sons differently.\u2019\u201d She was moved. \u201cThat is where we have to inspire the good men, the brave men, the courageous men, to stand up to those who are trying to belittle them. We\u2019re not going to move the needle on gender parity, on violence, until we have more men entering the conversation and using their platform to support those of us who are trying to do good.\u201d</p> <p>When making the film, she says she was taken aback. \u201cWhat really surprised me was how pure and gentle and confused boys were,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they felt so much pressure to become someone they felt they weren\u2019t. \u2018I don\u2019t want to date girls, I just want to be friends with them\u2019; \u2018I don\u2019t know why I only have to play football.\u2019 It\u2019s in those school years where they start feeling this need to disconnect, and you see the pain, anxiety, the alienation that results from them denying their true selves. It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I hear her son calling for her again. \u201cBecause, at the end of the day,\u201d she adds, \u201cnobody wins.\u201d</p> <h2>Matthew Ryder: \u2018My dad\u2019s notion of being a man was flexible\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"324d4a77b6f740731f858b8bc196e097be59e2d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/324d4a77b6f740731f858b8bc196e097be59e2d5/85_29_1403_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Ryder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I was growing up, my father\u2019s explanation of \u2018being a man\u2019 could be bewildering. \u2018It\u2019s not about what sex you are,\u2019 he would say, before adding even more confusingly, \u2018Your mother can teach you more about being a man than anyone I know.\u2019</p> <p>Eventually I understood. Unlike many fathers in the 1970s, his concept of being a man was not the opposite of being feminine or emotional. It was the opposite of being childish and immature. It meant having the courage to face your fears and responsibilities, but also not being afraid of your emotions or weaknesses. It was about being a trusted friend and an equal partner.</p> <p>He could have just said \u2018be a good person\u2019 rather than \u2018be a man\u2019. But it wouldn\u2019t have had the same effect. He knew that, as a boy, I would one day be interacting with the rest of the world as an adult male \u2013 a man. I was going to have to understand what that meant in my dealings with women, with other men, and with society as a whole. If he did not give me a positive identity of what it was to be man, he knew that one of the many negative ones would quickly fill the vacuum. He was giving me an identity that would prepare me for life.</p> <p>Over the years, that identity grounded me through my successes and failures. It also meant that, despite my youthful love of hip-hop, reggae and sports, I was never really seduced by the cartoonish, misogynistic versions of manhood \u2013black manhood, in particular \u2013 that they often offered. It inoculated me from the worst excesses of testosterone-fuelled nonsense.</p> <p>My father\u2019s notion of being a man was also flexible. As I grew from a child of the 70s to an adult of the 90s, it grew with me. I learned that sometimes a man should back down from a fight; that real men are also feminists; and that not being seen as a \u2018sissy\u2019 is meaningless, while not being homophobic is important.</p> <p>In a modern, gender-fluid world, is the notion of being a man still relevant? Are we not all just people? Yes and no. The philosopher Jerry Cohen wrote: \u2018There is no way of being human, other than a way of being human.\u2019 Being a man is one of those ways.</p> <p>Matthew Ryder is a QC and part-time judge.

I was never happier than when I was sitting on his knee watching westerns like Wagon Train and Rawhide on our tiny black-and-white TV.</p> <p>My father was cowboy mad and so was I. After I said my prayers for all the people I loved, my mother had to wait until I was in bed and fast asleep before she could gently relieve me of my beloved cowboy suit. Cowboys were real men. They were tough and they never cried.</p> <p>But when my mother was killed in a road crash less than a year later, I cried. My father had to be cut from the wreckage and, when he came home, I cried again. In place of my funny, loving, playful dad was a grieving, selfish, violent drunk. He beat the women he lived with and he beat me. I loved him still, but learned to hate him just as much. The care home I was sent to at 11 was full of boys like me. No aspiring train drivers or astronauts among us \u2013 we told each other that, when we grew up, we\u2019d be gangsters and crooks. No crying allowed.</p> <p>My teenage years were punctuated by spells in prisons that lionised toughness and frowned on cry-babies. Lifting weights and being \u2018hard\u2019 was what counted, what got respect. At 20, I should have been a man. Instead, like my father, I\u2019d become a selfish, violent drunk.</p> <p>Self-loathing took me down a dark road, leaving in my wake immeasurable pain and grief. At the end of it, an Old Bailey judge called me \u2018brutal, vicious and callous\u2019 and jailed me for life. Two years in, a prison psychologist told me, \u2018We\u2019re all born lovable.\u2019 I said, \u2018Even me?\u2019 She said, \u2018Even you.\u2019 Contrition almost destroyed me. For the first time in a long time I cried again. I was desperate to be a man. I just wasn\u2019t sure what that meant. In the end, I decided to try to just be a decent human being. Trying to be a man had been catastrophic.</p> <p>Erwin James is the author of <em>Redeemable, a Memoir of Darkness and Hope</em> (\u00a313.93, bookshop.theguardian.com)</p> <h2>Horatio Clare: \u2018Being a man is being kind when frightened\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"04f6c1958f885cd3d08e94a3f64fd36022756cc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04f6c1958f885cd3d08e94a3f64fd36022756cc9/0_426_2009_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Horatio Clare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When we are boys, we believe we must study Dad and be like him.

He had \u2018problems\u2019, according to Mum, and he married four women before he settled down. But he is kind, peaceable, slow to anger, very funny, and skilled.</p> <p>I was quite funny but otherwise hopelessly unlike him. I loved speed, spending, girls and guns. Over the decades of my \u2018manning up\u2019 I accrued convictions for arson, taking without consent (car), ditto (boat), ditto (milk float) and all sorts of decorations for dope. Change my background and I would have been a suicide bomber. No question.</p> <p>You could apply the same criminal record to my relationships with women. Not in the manner of loving them, for I think I am gentle, too, but in the leaving. Porn, piracy, hijack, honeytrap: in my pursuit of love I have committed and been had by all these. And the frightening thing is, however special I thought I might be, in my teeny ravings, which are ongoing in the male part of my lizard brain, I\u2019m not. The blindness testosterone causes accounts for much, we know, and being a man is being blind, \u2018sand-blind, gravel-blind\u2019 as Shakespeare had an old man say, and frightened. That\u2019s the job, I think \u2013 to be kind when blind and frightened.</p> <p>The only teacher I had, really, who lived with the knowledge she would watch us go wild into a wild world, was my mum.

At this stage, there can\u2019t be many people who haven\u2019t, at one time or another, fretted about this question. After all, the technology has invaded every aspect of our lives; it is changing social and private behaviour, having a disproportionate impact on our children and facilitating types of criminal and antisocial behaviour that are repulsive and sometimes terrifying. And it is now also changing democratic politics: the most interesting thing about Donald Trump is how his narcissistic personality has found its perfect expression in Twitter \u2013 which is how we come to have <a href=\"http://www.maryaiken.com/news/2016/6/17/welcome-to-the-troll-election\" title=\"\">an internet troll running for president</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aiken finds it alarming that parents of babies believe that it\u2019s good for infants to have access to technology</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But at the same time our public discourse about technology remains depressingly Manichaean \u2013 with enthusiasts (and a formidably powerful global industry) extolling its wonders, while critics focus only on its manifest downsides. But this isn\u2019t a proper debate: we are like two drunks in a bar arguing about whether oxygen is, on balance, a good or a bad thing.</p> <p>The reality is that digital technology (like most technologies) is <em>both</em> good and bad. And, as with oxygen, it\u2019s not going to go away. So the only rational way forward is to figure out how to live intelligently with it. But in order to do that we need to understand it. The industry and its boosters have done a pretty good job in explaining the advantages. What we lack is an informed understanding of the problems, dangers and pathologies to which it gives rise.</p> <p>This is the gap that Dr Aiken seeks to fill. As a psychologist, her prime interest is in the scientific understanding of online behaviour. \u201cIf I seem to focus on many of the negative aspects of technology,\u201d she writes, \u201cit is in order to bring the debate back to the balanced centre rather than have one driven by utopian idealism or commercialism. My job is just to provide the best wisdom possible, based on what we know about human beings and how their cognitive, behavioural, physiological, social, developmental, affective, and motivational capabilities have been exploited or compromised or changed by the design of these products.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/why-spending-more-time-on-the-internet-is-a-good-thing\">Why spending more time on the internet is a good thing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her book has to cover a lot of ground. She begins with fetishes and addiction and leaves one in little doubt that the old boast of the now defunct <em>News of the World</em> (\u201cAll&nbsp;human life is here\u201d) is definitely fulfilled by the internet. Aiken\u2019s point is really just that the network provides unprecedented opportunities for personalities that are warped in particular ways to follow their inclinations, harmless or otherwise.</p> <p>But in a way, we knew much of this. Where Aiken really hits her stride is in three central chapters covering the impact of digital technology on children and young people. Here she makes a powerful case for the view that our society has been criminally negligent in the way it puts children in the harm\u2019s way of digital technology. This is partly about the usual dangers of pornography, paedophilia, cyberbullying etc, but it\u2019s just as much about the casual laxity of parents, and the way in which the technology industry continues to avoid responsibility for the perils that it facilitates and the damage that its products can do.</p> <p>For example, Aiken finds it alarming (as I do) that parents of babies mistakenly believe that it\u2019s good for infants to have access to the technology from very young ages. As I write, I\u2019m looking at the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Ipad-Apptivity-Seat-Newborn-to-Toddler/dp/B00EL4NI5U\" title=\"\">Fisher-Price iPad Apptivity Seat</a>, which Amazon.com is selling for $57.99.

Yet it turns out that between 23% and 34% of kids under that age have Facebook accounts. When asked why the company doesn\u2019t enforce its own rules, a spokesman shrugged. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a mechanism for eradicating the problem,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/23/facebook-admits-powerless-young-users\" title=\"\">he said</a>. For a company with the technological resources of Facebook, this is simply not a credible response. The real reason must be that keeping underage users out is not a corporate priority.</p> <p>Other areas covered by Aiken are online dating, cyberchondria and cybercrime, but the real strength of this&nbsp;book is the persuasive case it makes for taking seriously the potential&nbsp;damage to children. This is partly \u2013 but only partly \u2013 a matter of regulation, which in relation to the internet is always a tricky problem. But it\u2019s mainly a problem of the cognitive dissonance which afflicts us all in relation to digital technology. Most of us love it and value the ways it enhances our lives and augments our capabilities. (What is the web, after all, but a memory prosthesis for humanity?) But, deep down, as we see what digital technology is doing to behaviour, relationships, crime and politics, we\u2019re also aware that it\u2019s becoming increasingly dangerous and problematic \u2013 and that it\u2019s our grandchildren who will really reap this whirlwind.

  "<p>Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Muslim woman from Maplewood, New Jersey, stood on a medal stand Saturday night, wearing a black hijab and squeezing the hands of two other women from New Jersey. The one on her left was born in Poland and had purple hair. The one on the right was born in New York and graduated from Penn State University. They were all three, a sliver of the America they represented as a bronze medal sabre fencing team. As much a story of their country as their blonde team-mate from Oregon who stood at the end and went to Notre Dame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/katie-ledecky-swimming-2016-dominant-athlete\">For the remarkable Katie Ledecky, the future appears limitless | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No American medal at these Olympics might matter as much as the bronze circle that dangled around the neck of Muhammad and her team-mates. Not this summer, not when a presidential candidate says people like her don\u2019t belong in his country and doesn\u2019t appear to know what an American actually is. So on Saturday she grabbed the hand of her purple-haired teammate from Poland and her New York-born teammate who went to Penn State and they threw their arms in the air. Then they watched the American flag rise into the rafters.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that through my experiences here at the Olympic games \u2013 winning a medal \u2013 that I combat those stereotypes about Muslims and African Americans, and even women,\u201d she said after her Olympics were over. \u201cWe\u2019re like any other athletes we have worked really hard for this, and I can\u2019t think of a more deserving group of girls to go home with a medal.\u201d</p> <p>She said this medal mattered more than any individual honor that could have come here way at these Olympics. She had spent too many days and months with the women on the platform beside her, working and training and pushing to get to these Olympics, to represent their country. Saturday afternoon was their last chance together, their final hope at Olympic glory. They had all fallen short in individual competitions this week. The team meet was the end. If they lost they would come home with nothing. That they came back from a semi-final loss to trounce Italy 45-30 brought a satisfaction she struggled to put into words.</p> <p>\u201cTo win with this team really means a lot,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.</p> <p>Again and again, Muhammad said these Olympics have been about her and her team-mates. She has said she loves them dearly and wanted badly for them to leave here with a reward for the time they had spent trying to build a power here. The team\u2019s coaches even inserted Monica Aksamit, the one born in New York who went to Penn State, in the bronze medal match against Italy simply so she could claim her medal too. As the alternate, Aksamit would never go in Olympic history as a member of this team.</p> <p>But the real history here was Muhammad, and not just because she became the first American to compete in a hijab. The bigger history is that she didn\u2019t squander her opportunity to speak out against intolerance, that she didn\u2019t politely muzzle her voice against the screams of a political campaign that has run off the rails of common sense. Instead, she used the Olympics to show that a 30-year-old woman from New Jersey can grow up with a sports dream and fulfill it, just like Katie Ledecky or Simone Biles or the women\u2019s eight rowers who celebrated gold Saturday on the banks of an Ipanema lagoon.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I believe so we are in a really peculiar time in our country, where people are comfortable saying things about particular groups, and they encourage fear, and they encourage violence, and I want to challenge those ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel I have to use my platform as an athlete to speak up, and hopefully provide change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>She watched a lot of the coverage of Muhammad Ali\u2019s life after he died a few weeks back. Being just 30, she didn\u2019t know much about him, even though they share a faith and a spotlight and now a legacy as Olympic medal winners. She was too young to have watched him fight, and by the time she was an adult he had started his long slide from public life. Until his death he was a name and a vague concept of a battle for acceptance. Watching those videos of his speeches, hearing his story, she came to realize he was so much more.</p> <p>Already, Muhammad had made the decision to speak out, even telling Time magazine\u2019s Sean Gregory earlier this year that \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/fencer/\">\u201dthat if Donald Trump had his way, America would be white, there wouldn\u2019t be any color and there wouldn\u2019t be any diversity.\u201d</a> But Ali\u2019s story inspired her to fight even more to make sure she didn\u2019t waste these Olympics to show her country and the world that Americans look exactly like her.</p> <p>She said repeatedly in her days here that people need to see that Muslim women can be athletic, that African American women do sports like fencing, and that women should not be trapped to the home. She also said that an Olympic medal would give hope to young girls just like herself once, that they can aspire to an Olympics too and watch their country\u2019s flags rise while wearing medals around their necks.</p> <p>Someone asked if she thought more athletes should speak out and she nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not use your platform to change our condition to help make our world a better place?\u201d</p> <p>Then she smiled. Beside her stood her American team-mates, who, just like her, are pieces of a mosaic that is the United States. She wore a Team USA jacket and held in her hand a folded-up American flag. And she savored a victory that was just as American as any other in these Olympics. </p>"
