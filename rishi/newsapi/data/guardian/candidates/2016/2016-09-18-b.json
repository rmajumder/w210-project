  "<p>If there was a high point in the reputation and significance of fact checkers, wonks and poll crunchers it came during the 2012 US presidential campaign.

It was the election in which Barack Obama cited fact checkers in the <a href=\"http://debates.org/index.php?page=october-22-2012-the-third-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">third presidential debate</a> to counter Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Obama had gone on an \u201capology tour\u201d.</p> <p>It was also the election in which the poll aggregators such as Nate Silver had put down their glasses by the time of that third debate, and called the race for Obama. It was the election where insiders such as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan came to grief, believing their finger on the pulse was <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/11/05/monday-morning/\">more accurate than the polls</a>.</p> <p>It was a total victory for the wonks, the fact checkers, the poll crunchers.</p> <p>Four years later we have Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination with a record number of fact-checked lies, the British voting to leave the EU despite all advice to the contrary, the local ABC\u2019s own fact-checking unit being axed and Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hey-at-least-the-cavs-might-not-get-swept/\">538 statistical site</a> even getting the result of the NBA final series wrong.</p> <p>What the hell? With this seeming failure has come no small amount of glee from progressives. While poll analysts and fact checkers are not the same, they do work on the same side of the street, and are the cause of much angst among progressives, which would seem odd given progressives as a rule generally perform better on fact checks.</p> <p>After the recent Australian federal election, Fairfax\u2019s Matthew Knott reviewed the media\u2019s coverage, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016-opinion/election-2016-the-uncomfortable-truth-is-the-media-got-it-wrong-how-did-we-do-it-20160705-gpzatm\">in which he admitted</a>, \u201cThose political reporters not too hubristic to engage in self doubt are asking: did we get it wrong? Did we, as a collective, miss the story?\u201d</p> <p>The story that was seemingly missed was not a policy or a hidden funding cut, but the margin of victory by the LNP. But really, who gives a damn? If you think the prime role of your job as a journalist covering an election is to predict the results, then there is a lot more wrong than just whether or not your prediction was faulty.</p> <p>But the devotion to polling and prediction is also a concern for progressives because inherently polls \u2013 and thus their analysis \u2013 reinforce the status quo. As US political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg has noted, the growth of public polling has been \u201cmost damaging to the political fortunes of the groups that represented the interest and aspirations of the working classes\u201d.</p> <p>Without polling, politicians can only gauge voters\u2019 moods on certain issues either through meetings with constituents, letters or through observing political actions such as protests, strikes or rallies. Polls can give equal weight to the attitudes of the uninterested and the politically active.</p> <p>For the progressive wonks the worry is not so much about advocating policies or programs that are detrimental to society, but whether the need for data and evidence means your arguments are being ignored by those who matter (itself an issue for debate) and that secondly you are pushing the debate towards the centre \u2013 and also being part of the movement that then pushes that centre ever more to the right.</p> <p>Among the most common strawman arguments is that the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s ascendancy prove that relying on fact-checking and wonks is doomed to failure. And there may be truth in that, but I\u2019ve yet to hear anyone suggest that facts should be the only weapon used in a debate. No election \u2013 not even the fact-checking triumph of 2012 \u2013 has ever been won on the basis of who told the fewest lies. Similarly no policy debate has ever been won just because a group of experts did a review and someone tweeted a graph.</p> <p>If you are arguing that there needs to be action on climate change, yes you\u2019re going to need more than a graph to do it. But you\u2019re also going to struggle without one. A concept as divorced from most people\u2019s lives as is climate change needs at the very least to be fought with data \u2013 especially when the opposing side is doing its best to suggest their data shows there is no need to worry. Among the most influential examples was the ultra-wonky documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Did the film win the debate? Did its numerous graphs on climate change lead to global action that saw a price on carbon? Well no, but that\u2019s not to say nothing was gained \u2013 more perhaps that progressives have a tendency to discredit their victories. Australia did implement a price on carbon.</p> <p>Now perhaps the reason the ALP subsequently lost the 2013 election was because there was too much of an emphasis on data and economic neoliberalism and not enough talk of values. Or perhaps the main reason we no longer have a price on carbon is because the ALP lost the election after three years fanning a dumpster-fire of internal division.</p> <p>Who can say. But the wonk critics do also have a point. Despite what the authors of books such as Freakonomics might attest, economics neither explains everything in life nor persuades. Fact-checking is particularly useless at countering prejudice. A graph on the improvement of GDP from immigration is unlikely to switch the votes of people from Trump or One Nation hostile to the very idea of foreigners.</p> <p>While there may be some objective centrists, I would argue in Australia the progressive wonks \u2013 and I put myself in this camp \u2013 write as much with passion for a cause as they do with passion for facts. When I write an article to dismiss the claims regarding the numbers of welfare recipients, I don\u2019t do it from some neutral point of view. I do it because people are lying in order to hurt the most disadvantaged in society. I\u2019m not going to ignore the lie\u2014and using facts to counter it is not I would argue some anodyne approach.</p> <p>The adherence to data can easily lead the wonks to prefer the safety of the status quo. This was something I was conscious of when arguing against the Abbott plan for extending paid parental leave to full replacement-wage level for 26 weeks. I argued that such a plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/10/abbotts-paid-parental-leave-will-do-little-to-bring-women-to-the-workforce\">would do little to increase women\u2019s workforce participation</a> (the aim of the policy), and that the money would be better spent on child care. I could see the moral argument that paid parental leave should be paid regardless of the parents\u2019 income, but I could also see the moral argument that governments should aim to improve the standard of living for women with children. For me the better policy response was in broader childcare policy rather than an expanded PPL. </p> <p>But the risk \u2013 as soon as you suggest factors such as the size of a budget deficit should be considered \u2013 is that such an approach will always see you favouring a more centrist position. Consider for example the common argument about government spending and the size of the budget. During the last election campaign Anthony Albanese argued that \u201cspending is higher as a proportion of GDP today than it was under the global financial crisis\u201d. The ABC\u2019s fact-checking unit <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/fact-check-is-government-spending-today-higher-than-gfc/7459392\">found that statement to be incorrect</a> because in one year during the GFC government spending was marginally higher.</p> <p>This set off quite a debate \u2013 especially online involving economist Stephen Koukoulas, who argued the ABC fact checkers had taken far too narrow a view of what constituted the GFC period. And yet to what end was the fight? Do progressives really care that the ALP spent less than an LNP government? Doesn\u2019t that merely reinforce the conservative position that smaller government is better?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/close-call-how-the-pollsters-got-the-election-result-right\">Close call: how the pollsters got the election result right | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Progressives love to blame themselves. Rare is an election defeat by the ALP that does not result in great internal angst, gnashing of teeth and writing of books charting what went right and what needs to be done. Such self-reflection certainly is preferable to the view that it is always the other side or the media which that is at fault \u2013 or even worse, that voters are to blame. But the anti-wonk fight is a futile one. Progressives should not give up on the facts, if only because doing so cedes the space to the conservative forces.<br></p> <p>The wonks themselves need, however, to watch whether their work is merely perpetuating a status quo due to a fear of the bold, or a disinclination to countenance an upset, or because the lines within which they fight have been laid out by the conservative side. </p> <p>But mostly they need to be wary that their adherence to the data can see them lose sight of the greater truth: that despite what some might have thought in 2012, facts \u2013 whether they be on GDP, climate temperatures or any other data \u2013 are not the only truth in life, or politics.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

  "<p>Berlin is likely to get the first leftwing triple-coalition government in its history, after Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party and the ruling Social Democrats both plummeted to their lowest result in the Germany capital.</p> <p>Centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) came out top with 21.6% of the vote, ahead of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on 17.5%. Leftwing Die Linke came third on 15.7%, ahead of the Greens on 15.1%. </p> <p>Anti-immigration populists Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland are set to enter the German capital\u2019s state parliament for the first time, with 14.1%.</p> <p>Days before the election, mayor Michael M\u00fcller had warned that a double-digit score for the AfD \u201cwould be seen around the world as a sign of the return of the rightwing and the Nazis in Germany\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a26e21195870b5aa689b856fb8703ea657c4e402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a26e21195870b5aa689b856fb8703ea657c4e402/0_295_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The AfD\u2019s Georg Pazderski and Joerg Meuthen celebrate the first exit polls of the Berlin city-state election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AfD\u2019s Georg Pazderski and Joerg Meuthen celebrate the first exit polls of the Berlin city-state election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBerlin is not any old city\u201d, the Social Democrat (SPD) politician wrote on Facebook on Thursday. \u201cBerlin is the city that transformed itself from the capital of Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany into a beacon of freedom, tolerance, diversity and social cohesion.\u201d</p> <p>Before an election in which about 2.48m people were eligible to vote, M\u00fcller had indicated that he would prefer not to continue governing the city in a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between centre left and centre right, seeking a coalition with the Green party instead.</p> <p>To gain a governing majority, the two parties will require the support of a third party, such as the Left party or the liberal Free Democrats, who managed to get back into parliament with 6.7%.</p> <p>Berlin, once hailed as \u201cpoor but sexy\u201d by its former mayor Klaus Wowereit, has seen unemployment rates drop below 10% and tax earnings rise in recent years. But a population growth of 40,000 residents a year has led to a build-up in state bureaucracy and given rise to fears of urban gentrification.</p> <p>Asked by pollsters which issues had most influenced their votes, <a href=\"http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2016-09-18-LT-DE-BE/index.shtml\">Berliners in the west and the east</a> listed social justice, the local economy and the state of the education system above the management of the refugee crisis.</p> <p>The month of campaigning in the German capital was dominated by rising rental prices and the ongoing fiasco of the new Berlin Brandenburg airport rather than refugees or fear of terror attacks.</p> <p>Unlike most capitals in Europe, Berlin has higher public debts than other big cities such as Munich or Hamburg and continues to be subsidised by richer states around Germany.</p> <p>M\u00fcller took over from Berlin\u2019s long-term mayor Klaus Wowereit two years ago, after previously serving as party leader and senator. A more managerial figure than the often exuberant, openly gay Wowereit, M\u00fcller initially enjoyed high popularity ratings.</p> <p>Yet, after 15 years of Social Democrat rule, Sunday\u2019s result is a sobering step down from the 30.8% the party enjoyed at the height of the Wowereit era \u2013 and the 61.9% achieved under late mayor and ex-chancellor Willy Brandt. Like the CDU, the Social Democrats gained their lowest share of the vote in Berlin ever. In the history of modern Germany, no party has previously won an election with a similarly poor result.</p> <p>The Pirate party, a band of internet freedom activists who managed to enter parliament in 2011, dropped below the 5% threshold.<br></p> <p>But the result will hurt Merkel\u2019s CDU most. After defeats for the Christian Democrats in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland-Westphalia and Baden\u2013W\u00fcrttemberg, the Berlin result is the fourth blow in a row for the centre-right party, which came close to gaining an absolute majority at federal level only three years ago.</p> <p>For the party leadership, it has become hard to ignore a pattern behind the results. In all four elections, established parties shed votes while the upstart AfD, founded in 2013, managed to achieve double digits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da2f7aa1435e20916def8abdf2d103aff4e684d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da2f7aa1435e20916def8abdf2d103aff4e684d3/0_134_4239_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate Frank Henkel casts his vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate Frank Henkel casts his vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorg Carstensen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As in the three previous votes, the CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate in Berlin, Frank Henkel, got punished even though the party tried to distance themselves from their own chancellor\u2019s stance over the refugee issue.

Despite Le Pen\u2019s sidelining of her father and party co-founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her long quest to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/le-pen-feud-family-drama-in-battle-for-the-soul-of-front-national-and-france\">\u201cdetoxify\u201d</a> her party of the racist, jack-booted, antisemitic imagery of the past, a majority of French voters still question whether the party is capable of governing France. </p> <p>Outside Le Pen\u2019s heartlands there is a widespread fear of the party, which many continue to associate with the old tags of demagoguery, xenophobia or racism. The party still faces a barrage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/le-pen-french-tactical-voting-to-fight-rise-of-far-right\">tactical voting </a>by the right and left to stop it winning final-round votes \u2013 described by one Lille party worker as \u201cthe onslaught of an armada\u201d. This clubbing together of right and left parties against the FN prevented it from winning any constituencies in last year\u2019s regional elections despite taking a historic 6.8m votes. </p> <p>Smiling, Le Pen chatted to journalists backstage at her party conference, saying she was confident she could expand her electorate far enough to win. Her aim in this pre-campaign period is to present herself as credible, to move away from divisive positions and to re-position herself as a kind of calm, unifying authority. She said she would run a \u201cjoyous\u201d campaign. Her aides said she felt her chances were better than ever. \u201cWith the designation of Trump in the US, and Brexit, analysts should be a bit more modest, there\u2019s a global awakening,\u201d Le Pen said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, if Le Pen makes it through to the second round, she wants to avoid the fate that befell her father when he shocked France by reaching the final round in 2002.More than a million angry demonstrators took to the streets in protest against Le Pen senior who was subsequently squarely beaten when 82% of voters from all parties opted for Jacques Chirac, in order to keep the FN at bay.</p> <p>This time, if Marine Le Pen makes the second round, she is likely to seriously narrow the gap.

This serves to legitimise FN ideas, party members argue. </p> <p>While Sarkozy has controversially called for the locking up of anyone suspected of radicalisation even if they have committed no crime, Le Pen has sat back and argued for protecting the rule of law, aiming to show she is less divisive than him. </p> <p>David Rachline, the young FN mayor of Fr\u00e9jus who will serve as Le Pen\u2019s campaign director, said her ideas were now \u201cmajority-held views in France\u201d.</p> <p>Gilbert Collard, one of Le Pen\u2019s MPs, said: \u201cWho in France can say that everything\u2019s going well, that the economy\u2019s good, that there\u2019s security, that terrorism has been controlled, the nation preserved? If you look at our whole diagnosis of society\u2019s ills \u2013 you can hate us, but everyone knows that our ideas are being taken up and reproduced by everyone else.\u201d </p> <p>Nicolas Bay, the party\u2019s secretary general, said Trump and Brexit helped Le Pen\u2019s cause. \u201cIt shows French people that there\u2019s a patriotic dynamic that goes well beyond France.

  "<p>Labour\u2019s turbulent summer, which kicked off with a riot of resignations in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, will come to a formal close in Liverpool this Saturday, when the result of Owen Smith\u2019s challenge to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership is announced. But even if Smith is soundly beaten, few expect peace to break out, after a bruising contest that has exposed the fault lines between the warring sides in the Labour movement. Here, we ask what might happen next.</p> <h2>1. Smith wins: a new battle commences</h2> <p>Few Labour insiders are expecting Owen Smith to win. But there is little reliable polling, and Saving Labour, the lobbying group set up to campaign for a replacement to Jeremy Corbyn, claims to have done an effective job signing up trade union affiliates and non-members <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/labour-stops-crowd-funding-bid-to-help-supporters-pay-for-vote\">willing to pay the \u00a325 to register to vote</a>.</p> <p>The Pontypridd MP has presented himself as a unity candidate and promised to offer Corbyn the new job of Labour president \u2013 in charge of the grassroots party.

The tough language of his final speech \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/owen-smith-momentum-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-host-body\">describing Momentum as a \u201cparty within a party\u201d</a> and comparing it to Militant, the hard-left group expelled from Labour in the 1980s \u2013 suggested he might be prepared to try to drive them out.</p> <h2>2.

One Corbyn ally predicts it will be a war of attrition.</p> <p>This summer\u2019s leadership campaign has been bruising, and many at Westminster regard it as strengthening, not weakening Corbyn\u2019s hand. Yet it may not be the last challenge he faces before the 2020 general election.</p> <h2>4.

If Momentum is, as it is seen by many, a party within a party, Labour moderates believe they too must create a similar movement within the party. It is understood that such a movement would be launched shortly after a leadership election loss to Corbyn. </p> <p>The tactics would mirror Momentum\u2019s rise from Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign in 2015 \u2013 this time using Smith\u2019s campaign resources, including his database of volunteers, as a backbone for a new movement. </p> <p>Labour sources told the Guardian the new movement would need to be open and transparent to avoid the negative publicity MPs received during the perceived \u201ccorridor coup\u201d to get rid of Corbyn over the summer. </p> <p>The movement would launch with an umbrella identity for progressive Labour groups in parliament and outside, with researchers hired to develop policy. Moderates in the party who back such an endeavour see it as a way to try to take back the party without having to operate cloak and dagger and avoiding the trauma of a physical split. </p>",

In an interview broadcast on Sunday, however, his vice-presidential candidate still struggled to account for his running mate\u2019s behaviour. </p> <p>\u201cHe brought that issue to an end this week,\u201d Mike Pence told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cIt is a fact, and Donald Trump and I have acknowledged that without hesitation.\u201d </p> <p>In fact, on Thursday Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defiant-as-polls-rise-wont-say-obama-was-born-in-united-states/2016/09/15/48913162-7b61-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\">refused to admit</a> that Obama was born in Hawaii.</p> <p>New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the first major politician to endose Trump after abandoning his own presidential campaign, similarly tried to wall off the candidate by laying down a series of falsehoods.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not true that he kept [the claims] up for five years,\u201d Christie told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, calling the matter \u201ca contentious issue\u201d \u2013 although in fact only a fringe group of conservatives ever embraced the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d movement. \u201cDonald Trump has said it\u2019s a done issue now.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, Christie said he \u201cwould correct\u201d Trump about the lie, <a href=\"http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/trump-facing-fire-at-get-rid-of-muslim-question/\">telling NBC</a>: \u201cI\u2019d say that the president is a Christian and he was born in this country.

In August 2012, for instance, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">wrote</a>: \u201cAn \u2018extremely credible source\u2019 has called my office and told me that @BarackObama\u2019s birth certificate is a fraud.\u201d </p> <p>A year later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/411247268763676673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">he wrote</a>: \u201cHow amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama\u2019s \u2018birth certificate\u2019 died in plane crash today.

Or were you just trying to cynically play to the darkest emotions in American life?\u201d</p> <p>The lie, Kaine concluded, was evidence that Trump \u201chas proven himself unfit\u201d for the presidency. </p> <p>Pence and Christie were also forced to defend Trump for his insinuations about violence against Clinton and his refusal to share tax returns with voters, breaking 40 years of precedent. </p> <p>On Friday, Trump said Clinton\u2019s secret service protection should<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-miami-clinton-disarm-security-obama-birther\"> \u201cdisarm immediately\u201d so that he could \u201csee what happens to her\u201d</a>.

She offers it without a trace of unease, and I&#xa0;can\u2019t decide whether the grace of what I\u2019m sure is a&#xa0;deceit is really quite impressive, or offputting. In fact I can\u2019t recall ever feeling so&#xa0;many powerful but contradictory emotions about someone I&#xa0;have only just met.</p> <p>Bouattia\u2019s manner can be almost glassily cool, but I think that\u2019s to hide how nervous she is, and the vulnerability is very touching. But the next minute she can become formidably impressive, and fill me with admiration, and seconds later become maddening. By the end I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m ranting at her like a lunatic. \u201cFor the record,\u201d I yell, \u201cthis has never happened before! I am not in the habit of shouting in interviews!\u201d I am dying of embarrassment when I leave, and at a loss to explain why this&#xa0;happened.</p> <p>Bouattia, 28, has had to deal with so much anger by now that you might think she would be immune to it, but I don\u2019t think she is. Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/malia-bouattia-election-nus-president-deeply-divisive-jewish-student-groups\" title=\"\">she became president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in April</a> she served two years as the union\u2019s black students\u2019 officer, during which she rejected a motion condemning Isis. She was promptly branded a terrorist sympathiser by the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/new-nus-president-not-antisemitic-isis-sympathiser\" title=\"\">who chose not to report that her only objection to the motion was its poor wording</a>, which she wanted to correct. The deluge of death threats necessitated police protection, but still were nothing compared with the uproar her presidential election provoked. That Bouattia is the first black woman and first Muslim to be elected NUS president was lost in Fleet&#xa0;Street\u2019s frenzy to dig up old comments she had made that \u201cproved\u201d she was antisemitic.</p> <p>She had described the University of Birmingham as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/21/nus-president-malia-bouattia-must-redress-concerns-over-antisemitism-say-jewish-students\" title=\"\">\u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d and on another occasion referred to \u201cmainstream Zionist-led media outlets\u201d.</a> More than 300 Jewish leaders complained. \u201cThis was a few years ago and I was talking about quite a particular context where there were a lot of activists that were very vocally supportive of the state of Israel and its actions. I was part of the Palestine society that, for most of the years that I was involved in it, was just trying to exist as a society let alone actually build solidarity, so it was because of that opposition, the constant tension and having disruptions for events that were taking place \u2026 you know, holding solidarity demonstrations and having opposing ones with Israeli flags flying, speakers being heckled. I wasn\u2019t being critical of the number of Jewish students or the size of the Jewish society at Birmingham. It was very much in relation to the opposition to any kind of Palestine solidarity efforts that were taking place.\u201d</p> <p>She clarifies that she simply meant that Birmingham\u2019s student union had the biggest and most vociferously Zionist Jewish society, and that she was referring to media outlets that promote a heavily pro-Israeli line, not evoking the old conspiracy theory about Jewish control of the media.</p> <p>Bouattia thinks the real reason for all the animosity is not antisemitism, but the radicalism of her leftwing politics. Though not a Labour member, she is a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn, and believes it was her promise of a bolder political agenda that won her the election. \u201cWe need action, and we need it now, and we need it differently to what we\u2019ve had before. We can\u2019t come to the table trying to compromise any more. That hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p> <p>But Bouattia\u2019s political ambitions go way beyond campaigning against education cuts or fee hikes. \u201cWe want a sense of international solidarity. We don\u2019t sit in a bubble. We have international students, migrant communities, and we can\u2019t sit by and be silent when spaces for education are for us to be critical of the systems, and of this country\u2019s role in escalating international crises, and escalating oppression of other groups. Liberation campaigns relate their work back to global movements for justice and solidarity, and we\u2019re much stronger when we\u2019re united.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I find this both quite touching and perfectly appropriate from a student politician. But judging from an average turnout in student union elections of just 18%, the majority of undergraduates don\u2019t. I was a bit of a student political hack, and within that small world Bouattia is perfectly recognisable. To the overwhelming majority of seven million NUS members, however, her views and values, even the language she uses, are incomprehensible. If they don\u2019t share her commitment to fighting global injustice, but care about how to pay their rent instead, shouldn\u2019t their union leader confine herself to representing their interests?</p> <p>But the NUS is fighting on all fronts, Bouattia says, and it campaigns just as hard on education issues as, say, Palestinian rights. I wonder how much time she has ever spent in the company of apolitical students who came to university for the football, beer and toga parties, and are bewildered and alienated by NUS motions calling for the abolition of all prisons. Why does she think, I ask, that student voter turnout is so low?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9/0_23_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s necessarily low if we compare it with voter turnout more generally.\u201d After I run through the average turnout for general, mayoral and devolved parliaments, she takes a new tack.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I think that when we think about the context in which we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s active demonisation of being politically active, you\u2019ve got the Prevent agenda [the government counter-terrorism programme to combat radicalisation], which is, like, actually hunting down students that choose to be politicised, particularly those who are racialised. We\u2019re at a time where things like the Prevent agenda quite explicitly target black and Muslim activists. I\u2019m seeing the realities of that, which is a turn away from taking political action. There is a total fear that they\u2019re going to be deported, and this is what they go home to. Their&#xa0;parents will tell them, \u2018You\u2019re going to end up in Guant\u00e1namo. You could end up deported to a homeland you\u2019re linked to, but have never even visited. You could end up having all your doors shut. You could end up being thrown out of university.\u2019 These are very real questions that people have to think about.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not this is true, it still fails to explain why more than 80% of NUS members don\u2019t even turn out to vote. But I am struck by the scale of influence Bouattia accords to&#xa0;Prevent. Even if it frightened every single Muslim student away from politics, that would still only account for about 5% of NUS&#xa0;members.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but you see the Prevent agenda is not just simply targeting Muslims \u2013 as though an incredibly racist policy could even distinguish between the Muslims and non-Muslims. One black man with a beard and another, they all become Muslims, so, by extension, any racialised person becomes a target. And actually the agenda is targeting far more than that. It\u2019s a wider-reaching attack on politicised people and groups, anti-austerity activists, anti\u2011fracking activists, there\u2019s a whole host of people that this extends to now.\u201d Does she think Prevent\u2019s intention was always to target&#xa0;all forms of activism, and to use radicalisation as a convenient excuse to conceal grander ambitions?</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do believe that. I do believe that is has incredibly racist intentions, and intentions to crack down on people\u2019s civil liberties. I do believe&#xa0;that.\u201d</p> <p>If she could abolish Prevent today, what would she do to combat radicalisation? \u201cI would propose looking at the state of our foreign policy. And we\u2019ve cut every space of constructive engagement, like youth centres. Cost of living\u2019s increased, employment prospects are low, access to university is becoming ever harder. Even if people have accessed higher education, they\u2019ve accumulated vast amounts of debt. And have they had a positive experience, being forced to engage with content that doesn\u2019t relate to them, and perhaps is psychologically destructive? When we look at the incredibly Eurocentric curriculum, where people don\u2019t see themselves in what they\u2019re studying, and can\u2019t relate to it, and feel that their European counterparts hit the ground running, they can\u2019t see themselves advancing in the subjects.\u201d</p> <p>Bouattia says she has no ambitions for a political career, and sees her future in academia instead, which may be for the best, as I\u2019m not sure how her anti-radicalisation strategy would go down on the doorstep. But if her politics would strike most British voters as extreme, they make more sense from the perspective of her own life experience.</p> <p>Until the age of seven, she had a blissfully happy childhood in Algeria, but in the civil war academics became targets for abduction and murder, and the family fled to Birmingham. Taken in by Christian ministries, they found themselves in an alien world of brussels sprouts and a language Bouattia could not speak. She was fluent within two months, but remained desperately homesick, and consoled herself by drawing the Algerian map all over everything at school.</p> <p>After studying a degree in culture studies she read an MA in postcolonial theory at the University of Birmingham, before becoming the NUS black students\u2019 officer and then president. \u201cBut I think the sense of displacement is still with me. When Daily Mail articles are written, and quite racist, Islamophobic trolls come after you over social media, you\u2019re very much reminded that people don\u2019t feel you belong here. My parents took us out to access a better space of education, to be better equipped to go back to Algeria and give back.\u201d Her election was widely celebrated in Algeria, and she goes on: \u201cThat made me more at ease with all that I do here, and how it feeds into the bigger picture, because at times when you\u2019re so intricately involved in something locally, you start to wonder how does this fit into the bigger picture? How does this fit into the wider struggle?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she worries that the antisemitism row has diminished her power as president. \u201cNot necessarily. Not so far,\u201d is a surprising answer, but she says that she thinks the controversy raised the profile of the NUS, and provided new platforms for her \u201cto put out our vision of the future\u201d.</p> <p>Does she think she has ever said anything antisemitic? \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, and if my words were misinterpreted, then in future I\u2019ll take the time to make sure I break them down and explain them.\u201d Are there any comments she has made in the past that she would not now say?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about not saying it again, it\u2019s about just breaking them down to explain what I meant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5/0_300_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips/Gareth Phillips for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Jewish critics still maintain that she is antisemitic. Others argue that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. Bouattia maintains that they have misunderstood and misinterpreted her, and are wrong. I think this would be a perfectly defensible position for her to take if only she applied the same principle when student unions invoke the NUS\u2019s no-platform policy. I want to talk to her about Germaine Greer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university\" title=\"\">who Cardiff University students\u2019 union demanded be no platformed last year</a>, owing to her views on transsexuals. This is when the argument begins.</p> <p>Most graduates of my age, I say, are appalled by a campus culture that no-platforms a speaker for holding opinions some students might find offensive. If someone cannot bear to be exposed to challenging views at university, what are they doing there? \u201cIt\u2019s a case of seeing those ideas as spreading forms of hatred.\u201d Does she think that Greer spreads hatred? \u201cI support the union\u2019s right to no-platform her. To hold transphobic views spreads hate.\u201d</p> <p>But Greer has repeatedly stated that she does not hate transsexuals, is not critical of their choices, and couldn\u2019t care less if anyone wants to reassign their gender. She simply does not share the belief that a man who decides to live as a woman was female all along, or that surgical procedures can wholly reassign gender.</p> <p>Now a woman sitting at what is known as the liberation desk in the office, who works on campaigns for LGBT, black, female and disabled students, gets involved. What Greer thinks she means is not the point, she says; the trans community consider her a \u201cfascist\u201d, the NUS respects their view, ergo Greer is a fascist.</p> <p>But Bouattia doesn\u2019t accept that just because some Jewish people consider her antisemitic, that means she is. Why, then, does she not accord this principle to anyone else? \u201cThis is the NUS policy,\u201d she repeats. It\u2019s like talking to a speaking clock. I suggest that when a policy ends up branding Greer a fascist, it\u2019s time for an urgent policy review. Universities exist as places where people engage with ideas, and learn; they are not meant to be sealed panic rooms, are they? \u201cThis is the NUS policy.\u201d</p> <p>While I get more and more worked up, Bouattia just smiles placidly. I ask her to call her parents the next day and ask them if they, as senior academics, agree that Greer is too dangerous to be allowed to talk to students. When I email Bouattia later in the week, she doesn\u2019t respond, and the press officer tells me she is out of the country and uncontactable.</p> <p>I get the impression that Bouattia is more fragile than the persona she presents. But perhaps, if one\u2019s own academic parents have been targets for&#xa0;assassination, the concept of safety on campus holds something different to mine.</p>",

  "<p>Five years after the tents sprouted, the protesters faced pepper spray and a call went out against inequality, the mood in Zuccotti Park on Saturday evening felt more like a family reunion than a political rally.

Activists claim that Obama has been too slow to respond to the gathering storm, even after recently achieving his target of accepting 10,000 refugees from Syria in the last fiscal year.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that is enough because the Syrian people are suffering the crisis,\u201d Acuoth said. \u201cI think they should take more because I was a former refugee and I know how that felt. The Syrian people who don\u2019t have a country to go to deserve our support as an international community to give them refuge.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the 3,000 refugees who came from Sudan to the US as \u201clost boys\u201d have made successful lives in government, business and academia, he added. \u201cWhen I was a refugee, what it meant was that I didn\u2019t know that I had any other life. I thought I would just live in a camp forever. But then, when I had the opportunity to come here, I saw I value in my life and what it means to be somebody.\u201d</p> <p>But some of them never made it, because the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to US borders being virtually closed to refugees. </p> <p>The door has slowly edged open again in recent years. In the 12 months ending 30 September, the goal was 85,000, and in each of the three years prior, the target was 70,000. </p> <p>Campaigners say much more is necessary to come to grips with the 20 million refugees worldwide. But fears of terrorism bring political risk, notably after the attack in San Bernardino, California, and incidents in Europe connected to people who had spent time in Syria. Republican governors have sought to keep refugees out of their states while the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">threatened to slam the door shut again</a>.</p> <p>Ibrahim al-Assil, president and cofounder of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SyrainNonviolence\">Syrian Nonviolence Movement</a>, argued that the US had a special responsibility after its failure to intervene in Syria, notably when Obama did not follow through on warning that the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons would cross a \u201cred line\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9495b76ee690f6013439d6660e311022f35f591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9495b76ee690f6013439d6660e311022f35f591/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama addresses the UN general assembly last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama addresses the UN general assembly last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/stateless-not-silenced-conversation-refugees-refugees\">Speaking at the Wilson Center thinktank</a> in Washington, Assil said: \u201cOf course, the number that is being admitted to the US is very, very low, extremely low. The US on the political level committed some mistakes at least when they put the red line and then they didn\u2019t enforce that red line. So I think they should share that responsibility and they should admit more Syrians as refugees to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Even when refugees get on American soil, they face a lengthy wait to be cleared for asylum. Assil said he himself has cofounded a civil society group, cofounded a business and gained a job at a thinktank but is still in legal limbo, waiting on an asylum application filed in 2014. \u201cSo imagine how difficult it is for other people as well.\u201d</p> <p>Officials have said potential refugees are subject to a rigorous screening process that typically lasts two years and involves both in-person interviews and further vetting by the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the defense department and US Citizenship and Immigration Services and an examination of biographical and biometric data.</p> <p>Rouba Mhaissen, founder and director of the refugee initiative <a href=\"http://www.sdaid.org/about-us\">Sawa for Development and Aid</a>, said: \u201cWhen you hear \u2018110,000 to be admitted\u2019, this is amazing news, but between the moment this decision is taken and the moment these people arrive in the US, it can take up to two years.\u201d</p> <p>The US is the world\u2019s biggest donor to refugee programmes and provides a third of the budget for the UN high commissioner for refugees. But politicians in Europe, where some 1 million people arrived last year, have expressed concern that Washington does not appreciate the scale of the crisis.</p> <p>Of the 110,000 that the US will admit in the coming year, 40,000 will come from the Middle East and South Asia. An additional 35,000 will come from Africa, 12,000 from east Asia, 4,000 from Europe and 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean. Some 14,000 slots do not have a refugee\u2019s place of origin specified.</p> <p>Mark Hetfield, president of <a href=\"http://www.hias.org/\">Hias</a>, which was created in New York in 1881 and is the oldest refugee agency in the world, said: \u201cWe were pleasantly surprised at the number increase but it\u2019s not nearly enough given what we should be doing or what we have done in the past. We have ceded leadership on this issue to other countries.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/fear-forces-refugees-dadaab-kenya-worlds-largest-camp-return-conflict-zones-human-rights-watch-warns\">Fear forces refugees in world\u2019s largest camp to return to conflict zones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The system has become dominated by security apparatus and agencies, crippling the process and crying out for leadership from the White House, he added. </p> <p>In Canada, by contrast, prime minister Justin Trudeau <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/world/americas/syria-refugees-arrive-in-canada.html\">has welcomed new arrivals at the airport</a> with the words, \u201cYou\u2019re safe at home now.\u201d If the US matched Canada\u2019s intake of refugeees in proportion to its population, the annual figure would be 250,000.</p> <p>Hetfield said: \u201cI think the president has been very reactive and not paid attention to refugee policy until this year. If Obama had done four years ago what he is doing now, I think we would be in a much better place to respond to refugees. But now he\u2019s very limited in what he can do.\u201d</p> <p>Washington also has been condemned for its passive approach to people fleeing a surge in violence in Central America. It announced last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/central-american-refugees-costa-rica-obama-administration\">Costa Rica would offer temporary protection</a> to Central American refugees, as American efforts had been overwhelmed since 2012 by a fivefold growth of people leaving Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.</p> <p>The White House has defended its actions. Josh Earnest, its press secretary, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/29/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-deputy-nsa-strategic\">told a recent briefing</a>: \u201cThe United States has already stepped up to the plate and played an important leading role in the response, both in terms of providing more humanitarian assistance than any other country in the world, and we certainly are playing an important role here in accepting refugees from that conflict. The United States is obviously in a different place, literally, than countries in Europe. The United States is separated by a large ocean when it comes to these refugees.</p> <p>\u201cSo the situation that we face is different when it comes to this set of refugees. And the president does believe it\u2019s important for the United States to do our part. That\u2019s why we increased our ambition and admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. But I think the president certainly would like to see the United States continue to ramp up our commitment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Born in London to a Spanish father and Italian mother, Molina, 63, decided to become an actor after watching Stanley Kubrick\u2019s <em>Spartacus</em> aged nine. He later attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and was a member of the National Youth Theatre. After a number of theatre roles he made his film debut in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> (1981) as the ill-fated guide Satipo; since then he has starred in more than 70 films including <em>Chocolat</em>, <em>Boogie Nights</em>, <em>Magnolia</em> and <em>Frida</em>. Now an LA resident and US citizen, Molina starred in Ira Sachs\u2019s 2014 film <em>Love Is Strange</em>, and he will appear in Sachs\u2019s latest drama, <em>Little Men</em>, out in cinemas on 23 September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"739b3a290c044c3ee577725db87f6dadb397063c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/739b3a290c044c3ee577725db87f6dadb397063c/0_0_1024_1387/738.jpg\" alt=\"Eugene O\u2019Neill A Life in Four Acts\" width=\"738\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eugene O\u2019Neill: A Life in Four Acts</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale University Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1 | Nonfiction book</h2> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/eugene-o-neill-420215.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Eugene O\u2019Neill: A Life in Four Acts by Robert Dowling (2014)</strong></a></p> <p>This is the most recent biography of [US playwright] Eugene O\u2019Neill.

In 2010, deputy Richard Graber, a senior official in the Milwaukee deputies\u2019 union, alleged that Clarke aggressively confronted him, called him a \u201csick fuck\u201d and threatened to \u201ccome after him\u201d for questioning an order that deputies must work mandatory overtime after the high-profile death of a local child.</p> <p>\u201cClarke\u2019s profanity-ridden rant included yelling, pointing, and calling Graber \u2018waste,\u2019 an \u2018organizational terrorist,\u2019 a \u2018fucker,\u2019 and a \u2018cancer to the agency\u2019,\u201d according to an appeals court filing. Clarke denied most of Graber\u2019s account of their confrontation. A federal appeals court said Clarke\u2019s behavior amounted to an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d but rejected an allegation from Graber that the mistreatment was because of his union activity.</p> <p>Inspector Edward Bailey, a spokesman for Clarke, declined to comment. \u201cThis county office does not involve itself in the current presidential race in any capacity,\u201d he said in an email.</p> <h2><strong>Joe Arpaio</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has over the past two decades become notorious as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/sheriff-joe-arpaio-the-most-lawless-lawman-in-america/359613/\">\u201cthe most unrepentantly lawless lawman in America\u201d</a>: repeatedly condemned by the courts, denounced by civil liberties advocates and forced to pay out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in compensation.</p> <p>Arpaio currently faces possible criminal charges for contempt of court for ignoring a judge\u2019s order in 2011 that his aggressive immigration patrols must stop racially profiling suspects. Earlier this year, Arpaio was <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2016/05/13/arpaio-contempt-federal-court-ruling/77833232/\">held in civil contempt on three counts</a> by a federal judge. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e173b7cd1dbdcb72ecb86e405faa9cf7eed639a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e173b7cd1dbdcb72ecb86e405faa9cf7eed639a/1366_58_1480_1849/800.jpg\" alt=\"Arpaio.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arpaio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less well known than Arpaio\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.12news.com/news/local/arizona/inmates-endure-extreme-heat-in-tent-city/250951997\">\u201cTent City\u201d</a> detention center, however, is his record of using his department to go after personal and political enemies.

The failed charges also prompted the state supreme court to disbar the county attorney, an Arpaio ally, who was found to have brought malicious prosecutions against political foes.</p> <p>Last year it emerged that Arpaio had even <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/23/joe-arpaio-apologizes-contempt-hearing-day-three-abrk/26240715/\">hired a private investigator to look into the wife</a> of the federal judge who ruled in 2013 that Arpaio was engaged in illegal racial profiling. Spokespeople for Arpaio did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2><strong>Tim Howard</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Tim Howard of Erie County, New York, is a co-chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign in the Republican nominee\u2019s home state, which Trump has declared he can win even while trailing Hillary Clinton in state polls <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html\">by an average of 19 percentage points</a>.</p> <p>Despite holding an official position in the Republican\u2019s campaign, Howard earlier this year was involved in policing a Trump campaign rally in Buffalo, where he was filmed overseeing the removal of protesters.

He killed a state trooper and wounded two others before being caught after five months on the run. In March 2009, Rasheed Milton was released from the same facility by mistake. Milton was recaptured after raping a woman. Then, in March 2012, Awet Gebreyesus was mistakenly released from Alden after being indicted for the attempted murder of his partner. Gebreyesus was caught before harming anyone.</p> <p> Howard has also been <a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2013/10/howard-widens-pay-play-net-8-years/\">accused of cronyism</a> after it emerged that companies that gave Howard\u2019s election campaign tens of thousands of dollars in contributions received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of county contracts for purchases such as <a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2005/09/sheriff-howard-bought-like-new-car/\">new police cars</a>, software and furniture.</p> <p>Howard\u2019s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Babeu</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Arizona, enthusiastically supports Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance and campaign pledge to build a wall along the US border with Mexico. Babeu is also running as a Republican for a seat in the US House of Representatives and has made border security a key plank of his campaign.</p> <p>Babeu promises voters on his website that he will tackle the \u201chundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring across our southern borders\u201d, warning that at present, \u201cpossible terrorists with military training, deliberate plans and lots of money can cross the border\u201d.</p> <p>In 2012, Jose Orozco, a Mexican man and ex-boyfriend of Babeu who worked for the sheriff\u2019s election campaign, alleged that he was threatened with deportation by an aide to Babeu when he refused to sign an agreement not to publicly disclose the relationship. Orozco\u2019s attorney said she was told Orozco\u2019s US visa had expired, making him undocumented. Babeu denied Orozco\u2019s allegations.

Babeu, who led the controversial DeSisto School in West Stockbridge between 1999 and 2001, responded by <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/blogs/senor-reporter/babeu-camp-attacks-sister-over-new-allegations/article_398e3692-622f-11e1-a591-0019bb2963f4.html\">publishing his sister\u2019s mental health history</a>. </p> <p>The former student, Joshua Geyer, <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/blogs/senor-reporter/babeu-camp-attacks-sister-over-new-allegations-updated/article_398e3692-622f-11e1-a591-0019bb2963f4.html\">has not disputed</a> that he had a relationship with Babeu, but insisted that it was not \u201cinappropriate\u201d. This week, a spokesman for Babeu sent the Guardian a letter purportedly from Geyer that said he and Babeu had no sexual relationship at all. Asked twice whether Babeu himself denied that the relationship took place, the spokesman did not respond.</p> <p>State authorities <a href=\"http://media.phoenixnewtimes.com/7687064.0.PDF\">pursued DeSisto</a> for operating illegally without a state license. Over the years, the school <a href=\"http://www.bridges4kids.org/articles/2004/3-04/Globe2-23-04.html\">became notorious</a> for its severe punishment system, and was investigated repeatedly for allegations of abuse and mistreatment of students. It has since closed. </p> <p>The Babeu spokesman, Barrett Marson, said in an email: \u201cPaul was in charge of the business operations at the school. He never had any control over student discipline or instruction. He was in charge of ensuring there was food and bathroom supplies and things like that. But Paul was never investigated nor had any knowledge of any alleged abuse at the school while he was employed there.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wayne Ivey</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Wayne Ivey of Brevard County, Florida, is playing an energetic part in Trump\u2019s campaign.

But Jones, who is also running for Congress as a Republican, has dialed down his enthusiasm after the Republican nominee\u2019s recent string of inflammatory remarks.</p> <p>\u201cHe has not personally or publicly endorsed any candidate, but has said he will cast his ballot for Trump given the only alternative is Hillary Clinton,\u201d Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Jones, said in an email.</p> <p>Jones was accused of sexually harassing a junior female deputy starting when he was a sergeant about 12 years ago, which he denies. The deputy, Tosca Olives, said in a sworn deposition that Jones frequently harassed her on visits to the department\u2019s law library, to which she was assigned. Jones denied the allegations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a94a3d595fcd3b8166735047b2b6c87ef8951950\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a94a3d595fcd3b8166735047b2b6c87ef8951950/757_448_1225_1531/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jones.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: scottjonesforcongress.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt started with, like, rubbing my shoulders while I was on the phone,\u201d said Olives. \u201cIt progressed to going underneath my shirt and feeling my breasts.

There were times that he would unzip my pants and \u2026 but mainly feeling my breasts and kissing.\u201d </p> <p>She said Jones touched her inappropriately \u201capproximately 30\u201d times. Once, when she told him he must stop touching her breasts, she alleged, Jones replied: \u201cStop being so tempting.\u201d Olives said she feared retaliation for taking action against Jones, and that when she eventually told him she was going to make a complaint about him, he advised her not to and suggested she would ruin both their careers. </p> <p>Olives\u2019s testimony was submitted as evidence in a lawsuit brought by four other female deputies, who alleged retaliation and discrimination by the sheriff\u2019s department \u2013 much of it in a county jail, when it was run by Jones. Jurors ruled in favor of the female deputies and awarded them $3.6m. </p> <p>In an emailed statement, Jones said the allegations against him were \u201cwithout merit, corroboration or evidence\u201d and that he denied them \u201cin the strongest possible terms.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI have never been the subject of any internal complaint of misconduct of any kind during my 27-year career with the sheriff\u2019s department, and have consistently opened up my personnel records for review,\u201d said Jones.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAs a general rule,\u201d it was written in the 1920s, \u201cNegroes have not been and are not thought of in America when you talk in general terms of Americans unless they are specifically pointed out.\u201d This \u201cgeneral forgetfulness\u201d therefore made it \u201cnecessary for those interested in fair play to all citizens\u201d to propose a \u201cbeautiful building\u201d to \u201cdepict the negro\u2019s contribution to America in military service, in art, literature, invention, science, industry etc.\u201d</p> <p>The text was part of a century-long campaign, started by black civil war veterans in 1915, that will reach its fulfilment on Saturday, when Barack Obama formally opens the <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/\">National Museum of African American History and Culture</a> in Washington DC. It describes with some precision what has finally been achieved. It also suggests what the museum\u2019s director, Lonnie Bunch, says over and over: that the museum should give \u201ca fuller understanding of what it means to be American\u201d seen through the \u201cparticular lens\u201d of black experiences and contributions, not a place that is just about and for an anthropologically defined category known as African Americans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall, 60% of the museum is buried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The moment, of course, is charged. A short walk away another building has opened in the heart of the federal administrative district: the chandelier-bedecked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump International hotel</a>, a possible encampment on the way to the White House for the man keen on the plainly racist fantasy that Obama was not really American-born, and who as a young property tycoon was accused of denying homes to black applicants. Trump\u2019s combinations of obfuscation, cunning, bluster and force follow a pattern seen across the centuries in the museum\u2019s accounts of the ways in which black freedom and advancement were blocked.</p> <p>The museum, the 19th to be created by the Smithsonian Institution, enacts further principles currently under attack, which are the importance of knowledge and fact, scrupulously gathered, and of shared spaces for their understanding. It is much for a single building and its contents to carry, especially one placed on the National Mall in Washington amid the icons of the nation \u2013 the White House, the Capitol, great museums, memorials to wars and presidents. \u201cHow does one compete with such a monumental landscape?\u201d asks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/02/david-adjaye-interview-not-always-looking-at-usual-references\">David Adjaye</a>, the lead designer of an architectural team formed out of four practices for the purpose of this project called Freelon Adjaye Bond/SmithGroup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0152daeabc3349ce418a75ee554a693a6e489b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0152daeabc3349ce418a75ee554a693a6e489b9/2476_1857_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British architect David Adjaye, the lead designer on the Washington museum project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British architect David Adjaye, the lead designer on the Washington museum project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Leynse/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This team is led by people of predominantly African American heritage, a rarity in the still very white profession of architecture, such as the lead architect Phil Freelon and the project leader Zena Howard. J Max Bond, a pioneer among black architects, was part of the group but died before the museum was finished. Adjaye is British, born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents. The theme and content of the museum is therefore personal. \u201cAs a young boy of my generation the African American story was also our story,\u201d says Adjaye, who was born as the civil rights movement was gathering force in 1966, \u201cin the sense that it was the techniques, the motivation, it was a way of being and it was a way of understanding that one could succeed in the modern world and not be oppressed by it. I feel it as part of my emerging into adulthood and being who I am.\u201d</p> <p>It is indeed the content that should come before the architecture of the building that serves it. It includes artefacts of desperation and sheer survival, such as the shards of tools used by Maroons \u2013 escaped slaves \u2013 in their refuge in the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina. Also of violence, such as leg irons, and fragments of glass from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/alabama-board-denies-parole-klansman-birmingham-church-bombing\">1963 bombing that killed four young girls</a> in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. There is exaltation, in the form of one of Chuck Berry\u2019s bright red Cadillacs, of the recollected triumphs of Muhammad Ali, of the orange silk jacket and recorded singing of the contralto Marian Anderson. There is abundant film and photography of the struggles and grotesqueries of racial politics, such as the Ku Klux Klan march through Washington in 1925.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97fb3066809f1cad24263b7cae8aad2110f10f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97fb3066809f1cad24263b7cae8aad2110f10f98/0_0_3500_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The patterns of the museum\u2019s filigree, bronze-finished screens derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The patterns of the museum\u2019s filigree, bronze-finished screens derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scraps of intimacy and poverty are interspersed with larger structures, such as wooden cabins inhabited by slaves and a watchtower from Angola prison in Louisiana. Objects of American transport technology contribute: a segregated railway carriage, a bright yellow-and-blue biplane used by the African American Tuskegee airmen, that Cadillac. Eventually you find the P-Funk Mothership, a spoof spacecraft that used to land on stage on the 1970s stadium tours of George Clinton and his band Parliament-Funkadelic.</p> <p>The collection is remarkable for the fact that, little more than a decade ago, it didn\u2019t exist. Lonnie Bunch, on taking up his post in 2005, was armed with a Bush-signed act of Congress that supported the idea of the museum, but he had nothing to put in it. This could have been catastrophic, as the world is full of unconvincing museums founded on ideas but little content. So Bunch and his team toured the nation, inviting people to offer whatever they might have. The result is personal, eclectic, touching and surprising, rather than encyclopedic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The culture galleries at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The culture galleries at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The displays are sometimes overcrowded but avoid gimmicks and pointless gestures at interaction. They are text-heavy, partly to fill the gaps that arise from the nature of the collection, with a measured and sober tone. The exhibits are arranged in three main sections, starting with a narrative history, rising up from the bottom of a deep basement, that runs from the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade in 15th-century Africa and Europe to the presidency of Barack Obama. On two upper floors, above the ground level entrance hall, are the community galleries, which talk about such things as religion, place, sport and military service, and the culture galleries, which show art, music, literature and performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ad1cfa21a43f4e0813f82d4acbe33b5eace11a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad1cfa21a43f4e0813f82d4acbe33b5eace11a4/397_130_2428_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slave shackles on display at the museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slave shackles on display at the museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The museum thus climbs from slave ships to the mothership, an ascendant trajectory that maybe doesn\u2019t do enough to avoid an oversimplified story of oppression ultimately redeemed by blues, funk and hip-hop. The museum nonetheless does an outstanding job of giving due weight to horrors and heroism, to people just living their lives and to the endless repeating stories of creativity prompted by oppression. Many of the histories are familiar even to non-Americans, such as that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/25/guardianobituaries.usa\">Rosa Parks</a>, but they are shown here with new weight. You are assailed by the mental force of something pushing from the back of your mind to the front. Was segregation really so cruel, so laughably hypocritical, so absurdly rigged and transparently unfair? Yes, it was.</p> <p>The official story of the design is already much told and doubtless will be repeated to the museum\u2019s visitors for as long as it stands. The triple-decker superstructure of inverted truncated pyramids recalls the celebratory headpieces on certain Yoruba sculptures from west Africa and can also evoke, if you like, arms raised in celebration. They are made of bronze-finished aluminium whose filigree patterns derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston. A long, deep canopy that shelters the main entrance refers to the porches of southern houses that acted as social and political centres, little village halls, informal schools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e3475e1f955b40c48164de9928365ac2e81540d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3475e1f955b40c48164de9928365ac2e81540d/0_0_2698_3600/749.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Karchmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These narratives are necessary, says Adjaye, for a project that was \u201cdefinitely not done quietly on a mountain somewhere on my own\u201d but had to \u201cnegotiate a lot of positions and opinions to get this form.

What matters more are the relationships the architecture makes through its space and material between exhibits, people and surroundings.</p> <p>Here there are tensions between the institutional nature of a museum and its popular ambitions, between a search for authenticity and the tendency of modern museums to resemble shopping malls \u2013 shiny, escalatored \u2013 driven as they are by mall-like considerations of people moving and browsing. The design also has to deal with the contemporary habit of putting exhibitions in sealed boxes, where air and light are perfectly controlled, which makes for abrupt transitions with the rest of the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One technique that Adjaye tries is to create moments of crowd-pleasing charm \u2013 a particular tone of purplish pink terrazzo in the entrance hall\u2019s floor, coppery panels on the lifts, outbreaks of decoration as in an art deco cinema, something as simple as the rich blue over the entrance to the Oprah Winfrey theatre. There is an agile open loop of a spiral staircase going down to the basement, which also helps you forget that \u2013 because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall \u2013 60% of the museum is buried. You might imagine something non-Caucasian in these hues and motifs, but at any rate they are different from the greys and creams of most Smithsonian museums.</p> <p>More substantially the building seeks to connect with its august surroundings, through views from decks outside the upper galleries that are sometimes filtered through the filigree screens and sometimes through openings specially oriented to particular monuments. The glass-walled ground floor allows views in all directions of both greenery and stone-pillared official architecture. At this point it feels embracing and inclusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66b0450bbb04ba5f04a33b415648e2201ea290a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b0450bbb04ba5f04a33b415648e2201ea290a7/0_0_4481_2987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A first world war helmet of the US Army\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, on display at the museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A first world war helmet of the US Army\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, on display at the museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preston Keres/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hardest job the design has to do is to find a way to stand on its grand stage. It is placed at a corner where the grand axis emanating from the Capitol intersects at a right angle with that emanating from the White House, a cross pinned at its centre by the 555ft obelisk of the Washington monument. All around are white stone commemorations of white men, albeit often built with black labour. As a freestanding largely symmetrical object, the new museum has something in common with its neighbours, but as a dark-clad structure that eschews classical columns for apparently floating horizontal layers, it does not. Its suggestion of pyramids gives a geometrical echo of the obelisk (which, lest we forget, is Egyptian and therefore also African), but their inversion sets them apart.</p> <p>Adjaye doesn\u2019t mind if a link is made between the dark skin of the building and that of the people it remembers, but he gives another reason for it. If it is not the main material for buildings on the National Mall, bronze is nonetheless used for the memorial detail of statuary and plaques. The role of the new museum is itself partly memorial, the idea having started off a century ago with the primary intent of honouring black soldiers. The bronze finish, for Adjaye, is \u201cabsolutely from the classical family, but to express different ideas seemed like the right thing to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca59259401bdaf675eb3bcbf4b6df0fbf80b1414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca59259401bdaf675eb3bcbf4b6df0fbf80b1414/0_469_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Museum of African American History and Culture flanked by the Washington monument, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Museum of African American History and Culture flanked by the Washington monument, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Karchmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It takes some nerve to do a building like this, on this spot, and the design is confident enough to pull it off. It is not flawless, as it sometimes feels assembled or panellised more than crafted. The bronze-coloured screens are not the delicate, seamless things suggested in computer visualisations. The build-up of the exterior cladding \u2013 glass wall plus screen plus substantial fixings for the latter \u2013 impedes the sense of connection between inside and out. There are moments of gawkiness that can be engaging or uncomfortable, depending on your taste. But it achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American, and to be of its location but also different from it.</p> <p>As a museum and as a building it enacts the tone that is so striking in the 1928 text \u2013 its patience, reason and lack of rancour. It realises qualities of America at its best, ones which, as is now abundantly clear, we can\u2019t take for granted.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>A century of waiting: the long campaign for the museum</h2> <p>The new National Museum of African American History and Culture is the result of more than a century of efforts to commemorate the contributions of African Americans to their country.</p> <p><strong>1915</strong> A group of civil war veterans, gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of its ending, organise a \u201ccommittee of colored citizens\u201d to build a monument.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c959639ea78bb30518af9bf1f16b3ece7548584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c959639ea78bb30518af9bf1f16b3ece7548584/0_0_1078_1066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A badge showing the unbuilt 1920s design for what has now become the National Museum of African American History.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A badge showing the unbuilt 1920s design for what has now become the National Museum of African American History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1929 </strong>Congress permits a national commission to be set up, but it fails for lack of funding.</p> <p><strong>1968 </strong>Black leaders unsuccessfully press Congress for a museum.</p> <p><strong>1985 </strong>The owner of a bus-tour company, Tom Mack, starts a fundraising group.</p> <p><strong>1988 </strong>Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights veteran, unsuccessfully introduces a bill for a museum.

  "<p>In American presidential campaigns, September is the cruellest month. It is the time, following the long summer break, when partisan warfare resumes in earnest. It is the moment when the gloves really come off. The primary season is past, the Democratic and Republican party conventions are over, the presidential nominees have been formally acclaimed. Now begins the hard, fast, unforgiving head-to-head run towards November\u2019s national winning post.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton should be cantering towards a clear victory. After 25 years in public life, the Democratic candidate has unmatched experience. She has been tested in roles as varied as first lady, senator and secretary of state. She has raised the profile of women in politics to new heights, taking her lifelong role as \u201cceiling-cracker\u201d (her word) to the doors of the Oval Office. In Donald Trump, she faces a fourth-rate rival who has proved himself unfit for office, a bigoted, ignorant man who feeds off lies and hate. She should be a shoo-in.</p> <p>Instead, September has seen Clinton stumble. As independent and undecided voters begin to focus on their choice, Clinton\u2019s unusually poor approval ratings are assuming critical importance. Trump\u2019s risible, insincere attempts to move away from the extreme right have given him an undeserved bounce. Clinton\u2019s averaged-out poll lead is down to less than two points. In some surveys, Trump is actually moving ahead.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s biggest stumble was a physical one, in New York last Sunday when she fainted, almost fell, lost a shoe and had to be helped away. The subsequent furore, her belated admission she was suffering from pneumonia, the realisation this had been concealed for days and the suspicion she was hiding something worse conspired to highlight one of Clinton\u2019s two big vulnerabilities: lack of trust. Put bluntly, when she states a fact, makes a pledge or offers an explanation, there is a widespread tendency not to believe her.</p> <p>Trust is always a big issue in presidential campaigns. But in Clinton\u2019s case, as has become customary throughout her career, she is constantly held to a higher standard than her contemporaries. She has, for example, been relentlessly castigated over her use of private email when secretary of state. Ideally, she would have adopted a more secure method of communication. But not even the most rabid Republicans have demonstrated any serious consequences as a result. That predecessors did the same thing and escaped censure is not viewed as a double standard.</p> <p>Clinton was in charge when the US mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked and its diplomats killed in 2012. But to blame her, rather than Barack Obama, or the CIA, or the Marine Corps \u2013 whose job is to protect embassies \u2013 is grossly unfair. To criticise Clinton for her refusal to divorce Bill after his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was revealed is to treat her very differently from the partners of other erring politicians.</p> <p>Clinton is still dogged by the so-called White House travel office scandal of early 1993, an insignificant affair but one that established the subsequent, long-lasting narrative of a bossy, arrogant, untruthful person who brooks no criticism. Whether the issue is healthcare reform, which she attempted as first lady and was pilloried for, or sensitive questions of equal rights, which she has championed with growing confidence in recent years, Clinton has been hounded at every turn in a hostile, frequently crude manner that other public figures simply do not experience.</p> <p>A common factor in all of these controversies is the fact that Clinton is a woman \u2013 which despite all that has been achieved over women\u2019s rights, remains her other big political vulnerability. For being a Yale-trained lawyer and partner in a leading law firm, for retaining her maiden name of Rodham, for insisting on maintaining an independentlife while married to a president, for pursuing a political career in tandem with motherhood, and now for presuming to become America\u2019s first female leader, it seems a significant chunk of the public and the media cannot forgive her.</p> <p>Clinton has been called a feminazi, a shrew, a scold, a harridan, even a dominatrix who has emasculated America. Her famous 1992 defence of her troubled marriage \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I\u2019m sitting here because I love him and I respect him\u201d \u2013 was misrepresented as proof that she looked down on traditional female roles. She fuelled the misogynist fire by defending her legal career: \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas but what I decided to do was fulfil my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.\u201d</p> <p>For supposedly outraged conservatives, the storyline of Hillary, untrustworthy betrayer of American womanhood, was set in stone. It has not changed much since, and according to Tammy Vigil of Boston University, Clinton is still struggling with it. \u201cRight out of the gate she was getting slammed for the pantsuits, the hair, the headbands, her appearance, her life choices, and everything she said was so heavily scrutinised. I think she became defensive. And now she\u2019s trying not to be as defensive, but it\u2019s sort of still there.\u201d Even her recent illness was used to fortify this critique: namely, that Clinton, unlike the 17-stone, 70-year-old Trump, cannot take the strain, cannot be trusted to tell the truth, and is unfit for office,</p> <p>Far from undermining women, Clinton is a standard bearer on the cusp of an historic breakthrough. It may be said she lacks a new vision of governance, that her ideas are rooted in the discredited Clinton-Blair New Democrat/New Labour era, and that, in foreign affairs, she can be both too aggressive (for example, towards Iran) and too cautious, as on Palestinian rights. In personal dealings, she is undoubtedly sometimes prickly and impatient, though these failings are exaggerated.</p> <p>At the same time, her achievement in overcoming the extraordinary bias and prejudice ranged against her is admirable. Clinton combines intelligence, courage, energy, determination and a powerful sense of destiny. That she is by any measure the best candidate on offer in November cannot be sensibly denied. That she is America\u2019s last defence against Trump\u2019s appalling sexism, racial prejudice and dangerous xenophobia is seriously sobering. Like her or not \u2013 totally trust her or not \u2013 Clinton deserves support. Non-voters across the globe must hope she will avoid new stumbles, keeps well \u2013 and wins.</p>",

But the 2016 presidential race is deeply personal. </p> <p>Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, for years promoted the false \u201cbirther\u201d movement that questioned Barack Obama\u2019s origins \u2013 to the extent that he claimed to have sent <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/07/trump-sends-investigators-to-hawaii-to-look-into-obama/\">investigators </a>to Hawaii to search for his birth certificate in 2011. On Friday, Trump conceded that the president was born in the United States.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s careful cultivation of the lie, and his refusal to denounce it even as recently as Thursday, has crippled the Republican\u2019s standing with black voters, who widely view the birther campaign as an attempt to delegitimize the first black president. Public opinion polls show that he draws a historically low support from black voters, with some surveys showing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-gets-0-support-black-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-nbc-n609026\">0%</a> among black voters. </p> <p>In her speech at the Democratic national convention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">an aspirational and devastating riposte</a> to Trump\u2019s vision for America, Michelle Obama remembered her daughters\u2019 first day of school, and the lurching feeling when she realized that they would grow up in the White House. </p> <p>\u201cI realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight \u2013 how we urge them to ignore those who question their father\u2019s citizenship or faith. </p> <p>\u201cHow we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. How we explain that when someone is cruel, or acts like a bully, you don\u2019t stoop to their level \u2013 no, our motto is, when they go low, we go high.\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s swan song speech was quickly elevated to the pantheon of historic political addresses. Some delegates in the audience wept freely as the first lady spoke.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Clinton voiced appreciation for her powerful and most popular ally.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn\u2019t between Democrat or Republican,\u201d Clinton said in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Though they share a goal on the campaign trail, Obama and Clinton could not have had more opposite ambitions in their roles as first lady.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Obama can\u2019t wait to leave the White House and Hillary Clinton can\u2019t wait to get back in,\u201d said Kate Andersen Brower, journalist and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Women-Americas-Modern-Ladies/dp/0062439650\">author of First Women</a>.</p> <p>Unlike Clinton, who broke with many of the traditions and norms expected of a presidential spouse, including the unprecedented step of setting up an office in the West Wing, Obama has remained firmly in the East Wing. She has devoted herself to supporting military families, fighting childhood obesity and advocating for girls\u2019 education. Under Obama\u2019s leadership, the White House launched the <a href=\"http://www.letsmove.gov/\">Let\u2019s Move</a> campaign to reduce child obesity and the <a href=\"https://letgirlslearn.gov/\">Let Girls Learn</a> initiative, to improve access to education for girls around the world. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/michelle-obama-birther-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bkg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724829\"            data-video-name=\"Michelle Obama slams Trump's 'birtherism' during Clinton rally \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc667fe4b0a8cdc623873c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916michelle_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916michelle.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916michelle_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/michelle-obama-birther-clinton-video\">Michelle Obama slams Trump\u2019s \u2018birtherism\u2019 during Clinton rally</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She has also cemented herself as a cultural icon, with a reach far beyond the realm of politics. Last week, she poured boxed wine for customers at a drug store with talk show host Ellen Degeneres. Before the DNC, she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4\">sang carpool karaoke</a> with comedian James Corden. And the Obamas posed for an intimate portrait published on the cover of the October issue of Essence, a lifestyle magazine directed toward black women. </p> <p>\u201cI think when it comes to black kids, it means something for them to have spent most of their life seeing the family in the White House look like them,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cIt matters. All the future work that Barack talked about, I think over these last few years, we\u2019ve kind of knocked the ceiling of limitation off the roofs of many young kids; imaginations of what\u2019s possible for them.\u201d</p> <p>At the university on Friday, the graduate student Katie Boyette echoed the first lady\u2019s sentiments, and recalled watching Obama\u2019s inauguration, \u201cwalking on to the stage with his family, and they just looked so beautiful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was only 15 at the time, but seeing them, as an African American,\u201d she said, \u201cit was a pivotal moment for me. I started to cry. It was a moment I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p> <p>Before the event, Obama reflected with former first lady Laura Bush at the National Archives, in Washington DC, about the power of their platform.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is you really have a podium, really, always. People still listen to Barbara Bush, don\u2019t you think? I certainly do,\u201d Bush said, referring to her mother-in-law, the wife of George HW Bush. </p> <p>Obama said she would continue to the work she started in the White House: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll leave here and really kick my feet up and say, \u2018Oh, well, good luck with that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Obama\u2019s rousing DNC speech, speculation \u2013 most wishful \u2013 mounted that it might launch a national political career, as such a speech did for her husband in 2004.</p> <p>But Obama has swatted away any speculation that she might seek office one day and earlier this year, the president lowered the chances of a double act to zero. </p> <p>\u201cThere are three things that are certain in life,\u201d the president said during a town hall in Louisiana. \u201cDeath, taxes and Michelle is not running for president.\u201d</p> <p>And yet some still hold out hope.<br></p> <p>\u201cFour more years!\u201d the college crowd chanted on Friday when Obama said her family\u2019s time in the White House had nearly come to an end. \u201cNo!\u201d Obama said, waving her hand and laughing. \u201cNo,\u201d she tried again, more emphatically.</p> <p>After the event, Rachelle Campbell didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment. </p> <p>\u201cOh, I would <em>love</em> for her to run for president one day,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cMichelle for president!\u201d</p> <p>As she closed out her speech to the students, Obama spun one of Clinton\u2019s slogans, \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d, into her own. \u201cI urge you \u2013 I beg of you \u2013 to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves, which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I just described to you?\u201d she asked the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI need your help to do that as well. Are you with me?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s an immaculate simplicity about the way <a href=\"http://madeleinepeyroux.com/\" title=\"\">Madeleine Peyroux</a> and her two accompanists treat these 10 songs, which she calls secular hymns. With composers ranging from Stephen C Foster to Tom Waits, Willie Dixon to Linton Kwesi Johnson, the only subject they seem to have in common is life itself, but the candour of Peyroux\u2019s approach, the warm intimacy of her voice and the incisive clarity of the arrangements draw them together. Jon Herington (guitar) and Barak Mori (double bass) delicately sketch in the diverse styles, giving them a timeless quality. The whole thing was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONeLWfImSWA\" title=\"\">recorded in one day</a> at St&#xa0;Mary\u2019s Church, Great Milton, Oxfordshire, whose generous acoustic provides the distinctive atmosphere.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s stumble at a 9/11 anniversary ceremony last Sunday may have been pounced on by her critics, but many also pointed out that she still managed to fulfil her obligations despite suffering from pneumonia.</p> <p>The knees buckling, as Clinton\u2019s did, is a classic symptom of fainting. Weak and wobbly legs might seem to be caused by the reduction in blood pressure that often results in fainting. But, in fact, this lack of oxygen being pumped around the body does not affect the limbs directly. Instead, it\u2019s a reaction sparked by the brain to ensure its own survival, as limited oxygen supply is so dangerous. If the brain is starved of oxygen for more than a minute or two it is irreversibly damaged.</p> <p>While fainting carries the risk of hitting your head, evolution has judged a potential knock to be less dangerous than the threat of oxygen starvation. So, the brain sends a signal to the leg muscles to stop working. This gets the head closer to the level of the heart quickly, where less pumping effort is needed to receive a life-saving supply of blood. Ironically this is exactly the kind of tough call a future commander in chief might be called upon to make.</p> <p><em>Dr Daniel Glaser is director of <a href=\"https://london.sciencegallery.com/\">Science Gallery</a> at King\u2019s College London</em></p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times.<br></p> <p> In a tweet on Saturday night, the Republican nominee for president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/777280259875975169\">wrote</a>: \u201cMy lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent.
