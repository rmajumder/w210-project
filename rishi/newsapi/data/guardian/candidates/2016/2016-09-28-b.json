  "<p>Hillary Clinton turned to the magnetic power of Bernie Sanders on Wednesday as her battle continued to persuade younger voters to rally to her cause.</p> <p>For months, Sanders and Clinton were often irascible rivals, as she edged towards the Democratic nomination and he continued to inspire a movement of millennials.</p> <p>And on campus in the battleground state of New Hampshire, Sanders\u2019 star power was still there for all to see as hundreds of young voters formed a line snaking across campus, which left many to make do with a spot in an overflow room as he spoke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/millennials-voters-turnout-2016-candidates-reno-nevada\">'I don\u2019t like this election': will millennials, the biggest generation, turn out to vote?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while Sanders has appeared in the past to be a reluctant cheerleader, with the race now entering its final six weeks, he left the audience in no doubt it was \u201cimperative\u201d Americans elect Clinton as their next president.</p> <p>\u201cAll of you know that this is a very tight election. And in fact, New Hampshire could decide the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I am asking you here not only to vote for Secretary Clinton, but to work hard, to get your uncles and your aunts, to get your friends to vote.\u201d</p> <p>His words were delivered with genuine passion in the state where he chalked up his first primary win, setting off his remarkable underdog run. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f782f31407273763da3c938bba9ce51678578a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f782f31407273763da3c938bba9ce51678578a6/0_0_3468_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton supporters New Hampshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audience members wear campaign buttons at the Durham, New Hampshire, rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton and Sanders campaigned together at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, where they detailed a plan on college affordability before a crowd of roughly 1,200. The event marked their second joint appearance on the campaign trail, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/hillary-clinton-dropped-climate-change-from-speeches-after-bernie-sanders-endorsement\">Sanders\u2019 endorsement of Clinton</a> at a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in July.</p> <p>The Vermont senator, whose grassroots campaign for the Democratic nomination drew crowds of tens of thousands of people across the country, emphasized the importance of the election by invoking the names of billionaire Republican donors who were dedicating a combined total of more than $1bn on the 2016 race.</p> <p>\u201cIf anybody tells you that this election is not important, you ask them why the Koch bothers and Sheldon Adelson and other billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect their candidates,\u201d Sanders said.</p> <p>\u201cThis election is enormously important for the future of our country. It is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as our next president.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders then joined Clinton for a discussion on their joint proposal, which would provide free tuition to public universities and colleges for middle- and working-class families.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/millennial-voters-young-republicans-trump-2016-election\">'How do we support a racist?' Young Republicans grapple with 2016 election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The staying power of Sanders as a powerful voice among young voters has remained a palpable factor in the election. While the majority of Sanders voters have rallied behind Clinton, polling has found millennials still uneven in their support for the former secretary of state. One recent survey found that a third of voters under the age of 30 said they planned to vote for third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.</p> <p>Sanders has increased his presence on the campaign trail, along with other high-profile surrogates such as first lady Michelle Obama and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, with a focus on courting college students whose priorities include issues such as student loans, campaign finance reform and climate change.</p> <p>The boost Sanders can help to bring was evident on Wednesday, and in her own remarks, Clinton praised Sanders and his campaign as having \u201cenergized so many young people\u201d. Although the contest was at times bitter, the Democratic nominee sought to draw a contrast between the dynamics within the two parties.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe ran a campaign about issues, not insults.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91b829e5d015e3ecf11f396cc4d6e206b32950a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91b829e5d015e3ecf11f396cc4d6e206b32950a8/0_53_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders acknowledge the audience a campaign stop at the University Of New Hampshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She added that Sanders was \u201cone of the most passionate champions for equality and justice who I have ever seen\u201d, and referred to the senator as her friend.</p> <p>Clinton shared her own personal experience with student loan debt, but noted she was fortunate to have found a job after college and did not face the same circumstances as families today who grapple with rising tuition costs. Declaring Sanders as \u201cabsolutely right\u201d on college affordability, Clinton said she looked forward to working with the senator to pass and implement their plan if elected president.</p> <p>Under the proposal, families earning less than $125,000 a year would be eligible for free tuition from public colleges and universities. Clinton\u2019s platform, dubbed \u201crevolutionary\u201d by Sanders, would also enable students to refinance their college debt and make community college free. <br></p> <p>To those perhaps reticent to embrace her, Clinton urged them not simply to consider her name but the issues on which she has campaigned.</p> <p>Highlighting climate change as an example, Clinton said she never thought in her July acceptance speech at the Democratic national convention that she would have to include the sentence: \u201cI believe in science.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just my name on the ballot,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cEvery issue you care about it \u2013 think about it, because in effect it\u2019s on the ballot, too.</p> <p>\u201cThe next 40 days will determine the next 40 years.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Over the years, Iran has sometimes played a disproportionately large part in US politics. Jimmy Carter blamed the 1979-81 embassy hostage crisis for his failure to secure a second term, and Reagan\u2019s second term was damaged significantly by the Iran-Contra revelations. </p> <p>The deal secured by the Obama administration with Iran over the nuclear question in July 2015 has proved violently divisive between Democrats and Republicans. So it was no surprise that Iran surfaced again in the debate between the presidential candidates on 26 September. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Iranians have not forgotten Clinton's 2008 statement that America could \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump\u2019s maverick tendency by referring to his apparent willingness to open fire on Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf if they threw insults at US sailors. Trump hit back at Clinton for going along with Obama\u2019s Iran policy, complaining \u201cwe lose on everything\u201d \u2013 referring back to his theme of a US diminished by Obama\u2019s presidency. The exchange thus summed up what each candidate saw as one of the other\u2019s main weak points.</p> <p>President Rouhani of Iran can scarcely be enthusiastic about the prospects for the US presidential election. Trump has said directly that the 2015 nuclear deal was \u201cdisastrous\u201d and he would repudiate it, doubling and tripling sanctions (quite how, he doesn\u2019t specify) to force the Iranians to renegotiate. Clinton has supported the nuclear deal and is more likely to follow in Obama\u2019s footsteps, but she has consistently been more hawkish on Iran than Obama. She was enthusiastic in the drive to harden sanctions on Iran in the latter part of Obama\u2019s first term, and Iranians have not forgotten her statement during the presidential nomination contest in 2008 that the US could \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran if it were to attack Israel with a nuclear weapon \u2013 widely reported at the time as \u201cClinton wants to obliterate Iran\u201d.</p> <p>Rouhani himself is engaged in an election campaign (the election will take place in May 2017) and, though still popular, is under increasing pressure because economic benefits from the nuclear deal have yet to reach ordinary Iranians. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has suggested that the US has failed to honour its commitment to lift sanctions. It is an unwritten rule of Iranian politics that Iranian presidents always get a second term, but Rouhani cannot be complacent. He has to appease hardliners, which is why he avoided meeting Obama at the UN general assembly earlier in September. Since the nuclear deal, Iran has drawn closer to Russia over Syria and the US has seemed keener to mollify its ally Saudi Arabia than to explore new opportunities for a better relationship with the Iranians. Depressingly, both Iran and the US have retreated to their familiar comfort zones of mutual hostility.</p> <p>If Trump were elected and really were to follow an America-first policy, retreating from global commitments, conciliating Putin and allowing Russia a larger role (as he has hinted, bizarrely) then relations between states would shift in the Middle East. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia would be isolated (the folly of the UK\u2019s support for Saudi Arabia in its sectarian cold war with Iran would be even more exposed) and the Iranian regime might rejoice. But Trump has also said those things about renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, and has run an ad campaign saying he would \u201ccut the head off Isis and take their oil\u201d, which, though hard to construe, sounds like more intervention rather than less. If he were elected, a lot would depend on Trump\u2019s advisers, but that is no cause for reassurance. John Bolton, whom Trump has spoken of as a possible secretary of state, said in March 2015 in the last weeks before the nuclear deal that the US could still bomb Iran, and that bombing was the only way to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon. Another figure close to Trump, Lt Gen Michael Flynn, made a statement in July 2016 that seemed to suggest he thought Ali Khamenei\u2019s predecessor, Ayatollah Khomeini, was still alive and in office.</p> <p>As many around the world look on at this election with alarm and some despondency, I remember Henry Kissinger\u2019s infamous comment on the Iran-Iraq war \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a pity they can\u2019t both lose\u201d. It seems to be a choice between a man whose daddy bought him a route to the top and a woman whose path was smoothed by the charm of her less intelligent husband. </p> <p>Broadly, in assessing the likely direction of policy under either of the two candidates, one has to expect that Trump would follow through on his rhetoric and take a hard line on Iran. Trump is plainly populist and unpredictable \u2013 an American version of Iran\u2019s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But even to him, a US policy initiative to tear up the nuclear deal must look like only adding to the problems of a murderously chaotic region.</p> <p>Clinton by contrast appears a relatively safe choice \u2013 but would that mean following the unimaginative anti-Iranian groupthink in Washington rather than exploring the opportunities that the Iran nuclear deal should have opened up? In a statement earlier in the year she spoke in all-too-familiar terms of Iran as continuing to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East, of \u201cIran\u2019s negative actions in the region\u201d and standing \u201cside-by-side with our ally Israel and our Arab partners\u201d. We know from Wikileaks that she believed privately in the past that Saudi Arabia was the largest source for terrorist funding worldwide, and that the Saudi government was not doing enough to stop that funding. But a more balanced view of the Saudi-Iranian confrontation has not emerged in her public utterances.</p> <p>Perhaps if, as the polls still indicate, Clinton wins the US presidential contest, greater political freedom of action will permit her to be more imaginative, bold and judicious in the Iran context. Let\u2019s hope so.</p>",

Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u2019s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u2019t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: You know, this is something that they\u2019re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u2019t see...</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Would you recommend it?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: I don\u2019t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player. Let\u2019s face it. Because it has a lot of relationship with many other banks around the world. And it is an international player as well. So it\u2019s important that it be consolidated and, you know, it has a solid base. Let\u2019s also be realistic.

Those who blame ECB policy for the mixed performance of certain German financial firms have been very vocal.

While some banks\u2019 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions.

Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.</p> <p>Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u2013 and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u2013 and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u2013 loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/past-mortgage-fines-give-deutsche-room-for-hope/\">Another fine mess</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I calculate range of &quot;fair&quot; U.S. Justice Department fine for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeutscheBank\">@DeutscheBank</a> based on what other banks have paid as between $200m and $5.5bn <a href=\"https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1\">https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1</a></p>&mdash; Dominic Elliott (@DominicElliott) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc07be4b049b74e4caf0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:22:54.257Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deutsche Bank logo adorns a wall at the company\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated.</strong></p> <p>Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-14bn-dollar-fine-doj-q-and-a\">rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities</a> would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed.</p> <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong>, analyst at <strong>ETX Capital,</strong> explains how Deutsche has some firepower left:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers.</p> <p>Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u2013 this would hit the share price but it\u2019s not the end of the world. And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required. Selling the asset management arm might be required, although this would be negative for earnings growth going forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also argues that we\u2019re not facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/28/deutsche-bank-ceo-help-opec-oil-draghi-germany-live?page=with:block-57eb77c6e4b08ca277ca0ee5#block-57eb77c6e4b08ca277ca0ee5\"><em>as UBS chairman Axel Weber said this morning</em></a>).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not a Lehmans moment in the offing. Banks are generally better capitalised and able to cope with adverse shocks. And Deutsche\u2019s derivatives exposure can be overstated. These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u2019s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t in a fix:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche\u2019s problem is not capitalisation \u2013 it\u2019s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u2019s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u2019s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement. Deutsche has to face down the short hedgies first and then look to raise capital. In that sense a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 kind of nod from Berlin may help.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc182e4b0757c5291926c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:12:04.092Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>How things change...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/781073088947621888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From February:<br>JP Morgan named Deutsche its top global investment bank pick;

According to Die Zeit\u2019s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u201d of the bank.</p> <p>One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned.</p> <p>However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u201cashamed\u201d to take money from the state \u2013 as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe.</p> <p>The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u201cbail-in\u201d regime.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb9337e4b01b56deffc2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T10:15:59.209Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the Die Zeit story on Deutsche Bank here</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Die Zeit\u2019s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-09/deutsche-bank-rettungsplan-finanzaufsichtsbehoerde?utm_campaign=Zeit.de-Wirtschaft&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00fcr Deutsche Bank vor</a></h2> <p>I\u2019ve skimmed through it, and....</p> <p><strong>It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u2019s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt.</strong></p> <p>It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u2019t raise it from the markets.</p> <p>Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached.</p> <p>And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche.

  "<p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian hardliner who presided over a period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">deepening and damaging sanctions</a>, has been blocked from running for president in Iran\u2019s elections next year. <br></p> <p>The former president\u2019s hopes were dashed after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indicated in public that he did not see the prospect of his candidacy as being in the interests of the country. <br></p> <p>In a letter published on Tuesday, Ahmadinejad announced he would not be running, submitting to the wishes of the 77-year-old ayatollah. <br></p> <p>It comes after months of speculation that Ahmadinejad had been building up a campaign to confront the current president, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani, in next year\u2019s vote. Rouhani has to seek re-election if he wants to remain in power for another four years. Under Iranian law, presidents are only allowed two consecutive terms.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the semi-official Fars news agency reported that the supreme leader had explicitly told Ahmadinejad he should not run. Later, two conservative politicians confirmed those reports.</p> <p>On Monday, Khamenei\u2019s official website, in an apparent move to put his opinion on the record, published the transcription of his speech during a meeting with a group of his followers. </p> <p>\u201cSomeone came to see me and considering his own interests and the interests of the country, I told him he should not participate in that matter [elections],\u201d Khamenei is quoted as saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him not to participate, I told him I won\u2019t recommend him participating.\u201d</p> <p>In his letter on Tuesday, which was addressed to Khamenei, Ahmadinejad revealed he had a meeting with the leader at the end of last month, during which he was told not to run. </p> <p>\u201cYou recommended that it was not in [my] interests to run in the elections and I stated my obedience,\u201d he wrote. <br></p> <p>In theory, Ahmadinejad can still put his name on the list as a nominee and the supreme leader does not have the automatic power to block him. In practice, however, the ayatollah has the ultimate power in all state matters. </p> <p>The Guardian Council, a body of jurists and clerics who are close to Khamenei, vets all candidates before any elections in Iran, in a process that has been the subject of much controversy. There has been a heated debate over whether the Guardian Council has the constitutional footing to block candidates but in recent years, it has blocked many reformists and independents, as well as conservatives, from running in parliamentary and presidential elections. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96ac69e166e52fc1177b9018ac39be58bf27cb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96ac69e166e52fc1177b9018ac39be58bf27cb1/0_80_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indicated he did not see the prospect of Ahmadinejad\u2019s candidacy as being in the interests of the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/life-iranians-nuclear-deal\">After the nuclear deal, the west should not disappoint Iranians for the third time | Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the vetting process, which has raised questions about the fairness of Iranian elections, turnouts are usually high in presidential elections.

The size of that lead can vary significantly from poll to poll - she was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-leads-trump-ahead-first-debate-n652141\">seven percentage points</a> ahead according to an NBC poll, then only <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/SEPT_26_NAT_PRES_+_BP.pdf\">one percentage point</a> ahead, according to Quinnipiac University \u2013 but they still suggest Clinton is winning the majority of support. </p> <p>Numbers from LA Times and USC published on Wednesday tell a very different story, though, because they suggest Trump is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/\">four percentage points</a> ahead of Clinton. What\u2019s more, LA Times and USC polling have consistently suggested a more optimistic picture for Donald Trump (no wonder the candidate has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767150340726779904\">tweeted</a> their poll results). So, is this poll more or less accurate than the others? </p> <p>To understand, you have to take a peek at their methodology.</p> <p>Unlike most polls, LA Times and USC tracks a panel of roughly 3,000 US citizens that were randomly contacted from across the country rather than trying to find new respondents each time.

Clinton was knowledgeable and poised; Trump was volatile and at times barely coherent.</p> <p>Despite all evidence that he floundered badly on Monday night, Trump spent the entire following day bragging about winning and insisting that his distracting sniffling was due to a faulty or tampered microphone. He even doubled down on insulting a former Miss Universe, who Clinton pointed out he had called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d, by explaining on Fox News that she had gained \u201ca massive amount of weight\u201d.</p> <p>Lord, give me that confidence!</p> <p>For women like Clinton who are advised to tone down their intelligence lest they come across as unlikeable, the debate and its aftermath mark a promising shift in the way that smart women are perceived. Finally, a man who was markedly less prepared and talented than his female opponent was called out as such. Finally, a woman who has spent her life doing her homework wasn\u2019t made out to be a condescending shrew.

In all this, too, I\u2019m sure she studied up.</p> <p>And it worked. The pre-debate expectations-lowering around Trump\u2019s performance and the post-debate posturing were all in vain.

And the crowd of more than 1,000 New Yorkers boomed at his every \u201cfuck\u201d and chanted his name. He turned his head toward White, smirked then gazed into the lights.</p> <p>\u201cFour point two billion dollars! That\u2019s what I\u2019m worth to this company!\u201d he cried, repeating the price <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/11/ufc-sale-4bn-dana-white-wme-img\">WME-IMG reportedly paid for the UFC this summer</a>.</p> <p>He can do whatever he wants in an organization that usually makes its fighters beg. The UFC needs his face on the Madison Square Garden marquee more than he needs it himself. No fighter is more vital to the company if they are going to get an instant payback on that $4.2bn in seat sales and pay-per-view clicks. Several times White has said that McGregor must defend his belt at 145lb or relinquish it. This only seems fair: McGregor won the featherweight belt in December and is on his third fight without having to defend the title. If this was anyone else in the UFC, the belt would have likely been yanked away by now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/conor-mcgregor-to-fight-eddie-alvarez-in-ufc-205-headline-bout\">Connor McGregor to fight Eddie Alvarez in UFC 205 headline bout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, McGregor persists with this quest to become the first UFC fighter to hold two belts at the same time, and it seems no one wants to tell him no.

Who\u2019s going to slap down the cash cow as he holds a New York crowd in his hand and the pay-per-view buttons on the remote click faster than anyone can count? Aldo, as a great champion for more than six years, deserves another McGregor fight. But he won\u2019t get one. Not now. Not maybe ever. McGregor is supposed to return the featherweight belt after his fight with Alvarez, it\u2019s hard to imagine he will ever give it back. It\u2019s hardly surprising that <a href=\"http://mmajunkie.com/2016/09/interim-champ-jose-aldo-wants-ufc-contract-terminated-after-alvarez-vs-mcgregor-booking \">Aldo now wants out of his UFC contract</a>.</p> <p>So there was McGregor on Tuesday, barely a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/ufc-202-conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz-fight-report-rematch\">his win over Nate Diaz in UFC 202</a>, strutting as much as he ever has. The Las Vegas fights have almost grown stale for him, and it is clear New York was always his next destination. He basked in the blast of the Garden theater crowd on Tuesday, playing to it, feeding it. The other fighters on the stage, champions many of them, had become his props, randomly selected for searing lampooning.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even negotiate new money for himself, imagine that!\u201d McGregor cried, glaring at Alvarez before turing his gaze to the other fighters, all in suits like himself. \u201cLook everybody up here! They\u2019re all dressed like me. They\u2019re all trying to talk like me. They\u2019re all trying to be me. This is a lottery fight and this man took it on his last contract. Imagine that.

Maybe he has made this much. Maybe he hasn\u2019t. On Tuesday it didn\u2019t matter. The UFC has finally come to New York and it is guaranteed to have the only headliner who counts. As long as McGregor is in the cage the money will follow, Jos\u00e9 Aldo and what is right with the 145lb belt be damned.</p> <p>If McGregor wants to drape two belts over his shoulder to carry a show then he will probably get the two belts.

  "<p>Vice-president Joe Biden will make a cameo Wednesday on Law &amp; Order: Special Victim\u2019s Unit, the well-known police procedural, highlighting a very real partnership between the politician and the show\u2019s leading actor, Mariska Hargitay. </p> <p>Hargitay leads the show\u2019s upcoming season, the 18th, playing detective Olivia Benson. Biden will appear in the second episode of the season on 28 September to commend the fictional detectives on their work to end the rape kit backlog, shorthand for thousands of uncounted and untested sexual assault kits that police collected but never processed. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness of the problem at all levels, from citizens to elected officials,\u201d said Ilse Knecht, a senior policy adviser for the not-for-profit Joyful Heart Foundation, founded by Hargitay with the express purpose of ending the backlog. </p> <p>\u201cIt definitely is something that people are becoming more aware of, and more angered by honestly, and inspired to action \u2013 but there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d </p> <p>The episode specifically addresses efforts to end the backlog in Detroit, where more than 11,000 kits were discovered. Now, nearly 10,000 have been tested, identifying 762 suspected serial rapists impacting 40 states and 50 convictions.</p> <p>\u201cRape kit\u201d is the term used to describe forensic evidence collected by nurses following a sexual assault. Women who submit to such exams often undergo invasive, sometimes hours-long examinations of their bodies to collect evidence immediately following the trauma of sexual assault.</p> <p>Evidence from rape kits has helped identify <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/24/untested-rape-kits-backlog-us-legislators\">serial rapists</a>, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/07/25/texas-man-exonerated-through-dna-testing-he-didnt-know-was-going-to-happen/?utm_term=.9543ca8c5344\">exonerated the innocent</a>, and helps build a strong court case. Many advocates also believe that regular testing of rape kits could encourage more women to report sexual assault. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">US Department of Justice</a> estimates that roughly one in three women report an assault. </p> <p>Rape kit backlogs have been found in states across the country, including backlogs of thousands in major cities such as Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, Cleveland and Memphis, Tennessee. Hargitay\u2019s foundation estimates that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.joyfulheartfoundation.org/events/talk-san-francisco-untested-rape-kits\">175,000 backlogged kits</a> were found nationwide as of 2014.</p> <p>For Biden, the episode may hold special meaning. One of Biden\u2019s signature accomplishments as a senator was passage of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/stanford-sexual-assault-joe-biden-victim-letter-brock-turner\">Violence Against Women Act</a>. Biden was also a lead sponsor of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rainn.org/news/biden-talks-about-rape-kit-initiative\">Debbie Smith Act</a>, the first to directly address and attempt to end the rape kit backlog.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a rape kit left sitting on a shelf, there\u2019s a victim without justice,\u201d then senator Biden said during the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://votesmart.org/public-statement/381667/senate-passes-bidens-debbie-smith-reauthorization-act#.V-rrf5MYhAY\">bill\u2019s reauthorization in 2008</a>. \u201cIt is unconscionable that we have the ability to solve these crimes and hold the perpetrators responsible, but because of red tape and lack of funding, the criminals are free and their victims continue to live in fear.\u201d </p> <p>The show marks one of many collaborations between Hargitay and Biden, including on NBC. In 2014, Biden was featured in a public service announcement alongside Hargitay, which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jer1IlrOdQ\">addressed campus sexual violence</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.3333333333% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFR7KM7kK60/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">My heart is full of joy and gratitude for @thejhf&#39;s invaluable ally, my friend, and my hero in this work, @VP Biden, whom we honored at the 2016 #JoyfulRevolution Gala last night.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Mariska Hargitay (@therealmariskahargitay) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-05-11T20:17:15+00:00\">May 11, 2016 at 1:17pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Just this year, Hargitay narrated Biden\u2019s introductory video at the <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/07/joe-biden-speech-democratic-convention-hillary-clintin-1201793944/\">Democratic national convention</a>.

He hopes, almost certainly, to be thrown out.</p> <p>Moore has picked a political fight that may not make sense to people elsewhere. But in Alabama, his intentions are clear: by carrying his fight against the federal government to the brink of judicial destruction, he is appealing to the rebellious nature of Alabamians and positioning himself to run for governor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/alabama-judge-roy-moore-suspended-gay-marriage-stance\">Alabama judge Roy Moore suspended over anti-gay marriage stance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stakes are high for him. He will turn 70 in February, which means he will not be allowed to run for a supreme court spot during the next election, in 2018. And as the sitting chief justice, he has no power to change the trajectory of gay marriage, the issue that brought him to this point. So the worst punishment the Alabama court of judiciary \u2013 a court for judges \u2013 could inflict on him would be to allow him to serve out his term, fading into obscurity as neither martyr nor decision-maker.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the irony,\u201d said Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University. \u201cHe needs them to remove him.\u201d</p> <p>The sparring began in February last year. That\u2019s when a US district court judge <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/12/alabama-same-sex-marriages-federal-judge\">ordered Alabama\u2019s county-level judges</a> to issue marriage licenses to anyone who qualified, regardless of gender or orientation. </p> <p>That night, Moore sent an email out to all those lower judges, with a clear order of his own: \u201cNo probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with Article 1, Section 36.03, of the Alabama Constitution or ... 30-1-19, Ala. Code 1975.\u201d</p> <p>No probate judge <em>shall</em>.</p> <p>The rest of the citation was legal filigree. The word \u201cshall\u201d made it an order, and artfully recalled the source of Moore\u2019s fame and power: standing up to the federal government in 2003, over the display of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. <em>Thou shall, and shall not</em>.</p> <p>A special judicial court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/alabama-judge-roy-moore-suspended-gay-marriage-stance\">removed Moore from his position</a> after that showdown, but the people of Alabama immediately elected him back to it. </p> <p>Moore can do that \u2013 intuit the counterintuitive, surge with the insurgency \u2013 because those Alabama characteristics shaped him from birth. He grew up on Sand Mountain, an Appalachian foothill in north Alabama where his family looked like the other families on the mountain: poor, white, Baptist. He was smart, and a believer, and worked his way through West Point and a turn in Vietnam. He returned to Sand Mountain with a law degree and won an election to a local judicial district. He might have swung his gavel forever in near-anonymity except for one thing: his devotion to the Ten Commandments, which he installed in his courtroom.</p> <p>After a suit by the American Civil Liberties Union in 1997, a judge in Montgomery ordered Moore to either take down the icons or add other diverse documents for context. The following conflict taught Moore a lesson he carried throughout his career: he lost his appeal over the commandments on a decision by a federal judge. But the ensuing pro-Moore rally brought about 25,000 supporters to the steps of the state capital in Montgomery.</p> <p>Moore had glimpsed the power, in Alabama, of one man shaking his fist at the federal government.</p> <p>It\u2019s a trait that goes all the way back to the civil war, and the state\u2019s humiliation in Reconstruction. \u201cEver since the secession, Alabama has been trying to find other ways to accomplish the same end,\u201d said Flynt, the historian. \u201cLately, that has meant claiming a different set of rules apply to us.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Alabama has wielded the 10th amendment to the US constitution on a variety of issues \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/12/alabama-judges-gay-marriage-licenses\">same-sex marriage, for one</a> \u2013 to claim sovereignty as a state.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is we\u2019ve been inconsistent,\u201d Flynt said. \u201cAlabama would never support Massachusetts in a fight to legalize abortions in the third trimester. Or the state of Washington, if it wanted to ban all guns. We would say those states must bend to national opposition. We want it both ways.\u201d</p> <p>After his email last year, a judicial ethics commission suspended Moore, saying his order to lower judges was an abuse of power. In a 32-page complaint, the commission said Moore had \u201cflagrantly disregarded and abused his authority\u201d and \u201cabandoned his role as a neutral and detached chief administrator of the judicial system\u201d.</p> <p>Moore struck back, saying the commission \u201chas chosen to listen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/alabama-gay-marriage-same-sex-ambrosia-starling-roy-moore\">people like Ambrosia Starling</a>, a professed transvestite, and other gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals, as well as organizations which support their agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Now Moore aims to once again parlay a possible setback in Montgomery into defiant victory. A recent poll by one of the state\u2019s most influential conservative groups, the Alabama Forestry Association, found that Moore led other possible contenders by a large margin among likely Republican voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/alabama-gay-marriage-same-sex-ambrosia-starling-roy-moore\">Fighting gay marriage law is 'rude': polite Alabama drag queen is voice for equality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an open secret here that Moore has his eye on the governorship, or at least attorney general,\u201d said Richard Cohen, president of the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, one of Moore\u2019s most consistent opponents. Losing his trial may help his political aspirations, Cohen said, but that shouldn\u2019t be a consideration in court. \u201cIt\u2019s high time the judiciary throws out the ayatollah of Alabama.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to say how successful Moore might be in politics, regardless.</p> <p>He may have spent his career attempting to re-create Alabama in the image of his beloved Sand Mountain, and doing so has tapped into Alabama\u2019s idiosyncratic, sometimes backward, sometimes noble yearning for self determination. But over the decades, the state has changed. Figures whom Moore emulates, such as the late governor George C Wallace, now embarrass Alabamians. In both of Moore\u2019s previous runs for governor, polls have shown that his constituency embraces his ideals, but finds his approach distasteful.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a Baptist, I can tell him that most Baptists don\u2019t agree with his methods,\u201d Flynt said. \u201cPeople here don\u2019t want to be portrayed as ridge-running hayseeds anymore.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Pepe the Frog, a green frog with red lips created by cartoonist Matt Furie in 2005, has been labelled an \u201conline hate symbol\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League after his adoption as an icon of the white supremacist movement.</p> <p>\u201cImages of the frog, variously portrayed with a Hitler-like moustache, wearing a yarmulke or a Klan hood, have proliferated in recent weeks in hateful messages aimed at Jewish and other users on Twitter,\u201d the ADL said, explaining its decision to add the meme to its online Hate on Display database.</p> <p>The ADL\u2019s decision comes two weeks after Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign posted an article pointing to Pepe as the common factor linking Donald Trump and the white supremacist movement. <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/\">The campaign wrote that</a> \u201cin recent months, Pepe\u2019s been almost entirely co-opted by the white supremacists who call themselves the \u2018alt-right.\u2019 They\u2019ve decided to take back Pepe by adding swastikas and other symbols of anti-semitism and white supremacy.</p> <p>\u201cNow white supremacists have given Pepe the cartoon frog some Trump hair \u2013 and the candidate\u2019s own son says he is \u2018honoured to be grouped with\u2019 him,\u201d the post concluded.</p> <p>The character of Pepe, who may be better known as the \u201csad frog meme\u201d, was originally created for Furie\u2019s comic <a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/boysclub/\">Boy\u2019s Club</a>, but achieved online fame in 2008, when the 4Chan forum took a shine to the character. Depending on one\u2019s point of view, the anonymous users of 4Chan adopted, remixed, or stole Pepe, placing him in new situations and permanently linking him with the phrase \u201cfeels good man\u201d, the punchline to the first comic featuring Pepe that hit the forum.</p> <p>For almost a decade, Pepe existed mostly as a meme on the internet, with his roots in 4Chan. The character has become so divorced from his origins in Furie\u2019s comic that a brief resurgence in popularity in 2015 saw 4Chan coining the concept of a \u201crare Pepe\u201d, sharing little-seen variants of the image.</p> <p>But in 2016, the rise of the \u201calt-right\u201d \u2013 the group that sits at the crossover of 4Chan and neo-nazism \u2013 led to Pepe being adopted as an unofficial icon.</p> <p>The second life has disturbed Pepe\u2019s creator, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/14/pepe-the-frog-artist-supports-hillary-clinton\">told the Guardian that</a> \u201cI just try to take it in stride, but the thing that\u2019s come to my attention is \u2026 well, I didn\u2019t know what white nationalists were until, like, yesterday. And the alt-right or whatever? It\u2019s all very new and very strange and definitely not something that I support. I guess Pepe is kind of its own internet thing now. I\u2019m hoping not to get any hate or threats or anything. You have to do a little bit of research to even link it back to me, I think.\u201d</p> <p>The chief executive of the ADL, Jonathan Greenblatt, emphasised the twisted nature of Pepe\u2019s genesis as a hate icon. \u201cOnce again, racists and haters have taken a popular internet meme and twisted it for their own purposes of spreading bigotry and harassing users,\u201d he said. \u201cThese anti-Semites have no shame. They are abusing the image of a cartoon character, one that might at first seem appealing, to harass and spread hatred on social media.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the second time the alt-right has managed to create a new hate symbol.

  "<p>Alicia Machado became an American citizen just in time to vote against Donald Trump. It\u2019s a vote that has been a long time coming.</p> <p>In May 1996, the Venezuelan beauty queen was just 19 years old when she was crowned the winner of the Miss Universe pageant, which had recently been bought by the Manhattan business mogul. That year should have been one of sheer happiness and possibility for Machado, and for a moment it was. \u201cI remember I hug my mom and I tell her, now our lives is going to be changed forever,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview in her adopted hometown of Los Angeles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">Trump attacks Alicia Machado again: 'She gained a massive amount of weight. She was the worst'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But when she put on weight soon after winning, Trump turned what should have been a golden year into the most traumatizing one of her life. It wasn\u2019t just that Trump shamed her about about gaining weight, calling her things like \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201can eating machine\u201d. It wasn\u2019t even that he did so publicly. It was that he did it with the biggest audience he could find, in an attempt to sear her weight fluctuation into the public consciousness, forever changing how she would be remembered.</p> <p>Then on Monday night, in a twist of cosmic justice, Trump \u2013 now the Republican nominee for president \u2013 was presented with a bigger audience for his comments about Machado\u2019s weight than he ever could have imagined, or wanted.</p> <p>In what has been billed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">the most-watched debate in presidential history</a>, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made Trump\u2019s remarks to Machado a centerpiece of their first televised clash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">citing the name-calling</a> \u2013 in particular, Trump calling her \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d in reference to her Latina origins \u2013 as a prime example of her opponent\u2019s demeaning views about women.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s treatment of Machado reached its nadir in January 1997 when, having put the recently crowned Miss Universe on a stringent diet and exercise regime, he scheduled a trip with her to a New York City gym. There he blindsided her with dozens of cameramen, who gathered to film her jumping rope, lifting weights and pedaling a stationary bike. Trump cast himself in the role of disapproving dad, leaning over Machado as she hid her mortification behind a show of charms only the world\u2019s top beauty queen could have mustered, laughing along with reporters and even once planting a kiss on Trump\u2019s cheek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56/0_0_1478_1790/826.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.\" width=\"826\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Draper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although she appeared happy, smiling for the crowd of cameras as she dutifully skipped rope, she tells the Guardian she felt like a mouse in a cage, running endlessly on her fixed wheel for the entertainment of others. \u201cI was in some gym in New York like a mouse,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at that mouse: how she run, how she jump, how she make exercise. Like that. In that moment is when \u2026 problems come to me and start.\u201d</p> <p>The media loved the spectacle, and so did Trump, who didn\u2019t hesitate to pass out some memorable if fallacious tidbits himself. \u201cShe weighed 118 pounds or 117 pounds and she went up to 170, so this is somebody who likes to eat,\u201d he said in an interview at the time. In fact Machado says she gained only a fraction of that weight but she didn\u2019t dare correct him; she was already frightened he\u2019d make good on a threat to strip her of her crown if she didn\u2019t follow through on the performance at the gym. (Trump\u2019s campaign did not return a request for comment.)</p> <p>Machado never did lose her crown, but she lost her health for a time. Though she had never suffered from eating disorders previously, in the years that followed the ordeal at the gym, she struggled with anorexia and bulimia. It took five years before she was fully recovered, and longer before she could talk about what she went through. Now she hopes to use the insights gleaned to help teenagers struggling to love their bodies.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what, no matter who tells you that you don\u2019t look good, that is only outside,\u201d she said, speaking partly, perhaps, to her younger self. \u201cYou are more than some weight. You are more than some phase. You are more than if you are short or tall, or you are black or you are white, or you are skinny or fat or whatever. Your value is how you can work, how you can feel for the people around you.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIn this moment 20 years later, the only thing I need to say is I\u2019m a really happy person. I\u2019m a very successful person. I have my family, my daughter, my career, my dreams, my ideas.\u201d Referring to Trump\u2019s character, she said: \u201cAnd he can\u2019t be a president of the United States of America.\u201d</p> <p>That Machado is thriving these days was readily apparent from where she sat in her publicist\u2019s fourth-floor office in West Hollywood, and apparent in many different realms. She has traded pageants for success as an actor, starring in a string of telenovelas \u2013 a childhood dream come true. She is also a successful businesswoman, with a line of products bearing her name. And she is the proud mother of a seven-year-old girl, whose privacy she fiercely protects; a question about whether she would encourage her daughter to compete in beauty pageants was met with stern disapproval.</p> <p>More recently, she has added another title to her list of identities: activist.

She was impossible,\u201d he said of the former beauty queen.</p> <p>\u201cShe was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a problem,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe had a real problem, not only that, her attitude and we had a real problem with her. Hillary went back into the years and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn\u2019t quite that way, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fat-people-rise-up-we-could-swing-this-election\">Fat people, rise up!

It\u2019s a similar case with his continued insistence on how right he is to call women out for their weight. Machado understands this, perhaps even more acutely than Clinton, because she\u2019s lived it; and she is willing to relive and keep reliving this painful episode if it means shedding light on a man she feels has no business anywhere near the Oval Office.</p> <p>On a call organized by the Clinton campaign on Tuesday afternoon billed as a chance to let Machado respond to Trump\u2019s most recent attacks, the former beauty queen was much more interested in talking about his Democratic rival, whose mention of her story in the debate the night before had moved her to tears. She \u201cnever imagined it would matter to someone so powerful\u201d, she said. </p> <p>But as someone who straddles two powerful voting blocs this election cycle, Machado is a double threat to Trump, and she feels that her celebrity means she has a responsibility to speak up about her experiences when they can help people. \u201cIf I can be a voice for my Latino community in this moment, I will do it,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a matter of Trump: a few years ago she survived a battle with breast cancer, and as a person of faith, she said she struggled to make sense of why God sent her such a challenge. Tearing up ever so slightly for the first time in an hour-long interview, she said she finally determined it was because she needed to share her story: \u201cPeople believe in my words,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople look at me as a strong person. That is my character \u2013 I\u2019m a strong woman.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two weeks ago, 13 September, was the 23rd anniversary of the signing of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7385301.stm\" title=\"\">Oslo agreement</a>, Shimon Peres\u2019 diplomatic masterstroke that was supposed to lead to a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians. In the early afternoon, a rocket streaked across the Mediterranean, clearly visible from the windows of his office in the Peres Peace Center near Jaffa\u2019s coastline. It was carrying a spy satellite, made by the Israeli Aerospace Industry that Peres had founded over half a century earlier. The rocket was a civilian version of the Jericho missile, reported to be the launcher of Israel\u2019s nuclear weapon, developed by the project founded by Peres in the 1950s.</p> <p>That evening, as he was being rushed to hospital in the early stages of a massive stroke from which he would not recover, a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/us-israel-aid-38-billion-record-military-assistance\" title=\"\">$38bn military aid deal</a> was announced in Jerusalem and Washington. It had been Peres who had signed the first arms deal with the United States in 1963.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/shimon-peres-former-israeli-leader-dies\" title=\"\">Shimon Peres, who has died at the age of 93,</a> spent the first half of his public career building Israel\u2019s military might and ensuring its security. The second half was focused on increasingly forlorn attempts to bring peace to his country. The sad irony of his life was that he had been much more successful in his first chapter. His efforts to reconcile the Jewish state with its Arab neighbours failed to achieve similarly lasting results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0a38dc4f0ef31038dc55c3e4804103b62f88431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a38dc4f0ef31038dc55c3e4804103b62f88431/17_405_2035_1222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shimon Peres\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shimon Peres: \u2018the sad irony of his life was that he had been much more successful in the first chapter, building Israel\u2019s military might.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GPO/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Peres had resigned from frontline politics at the age of 54, as many of his colleagues were demanding, after having lost the 1977 general election as leader of the Labour party to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin\" title=\"\">Likud\u2019s Menachem Begin</a>, he would be remembered as one of Israel\u2019s most legendary security \u201chawks\u201d. The man who had purchased the arms for Israel\u2019s army during its early years and conducted the secret negotiations with France for the supply of the Dimona nuclear reactor. The first patron of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Instead, most of the eulogies now being written in his memory are extolling him as a man of peace. For a man who loved to talk of his own experiences and thoughts, Peres never explained the transformation he underwent in the wilderness of opposition.</p> <p>His many detractors said that Peres simply had no choice. With Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat ending the state of war between the two nations and signing the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Camp-David-Accords\" title=\"\">Camp David peace agreement</a>, he had no choice but to move leftwards and try to present himself as a better peacemaker than his Likud rivals. His supporters explained that Peres knew more than anyone else just how strong and secure Israel had become, and could therefore make concessions and take risks for peace in its dangerous neighbourhood. Whatever his motives, he failed to convince the Israeli public with his vision.</p> <p>He led the Labour party in five general elections between 1977 and 1996 and failed each time win an outright victory. His best result was a stalemate with Likud in 1984 which meant he had to share power with his hardliner opponent, Yitzhak Shamir. In two years as prime minister he was busy mainly with stabilising the economy and pulling most of Israel\u2019s troops out of Lebanon. In 1986, he became foreign minister and began secretly negotiating with Jordan\u2019s King Hussein. But the London agreement they reached, which could have launched a peace process including the two countries and the Palestinians as well, was vetoed by Prime Minister Shamir. Peres simply did not have the political or public support to defy him.</p> <p>Six years later, he succeeded, once again as foreign minister, in persuading a reluctant and sceptical <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/13/newsid_3053000/3053733.stm\" title=\"\">Yitzhak Rabin to go along with the Oslo process and shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat</a> on the White House lawn. The international community recognised the breakthrough by giving the three men a joint Nobel peace prize, but it was Rabin who had won the election and sold the agreement to the Israeli public. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/night-yitzhak-rabin-was-assassinated\" title=\"\">Rabin\u2019s assassination</a>, Peres was left to carry Oslo on his own and lost yet again.

While opinion polls showed a majority of Israelis in favour of his positions, in principle, at the ballot box they preferred a stern rightwinger in government. They were willing to trust Labour only with a reassuringly tough retired general leading the party, like Rabin or Ehud Barak. Prime minister Peres simply wasn\u2019t a combination of words that inspired enough confidence and security.</p> <p>Perhaps the final irony of Shimon Peres\u2019 life was that his last act in the service of peace, remains secret and undocumented. As an octogenarian president, he observed the conventions of the ceremonial office and refrained from openly intervening in politics. That didn\u2019t stop the commanders of the army and chiefs of the intelligence services turning to him for advice when they felt their political masters were dangerously wrong. Towards the end of his seven-year term, he was the secret leader of the faction within the defence establishment that successfully worked to block the plans of Netanyahu, the prime minister and the defence minister Ehud Barak to launch a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/23/leaked-spy-cables-netanyahu-iran-bomb-mossad\" title=\"\">military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations</a>, before it could build an atomic bomb.</p> <p>Ultimately he had to rely on the generals and spy chiefs to avert war. He never convinced ordinary Israelis to make the same leap of faith he had.</p>",

Three times in the course of a rally in Florida, Trump called out \u201cthe corrupt corporate media\u201d and gestured towards his supporters to turn towards the press pen to boo, hiss and even, in one instance, shout \u201cgo to hell\u201d.</p> <p>Trump constantly revisited different moments in the debate and told of how, before taking the stage, \u201cI took a deep breath and pretended I was talking to my family.\u201d He recounted what he felt were his best lines during the debate \u2013 like, \u201cYou are experienced but it\u2019s bad experience\u201d \u2013 and touted how he had done well on the issue of trade and exposed Clinton\u2019s \u201creal positions\u201d on Nafta, which he described as \u201cthe single worst deal you\u2019ll ever see\u201d.</p> <p>He even criticised Lester Holt, the debate moderator, whom Trump described as \u201cthe emcee\u201d, for challenging him when he praised stop and frisk, a controversial police tactic that involved New York police officers stopping pedestrians without a warrant, asking them questions and checking them for weapons. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the practice was unconstitutional as it disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos. Trump insisted: \u201cI also explained last night stop and frisk was constitutional. The emcee argued with me, taking up the time. Law enforcement does stop and frisk every day.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also re-litigated his false claim that he had opposed the Iraq war from the beginning, asking the crowd for approval. \u201cAnd does everybody believe me, I was against going into Iraq?\u201d he asked the crowd.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54q33\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754975\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea1adfe4b0a785ec48bdc4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926wrap_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926wrap.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926wrap_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In contrast, Clinton took a far more jubilant tone on Tuesday, mocking Trump\u2019s complaints about his microphone. \u201cAnybody who complained about the microphone is not having a good night,\u201d she told reporters on her plane.</p> <p>Though Trump supporters in Florida responded with loud cheers when asked by state party chair Blaise Ingoglia who they thought won the debate, they were far more equivocal in one-on-one interviews.</p> <p>Standing outside the rally, Monty and Cat Alger, an ex-husband and ex-wife, thought Trump had room for improvement. Monty Alger thought Trump \u201ccould have done better\u201d, but said he despised Clinton: \u201cIf it were up to me, I\u2019d put her ass in jail.\u201d </p> <p>Cat Alger echoed a famous country music song: \u201cLike Tammy [Wynette], stand by your man.\u201d She supported the Republican nominee because \u201che tells it like it is, whether you want to hear it or not\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> </figure>  <p>Matty Hall, from Palm Bay, Florida, said she felt that \u201cfor it being [Trump\u2019s] first debate and no experience, he did better than I thought\u201d.

He thought that \u201cit wasn\u2019t [Trump]\u2019s worst debate but it wasn\u2019t his best\u201d.

In her analysis, Trump \u201cneeded to come out and hit her harder than he did.\u201d She added: \u201cHe did OK but Trump can do better\u201d. </p> <p>Owens took issue at those who might take offense at her shirt. Before Trump, the slogan America First had been associated with those wanting to keep the United States out of the second world war, many of whom were sympathetic to Nazi Germany. In her opinion, \u201cthey are just looking to attack Trump. Screw them.\u201d</p>",

He would have still had achieved more to build Israel\u2019s security than nearly anyone else alive.</p> <p>He could have resigned from the Knesset in the mid-1960s, following his mentor and patron David Ben-Gurion. Still in his early 40s, instead of languishing on the backbenchers, a lucrative future in business was open to him, as the man who had negotiated Israel\u2019s most crucial arms and technology deals, and had laid the foundations for its defense industry.</p> <p>In 1977, when he lost the election to Menachem Begin and Likud first came to power, the correct thing would have been to make way for a new generation of Labor Party leaders. But he soldiered on a leader of the opposition, despite another humiliating defeat in 1981.</p> <p>The crushing loss in 1996, by a fraction of a point to Benjamin Netanyahu, should have been another clear signal that his time was up. And again, four years later when he lost in a secret ballot for the presidency against political nonentity Moshe Katzav, he kept on going, even when he seemed pathetic to everyone around.</p> <p>Even when he was pushed by younger prime ministers in to minor cabinet posts way beneath his experience. Even when he twice felt forced to leave the party he had served for over six decades. Even when his last hurrah, a second and finally successful run for president, meant separating from his wife Sonia and leading their last years apart.</p> <p>On the way he broke nearly all the Israeli political records of longevity. He served as Knesset member for over 47 years, no one else comes even close. He is the only man to have ever served in all four top government jobs \u2212 defense, foreign and finance minister, as well as prime minister. He had reached the top again and again, won the Nobel Peace Prize. But it was never enough and he always wanted to keep going.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb52fae4b04cbd30bc3d0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbeaumont\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T05:20:49.400Z\">6.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile Yaakov Katz in the Jerusalem Post has <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Pushing-the-nation-forward-468867\">this take</a> on Peres\u2019s wars and his political disappointments. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In his 93 years, Peres saw it all and was at every major juncture this country went through in its 68 years of statehood.

While political opponents called him the \u201ceternal loser\u201d for his failure to win several elections, he never let the losses linger. The next day he would be back at work, thinking up new ways to advance the country.</p> <p>While others viewed his dreams as na\u00efve policy-making \u2013 especially with regards to the Palestinians and the Oslo Accords \u2013 Peres refused to give up on peace and the opportunities he believed it would afford the Jewish State.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb5163e4b08ca277ca0ec3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T05:18:54.056Z\">6.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull</p> <p>\u201cShimon Peres was a fierce defender of Israel\u2019s security and its ability to defend itself.

  "<p>Ever since the state of Israel was created in 1948, Shimon Peres, who has died aged 93, was at or near the centre of action. A protege of David Ben-Gurion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2012/may/14/archive-1948-establishment-israel-jewish-state\">Israel\u2019s first prime minister</a>, Peres became premier himself on three occasions, foreign minister for another three, and state president from 2007 until 2014. He fashioned alliances with France in the 1950s, and planted the seeds for Israel\u2019s embryonic electronics and aircraft industries. During the 60s, he honed the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and secretly amassed Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons.</p> <p>For 15 long years after it fell from power in 1977, Peres led the Labour party. In the early 80s, he resuscitated Israel\u2019s economy, and in 1994 shared the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/\">Nobel prize</a> for his role in the efforts to create peace in the Middle East through the Oslo accords. In the same year, he cemented Israel\u2019s peace treaty with Jordan. Defeated at the polls in 1996, he returned in 2001 as foreign minister, thereby giving Israel\u2019s controversial new premier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/ariel-sharon\">Ariel Sharon</a>, a much-needed veneer of respectability. And in 2006, he left Labour, his home for five decades, to help Sharon set up his powerful new breakaway faction, Kadima.</p> <p>A simple listing of achievements only hints at the phenomenon that was Peres. The Jerusalem Report news magazine called him \u201cIsrael\u2019s only world-class statesman, perhaps Zionism\u2019s last pragmatic visionary\u201d. Peres wrote 11 books, read poetry voraciously, and could quote from Old Testament prophets, French literature and Chinese philosophy with equal ease. After the assassination of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryyitzhak-rabin-1580649.html\">Yitzhak Rabin</a> in 1995, he bound together a shattered nation.</p> <p>And yet, despite all his talent, there was something tragic about the man. Peres contested five elections without winning a single outright victory. His longest tenure as premier was two years, and came while he was in an awkward alliance with his Likud enemies. He lost the Labour leadership on the eve of the party\u2019s return to power in 1992. A slew of terrorist attacks in early 1996 allowed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> victory over Peres in Israel\u2019s first direct prime ministerial elections. No wonder Orly Azoulay titled her 1996 biography of him The Man Who Didn\u2019t Know How to Win.</p> <p>Some of his initiatives were halted before they had got going, such as his 1987 London agreement with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-king-hussein-of-jordan-1069507.html\">King Hussein of Jordan</a>. Others collapsed because opponents chipped away at the scaffolding, as with the Oslo accords. Even when in 2000 he stood for state president \u2013 the ultimate consolation prize for veterans \u2013 Knesset members opted not for him but for the pedestrian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/moshe-katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>.</p> <p>All the same, Peres campaigned well into his 80s. No sooner had the media written him off as a \u201cserial loser\u201d than he would pop up again as a saviour in a time of crisis. He was used to playing the long game. In 2007 Katsav resigned in disgrace amid charges of sexual improprieties, and Peres was elected president in his stead. Virtually across the board, Israeli editorials spoke of a national sigh of relief in recognition of a long-maligned yet irreplaceable figure.</p> <p>\u201cI am a child of the generation that lost one world and went on to build another,\u201d Peres once wrote.</p> <p>Son of Yitzhak and Sarah Persky (he later Hebraised the family surname), he was born in Vishneva, then a largely Jewish town located in the borderlands between modern Belarus, Poland and Lithuania. His New York-born cousin Betty Perske, one year his junior, went on to achieve fame as the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/13/lauren-bacall-obituary\">Lauren Bacall</a>. Shimon\u2019s maternal grandfather, Zvi Meltzer, who later died in the Holocaust, inspired his love for literature. Frequent antisemitic raids undermined Vishneva\u2019s patina of autonomy. At the age of 10, Shimon left to settle in Tel Aviv, where his father, a lumber merchant, had emigrated two years earlier.</p> <p>At 15 Peres joined the Ben Shemen agricultural youth village, a crucible of future Israeli leaders. He soon met the Ukrainian-born Sonia Gelman and wooed her by moonlight with readings from Marx\u2019s Das Kapital. The couple married in 1945 after Sonia had served as a nurse and driver with the British Army in Egypt. She became a source of strength to him in private and an enigmatically deferential figure in public.</p> <p>Peres became leader of the Hano\u2019ar Ha\u2019oved (Working Youth) Zionist movement when he was 19, and founded Kibbutz Alumot in the Jordan Valley. Apprised of his skills, Ben-Gurion appointed Peres head of mobilisation for the Haganah underground in 1947. He procured plane parts from the US, Italy and Czechoslovakia during the 1948 war. He even became secretary of Israel\u2019s navy, although he confessed: \u201cMy experience consisted of moderate proficiency at breaststroke and one childhood attempt to launch a raft off the coast of Tel Aviv.\u201d</p> <p>In 1950 Peres travelled to Washington as military attache. By 1953, aged 29, he was director of the entire defence ministry, an office he held until 1959. Peres helped plan the Sinai campaign of 1956. In 1957, he successfully lobbied the French government for a nuclear reactor, and established a hi-tech intelligence unit, Lakam, whose operatives served him in future clandestine ventures. He also tried to abolish military rule over Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, but Ben-Gurion overruled him and the law was only repealed in 1966.</p> <p>Israel later promised that it would not introduce atomic weapons into the region \u2013 \u201cat my urging\u201d, wrote Peres. Though he conceded that Arab leaders saw his creation, Israel\u2019s secret Dimona plant in the Negev Desert, as \u201ca worrisome fuzzy deterrent\u201d, Peres the politician enjoyed creating such deliberate ambiguities.</p> <p>In 1959 Peres was elected to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for the ruling Mapai party (forerunner of Labour) and immediately became deputy defence minister. He bought Israel\u2019s first US weapons, but resigned in 1965 with the prime minister, Ben-Gurion. Their breakaway Rafi party proved unsuccessful, winning only 10 seats, and in 1968 Rafi rejoined Labour, as did Peres, who became its deputy general secretary.</p> <p>Israel gained the Palestinian-populated territories of Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 war \u2013 an acquisition that was to change its politics more profoundly than was realised at the time. In 1969 Peres was charged with developing these areas, and absorbing new eastern European immigrants. He then served in turn as communications, transport and information minister. When, in 1974, the prime minister, Golda Meir, was forced to resign, Peres gamely stood for election to the vacant post of party leader, but lost narrowly to an equally youthful, native-born military hero, Rabin. This was a battle that would be repeated often over the next two decades.</p> <p>Appointed defence minister that June, Peres immediately plunged into the intricacies of negotiating a second interim Sinai treaty with Egypt. He also opened a \u201cgood fence\u201d border crossing with Lebanon, revitalised the IDF after the near-humiliation of the 1973 war, allowed legally questionable settlements on the West Bank, and masterminded the daring rescue of hostages from Entebbe in 1976. Yet support haemorrhaged for a government blighted by scandal and economic malaise. Rabin resigned in April 1977 and Peres was prime minister for barely a month before <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0816.html\">Menachem Begin</a>\u2019s Likud demolished Labour at the polls.</p> <p>Peres thus won the dubious privilege of becoming Labour\u2019s first-ever opposition leader. He then saw Begin negotiate the historic peace agreement with Egypt that he had expected to make himself. Rabin\u2019s memoirs decried Peres for betraying him in 1977, and Begin was able to exploit the spat to triumph at the 1981 polls. Peres meanwhile became a vice-president of the Socialist International in 1978. There he befriended <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-willy-brandt-1556598.html\">Willy Brandt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/30/obituaries/bruno-kreisky-austria-s-leader-for-a-record-13-years-dies-at-79.html\">Bruno Kreisky</a>, British Labour politicians and delegates from Africa and Asia. Such ties were to prove invaluable.</p> <p>Likud\u2019s ill-fated Lebanese war of 1982 allowed Peres to tap into national unease. He fought the 1984 elections to a dead heat, and duly headed a national unity government, agreeing that he would hand power to Likud\u2019s pugnacious new leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/01/yitzhak-shamir\">Yitzhak Shamir</a>, after two years. As prime minister, Peres made up for lost time. He withdrew troops from Beirut to a narrow \u201csecurity zone\u201d in southern Lebanon. Then he slashed Israel\u2019s inflation rate from 450% to 16% by forcing the Histadrut labour confederation and big business into a national compact. When Shamir became prime minister, Peres served as foreign minister (1986-88), during which time the iconoclastic pragmatist and security hawk, who once called settlements \u201cthe roots and eyes of Israel\u201d, blossomed into a peace campaigner.</p> <p>He had first met King Hussein in 1974. Their mutual respect was clear from the outset. Peres felt that a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation could break the stalemate in the territories, and bring peace to Israel, and in 1987 negotiated with the king in London. Shamir, angry that Peres had \u201cgone behind his back\u201d, quashed the deal. The acrimony between them deepened, and probably exacerbated Palestinian frustration. For his part Hussein blamed Peres for leaking their secret talks.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s 1988 election took place against the backdrop of the Palestinian intifada (the uprising against Israel in the occupied territories). It ended in deadlock, and led to another unsatisfactory \u201cunity government\u201d. Peres rejected Shamir\u2019s endorsement of settlements and, in 1990, sought to topple the government. At the last moment, the religious Shas party withdrew the support it had promised him. In early 1992, Rabin replaced Peres as party leader, and went on to win the June elections for Labour.</p> <p>Miraculously, their enmity turned to partnership, with Peres, the foreign minister, as the engine and Rabin, the prime minister, as the gears and brakes (or so Peres later described it). A longtime foe of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Peres now persuaded Rabin to consider talks with the PLO leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/11/israel.guardianobituaries\">Yasser Arafat</a>. Peres\u2019s lieutenants, led by Yossi Beilin and Uri Savir, opened a secret track with PLO negotiators outside Oslo. At the subsequent White House lawn signing in September 1993, Peres nudged a reluctant Rabin to shake hands with Arafat \u2013 an image that went round the world.</p> <p>For two years, Peres worked furiously to keep the imperfect peace on track. Given the problem of settlements, it was, he quipped, an attempt \u201cto turn an omelette back into eggs\u201d. He negotiated directly with Arafat, turned the \u201cGaza and Jericho First\u201d proposals agreed at the White House into reality, drafted the 1994 Paris Protocol of Israeli-Palestinian economic relations, promoted regional summits and in 1995 sealed Oslo II (an agreement to restore Palestinian rule to six major West Bank towns). Rabin, meanwhile, concentrated on Syrian talks via his protege, the military chief of staff Ehud Barak.</p> <p>But Israeli fury at persistent terrorism prompted demonstrations against the Rabin-Peres administration. In 1995, Yigal Amir assassinated Rabin at a peace rally. Peres, Amir\u2019s other intended target, was just metres away. He took over as prime minister on a wave of sympathy. With hindsight, Peres\u2019s decision not to call immediate elections was an error. Nonetheless, he achieved much in his six months in charge: he implemented Oslo II ahead of schedule, assuaged the religious right, bolstered the economy and co-operated with Arafat over the first-ever Palestinian elections.</p> <p>Support for Peres evaporated when successive bomb attacks killed dozens in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and talks with Syria came to naught. Likud warned: \u201cPeres will divide Jerusalem.\u201d Arab states feared that his dream of a borderless Middle East spelled Israeli economic colonialism by stealth. Peres\u2019s retaliatory invasion of Lebanon in April 1996 also misfired, when more than 100 refugees perished in one Israeli bombing. For all Peres\u2019s Panglossian fantasies of a \u201cnew Middle East\u201d the electorate narrowly yet decisively favoured Netanyahu that May.</p> <p>Peres chided \u201cBibi\u201d for \u201c111 days of verbiage\u201d, and held on as party chairman until Barak ousted him in 1997. After Labour\u2019s victory in 1999, Barak gave Peres the nebulous portfolio of \u201cregional co-operation minister\u201d, but sidetracked him over the peace process. Peres had meanwhile founded a centre for peace in his name, with headquarters in Ajami, a largely Arab neighbourhood of Jaffa. It is dedicated to dialogue, cultural, economic and youth initiatives, and healthcare assistance to Palestinians.</p> <p>In 1998 he wrote forewords to four books on the 50th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence. He also released For the Future of Israel, a series of philosophical conversations with the author Robert Littell. Where other Israeli politicians grudgingly accepted a Palestinian state as inevitable, only Peres argued in Le Monde that it was necessary for Israel\u2019s future. When the new intifada broke out in 2000, polls backed Peres to restore the peace process. In the event, Barak sabotaged his rival\u2019s \u201cvirtual candidacy\u201d, only to lose at the polls himself. Peres emerged as foreign minister under Sharon in a Likud-Labour coalition government. This time Peres was the liberal brake to Sharon\u2019s determinedly rightwing engine. Whether he was an effective brake was another story.</p> <p>Although many Israeli leftists felt outraged at his \u201cbetrayal\u201d, experienced Peres-watchers knew that his personal friendship with Sharon counted for more than ideological congruence. Less charitable souls felt that his overvaulting ambition had once again trumped his principles. Similar charges resurfaced in 2005, when he left Labour to co-found Kadima with Sharon, barely a month after losing the Labour leadership to an outside candidate, Amir Peretz. Peres served as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ehud-olmert\">Ehud Olmert</a>\u2019s deputy premier after Kadima convincingly won elections in 2006. The following year, by now Israel\u2019s longest serving parliamentarian, he left the Knesset to contest the presidency.</p> <p>As Israel\u2019s ninth president, he helped restore his nation\u2019s battered reputation. He became the first Israeli head of state to address a Muslim state legislature when he spoke to Turkey\u2019s national assembly in November 2007. Turkey and Japan supported his \u201cvalley of peace initiative\u201d for economic revival and joint industrial projects in the West Bank. In 2008 he launched the Israeli Presidential Conference, an annual brainstorming forum which attracted guests including George W Bush, Elie Wiesel, Robert De Niro, Rupert Murdoch and Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. In 2009 Peres served as \u201cnational host\u201d for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-benedict-xvi\">Pope Benedict XVI</a>\u2019s visit to Israel. At last he gained the affection of Oriental Jews \u2013 half of Israel\u2019s population \u2013 who had once seen him as an Ashkenazi elitist.</p> <p>Most unusually for an Israeli president, Peres became his nation\u2019s top diplomat. He asked Palestinians and Arab nations to join in \u201ca great journey towards a world built on logic and intellect, not land\u201d. He negotiated directly with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-abbas\">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, president of the Palestinian Authority, on behalf of a taciturn Netanyahu. He placated President Barack Obama when Israeli actions offended the Oval Office. And in 2013 he delivered a video interview beamed from Jerusalem to a security summit in Abu Dhabi for 29 foreign ministers of Arab and Muslim countries. His honours included appointment as honorary GCMG in 2008, award of the US presidential medal of freedom in 2012 and the Congressional gold medal in 2014.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Peres still engendered controversy. In his inaugural presidential speech he bluntly stated that Israel had to \u201cget rid of the territories\u201d. He averred that he had changed his position, not his beliefs. Although many hailed him as a man of vision and peace, Israeli rightists flayed him for playing into the hands of the PLO. Many Likud supporters resented the way he pushed his peace agenda while the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, was persona non grata in most capitals. More than that, his stance seemed to contradict Netanyahu\u2019s policies.</p> <p>For their part, the Israeli left accused Peres of acting as a figleaf for an obdurate Likud administration. They were dismayed when in 2009 he defended Israel\u2019s continuing attack on Gaza. Days later he found himself at the centre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/turkish-prime-minister-gaza-davos\">an unseemly row</a> with the Turkish prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> at the Davos world economic summit as a result. Though Peres\u2019s diplomatic intercession smoothed ruffled feathers, he still warned against a nuclear Iran \u201ctaking over the Middle East\u201d and rejected the critical UN report into the Gaza war. Former liberal allies were perplexed when, that May, he proclaimed newly elected Likud premier Netanyahu a peace pioneer \u2013 an opinion he reversed in 2015 when he blamed Netanyahu (re-elected that year) for talking peace but doing nothing to implement it.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years,\u201d wrote the Israeli historian Ze\u2019ev Sternhell, \u201cShimon Peres \u2026 destroyed everything of value [in Labour].\u201d Other leftists blamed him for initiating with Oslo II the settlement bypass roads that seemed to render a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Peres repeatedly called Abbas a serious and true partner for peace, even admiring the courage, if not agreeing with the timing, of Abbas\u2019s 2012 UN bid for Palestinian statehood. Yet many Palestinians blamed Peres for saddling them with inferior terms in the Paris economic deal of 1994. Now Israeli critics charged him with abusing the apolitical nature of the presidency.</p> <p>After leaving the presidency in 2014, Peres continued work for his peace centre. When Israeli authorities denied the centre tax-exempt status because it trained doctors from Gaza, the centre suspended its application and continued with its programme, which by 2015 had helped 250 personnel. As late as November 2015, his health now failing, he insisted that Israel faced \u201ceternal war\u201d if there was no Palestinian state.</p> <p>Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\">David Frost</a>, politics is built on compromise. Nor was he above taking audacious decisions, as in 1989 when he ordered Mossad to abduct the nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu from British soil, or in 2002, when he attracted millions to invest in nanotechnology.</p> <p>He certainly brought a touch of aesthetic philosophical discrimination to the world of politics. His books included The Next Step (1965), David\u2019s Sling: The Arming of Israel (1970), Entebbe Diary (1991), The New Middle East (1993), Battling for Peace (1995), The Imaginary Voyage: With Herzl in Israel (2000) and Ben Gurion: A Political Life (2011). Among the numerous biographies of him are Matti Golan\u2019s Road to Peace (1989) and Michael Bar-Zohar\u2019s Shimon Peres (2013).</p> <p>He is survived by his daughter, Zvia, sons, Yonathan and Nehemia, and six grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Shimon Peres, statesman, born 1 August 1923; died 28 September 2016.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September 2016. An earlier version said that Peres was survived by his wife, Sonia. She died in 2011.</p>",

After the 2004 and 2012 convention seasons, both George W Bush and Obama were able to hold onto their convention bumps for a few weeks. (For Bush, his post-convention bump lasted about a month. For Obama, his numbers stayed high for two weeks.)</p> <p>But, in both cases, the candidates\u2019 poll numbers took a hit after the first debate.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"How debates affect candidate's poll numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">How debates affect candidate's poll numbers</a> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite trailing Bush in the polls for much of the fall of 2004, a majority of viewers polled thought John Kerry won the first debate. The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.</p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-DNC bump had disappeared almost entirely by yesterday, with the latest shows pre-debate showing the pair neck-and-neck. </p> <p>But largely favorable reviews across the board for Clinton\u2019s debate performance may now affect polls - even if that may not reflect the eventual election winner.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8416e4b08ca277ca0bdd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:53:34.851Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mary J Blige interviews Clinton</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hip hop queen Mary J Blige interviewed Hillary Clinton for a new show to be unveiled on Apple Music Friday, with a preview showing Blige questioning Clinton about race and singing to her. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in my community think Obama was blocked in Congress because he was black.

But he also wisely used his discretion to keep the debate going at times instead of sticking to the somewhat arbitrary 15 minutes allotted for each segment.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/lester-holt-moderator.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;_r=0\">Michael M Grynbaum called him</a> the \u201cminimalist moderator\u201d:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He was silent for minutes at a time, allowing Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump to joust and bicker between themselves \u2014 and sometimes talk right over him \u2014 prompting some viewers to wonder if Mr. Holt had left the building.</p> <p>But his reticence as moderator also gave viewers an unfiltered glimpse of the candidates: their views, speaking styles, and reactions under pressure.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/09/26/lester-holt-shows-he-doesnt-know-the-meaning-of-impartial/\">Kyle Smith in the New York Post</a> said Clinton got off easy compared to Trump:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the early going, it looked like it was going to be an ideal, Jim Lehrer-style performance from Lester Holt, the \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor. Lehrer was so boringly nonpartisan, so unwilling to play gotcha that he was always hotly in demand to moderate debates. For the first half or so, Holt gave simple, broad, open-ended questions and let the candidates go at it. He didn\u2019t venture into live fact-checking, didn\u2019t much quarrel with the nominees, didn\u2019t ask persnickety questions... But in the last half of the show, Holt started going after Trump. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea76a0e4b08ca277ca0b96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:49:23.759Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two of the country\u2019s major publications are running campaign ads across their debate coverage this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nataliewsj/status/780761459785687040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WSJ and the Washington Post right now, and the banner ads running on top.

  "<p>Indigenous peoples are part blockading one of the main tributaries of the River Amazon and demanding that Peru\u2019s new president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski visit them - with no positive response to date. The protest is one of the latest instances of social unrest across Peru and in Loreto in particular, which, at 50% larger than the UK, is Peru\u2019s biggest and most difficult-to-access region - as well as one of the poorest.</p> <p>This poverty, together with poor infrastructure and a weak or non-existent state, is particularly outrageous given that some of Peru\u2019s historically most productive oil fields are in Loreto. True, more than 40 years of operations, mostly by foreign companies, have transformed the region to the extent that the economy is now largely dependent on oil, generating wealth through tax revenues and casual employment for many people. But how have such revenues been spent? And what of the fact that the location of the oil fields has meant the systematic invasion and exploitation of huge swathes of indigenous peoples\u2019 territories - allegedly contaminating rivers and local inhabitants, blocking efforts by communities to obtain land title, creating economic dependency, dominating local politics, buying off leaders, misleading community members, dumping trash, wasting staggering amounts of energy and resources, and, in general, leaving precious little behind in terms of infrastructure, basic services, education, beneficial projects and skilled, sustainable employment?<br></p> <p>The problems caused by operations in this region tend to only make Peruvian or international media when there is some kind of \u201cspill\u201d - oil painting black the forest, fish, fauna. None has been recently reported where the protestors are, but not far upriver approximately <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/09/negotiations-and-protests-ongoing-in-wake-of-oil-spills-in-peruvian-amazon/\">4,000 barrels were spilled</a>, by the North Peruvian Pipeline, in mid-August at a community called Nuevo Alianza. Then another spill was reported on 24 September along the River Pastaza near the border with Ecuador, and then yet another was reported the following day upriver from Nuevo Alianza. As of 12 August 2016 Peru\u2019s government agency regulating energy and mining, OSINERGMIN, had registered 190 pipeline spills across the country since 1997 - although it attributes 67 of them to vandalism.<br></p> <p>One indigenous leader involved in this struggle is Kichwa man Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn, currently at the protest. Here, in an interview on 24 September with the Guardian in Loreto\u2019s capital, Iquitos, Fach\u00edn gives his take on what is happening there and in Loreto in general: </p> <p>DH: Where exactly is the protest taking place?</p> <p>JF: It\u2019s on the River Maranon at the oil pumping station at Saramuro [the start of the North Peruvian Pipeline running from Loreto to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast].</p> <p>DH: How many people, more or less?</p> <p>JF: We\u2019re talking about more than 2000 indigenous people. And more keep arriving, gathering there.</p> <p>DH: How long have the protesters been there for?</p> <p>JF: It\u2019s an indefinite protest. It\u2019s been going on 24 days now [as of 24 September] and it will continue until their demands are met. And they\u2019re asking, to resolve those demands, that the country\u2019s leading authorities visit: the president or prime minister and relevant ministers, such as the Minister of Energy and Mining, Health, Education, Agriculture and Economy and Finance. They\u2019re also requesting Loreto\u2019s four congressmen, the regional governor, the president of Perupetro, the president of Petroperu, and Pluspetrol\u2019s general manager. That\u2019s what they\u2019re requesting - to discuss, at a political level, the viability of oil activity in that region. That\u2019s what\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s why they want those people.</p> <p>DH: What are the main problems? That\u2019s to say, why are people there protesting? What are the complaints?</p> <p>JF: Well, this is the result of all the oil spills over the last few years. People can\u2019t take any more. So they\u2019re protesting. The main reason is the contamination over the last 40 years - and the issue of doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2016/jan/14/look-at-the-oil-spilled-in-the-worlds-2nd-best-place-for-wildlife\">remediation in Lot 8</a> [a concession held by state-owned company Petroperu until 1996 and then Pluspetrol since then], Lot 192 [held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/indigenous-peruvians-amazon-pollution-settlement-us-oil-occidental\">US-based company Occidental</a> before 2000, by Pluspetrol from 2000 to August 2015, and now by Canadian-headquartered Pacific Exploration and Production], and along all the pipelines. Another issue is the proposed Law on Environmental Vigilance and Monitoring - for that to be discussed. Another issue is the revision of Pluspetrol\u2019s contract [for Lot 8], given that it\u2019s been working for many years there with total impunity. Another issue is fixing, or replacing, the North Peruvian Pipeline [run by Petroperu].</p> <p>DH: It\u2019s not only the North Peruvian Pipeline where there are spills or leaks, right? There are other pipelines.</p> <p>JF: There\u2019s an entire network. We want to discuss this and have a technical study done to see what has happened to this infrastructure after 40 years.</p> <p>DH: The companies have worked there for 40 years?</p> <p>JF: More than 40 years. 45 years, there or thereabouts. More than four decades. The pipelines are leaking now. Just today there was a leak, in Andoas [on the River Pastaza]. They\u2019re looking into how much was spilt. </p> <p>DH: When was that?</p> <p>JF: Lot 192. It\u2019s just been made public. There are spills in the oil concessions themselves as well as along the transport routes. </p> <p>DH: Is the contamination the result of the spills only, or other oil operations?</p> <p>JF: No. The contamination is the result of many things. One is that for more than 35 years companies have been dumping their production waters into the rivers, directly, into tributaries, lakes, pools. Across the four rivers [Corrientes, Maranon, Pastaza, Tigre]. That stopped in 2009. In addition, there has also been contamination caused by the chemical waste in the oil installations. The other cause has been the spills. So there are many factors. And after 40 years things are the same. People are tired of it. The round-tables we\u2019ve held have come to nothing. We don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to do the clean-up. That\u2019s why now there\u2019s an indefinite protest. We\u2019re tired of discussing it with state functionaries who don\u2019t have the capacity to solve the problem. That\u2019s why we want the ministers to come - and the companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c11ee8be29bd7c9e3ef87145b6a5685c8d21d6a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c11ee8be29bd7c9e3ef87145b6a5685c8d21d6a0/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn at a protest on the River Tigre in the Peruvian Amazon in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn at a protest on the River Tigre in the Peruvian Amazon in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DH: Has anyone from the state or government turned up yet?</p> <p>JF: The regional governor [Fernando Melendez]. He agreed that he would transmit our message, our demands, to the national government. But he misunderstood. He didn\u2019t listen closely. As a result, they sent a commission [to Iquitos] - more functionaries - but the protesters won\u2019t speak with them. They want to speak to the ministers and the companies.</p> <p>DH: Who\u2019s on the commission [which has since been reported to have returned to Lima]?</p> <p>JF: A Vice-Minister from the Ministry of Culture, which, according to them, is the state institution responsible for this issue. We don\u2019t accept that. It isn\u2019t the state institution responsible. Another is a presidential advisor. We\u2019re fed up of talking to advisers. We continue insisting on wanting to talk to the ministers. </p> <p>DH: About the pipeline spills. . . Sometimes the government, state or Petroperu say they\u2019re caused by \u201ccuts\u201d - a type of sabotage. What would you say to that?</p> <p>JF: We\u2019ve responded to this before. It\u2019s not that it isn\u2019t impossible that sometimes there is sabotage. Sabotage is possible. But linking it to indigenous peoples is a real stretch. You go to an indigenous community and you\u2019ll see no one has the knowledge or technical capacity to do it. What we\u2019ve learnt is that these are overseen by the companies themselves to cover up their own responsibility. It\u2019s a strategy they\u2019re using.</p> <p>DH: Wait. You\u2019re saying sometimes there are cuts but that it\u2019s the company, or someone connected to the company, that\u2019s doing it?</p> <p>JF: There are interests in doing that. Strategically it suits their purposes to blame indigenous peoples and say the spills are caused by them. We have sources, who want to remain anonymous, and they know that this is effectively overseen by the company - and it suits them. You go to a community and you\u2019d see they have no equipment to do this kind of thing. Where would they get it? You can\u2019t use just any piece of equipment to sabotage a pipeline. </p> <p>DH: Sometimes the pipeline is underwater too.</p> <p>JF: Underwater. So how do you think an indigenous man is going to be able to cause a spill? It\u2019s impossible. We\u2019ve responded to this idea and we don\u2019t accept it - but it doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t happen. It could happen. Someone could do it, but it\u2019s not part of indigenous people\u2019s culture to do this sort of thing. </p> <p>DH: What are the impacts of the contamination? </p> <p>JF: The impacts are very visible. A week ago we went to [an installation in Lot 8] and nearby found dead fish. In a lake across which a Pluspetrol pipeline crosses. With Petroperu, it\u2019s exactly the same: the fish are dying where there are spills. And the impacts are worse when the rivers swell.</p> <p>DH: Who are the indigenous peoples participating in the protest? </p> <p>JF: There are the Achuar people, Urarina people, Cocamas, Kichwas. . . And the others are joining. . . We\u2019re in a country where there is no strict protection. What would happen today if indigenous peoples said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want oil operations in this area\u201d and they closed it down? It wouldn\u2019t take much for the state to send in the army or navy. That\u2019s the type of country we\u2019re living in.</p> <p>DH: Are there other things the protestors want? E.g. better services in their communities, health posts, schools, electricity, jobs?</p> <p>JF: Compensation from the state for use of indigenous territories, which would take the form of an investment plan for health, education and alternative projects. Other requests are that land is titled according to [the International Labour Organization\u2019s] Convention 169, that prior consultation is done for Lot 192, and that a truth commission is set up to investigate the impunity with which oil activities have taken place over the last four decades.</p> <p>DH: Last question. Obviously oil is very important for Loreto. Many people work in the industry. How do you see, therefore, the region\u2019s future? </p> <p>JF: Loreto\u2019s oil future, right now, is bleak because of the international context, although the national government\u2019s policy, for more than 30 years, has been oriented towards oil. But that is no longer Loreto\u2019s future. Loreto, strategically, has been made dependent on oil by past governments. As a result of activity declining, Loreto is now in total crisis because the economy depends on oil, and for indigenous peoples it\u2019s even worse because their territories have been impoverished and there have been serious environmental impacts. How can one talk about oil having a future when it has such a past? But to suddenly stop an extractive operation is very difficult - very difficult - because there are many poor people who depend on it for work. What\u2019s the future of oil? That\u2019s now the largest issue being discussed. Diversification of the economy, tourism, the forestry sector - but with very clear laws - environmental services, biodiversity, other alternative activities. . . There are many potential options to explore, but there hasn\u2019t been any interest in doing so because policy is designed from the top - and what the top wants for Loreto is to divide it up into oil concessions so the entire Amazon can be explored and exploited and companies continue operating and contaminating. That\u2019s the strategy for Loreto. For people in Lima, for the rest of the country, Loreto is just a place where you exploit oil. Nothing else. </p> <p>DH: Thank you, Jos\u00e9.</p> <p>JF: Thank you. </p> <p>Petroperu did not provide comment in response to Fach\u00edn\u2019s claims about pipeline sabotage.</p>",
