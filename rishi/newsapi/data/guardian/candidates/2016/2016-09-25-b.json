  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for police supporters in a key swing state, who was also a pilot for the Republican presidential campaign, has been fired from his job after the Guardian disclosed that he is charged with a violent crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">Donald Trump's police: officers backing Republican have murky legal histories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vincent Caldara, a retired police officer and chair of Trump\u2019s Florida law enforcement coalition, will no longer fly vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence to rallies across the US. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">He is accused of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon</a>.</p> <p>Caldara, 55, allegedly drove his car at a man repeatedly, knocking the man to the ground, causing him severe physical injuries and leaving him with more than $200,000 of medical bills. Caldara has pleaded not guilty.</p> <p>He is also accused of seriously injuring a woman by recklessly driving his Harley-Davidson motorcycle into her, in a separate incident. The woman has sued Caldara, but according to court filings, officials have been unable to locate him to serve him with legal papers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://easternairlines.aero/\">Eastern Air Lines</a>, the Miami-based company that supplies Pence\u2019s campaign plane and pilots, confirmed Caldara\u2019s departure.</p> <p>\u201cMr Caldara is no longer employed by Eastern Air Lines. We wish him well in his future endeavors,\u201d chief executive Ed Wegel said in an email. \u201cEastern has no further comment on this to respect everyone\u2019s privacy.\u201d</p> <p>After refusing for several days to answer questions about Caldara, the Trump campaign moved to distance itself from him. </p> <p>\u201cMr Caldara is not a paid employee of the Trump campaign nationally or in the state of Florida,\u201d said Marc Lotter, Pence\u2019s press secretary. </p> <p>Lotter and other campaign spokespeople repeatedly declined to say whether Caldara remained part of Trump\u2019s Florida law enforcement coalition. But references to his involvement, such as a video clip that showed him opening a Trump campaign office in the city of Cocoa Beach earlier this month, where he addressed supporters, have been removed from the Florida Trump campaign\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FloridaForTrump2016/\">Facebook page</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump and Governor Mike Pence are the law and order candidates,\u201d Caldara told supporters at the Cocoa Beach event. \u201cAnd if that is the direction you want our country to go in, then you know who you need to vote for on 8 November.\u201d</p> <p>Caldara did not respond to several emails seeking comment.</p> <p>Last Monday, Caldara stood directly behind Trump at a campaign rally in Fort Myers. As the Republican nominee praised law enforcement, Caldara took from his pocket what appeared to be a gold-colored law enforcement badge, and flashed it at the television cameras.</p> <p>Caldara worked as a police officer in New York and Miami but is no longer employed by a law enforcement agency.</p> <p>Police and court documents newly obtained by the Guardian provide more detail on Caldara\u2019s alleged battery of a business associate in July last year. The associate, Jeff Shanley, told police that Caldara struck him following a heated argument at their workplace.</p> <p>\u201cMr Shanley stated he stood in front of Mr Caldara\u2019s vehicle as he attempted to leave,\u201d according to the original police report. \u201cMr Shanley stated that Mr Caldara started that vehicle, then drove forward and bumped Mr Shanley.</p> <p>\u201cMr Shanley stated that he said to Mr Caldara, \u2018Come on, what are you doing?\u2019 Mr Caldara then drove forward again, thus striking Mr Shanley hard, knocking him to the ground. Mr Shanley got to his knees and was struck again by Mr Caldara\u2019s vehicle, knocking him down again.\u201d</p> <p>Shanley, who according to the police report was screaming, ended up under the front section of Caldara\u2019s dark blue 2002 Ford Crown Victoria. He was taken by emergency responders to North Broward medical center for treatment. A witness told police he called 911 after seeing Shanley struck by Caldara\u2019s vehicle for the final time.</p> <p>Shanley, now 53, underwent two surgeries following the alleged assault. He received a spinal stimulator and a fusion of his right hand, which he is now unable to bend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">Clinton camp says Trump in 'sewer' as debate looms and fight gets dirty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caldara also faced accusations of wrongdoing while serving as a police officer.

Caldara was said to have been driving in Queens while off duty.</p> <p>\u201cA passenger in the back of the cab screamed at me: \u2018Hey! You can\u2019t pull your gun on him!\u2019,\u201d the book quoted Caldara as saying. \u201cSo I pointed the gun in the backseat and said: \u2018Shut the fuck up.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>The passenger turned out to be a former member of Congress, according to the book, and filed a complaint that left Caldara facing possible termination. Having spent time on \u201cmodified assignment\u201d, however, he was reportedly reinstated after paying the bribe.</p> <p>Caldara did not respond to questions about the accuracy of the book. </p>",

A survey by the <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/09/25/trump-edges-clinton-ahead-first-debate/\">Morning Consult website</a> gave Trump an edge of one point.</p> <p>The debate on Long Island is predicted to draw an audience of 100 million, a record for a political event. National security will feature among the topics. Many are intrigued by the prospect of car-crash television and just how ugly things might turn. Online fact-checkers and a vast following on Twitter are likely to play a major role in real time in shaping the narrative of victory and defeat.</p> <p>On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, host Chuck Todd wondered if the aim of inviting Cuban, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/mark-cuban-donald-trump-wealth\">who has questioned Trump\u2019s financial worth</a>, was to get under Trump\u2019s skin. </p> <p>Podesta replied: \u201cNo, I think Mark Cuban is one of the business leaders who was never involved in partisan politics who\u2019s endorsed Hillary because he thinks she\u2019ll do better for the economy.

You know I\u2019m in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, his allies sought to defuse the issue. Vice-presidential candidate Pence told Fox News Sunday: \u201cGennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night. Donald was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from where the American people are going to be focused tomorrow night, which is on the issues, it\u2019s on the choice that we face.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/donald-trump-gennifer-flowers-debate-hillary-clinton\">told CNN\u2019s State of the Union</a> she could not confirm that Flowers would attend. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how easily baited the Clinton campaign was,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically, Mr Trump was saying, \u2018Look, if Mark Cuban is going to send out these texts that say \u2018<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/779125122628136962\">the humbling at Hofstra</a>\u2019 and this is his big downfall, then Mr Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that may get into the head of Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cBut we have not invited her formally and we don\u2019t expect her to be there as a guest of the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>One of the debate\u2019s numerous subplots will be the question of whether Trump might be provoked into lashing out, perhaps by confronting Clinton with her husband\u2019s past infidelities in a bid to humiliate her. It would be a risky move for the tycoon, himself thrice married.</p> <p>Conway said: \u201cHe has a right to defend himself against anything that Secretary Clinton may say in response. There\u2019s no plan to do that. I\u2019m not going to reveal what we have been doing in our debate conversations.

Answer the questions that the American people have. They deserve and expect these candidates to be talking about the issues.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign manger, Robby Mook, told the same show: \u201cNobody knows which Donald Trump is going to show up to this debate. And, in fact, his erratic temperament has been a subject of quite a bit of discussion \u2026 and I would argue it\u2019s why he\u2019s not fit and prepared to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Coming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/us-presidential-debates-famous-moments\">56 years to the day</a> after the first presidential debate, between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, Monday\u2019s battle appears set to be the most unpredictable and potentially the most brutal ever held. Clinton is a seasoned politician who has been preparing with mock debates reportedly featuring her aide Philippe Reines in the role of her opponent. Trump is a brash businessman and TV showman who hurled insults at his opponents during the Republican primaries.</p> <p>On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, Paul Ryan, the House speaker who, as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, debated Joe Biden in 2012, advised Trump: \u201cOver-prepare. Look, Hillary Clinton\u2019s been doing this most of her life. She is the consummate pro. This is new for Donald. So I think he should obviously over-prepare for it. </p> <p>\u201cAnd the thing I believe, obviously I prepared for these myself. You have to offer the country a vision, go on offence, prosecute your case, hold your opponent accountable. But then \u2026 show the country the direction you want to go and \u2026 prepare, prepare, prepare. And I hope he\u2019s doing that.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday morning, Trump met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump Tower in New York City. Netanyahu was due to meet Clinton later. </p> <p>A Trump campaign statement said: \u201cMr Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the state of Israel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e95d50a7bff4c1ae8815afd30bb1b407810e275f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e95d50a7bff4c1ae8815afd30bb1b407810e275f/0_0_2277_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carter Page\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carter Page, whom Donald Trump has named as a foreign policy adviser, speaks at the World Trade Center in Moscow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Serebryakov/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump could face difficult questions from Clinton, and indeed debate moderator Lester Holt, over his business ties to Russia and repeated praise for its president, Vladimir Putin.

Somewhere in this interval Scott is shot.</p> <p>Before the release of the footage, police chief Kerr Putney told reporters it supported his department\u2019s version of events, and that other evidence shows Scott was in possession of a handgun at the time of his shooting.</p> <p>\u201cPeople can interpret anything they want based on one piece of evidence,\u201d Putney said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re giving out is the most complete puzzle we can without trying the case in public.

A Democrat, Sokolich described how Christie aides at first tried to curry his endorsement with gifts, including trips up the new, partially constructed World Trade Center, a flag that had flown over Ground Zero and lengthy lunches at the governor\u2019s mansion in Trenton. </p> <p>Documents later shown to the court appeared to confirm his account, showing that favors to Sokolich included Port Authority money for shuttle buses in the town, steel from the destroyed World Trade Center given to the town as a gift by the Port Authority, as well as the two tours.</p> <p>But when Sokolich indicated that he would not endorse the Republican governor, the mood abruptly changed. </p> <p>It was then, the court heard, that Bridget Kelly sent her now notorious email: \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d </p> <p>Three consecutive days of lane closures to the entrance of the bridge reduced traffic in Fort Lee to a state of \u201ctotal gridlock\u201d.<br></p> <p>Sokolich testified that he\u2019d tried to reach Christie aides, including Baroni, but was stonewalled. By the third day of disruption, Sokolich testified, he was forced to conclude \u201cthe only plausible reason\u201d for the closures \u201cis someone is mad at me\u201d.</p> <p> Prosecutors have argued that Baroni and Wildstein gloated to Christie about purposely ignoring the desperate calls from Sokolich, saying that shutting the lanes meant a \u201cpublic safety emergency\u201d.</p> <p>Christie, who was reportedly hoping to use his 2013 re-election as a springboard for a White House run, has repeatedly denied knowledge of the bridge-closing plan. His aides, including Baroni, portrayed the closures as part of traffic study. </p> <p>Though he was not charged in the case, Christie\u2019s reputation was tarnished, and it may have been a factor inTrump\u2019s decision not to select the governor as his running mate. Trump himself said during the primaries, while he and Christie were rivals, that he <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/trump_unloads_on_christie_he_knew_about_bridgegate_and_much_more.html\">believed the governor had been fully aware</a> of the \u201cBridgegate\u201d plan. </p> <p>\u201cThe evidence may show that others could have, should have, perhaps known certain aspects of what was going on in Fort Lee,\u201d prosecutor Vikas Khanna told the jury. \u201cPerhaps you will even wonder what happened to those people.\u201d</p> <p>The trial is to resume this week.</p>",
  "<p>On a hot day in late August, <a href=\"http://www.linmanuel.com\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> sits in a lecture theatre at Columbia University in uptown Manhattan, fizzing with the kind of energy that only comes, one imagines, from the experience of creating a billion-dollar Broadway show. Two weeks earlier, Miranda took his last bow before leaving the cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/18/hamilton-review-founding-father-gets-a-hip-hop-makeover\">Hamilton</a>, the rap musical he wrote and starred in and for which the word <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/how-did-hamilton-become-broadway-breakout-hit\">\u201chit\u201d seems, at this point, inadequate</a>.</p> <p>Since its opening last year, not only has Hamilton sold $1bn worth of tickets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/hamilton-pulizer-prize-drama-lin-manuel-miranda\">won a Pulitzer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/13/tony-awards-2016-winners-hamilton-the-humans-broadway\">11 Tonys</a> and become the most successful Broadway opening of all time, but Miranda has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/03/hamilton-tony-awards-broadway-lin-manuel-miranda\">credited with everything</a> from reinventing musical theatre to revolutionising the way Americans think about their own history. He has rapped with Barack Obama in the Rose Garden, been quoted by Hillary Clinton in her speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president, and seen his beard and ponytail combo become almost iconic. Such is the pitch of his fame that it is hard, today, not to encounter the 36-year-old, who is slight and boyish and unexpectedly clean shaven, and not simply burst into laughter. What does one do after a year like Miranda\u2019s, I ask. He grins widely. \u201cYou cut your hair off,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The success of Hamilton, which tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, <a href=\"http://www.constitutionday.com/hamilton-alexander-ny.html\">one of America\u2019s lesser-known founding fathers</a>, from the American revolution to the drafting of the constitution, is down in large part to a brilliant cast, made up almost entirely of African-American and Hispanic performers, and told exclusively in rap. In that one act, Miranda simultaneously upended expectations of American history, made a point about inclusion, and also found the perfect idiom for the story at hand; after watching Hamilton, you find yourself wondering how the tale of a scrappy, post-revolutionary nation being born could ever have been told in a medium other than hip-hop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e5cb0846a904fe8124908725e64bbf440bc0e18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5cb0846a904fe8124908725e64bbf440bc0e18/0_110_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lin-Manuel Miranda, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda \u2013 minus the pony-tail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Tony Awards Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is rare for a Broadway show to cross over and become cool with other genres of musician; at its height, even a hit such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/26/the-producers-musicals-we-love-nathan-lane-mel-brooks\">The Producers</a> had a limited appeal. On any given night at Hamilton, however, so many celebrities were present that Miranda and the cast would joke that \u201cthe internet came to see the show tonight\u201d. A single example: \u201cBusta Rhymes coming on the same night as Mandy Patinkin and Salman Rushdie. It was the dream dinner party every night.\u201d (Or, almost every night; there was the one at which Dick Cheney sat chuckling away in the front row.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/16/spamilton-hamilton-parody-triad-new-york-lin-manuel-miranda\">Spamilton: Hamilton parody is a supplement, not a substitute</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the day I saw the show, mounted police patrolled the street, the queue stretched around the block and ticket holders looked with pity across the way at the poor sods queuing up for Finding Neverland. Compared with the drama outside, the show itself was, almost inevitably, anticlimactic; original, funny, shocking, but still, you know, a Broadway show, rather than the announcement of the second coming.</p> <p>It was, nonetheless, breathtaking, a combination of dazzling verbosity and polysyllabic brilliance, combined with the deep joy and bathos of rapping about dull subjects such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers\">the Federalist Papers</a> with the fever of a rap battle: \u201cThomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President / Reticent \u2013 there isn\u2019t a plan he doesn\u2019t jettison / Madison, you\u2019re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine / Damn, you\u2019re in worse shape than the national debt is in.\u201d And so on. You get the idea.</p> <p>As a result of the subject matter, Miranda\u2019s first expectation for the show was simply that it would be popular with teachers. After its New York run, he envisaged it living on as a worthy staple of community theatre. \u201cI thought, if they can get over our use of the F-word, this will be a good school group show.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deApjIhhhC4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/deApjIhhhC4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a video of scenes from Hamilton, starring Lin-Manuel Miranda</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is only his second Broadway show \u2013 the first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/14/in-the-heights-review-utterly-huggable-musical-lights-up-london\">In the Heights</a>, has just been <a href=\"https://www.intheheightslondon.com/\">extended in London</a> \u2013 and Miranda is still reminded daily of the fact that, 10 years ago, he was a supply teacher. In spite of the fact that his estimated royalties from the show total a mind-boggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/hamilton-musical-creator-lin-manuel-miranda-royalties\">$105,000 a week</a>, he still flies commercial \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t care about private jets\u201d \u2013 and lives a stone\u2019s throw from his old neighbourhood in Upper Manhattan; the reason we meet at Columbia is that it is around the corner from the apartment Miranda shares with his wife Vanessa and their 18-month-old son Sebastian, who was born two weeks before rehearsals for Hamilton started. (It strikes me that, were Miranda a woman, much more would have been made of this timing \u2013 the difficulty of having to be on stage every night with an infant at home. As it is, he says, it all worked out fine because, in spite of being \u201ca very sleepless two years, my wife is a superhero. That\u2019s the answer.\u201d)</p> <p>Clearly, Miranda works hard to keep himself grounded and surviving the experience has, he says, been a question of \u201cstaying on top of the emotions\u201d. Nonetheless, so feverish has the acclaim for Hamilton been, I wonder if, as the frenzy around it grew, he ever thought; \u201cGod, what have I done?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/01/lin-manuel-miranda-ancestry-hamilton-mexico-texas\">Lin-Manuel Miranda's ancestry is as multifaceted as Hamilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He shout-laughs. \u201cWhat have I done?! I have to give enormous credit to [the director] Tommy Kail, who\u2019s great at keeping the temperature low inside the theatre, especially when we moved to Broadway and the yell became a roar. That never came into the studio where we were working.\u201d Instead, he says, they carried on with business as usual, telling themselves: \u201cWe\u2019re making our thing better and still have 10 things a day to fix.\u201d</p> <p>One of the current questions surrounding Hamilton, as preparations are made for it to be rolled out, Phantom of the Opera-style, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/10/hamilton-the-musical-transfer-west-end-london-lin-manuel-miranda-broadway-tonies\">across the world</a>, is how hard it will be for foreign audiences to love a show that rests, in large part, on knowledge of, and interest in, the American origin story. The life of Alexander Hamilton is a great tale, but the show\u2019s real resonance comes from its interrogation of the American national character.</p> <p>\u201cI think that if we\u2019ve done our job well and we articulate this individual\u2019s life well, the themes inherent in that translate,\u201d says Miranda. \u201cIt\u2019s about legacy, about how much do we do with the time we\u2019re given? And then there are themes that wrestle with the American character, but only in that Hamilton\u2019s life is a rough-draft version of the arguments we still have as a country.\u201d These too, he hopes, will travel. He tells the story of what happened when Fiddler on the Roof made its Japanese debut, after which a theatre-goer approached the producers and said: \u201cThey like it in America? But it\u2019s so Japanese!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e2ac9dd2ecd7a446e0fd3b7f70bc71db2b54908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2ac9dd2ecd7a446e0fd3b7f70bc71db2b54908/0_185_1733_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miranda and other cast members of Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda and other cast members of Hamilton at the Public Theater, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miranda sees the arguments started by the founding fathers as analogous to his fights with his sister. \u201cThe arguments a country has are its family arguments. I fight with my sister and it\u2019s a version of the fight we had when she was 16 and I was 10. I think that\u2019s true of both countries and families. We\u2019ll always argue about the size of government in our lives and the role we play in the affairs of other countries.\u201d</p> <p>That these dry-sounding debates should animate such an electric show is, of course, a reflection of the scale of Miranda\u2019s talent and his success in answering the challenge set up in the opening line, rapped by Aaron Burr, nemesis to Hamilton and foil to his character: \u201cHow does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore / And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot / In the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor / Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?\u201d</p> <p>Miranda says: \u201cI think I threw the ball very high in the air with the opening line of the show. This big-ass run-on sentence, and we are going to purport to try to answer it. How does he get from here, to here?\u201d In the first version of Hamilton, which was written for the Public Theater, off-Broadway, Miranda combined song and speech in a much more conventional-looking show. It didn\u2019t work, \u201cbecause the songs \u2013 especially our opening number \u2013 is really heightened speech, with melody in it. So when we went to regular speech, you could feel the audience pull out.\u201d At some point, Miranda realised he was going to have to dispense with a script and simply \u201cmusicalise every second\u201d of the show, a huge undertaking and one that saw him wandering around his neighbourhood muttering to himself every day, as he tried to fit lyrics to music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6274d39ed1039c4304cde3c0025df684db81db64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6274d39ed1039c4304cde3c0025df684db81db64/0_396_4228_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The London cast of In The Heights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The London cast of In the Heights, Miranda\u2019s first foray on to the Broadway stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had never wanted to be a solo rap star, he says. \u201cMy ego is healthy, but it doesn\u2019t extend in that direction.\u201d Instead, from school age onwards, he had only ever wanted to be involved in the theatre. His parents had moved to New York from Puerto Rico before Miranda was born and landed in Upper Manhattan, where his mother was a psychologist and his father a political adviser to, among others, former New York mayor Ed Koch.</p> <p>Miranda grew up in a household rich in intellect but not particularly wealthy and he was aware, at college, that sacrifices were being made in order to educate him. As a result, he was highly motivated and started writing In the Heights, a show about his Washington Heights neighbourhood, before he graduated, slogging away at it for the next six years while working as a supply teacher to pay the rent, until, in what he still regards as a miracle, it came to Broadway. Overnight, \u201cI went from being a professional substitute teacher to a Broadway composer.\u201d It was, he says, an even more \u201cdrastic life change\u201d than the one brought about by the success of Hamilton.</p> <p>In the Heights was a hit, winning four Tony awards, but the one disappointment was that it didn\u2019t bring Miranda the interest or admiration of his heroes in the rap community. As an adolescent, did the part of him that loved hip-hop disparage the part that loved Broadway musicals? No, he says. \u201cThere are a few people who only like hip-hop music, and a few who only like theatre music, and the rest of us just like good shit. It doesn\u2019t matter what form it comes in. I think we\u2019re all a lot more eclectic than we give ourselves credit for. And I feel lucky to have grown up in the era when we made mix cassettes. I think it affected how I write scores. Because when you\u2019re making a mix tape for your friends, it\u2019s 90 minutes of music, in the order in which you curate it, so you\u2019re creating the ebb and flow. That prepared me to write scores more than anything else. You want to surprise them, tell them how you feel about them, you want to express the wealth of your taste. How is that different from writing a Broadway score?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/16/hamilton-broadway-film-lin-manuel-miranda-original-cast\">Hamilton's original Broadway cast to be filmed before Lin-Manuel Miranda exits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Can he remember any of his mix tapes from that era? \u201cYes. I still think of the mix tape my friend Antonia made me that had both Sam Cooke\u2019s Bring it On Home to Me and D\u2019yer Mak\u2019er from Led Zeppelin, which were the first two songs on side B. When I grew up, one of my favourite artists was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/30/weird-al-yankovic-interview\">Weird Al</a>, who taught me that genre is just the clothes of the artist. Instrumentation can change, but we\u2019re all dealing with the same 12 tones and a good melody is a good melody.\u201d</p> <p>For Miranda, one of the most gratifying aspects of Hamilton\u2019s success has, therefore, been the fact that every high-profile rapper in the US has dropped backstage to tell him how much they love the show. \u201cWhat hip-hop artists pick up on that your average theatre-goer doesn\u2019t is that I\u2019m using different flows for every character, the way a classical composer would use a different theme in, say, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfM7Y9Pcdzw\">Peter and the Wolf</a>. Everyone raps in a way that is consistent with their character and I\u2019m modelling that after my favourite hip-hop artists. Hercules Mulligan is Busta Rhymes in my brain, and Hamilton is from the school of Eminem and Big Pun, where it\u2019s how many syllables can I rhyme within a line, versus [George] Washington, which is much more straightforward and on the down beat. Because that\u2019s who Washington is. Very regimented and a moral authority. To hear what Eminem, Andr\u00e9 3000, or Chris Rock caught that I embedded in there \u2013 that is really fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc87ff3ec81ba0da802744ee50f32d1a4c339f6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc87ff3ec81ba0da802744ee50f32d1a4c339f6a/0_52_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamilton cast at Tony awards June 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Song and dance man: an extract from Hamilton being performed at the Tony awards in June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This, the period after his exit from the show, could have been an anticlimax for Miranda but, for now, he says, he is happy finishing up some back-burner projects \u2013 the score for the Disney animated movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKFuXETZUsI\">Moana</a> and the filming of a <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/disney-announces-release-date-for-mary-poppins-sequel-1201785893/\">Mary Poppins sequel</a> opposite Emily Blunt. And while success this large gets you out of lots of things \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t have to write a jingle to pay rent; I don\u2019t have to do a corporate gig. That part of it is very freeing\u201d \u2013 at the same time, \u201cit doesn\u2019t get you out of life. I still picked up my dog\u2019s poop this morning and changed three diapers. I\u2019m still ignoring a call from my dad because he wants me to do something I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Meanwhile, his wife, who Miranda met when they were both at high school and is now a corporate attorney, finally gets some help from him in the evenings.</p> <p>Miranda has no idea what his next show will be, only that the one fruitful way to find out is to maintain the right priorities. \u201cI work in a world in which only one in five shows returns their investment. Failure is the norm. So you have to walk away from the years that you spent on something, thinking: \u2018I did it for these reasons and I got that.\u2019 Financial success cannot be your goal. But if your goal is, \u2018I want to tell this story\u2019, or \u2018I want to learn from working with these people\u2019, then things have a good chance of working out.\u201d</p> <p>It is also a question of understanding one\u2019s own motivation, he says. \u201cI think when you\u2019re making something, you\u2019re trying to fall in love with it; to express the best version of that idea. I think, naturally my subconscious tries to create the high I first felt when I was in Pirates of Penzance in the eighth grade.\u201d</p> <p>This was, he swears, all he was doing with Hamilton, staging it with no expectations, just to \u201csee how the world responds\u201d. Miranda smiles widely. \u201cAnd the world freaked out.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>America has seldom been so divided going into a general election. And that division is showing up even in the housing markets of states that traditionally vote Democratic and those that vote Republican.<br></p> <p>A new report issued by a real estate data company, HouseCanary, and given exclusively to the Guardian found that over the last four decades, housing prices have risen significantly higher in blue (Democratic-leaning) states than in red (Republican-leaning) states. </p> <p>Since 1984, blue states have seen their house values go up from an average of $85,000 to $312,000, while red states saw an increase from $75,000 to $184,000. Blue states now account for 77% of the total value of homes in United States.</p> <p>Higher housing prices in the liberal-leaning blue states might have a twofold effect on voters\u2019 outlooks: while homeowners feel the benefits of the economic recovery, those who do not own homes are grappling with the effects of income inequality as house prices increase \u2013 often out of their reach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/red-blue-state-home-value-year/\" data-alt=\"Average home value in blue and red states\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/red-blue-state-home-value-year/\">Average home value in blue and red states</a> </figure>  <p>The prices also show a profound shift in wealth in the US.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at 20 to 30 years ago, Republican red states had higher net worth than Democrats in blue states. And now what you are seeing is this sea change happening where there is this growing divide in our country,\u201d said Jeremy Sicklick, co-founder and chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.housecanary.com/about\">HouseCanary</a>. \u201cThis helps illustrate some of the appeal that probably Donald Trump has had in some of these red states, where there have been these factory closures and exodus from these once proud industrial centers in the north.\u201d</p> <p>As this trend played out, those people who had resources to move to places with more jobs did so, contributing to this growing inequality, explained Sicklick. </p> <p>The divide between blue states and red states is likely to continue growing. According to HouseCanary, over the next three years, house values in all states are likely to grow between 10% to 12% \u2013 but those increases will look significantly different in blue states and in red states.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point, the average home in a blue state is [worth] almost double [the price] in a red state, and because of that, you are going to see this continued divide. Over the next three years, we expect the average homeowner in blue states to grow their value by $39,000 to $40,000 \u2013 versus in red states, [where] the average homeowner will grow their value by $20,000,\u201d said Sicklick. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/real-estate-square-map/\" data-alt=\"house value by political leaning blue state red state\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/real-estate-square-map/\">house value by political leaning blue state red state</a> </figure>  <p>To determine which states were blue states and which were red states, HouseCanary relied on elections and the statistical analysis website <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>\u2019s projections for the 2016 presidential elections. The projections used were released on 16 August. According to Sicklick, even if some of the swing states were to end up voting Republican instead of Democratic as predicted in the projections, the analysis would still hold up. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any swing state changes \u2013 whether they are Ohio or Iowa or other swing states \u2013 would have a material impact on the overall findings,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/01/average-manhattan-apartment-costs-hits-record\">Average Manhattan apartment costs $2m, and developers are to blame</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After all, not all blue states are equally expensive.

  "<p>This election season is enough to drive a normal voter \u2013 by which I mean anyone in search of substantive debate on real issues \u2013 to the brink of insanity. And the losers are us. <br></p> <p>With the very real possibility that we are heading towards another financial crisis, all we are discussing is whether Hillary Clinton had a body double after the her fainting episode. Or the latest outrage from Donald Trump, or his kids. It\u2019s idiocy ad nauseam. </p> <p> With the two main candidates finally set to meet face-to-face for the first televised debate tomorrow, you\u2019d be forgiven for hoping that might be finally about to change. I wish I shared that confidence. </p> <p> I do believe that both Clinton and Trump will engage in a free-for-all in an effort to show just how tough they\u2019ll be when it comes to homeland security. That\u2019s probably inevitable, given that the debate will take place only about 10 days after a bomb exploded in a dumpster on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, injuring 29 people.</p> <p> Clearly, it\u2019s important for the two candidates to spell out their views on national security issues. Hopefully this can be accomplished with a minimum of melodrama and a maximum of substantive dialogue.</p> <p> What worries me is that there\u2019s one aspect of national security that no one has mentioned, that no one will mention, and that neither of the two major candidates is even thinking about.</p> <p>What am I talking about? The risk that we could be heading for another financial crisis \u2013 one that might make the events of 2008 look like a walk in the park. And that kind of event \u2013 the prospect that the banking system will collapse, leaving us without access to our savings, and with no way to pay our bills or collect our paychecks \u2013 is just as much of a threat as the more conventional perils that spring to mind when I use the phrase \u201cnational security\u201d.</p> <p> Let\u2019s be clear: statistically it\u2019s much more likely that the next president will have to deal with a massive financial crisis than it is that she or he will have to contend with a terrorist attack of the magnitude of 9/11. It not a certainty, but it is a possibility given our never-ending cycles of boom and bust. And neither has even mentioned how they\u2019d prevent, or respond to, to such an event.</p> <p> The problem with trying to evaluate the probability of a financial crisis is that all the risk-management tools we use inevitably rely on what happened in the past. Inevitably, the next crisis comes from something we hadn\u2019t imagined could or would become a problem, or hadn\u2019t been watching. After the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, regulators knew they needed to worry about \u201ccontagion\u201d, or the way that the financial links between banks and other financial counter-parties, could spread problems, like a virus, throughout the system. But they were looking at hedge funds, not mortgage lending. </p> <p> Someone needs to ask Trump and Clinton who their top candidates for treasury secretary are \u2013 and what kind of instructions they would give that individual in terms of monitoring the financial markets and guarding against catastrophic outcomes. </p> <p>Well-informed candidates could deliver revelatory responses. Someone representing a traditional Republican view, for instance, might echo the view that private equity tycoon Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group put forth in a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-next-financial-crisis-will-happen-1433891718\">Wall Street Journal opinion piece last year</a>, and argue that new rules passed following the 2008 crisis might create another liquidity crunch, cutting off access to capital just when it\u2019s needed most. </p> <p>Someone from the other side of the aisle would focus on the fact that the shadow banking system has exploded in size since the 2008 crisis. The private funds that form part of this universe <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/unregulated-shadow-banks-are-a-ticking-time-bomb-1079892-1.html\">now handle about 60% of all trading</a> in the US Treasury securities market \u2013 found in virtually every major investment portfolio \u2013 using high-speed trading based on algorithmic models. </p> <p>This does assume that we end up with an informed candidate, of course, and not just someone who blusters that because he is rich, we should trust him with the nation\u2019s finances. (Forget about that unpleasant matter of the multiple corporate bankruptcies \u2026) Or someone who does seem to be well-informed, but who may still be getting a lot of her information on the subject from one powerful constituency. (Yeah, I\u2019d still like to see those speeches, even if I can pretty much guess what\u2019s in them.)</p> <p>An informed moderator would asked an informed candidate during tomorrow\u2019s debate what kinds of risks have been created in the name of trying to jumpstart the economy by keeping interest-rates at rock-bottom levels? </p> <p>At best, the result has been a surge in the issuance of junk bonds \u2013 speculative investments offering above-average bond yields \u2013 because investors have become desperate enough to take those risks. In some areas \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-17/energy-junk-bond-revival-cut-short-as-7-billion-lost-in-10-days\">particularly energy</a> \u2013 they have discovered the perils of that approach, sometimes losing billions in days when crude oil prices slumped. But what will happen when interest rates make all of these bonds look like bad investments?</p> <p>At worst? Well, that\u2019s a trickier matter altogether. The Federal Reserve now has an astonishing $4.5tn on its balance sheet, compared to only about $1tn at the onset of the financial crisis. The difference? That\u2019s all the assets it bought from the banks to stabilize the banks and keep interest rates low. Now, how does it reduce that bloated balance sheet without freaking markets out? <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/520377e8-037e-11e5-b55e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4L6i9gz1k\">No one really knows</a>, because no one has ever done it before. That\u2019s another factor that could end up causing or worsening a crisis, because it means the Fed\u2019s hands would be tied behind its back in the midst of another crisis. So \u2013 how would the next president cope in such an eventuality? </p> <p>Both presidents have said they want to reinstate Glass-Steagall financial regulations and break up the big banks. Setting aside the merits of that policy, how would the deal with the instability that would accompany its implementation?</p> <p>While we\u2019re on the subject \u2026 Since most banks today would fail a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-03-19/most-big-banks-would-fail-a-real-stress-test\">real stress test</a>, do the candidates know what one incorporating realistic scenarios would look like? In other words, can they do more than utter the words, \u201cI\u2019d get tough on big banks and make sure they wouldn\u2019t take foolish risks with your money again\u201d?</p> <p>All of this matters even in the best of all possible worlds. And when it comes to financial markets, we aren\u2019t living in the best of all possible worlds. Stocks and bonds alike are priced for perfection, and when that\u2019s the case, the slightest hiccup \u2013 like comments made by Federal Reserve officials early this month \u2013 can <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/09/us-markets.html\">ignite a big selloff</a>. And there are many, many things that could send markets into a tailspin, and generate a massive loss of confidence. </p> <p>Including, it\u2019s worth noting, whether or not the country\u2019s next commander-in-chief seems to have a grasp of how financial markets work, and how to manage that part of his or her national security responsibility. </p> <p>I\u2019m hoping financial security will make it into Monday\u2019s debate. But given this election cycle I\u2019m not holding my breath.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s detractors have struggled to define him as long as he\u2019s been on the political scene. But in 2015 it was the famously tongue-tied Rick Perry who landed upon what seemed like the most accurate descriptor to date: he called Trump \u201ca cancer\u201d.<br><br>He was speaking in reference to conservatism and, rather amazingly, would later go on to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/perry-tries-to-live-down-trump-cancer-comment.html\">support Trump</a>; he was also on to something. We know how cancer cells evade the body\u2019s natural response by basically disarming the immune system \u2013 turning it off or otherwise poisoning it.</p> <p>But the way this election is shaping up, the better analogy might be an autoimmune disease. Such illnesses result from our body\u2019s natural defenses being marshalled against it with destructive results. Trump is exploiting our political immune system to the detriment and potentially grave peril of the republic. He\u2019s taken what actually makes America great, the systems of government designed to foster public good \u2013 the courts, the press, our charity and financial systems \u2013 and used them for personal gain at the body politic\u2019s expense.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to look far to find examples of Trump using the protective mechanisms of society to undermine it \u2013 and perhaps the most conspicuous example of it is the courts.</p> <p>They were designed as the legal instrument of justice: to prevent victimization; to accuse and punish evildoers; to protect wildlife and the environment from the tragedy of the commons. But Trump has perverted the system, hiring seasoned lawyers to bully his way to desired verdicts. (His $10m lawsuit against a Miss USA hopeful who wrote a Facebook post he disliked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">was just one</a> of an estimated 3,500 lawsuits involving Trump, according to a USA Today <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/\">tally</a>.)</p> <p>Recently he sought to impugn the authority of a judge ruling on the Trump University case, saying his Mexican heritage and involvement with a Latino lawyers\u2019 association posed \u201can absolute conflict\u201d.</p> <p>The courts aren\u2019t the only protective lever of government Trump may have attempted to exploit in order to shield himself \u2013 Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, received <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">$25,000 from a Trump charity</a> before her office decided not to move forward with a review of his university.</p> <p>Like so many aspects of American democracy, charities \u2013 and specifically the tax-protected nature of donations from them \u2013 are meant to encourage us to take care of the country\u2019s vulnerable and protect people from the worst possible outcomes. And the Bondi donation is far from the only time Trump may have perverted his charities\u2019 use. A Washington Post investigation revealed that monies from the Trump Foundation have been used to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/trump-foundation-charity-settle-legal-disputes-reporting\">settle legal disputes</a>. </p> <p>Trump has also found ways to subvert the financial system, and specifically its bankruptcy laws, for personal gain. The leniencies in bankruptcy law are meant to save people on hard times from complete financial destruction \u2013 allowing them to start over again. But for Trump they\u2019re <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/\">a modus operandi of sorts</a>. After four corporate bankruptcy filings, he was still a multi-billionaire.</p> <p>Then there are the ways he\u2019s used the press to his own ends. With its mission of truth-telling, journalism aims to protects society against illegal or otherwise destructive behavior by exposing it. But Trump, who parlayed the notoriety from his television persona on The Apprentice into a national political platform, exploits its weaknesses.</p> <p>His steady stream of lies is difficult to fact-check in real time, an advantage to him in debates and other events with live coverage. Moreover, he\u2019s worked to actively undermine people\u2019s trust in the press, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/donald-trump-vows-to-open-up-libel-laws-to-make-suing-the-media-easier-heres-how-he-could-do-it/\">vowing to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws</a> so reporters can be sued more easily.</p> <p>What keeps a democracy on course is believing its protective checks and balances \u2013 its immune system built up over years of evolution \u2013 will work to protect the whole. We need to believe the court systems strive for justice; that the government will represent the interests of the people and won\u2019t be bought; that the press can speak truth freely.</p> <p>Even if he loses in November, Trump will still continue to undermine trust in democracy \u2013 inciting the rage of his sometimes violent supporters with claims the election process is \u201crigged\u201d. It\u2019s a specter he and his have long floated; confidante Roger Stone predicts the ensuing chaos will be a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/roger-stone-says-there-will-be-a-bloodbath-if-election-is-stolen-from-trump/\">bloodbath</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Such a thing, should it occur, would be a violation of what is perhaps the most basic tenet of democracy: that we vote to see what society agrees on, and once it\u2019s been determined, we uphold it whether or not we agree.<br></p> <p>Trump seems to have little interest in any such civic-mindedness.

He thought Clinton needed to achieve a margin of 375,000 to 400,000 in the fifth-largest city in the country.</p> <p>The suburbs were the prize, he said, adding that he was confident Clinton would do well there. Romney, Rendell said, \u201cwas a very good suburban Republican candidate. He looked the part, was somewhat moderate and had been governor of Massachusetts.\u201d The result was that Obama carried those four counties by \u201conly\u201d 120,000 votes. Rendell thought it was possible Clinton, against the more extreme Trump, could double such margins. </p> <p>Brabender, in contrast, thought Trump was making strides in the suburbs. The Republican nominee was doing two things right, he said. First, he was striking \u201cmore of a scripted tone, more presidential and certainly something that\u2019s more in line with what they would expect to see out of a president.\u201d Second, by emphasizing issues such as childcare, he was clearly trying to talk to suburban voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">Hillary Clinton's plan to stop Isis: hunt down leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always argued that Trump wasn\u2019t getting enough votes for people who didn\u2019t want to vote for Clinton.\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, for the first time, they are starting to look at him as a viable alternative.\u201d</p> <p>As Madonna noted, however, \u201cTrump is still losing the four suburban Philadelphia counties.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got to win a higher percentage of college-educated voters that really predominate in the Philly suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are places where the economy is much more diversified.\u201d</p> <p>In particular, Madonna said, the Republican nominee has a problem with women. \u201cIn my poll and every poll, and national polls, he\u2019s not doing well with women,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s losing women double digits in my state. And he\u2019s losing women by double digits in the Philly suburbs.\u201d</p> <p>In Pennsylvania, Trump faces a major challenge. The Real Clear Politics polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">has him down by almost seven points</a>. However, it may still be a state that is worth the effort. </p> <p>If Trump wins Pennsylvania, he will severely limit Clinton\u2019s path to 270 electoral votes. The question is whether, in a state that always requires \u201ca strange coalition\u201d for Republicans to win it, Trump can find a formula for success. It has already been a strange political year.</p>",

The Guerrero-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Revolutionary_Army\">Popular Revolutionary Army</a>, however, staged attacks on oil facilities as recently as 2007 and has since been blamed for kidnappings and violent demonstrations.</p> <p>The longest-enduring groups, however, are in Peru, Paraguay and Colombia \u2013 all countries that are not coincidentally centres of drug production and smuggling, which is a source of funds and guns.<br></p> <p>Last month, the small Paraguayan People\u2019s Army carried out an attack that killed eight soldiers. But it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/paraguay-guerrillas-epp-aca\">lost several of its leaders in recent years and is thought to have only between 20 and 150 members</a>, which makes it more of a local gang than a national threat. The same might be said for Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in Peru. Once a formidable force, it was blamed for more than 30,000 killings between 1980 and 2000.

In 2012, the weakened rebels agreed to begin negotiating a peace deal. At the time, leftist governments were in power across the region, giving the Farc confidence that since they were unable to take power via their armed struggle, they might achieve it through the ballot box. <br></p> <p>Before his death, former Venezuela president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 a former army officer who attempted a failed coup before securing power in an election \u2013 declared <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/armed-revolution-in-latin-america-is-over-says-chavez-843553.html\">armed guerrilla movements to be \u201cout of place</a>\u201d, a conclusion reached many years ago by his allies in Cuba, Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro. They have been key backers of the Colombian peace process and fittingly hosted the negotiations that led to the end of an era that also began in Cuba.</p> <p>Malcolm Deas, of the Latin American Centre at Oxford University, said the Farc is the last of the major guerrilla insurgencies inspired by Castro and Che Guevara, but argues that the significance of the deal should not be overstated, partly because the smaller ELN is still active, but also because the armed struggle in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America never genuinely threatened the stability of one of the world\u2019s most peaceful continents.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo say this is like a civil war is very much an exaggeration. The struggle is at a very low level. It hasn\u2019t really affected urban life very much.

But for most of its history the National Liberation Army (ELN) has played second fiddle to the country\u2019s larger and more powerful Farc.<br></p> <p>Now that the Farc have committed to lay down their weapons and shift to party politics, the ELN \u2013 founded the same year as the Farc in 1964 \u2013 becomes the oldest and largest insurgency in Latin America. </p> <p>\u201cThe ELN have lived in the shadow of the Farc,\u201d says Jerry McDermott, director of InSight Crime, a thinktank that studies insurgencies and organised crime in Latin America. \u201cNow will be the first time they will be in the limelight they have always craved,\u201d McDermott says.</p> <p>From the beginning, the ELN combined Marxist-Leninist ideology with liberation theology; some of the group\u2019s first recruits came from the church, including Camilo Torres, a popular Colombian priest who died in his first battle in 1966 and later became a cultural icon of the group. The group was nearly decimated in the 1970s as a result of a military offensive and internal fractures that led to bloody purges. </p> <p>But it recovered, and at its peak in the 1990s boasted an army of 5,000, after turning to kidnapping, extortion of oil companies and involvement in the drug trade. The group earned international notoriety in 1999, with the kidnapping of 186 people from a Cali church, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/28/features11.g23\">hijacking of a passenger aircraft</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f3bcb82aba54e8ca6eb1abae3597800e5e5f97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f3bcb82aba54e8ca6eb1abae3597800e5e5f97/0_97_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti for the ELN is seen at the entrance of the cemetery of El Palo, Cauca, Colombia, on 10 February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti for the ELN is seen at the entrance of the cemetery of El Palo, Cauca, Colombia, on 10 February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaime Saldarriaga/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The possibility of the ELN negotiating a peace deal with the government remains remote, despite an announcement in March that the two sides were ready to begin talks. Strong anecdotal evidence is emerging that as the Farc move out from areas historically under its control, ELN units are moving in, scooping up some dissident Farc fighters.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ELN, while hardly a threat to the state, is still potentially disruptive. \u201cThey can\u2019t take power but they can be a right pain in the ass for a very long time,\u201d says McDermott. </p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Shining Path, Peru</strong> </p> <p><strong>Estimated size:</strong> 300 combatants</p> <p>Founded in the late 1960s by philosophy professor<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abimael_Guzm%C3%A1n\"> Abimael Guzm\u00e1n</a>, Sendero Luminoso expanded rapidly \u2013 and initially peacefully \u2013 in the 1970s by recruiting university students. But in 1980, it declared war on \u201cbourgeois democracy\u201d, burned ballot boxes and established military bases and training camps in the Andean highlands, where they won the support of poor local farmers. </p> <p>In the years that followed, there were massacres on both sides. Shining Path guerrillas set off bombs in Lima and killed dozens of individuals, including rival Marxist leaders and union bosses. By its peak in 1991, the movement controlled much of south and central Peru but came under fierce assault from the armed forces during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, who was also blamed for massacres and human rights abuses. </p> <p>A 2003 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report estimated Shining Path was responsible for just over half the 69,280 people who were killed or went missing from 1980 to 2000 as a result of armed conflict in Peru. The security forces were blamed for about a third of the casualties and the rest were attributed to militias and other guerrilla groups, including the now defunct T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.</p> <p> Following the arrest of Guzm\u00e1n in 1992, Shining Path has declined and the government declared it destroyed in 2012. But the group is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/artemio-peru-shining-path-commander\">rumoured to have made a comeback</a> in recent years. At least one faction continues to be active in cocaine production and sporadic attacks, most recently on the eve of this year\u2019s election, when eight soldiers and two civilians were killed.

  "<p>Tsai Ing-wen is new to the job and the strain is beginning to show. Elected president of Taiwan in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/taiwan-elects-first-female-president\" title=\"\">a landslide victory</a>, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/taiwans-new-president-tsai-ing-wen-vows-to-reduce-dependence-on-beijing\" title=\"\">took office in May</a>, buoyed by high approval ratings. Yet in a few short months, Tsai\u2019s popularity has plunged by 25%. The reason may be summed up in one word: China. Suspicious that Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive party, which also won control of parliament, harbours a pro-independence agenda, Beijing suspended official and back-channel talks with its \u201crenegade province\u201d and shut down an emergency hotline.</p> <p>More seriously, for many Taiwanese workers, China also curbed the lucrative tourist trade, which brought millions of mainland visitors to the island during the accommodating presidency of Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-tsai-snap-story.html\" title=\"\">Cross-strait investment and business</a> have also been hit.</p> <p>Tsai faces contradictory pressures. The public wants the benefit of closer economic ties with China but Beijing\u2019s intentions are rightly distrusted by a population that increasingly identifies itself as Taiwanese, not Chinese. Given President Xi Jinping\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006\" title=\"\">ominous warnings</a> that reunification cannot be delayed indefinitely, China\u2019s military build-up and hawkish suggestions that Beijing may resort to force, Taiwanese ambivalence is wholly understandable.</p> <p>This dilemma \u2013 how to work constructively with a powerful, assertive China without compromising or surrendering national interests \u2013 grows steadily more acute. It is shared by states across the east and southeast Asian region. From Indonesia and the Philippines to Vietnam, Japan, Seoul, Malaysia and Singapore, the quandary is the same. But the answers proffered by national leaders are different and sometimes sharply at odds.</p> <p>The China dilemma is felt strongly in Washington. The US has striven in recent years to strengthen Asian alliances, increase trade and raise its regional military profile \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s so-called rebalance or <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/03/the-legacy-of-obamas-pivot-to-asia/\" title=\"\">pivot to Asia</a> \u2013 in a bid to contain and channel China\u2019s ambitions peacefully. But analysts say the pivot appears to be in trouble. For Europeans fixated on Syria and immigration, this may not seem especially worrying or relevant. That\u2019s shortsighted. If Obama and future US presidents get China wrong, the resulting damage could be global, threatening the security and prosperity of all.</p> <p>Obama is already badly off-track. His grand plan to promote interdependent economic self-interest across the Pacific Rim while excluding China \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP (similar to the controversial US-Europe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP) \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/trans-pacific-partnership-provisions-questionable-says-productivity-commission\" title=\"\">in deep trouble</a>.</p> <p>Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, declared last week that the TTP was a crucial \u201cpillar\u201d of future US influence. \u201cSuccess or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system and [shape] the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d Abe said.</p> <p>His warning reflected alarm in Tokyo that a risk-averse Obama is again proving an unreliable partner and will fail to get the deal ratified by Congress. It has already been disowned by both his most likely successors, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf/68_0_2063_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington\u2019s painfully obvious inability to curb China\u2019s controversial island-building programme straddling the international shipping lanes of the South China Sea is seen as further evidence that the pivot is failing. Each week seems to bring news of another Chinese airstrip or newly fortified reef. Ignoring neighbouring countries\u2019 rival claims, Chinese has effectively unilaterally annexed 80% of the sea\u2019s area, through which passes $5tn of world trade annually. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by US warships, soon to be backed by Japan\u2019s navy, have had little discernible impact while increasing the risk of direct military confrontation.</p> <p>China has flatly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\" title=\"\">rejected a precedent-setting UN court ruling</a> that deemed its claim to own the Spratly Islands, also claimed by the Philippines, to be illegal. Beijing has taken a similarly intransigent stance in its dispute with Japan over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.</p> <p>Some observers detect ulterior motives. China\u2019s military construction on the Spratlys and \u201cits effort to exhaust and eventually displace Japan in a contest for the Senkakus can be seen as an attempt psychologically and physically to isolate Taiwan and to prepare the battle space for China\u2019s possible use of military force to unify the PRC and Taiwan\u201d, an <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/publications/strategic%20comments/sections/2016-e7c1/turbulence-in-the-taiwan-strait-c26e\" title=\"\">analysis</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies said.</p> <p>Perceived American weakness has led some allies to take matters into their own hands. It <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-taiwan-idUSKCN11R109\" title=\"\">emerged last week</a> that Taiwan\u2019s military is also engaged in island fortification, at Itu Aba, its sole possession in the South China Sea.</p> <p>More dramatically still, the maverick Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-14/duterte-turns-back-us-orders-philippines-buy-weapons-russia-and-china\" title=\"\">switched sides last week</a>, announcing Manila would cease maritime co-operation with the US. China, he said, was the stronger partner. Duterte\u2019s shift reflects his anger at American criticism of human rights abuses rather than a deep strategic rethink. But it will certainly hearten Beijing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This feeble anxiety to play down differences, and evident lack of confidence in US leadership, plays into China\u2019s hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other regional players are more cautious, an attitude encouraged by Beijing\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics. Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, meekly agreed in talks with Xi this month that \u201cmaritime co-operation through friendly negotiations\u201d was the best way forward. But like China, Hanoi is rapidly building military capacity and cementing alliances with India, among others, in anticipation of less amicable times ahead.</p> <p>Similar diplomatic hedging of bets was on display in Laos this month, when an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit deliberately avoided mention of the UN court ruling. This feeble anxiety to play down differences \u2013 and evident lack of confidence in US leadership \u2013 plays into China\u2019s hands.</p> <p>The China dilemma extends far beyond the South China Sea. Having made nuclear disarmament a top priority in 2009, Obama has failed dismally to halt North Korea\u2019s accelerating pursuit of nuclear weapons. The threat was underscored by Pyongyang\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\" title=\"\"> biggest ever test explosion</a> earlier this month. China, the only country with real leverage, has helped impose additional UN sanctions on North Korea. But it has consistently balked at taking game-changing measures, such as cutting off fuel oil supplies, which could force Kim Jong-un to think again. Beijing also says it will block \u201cunilateral\u201d measures by other countries.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s impotence has intensified questions in Japan and elsewhere about the credibility of the American security umbrella, encouraging nationalists who argue that Tokyo should re-arm in earnest \u2013 or even deploy its own nuclear weapons. But their main concern is not North Korea \u2013 it is China.</p> <p>Xi is not looking for a fight. His first-choice agent of change is money, not munitions. According to Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, his preferred path to 21st-century Chinese hegemony is through expanded trade, business and economic partnerships extending from Asia to the Middle East and Africa. China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.clsa.com/special/onebeltoneroad/\" title=\"\">massive Silk Road investments</a> in central and west Asian oil and gas pipelines, high-speed rail and ports, backed by new institutions such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, are part of this strategy, which simultaneously encourages political and economic dependencies. Deng Xiaoping once said to get rich is glorious. Xi might add it is also empowering.</p> <p>Western neoliberals are optimistic. They typically argue that market-based economic exchanges can produce a win-win situation for rival states. In this way, China\u2019s rise may be peacefully accommodated, they say.</p> <p>Xi must also calculate that time is on China\u2019s side. \u201cChina\u2019s economic development and military modernisation programmes have witnessed dramatic progress since the early-1980s,\u201d said Karl Eikenberry in the <a href=\"http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/06/09/chinas-place-in-u-s-foreign-policy/\" title=\"\"><em>American Interest</em></a>. \u201cChina\u2019s aggregate GDP in 1980 was the seventh largest in the world\u2026 By 2014, China\u2019s GDP had multiplied 30 times to more than $9tn and is now the second largest in the world\u2026 The PRC\u2019s military spending, less than $10bn in 1990, grew to more than $129.4bn in 2014, second only to that of the US.\u201d On current trends, China\u2019s 2035 GDP could be a third larger than the US, Eikenberry said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87/0_146_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet for less sanguine analysts, this prospective disparity, this growing lack of balance, plus the expanding number of potential flashpoints in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere, point only one way \u2013 towards future military conflict between the US and China. The Pentagon now officially refers to the Chinese \u201cthreat\u201d.</p> <p>This is the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/\" title=\"\">Thucydides Trap</a>\u201d, a reference to the Athenian historian\u2019s account of the seemingly inevitable conflict between the rising city-state of Athens and the status quo power Sparta in the fifth century BC. Nowadays, the US is the status quo power and China the bumptious usurper.</p> <p>Open conflict is not inescapable, but it is under active discussion. A recent <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/new-report-details-why-war-between-china-america-would-be-17210\" title=\"\">study by the Rand Corporation</a> made a detailed examination of who might \u201cwin\u201d such a military showdown. It concludes that it would probably be catastrophic for both sides. Yet the study also suggests that, if war cannot be avoided, the US might be best advised to strike first, before China gets any stronger and the current US military advantage declines further.</p> <p>The dilemma is clear: amid rising nationalism in both countries, China is not willing to have its ambitions curbed or contained and the US is not ready to accept the world number two spot. These two juggernauts are on a collision course. It\u2019s unclear who or what can prevent a pile-up.</p> <h2>The other players in the conflict between Beijing and Washington</h2> <h2><strong>JAPAN</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Faced by what it perceives to be a growing threat from China, Japan\u2019s government, led by its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has sought greater freedom to project military force beyond the country\u2019s borders. This is controversial, since it involves the \u201creinterpretation\u201d of Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution. Concrete steps include joint naval patrols with the US in the South China Sea and direct help for coastal states such as the Philippines.</strong></p> <h2>VIETNAM <br></h2> <p><strong>The communist one-party regime in Hanoi is an unlikely partner for the US, given still painful memories of the Vietnam war. But Vietnam has been wooed by Obama and George W Bush as part of Washington\u2019s attempts to control and channel China\u2019s regional ambitions. Vietnam has been involved in deadly fishing grounds clashes with China, with whom it fought a war in 1979. It has also sought help elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered a $500m credit line for defence co-operation. But Hanoi is</strong> <strong>also carefully hedging its bets by keeping</strong> <strong>diplomatic lines open to Beijing</strong>.</p> <h2>INDONESIA<br></h2> <p><strong>The world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia has vast human and natural resources and is seen as one of the new 21st-century economic players. Anxious to balance development needs and national pride, President Joko Widodo </strong><a href=\"http://time.com/4379401/indonesia-china-jokowi-natuna-sovereignty-maritime-fishing-dispute/\" title=\"\"><strong>recently visited the Natuna Islands</strong></a><strong> in the southern South China Sea, scene of repeated, minor fishing boat clashes with Chinese vessels. Widodo vowed to defend \u201csovereign territory\u201d against foreign encroachment. But, officially, Indonesia calls itself a \u201cnon-claimant\u201d country and says it is not formally in dispute with Beijing. This suits both countries, at least for now. By sidestepping their differences, they can get on with business.</strong></p> <h2>SOUTH KOREA <br></h2> <p><strong>The Seoul government is more worried about its unpredictable northern neighbour than it is about China. Its defence minister said last week that South Korea has </strong><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/23/asia/south-korea-plan-to-assassinate-kim-jong-un/\" title=\"\"><strong>plans in place to assassinate Kim Jong-un</strong></a><strong> and the North Korean leadership if the nuclear threat becomes critical. Seoul sticks close to the US, which maintains military bases in the country. But abiding South Korean distrust of Japan, Washington\u2019s other key east Asian ally, dating back to the Second World War, has undermined attempts to present a united front to Beijing \u2013 with which Seoul maintains friendly relations.</strong></p> <h2>INDIA<br></h2> <p><strong>Like China, India is rapidly expanding its military capabilities, spending an estimated </strong><a href=\"http://www.defenseworld.net/news/15986/Reliance_Defense_Eyeing_Indian_Defense_Market_Worth__100_Bn__Receives_16_New_Licenses#.V-U8hXqHr7I\" title=\"\"><strong>$100bn on new defence systems</strong></a><strong> since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014. Like China, its ambition is to project itself as a regional superpower looking both east and west. This potentially brings the two countries into conflict. They have long-standing border disputes in the Kashmir/Xinjiang and Arunachal Pradesh areas. In a forerunner to Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia, George W Bush\u2019s administration launched a strategic partnership with Delhi, partly as a counterbalance to China. For its part, Beijing maintains close</strong> <strong>ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s historical foe.</strong></p> <h2>RUSSIA <br></h2> <p><strong>China and Russia are old enemies dating back to the cold war, but these days, they claim to be close friends. A visit to Beijing by President Vladimir Putin in June saw the launching of a number of </strong><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/business/348391-putin-china-visit-rosneft/\" title=\"\"><strong>trade and oil deals worth up to $50bn</strong></a><strong>. China sees Russia as a valuable provider of raw materials but also as a political and military partner in relation to the US. In defiance of Washington, the two countries held large-scale war games in the South China Sea last week, practising taking over islands in disputed waters. Putin also values collaboration as a way of circumventing sanctions imposed by the US and EU after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea.</strong></p>",

He argued he was being faithful to the party\u2019s choice and his conservative principles, even though he had previously made it clear he saw the two as incompatible.</p> <p>That meant conveying that even though he still feels Trump is an imperfect candidate, he would at least be a better defender of the US constitution and conservative values than Clinton.
