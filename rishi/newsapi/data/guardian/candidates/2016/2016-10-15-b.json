Labor and Liberal each won two seats in each electorate, with the final seat up for grabs. Labor has gained third seats in the northern electorates of Ginninderra (Belconnen) and Yerrabi (Gungahlin), while the Greens won seats in Kurrajong (central Canberra) and Murrumbidgee (Woden).</p> <p>One seat remains in play, in the Tuggeranong-based electorate of Brindabella. While the Liberal party looked likely to win the seat early on election night, a drop in the Liberal vote has left them vulnerable to losing the seat to either Labor or the Sex party.</p> <p>If Labor wins the fifth Brindabella seat, it will give them a majority for the second time in ACT history. If the Sex party win, it will be only their second election win after their victory in the last Victorian upper-house election.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/13/uncharted-territory-why-the-act-election-result-cannot-be-predicted\">There was no public polling about the ACT election</a> but a strong conventional wisdom had formed about the election: that the tired 15-year-old Labor government was vulnerable to a Liberal surge. The Liberals fiercely attacked the Labor-Greens government for its plans to build light rail through parts of Canberra and there was speculation about the Liberal party sweeping into power.</p> <p>This conventional wisdom was wrong. There was a swing of 3.3% against the Liberals, while the vote for Labor and the Greens remained stable. In retrospect, the 2012 result was a high water mark for the Liberal party. The Liberals won eight seats, only one seat short of a majority. It was the only time when the Liberal party had won eight seats \u2013 the party had only managed seven when it was in government in the late 1990s.</p> <p>The total vote for Labor and the Greens didn\u2019t change much but this masks regional swings. Labor\u2019s vote dropped in four of five electorates, by about 1% in the southern electorates of Brindabella and Murrumbidgee, and by smaller amounts in Ginninderra and Kurrajong. This was balanced out by a large 2.8% swing in Yerrabi. This electorate will be the main beneficiary of the first stage of the light rail and it appears that the focus on the light rail helped Labor shore up their third seat in this northern electorate.</p> <p>The Greens vote became more concentrated, with a 0.7% swing in their strongest seat of Kurrajong and a 0.6% drop in the Greens vote in outer-suburban Brindabella.</p> <p>This election is a reminder that Canberra as a city leans to the left of politics and it will take more than an \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d factor for the Liberal party to take power. The city is more socially progressive than most of Australia, without rural hinterland areas that favour conservative parties, and with a large public servant population that favours centre-left parties.</p> <p>Labor and the Greens have a strong relationship in the ACT, due to the electoral system and demographic factors that make it more politically feasible for the parties to have a close relationship. Eight years of formal alliance has strengthened these ties and it will be difficult for the Liberals to bust up this partnership.</p> <p>The Liberals are a long way from forming a majority in their own right. If they are to govern again, it\u2019s likely to be with the support of independents or other minor parties which are currently absent from the assembly. The Liberals governed the ACT from 1995 to 2001 with the aid of a more diverse crossbench. The best prospect for a future Liberal government is if parts of the Labor-Greens base, looking for a change after close to two decades of centre-left government, vote for centrist independents and minor parties who could choose to ally with the Liberal party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/13/uncharted-territory-why-the-act-election-result-cannot-be-predicted\">Uncharted territory: why the ACT election result cannot be predicted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We saw a large range of minor parties try their hand at this election but most fell far short, with only the Sex party having an outside chance of winning a seat. The five-member electorates will make it very difficult for outsiders to break into the assembly and thus reduce the Liberal party\u2019s options.</p> <p>While not much has changed in the political make-up of the assembly, the increased numbers will likely change the way ACT politics operates. There\u2019ll be more room for backbench MPs to challenge their party\u2019s leadership, with both major parties having more MPs to manage, and not everyone expecting a frontbench role.</p> <p>If Labor doesn\u2019t win a majority, you\u2019d expect to see a continuation of the current Labor-Greens government. If Labor does reach a majority, you wouldn\u2019t expect to see the current alliance continue. The Greens will have room to differentiate themselves from their long-time ally but you wouldn\u2019t expect any burning of the bridges between Labor and the Greens \u2013 they will likely need each other again in four years.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday night the US presidential election sparked two remarkable political speeches that in different ways illuminate our times. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> turned up the ampage on the conspiracy of a \u201ctotally corrupt political establishment\u201d . False, unsubstantiated accusations about his sexual misdemeanours, he said, were being hurled at him by a corporate media \u201cthey\u201d controlled. He was at his most extravagant yet.</p> <p>There was \u201cno lie that they won\u2019t tell, to hold their prestige and power at your expense\u201d. Crooked Hillary, who should be locked up, was at the centre of it. \u201cThe claims are preposterous, ludicrous, and defy truth, common sense and logic.\u201d Yes, these untruths hurt. But he was going to take it and rebut the lies \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d for the \u201cgreat movement\u201d he represented, which was going to take America back from the elite.</p> <p>For all its energy and hyperbole, it was unconvincing. It was a speech whose premise you could only buy if belonging to the same Trump bubble. It was sounding off \u2013 a raging in public that may offer the person raging some relief but does not persuade anybody not in the same bubble. If he found the accusations hurtful, so what? For anybody outside the \u201cmovement\u201d, he has amply deserved the opprobrium.</p> <p>A little later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama spoke</a>. She too was energetic, passionate and partisan \u2013 but she got beyond her bubble in a way that eludes Trump. Against his litany of accusations she chose to counter his rage by couching hers within a marshalled argument. Her propositions were as value laden, certainly, as Trump\u2019s and intended to be as lethal as anything he has said. But she framed her attack in a way no one could gainsay.</p> <p>There are values, in particular the way women expect to be spoken about by men, that are foundational in a civilised society, she said. What Trump had said about women, and chosen to defend as \u201clocker room\u201d talk, had crossed a line. \u201cThis is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable.\u201d</p> <p>It had hit her more than she expected, she said. In explaining why, she set out a series of feminist propositions about how the psychic wrong of being objectified as no more than a body gets under a woman\u2019s skin&#xa0;even as she tries to shrug it off. But she did&#xa0;so&#xa0;in language that was measured. Trump had put attitudes that should be stone-dead back at the heart of the national conversation. Her audience was spellbound. And when she said she found it personally hurtful, exposing her vulnerability, she achieved an empathy that Trump\u2019s same admission could never do. She was pained by the betrayal of universal values and hard-won gains; his \u201churt\u201d was because his past words were catching up with him. Different leagues.</p> <p>American conservatism\u2019s morphing from the language of rationality \u2013 presenting traditional conservative concerns about the size of government and its impact on economic incentives and morality \u2013 into a language of rage and conspiracy is one of the defining realities of our age. I profoundly disagree with conservative thinkers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/05/new-right-ayn-rand-marx\" title=\"\">Ayn Rand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/17/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">Milton Friedman</a>, Robert Nozick and Leo Strauss, but at least they mounted reasoned arguments based on first principles.</p> <p>You respect them even as you argue back. The issues are never going to be settled conclusively: it is impossible to found a society entirely on libertarian individualism; but equally to overstress the role of the public realm in securing the common good has parallel hazards. You respect your intellectual or political adversary because you know you don\u2019t hold a monopoly on truth \u2013 and if they are any good, they feel the same way. Battle is joined, and if common ground emerges you are ready to acknowledge it .</p> <p>Most politicians of left and right in advanced democracies feel similarly. Conviction and personal life stories have led to a series of decisions that have got them elected as liberals or conservatives. But if they have any self-knowledge they know that their opponents have their own integrity and want outcomes that promote human betterment and merit respect. There may even be issues on which common cause can be made.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Truth no longer matters. What counts is whether a statement feels true</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The right\u2019s collapse into rage makes these ground rules of democratic politics and political argument impossible. What is Donald Trump doing demanding that Hillary Clinton go to jail? Or conniving in his supporters wearing \u201cTrump that bitch\u201d T-shirts at his rallies? Or wildly insisting he is the object of an elite conspiracy that is intent on gerrymandering votes to produce the result it wants? It goes beyond wild disproportionality into fantasy and delusion. It makes the mutual respect on which democratic politics is founded impossible.</p> <p>Rage is absolutist. It wants to eliminate opponents, not argue with them. It justifies the gridlock and close down of government. It refuses to look for democratic compromises. It is narcissistic and wholly self-regarding, fuelled by being part of a closed belief system. It cannot accept any evidence that challenges the view that it is surrounded by conspiracy. Truth no longer matters. What counts is whether a statement <em>feels</em> true.</p> <p>What fuels the rage is in part the stagnation of blue-collar and lower middle-class male earnings. But a politician such as Trump did not have to debase the US\u2019s political coinage by choosing to represent this constituency in the way that he has. His \u201cmovement\u201d does need not to betray American values to the extent he has. The legacy of lashing out at every American institution won\u2019t disappear even if Trump loses \u2013 it will continue to poison the well.</p> <p>There are echoes of this in Britain. The hard Brexiters live in the same delusional hard right bubble as Trump, treating criticism in the same way \u2013 an elite conspiracy to obstruct the popular will. There is no rationality about the EU, just rage. The consequence is analogous to civil war in both countries \u2013 a public realm where evidence-based debate becomes ever harder. The Americans are lucky to have a Michelle Obama to remind them of a different kind of politics where anger is channelled into argument.</p> <p>We need to show in both countries that rage is a political, economic and cultural dead end. Hard Brexit will do that, but it may take years for the calamity to become obvious to all. Americans have a chance to do it more quickly next month. Here is hoping they seize the opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>In 2002, Cathi Hanauer published <em>The Bitch in the House</em>, a bestselling compilation of 26 life stories by women who felt they were carrying a disproportionate load in the home and in their lives.</p> <p>They were angry and disillusioned, sexually unfulfilled, financially over-burdened, their menfolk were lazy and unappreciative, and their children messy \u2013 and that was just the start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4920be00b144ed9f38e7dacacaf2e52dfe500100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4920be00b144ed9f38e7dacacaf2e52dfe500100/0_65_500_625/400.jpg\" alt=\"The Bitch is Back by Cathi Hanauer\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bitch is Back by Cathi Hanauer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: book jacket</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fourteen years on, Hanauer reports, this same generation of women, now in their 40s and 50s, are happier. The children have left, husbands have been sidelined in many cases, and they are now free to redefine themselves in new and decidedly post-feminist ways \u2013 and all the better for it.</p> <p>That, at least, is the broad premise of <em>The Bitch is Back</em> \u2013 a book in which Hanauer sets out to codify through personal accounts the gains women have made in an era of rapid, if uneven, personal and professional assertion.</p> <p>\u201cThe theme of the first book was anger, women juggling careers and young children and feeling like feminism had failed them,\u201d Hanauer said. \u201cBut now, as we\u2019ve settled into early midlife, I\u2019ve noticed that more women are making dramatic changes.\u201d The changes she noticed women around her making include leaving marriages \u2013 sometimes for other women \u2013 having babies on their own, or choosing to live alone.</p> <p>Statistics bear out her observations: 51% of women in the US are single, 43% of mothers are unmarried, women over 50 are now twice as likely to divorce as in 1990, half of divorces for those over 40 are initiated by women.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about how not to be the bitch in the house any more, about how not to be angry and disappointed, but about how you choose to get yourself happier in midlife.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, we meet a woman who plans to leave her husband because she is frustrated by his lack of sexual interest; another faces the opposite issue. A woman describes dating again in her 50s, others confront anxieties about appearance, health, loss, dating younger, dating older, not dating at all.</p> <p>While no convenient marketing term has been coined for this phase \u2013 reckoning or reawakening, Hanauer suggests \u2013 these are ideas reconditioned from the 1960s that, thanks in part to technology but mostly to economic equalisation, have become part of the social mainstream.</p> <p>\u201cBack then it was the radicals and the fringe; now everyone talks about this,\u201d Hanauer says. \u201cAs women have become stronger economically, they\u2019ve started to be able to say the things they have thought for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Traditionally, she says, we have heard a lot about the male midlife crisis but much less about a comparable phase for women. \u201cMidlife used to be the time a lot of women started to feel invisible but now we\u2019re able to ask, am I happy in this marriage? Am I happy in this town? Am I happy in this job?\u201d</p> <p>The choice, she says, is to calcify or decide to make things better: \u201cEarly midlife is a last chance to do that.\u201d But not everyone, she says, needs a radical overhaul: \u201cFrustrations are normal, so for many women it\u2019s a matter of adjusting expectations and making a few subtle adjustments.\u201d</p> <p>Hanauer, who has published several novels, is married to Daniel Jones, editor of the <em>New York Times</em> Modern Love column and author of the Bitch series counterpart compilation, appropriately titled <em>The Bastard on the Couch</em>. When the <em>Observer</em> spoke to Hanauer, the couple were driving to a book reading in Massachusetts.</p> <p>The bitch and the bastard hit the road together and that led to the Modern Love column. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been very in sync that way and supportive of each other\u2019s careers,\u201d she says. \u201cOur careers bounce off of each other, though people keep asking him if he\u2019s going to do <em>The Bastard Returns</em>. For the record, Jones says no way, but concedes he might do <em>The Bastard is Still on the Couch</em>.</p> <p>There\u2019s still an element of disquiet about the use of the word \u201cbitch\u201d in the title. In September, the <em>New York Time</em>s used the title \u201cThe bitch America needs\u201d for a pro-Hillary Clinton political opinion piece. The choice drew widespread criticism, with some readers writing in to say that the paper had stooped to tabloid titillation.</p> <p>For Hanauer, the title was conceived partly as a response to Virginia Woolf and her riposte to a 19th-century poem by Coventry Patmore, <em>The Angel in the House</em>, about the passive qualities of his perfect wife. Woolf thought the repressive ideal of women represented by the poem was still so potent that she wrote, in 1931, \u201cKilling the Angel in the House was part of the occupation of a woman writer.\u201d</p> <p>Hanauer says that while some women were dismayed by the title, others recognised themselves. \u201cThey thought, yes, that\u2019s me. They said they felt angry and mean and didn\u2019t want to feel that way. But they were also strong and assertive,and that\u2019s the good definition of the bitch in the house \u2013 even when we\u2019re not being angelic.\u201d</p> <p>For the couple, their shared exploration into this realm has produced one sustaining observation.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that there are so many different ways to do things, different ways to be and ways to be happy. The main thing is to figure out what works for you,\u201d says Hanauer.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no normal. No right or wrong. It\u2019s just yourself, your happiness and your obligations \u2013 and how to combine those to have a better, more content life.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\" title=\"\">suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are re-examining \u201cmilitary options\u201d </a>in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about: post-Soviet Russia\u2019s determined drive to re-establish itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end.</p> <p>The foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up anti-Russian \u201chysteria\u201d and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s call for demonstrations outside Russia\u2019s London embassy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\">invited similar, retaliatory action</a> against British interests in Moscow. The gaffe underlined his inexperience and lack of judgment.</p> <p>But on Syria\u2019s plight, and particularly on war crimes allegedly committed during the relentless \u201cpulverising\u201d of Aleppo, Johnson had a point. His comments served to highlight the much bigger strategic, security and diplomatic problem: what to do about Russia.</p> <p>Military options are indeed being discussed again in Washington, from where Britain usually takes its cue. The key question is no longer how best to remove the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. It is how to stop the Russian military, Assad\u2019s main backer, which is held responsible, directly or indirectly, for numerous lethal aerial attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s destruction of a UN aid convoy</a>.</p> <p>So furious was John Kerry, the US secretary of state, at what he saw as Moscow\u2019s deliberate sabotage of the latest Syria ceasefire that he broke off bilateral talks with Moscow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\" title=\"\">Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of \u201cbarbarism\u201d</a>. But repeating a pattern of behaviour familiar in Ukraine, Georgia and other crises, an unabashed Putin refused to back down. On the contrary, he rapidly upped the ante.</p> <p>Within days of Kerry\u2019s move and official leaks that the White House was considering cruise missile strikes on Syrian military airstrips, the Russian defence ministry warned that Russia had deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 ground-to-air missiles in Syria. Any US bombing raids would be deemed threatening to Russian military personnel, who would respond accordingly. Moscow also <a href=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\" title=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\">doubled supplies to the Assad</a> regime\u2019s war effort.</p> <p>Almost simultaneously, Putin scrapped a US-Russia agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons and two other nuclear cooperation agreements. The deployment of short-range, nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe bordering Nato members Poland and Lithuania, was confirmed. And, not coincidentally perhaps, massive civil defence exercises were held inside Russia, in apparent preparation for a nuclear war.</p> <p>Just in case Washington had not understood how serious Russia was, officials also declared Putin was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam. It is hard to think of a more defiant, taunting message to the Obama administration than conjuring the spectre of a new Cuban missile crisis.</p> <p>Demonstrating that Moscow has other strategic partnerships that could be turned against Washington, Russian ships joined military exercises with China around the disputed South China Sea islands. It is also busily building up alliances with emerging powers such as South Africa and India, notably at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\" title=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\">Brics summit in Goa</a>, while courting traditional American allies such as Turkey and the Philippines.</p> <p>Sergei Lavrov, Putin\u2019s veteran foreign minister, was blunt. Russia would not be told what to do. Like it or not, it was once again a global force to be reckoned with. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/2485001\" title=\"\">Washington... cannot use the language of force, sanctions and ultimatums</a> with Russia while continuing to selectively cooperate with our country only when it benefits the US,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week, Putin himself took to the airwaves to deliver a similar message. Responding to a formal accusation by the US government that Moscow had launched a cyber warfare-style campaign to \u201cinterfere with the US election process\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\" title=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\">Putin denied</a> he was trying to help the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cThey started this hysteria, saying this [hacking] is in Russia\u2019s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d Putin said. His government would work with whoever won the election \u201cif, of course, the new US leader wishes to work with our country\u201d.</p> <p>This latter statement was chilling. Putin was plainly saying that Russia, no longer the post-Communist economic and military basket-case it briefly became under his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/russia1\" title=\"\">Boris Yeltsin</a>, does not need or seek American approval or agreement to take action in its own interests in Syria or anywhere else. If Barack Obama or his successor want to do business in future, then Russia must be treated as a global equal, not as an irritant or a spoiler or mere regional actor.</p> <p>Such assertions flatly contradict Washington\u2019s preferred narrative, namely that the west \u201cwon\u201d the cold war and Russia is no longer a great power. Hence, perhaps, American slowness to come to terms with a changed situation. But the grave implications of unravelling US-Russia relations are slowly sinking in across Europe, as always the nervous pig stuck in the middle. The German magazine<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\" title=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\"><em>Spiegel</em> recently suggested that Syria was the most prominent battlefront</a> in a new global war, more perilous even than the Cold War because the old power structures and rules are no longer in place.</p> <p>Yet any sort of western consensus over what to do about Russia remains elusive. Opinion is divided in Europe, where many countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, for example, oppose sanctions on Moscow in addition to those imposed after Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Poland and the Baltic states, threatened by the Kaliningrad deployment and border troop build-ups, demand a more muscular Nato stance. Neutral Finland and Sweden, troubled by Russian air and sea incursions, edge ever closer to the western alliance.</p> <p>The so-called Minsk group is due to make another attempt to advance a Ukraine settlement. But nobody is optimistic; the situation there is steadily deteriorating. Following the bad-tempered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/vladimir-putin-declines-french-offer-of-syria-only-talks-in-paris\" title=\"\">cancellation last week of Putin\u2019s visit to France</a>, EU heads of state are also due to meet on Thursday with Syria-related sanctions against Russia on the agenda. This, too, may prove a non-event.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, as Johnson splutters impotently and contradicts himself over no-fly zones, the Labour party claims against all known facts that there is some kind of equivalence between Russian and US actions in Syria. If opposition fighters vacate Aleppo (handing victory to Assad), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\">Labour suggests</a>, all will be well. Its script could have been written by the Kremlin.</p> <p>The challenge presented by Russia is one of the biggest facing the next US president. Some analysts say Putin is taking advantage of Obama\u2019s lame duck status to create \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in Syria. The Russian president is said to anticipate a further deterioration in bilateral relations if Hillary Clinton wins. The two have a history of personal dislike, dating back to Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. \u201cShe says she sees in him a cold-blooded, self-enriching KGB agent and a bully; he remembers how she appeared to encourage street protests against him in 2011,\u201d said analyst <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\">Leonid Bershidsky</a>. Speaking in August, Clinton described Putin as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotated/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism</a>\u201d \u2013 lumping him with Trump, German anti-immigrant xenophobes and hard-right populists such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>Assuming Trump loses, a Clinton administration has three possible courses of action. One is to acknowledge Putin has a fair case when he argues that the US, the EU and Nato ignored or trampled on Russia\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet era, accept that Crimea is lost and that Assad stays in power for the time being, and focus in future on pragmatic, one-off \u201ctransactional\u201d deals where interests coincide.</p> <p>A second approach is a longer-term variation on the first, containing Russia wherever possible, maintaining or toughening sanctions, and waiting for the departure of Putin and what some economists say will be Russia\u2019s inevitable economic collapse as its oil and gas runs out and international ostracism, corruption and a declining working-age population take their toll. The plan would be to re-set relations (again) with a post-Putin \u201cnew Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The third possibility, and one that seems most likely at this point given Clinton\u2019s policy positions, is that the US will move on to the front foot and purposefully confront Russia directly, not only in Syria but on a number of other areas, backed up by the possible use of military force.</p> <p>This prospect is fraught with danger, especially since Putin has shown repeatedly that he reacts badly to diktats and threats. When cornered, Putin does not back down. He escalates. He does not have a domestic electorate, critical parliament or independent media scrutiny to worry about. He disdains international opinion and international law. Despite last month\u2019s bust-up, Kerry and Lavrov met again on Saturday to try to agree another Syria ceasefire. But a lasting solution looks as far away as ever. If the past 15 years show anything, it is that Putin, like a marauding Red Army tank, has no reverse gear. Much in the Middle East, Europe and beyond now rides on what an untested Clinton, with an awful lot to prove, decides is the best way forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3/0_72_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line near Donetsk, Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line about 50km from Donetsk, Ukraine, as part of the demilitarisation agreement signed in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SYRIA</h2> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s decision not to intervene militarily after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons left the door open for Russia. By going to the aid of his long-term ally Assad, Putin saw a chance to expand Russian influence in the Middle East at American expense and secure military bases on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Fighting Islamic State terrorism was a secondary consideration. The US insists Assad must go, but its limited commitment so far means the non-jihadist opposition continues to struggle while civilians bear the brunt of the violence.</p> <h2>UKRAINE</h2> <p>Despite the US-orchestrated imposition of international sanctions on Russia, Putin shows no sign of reversing his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow\u2019s not-so-secret support for separatists in eastern Ukraine opposing the pro-western government in Kiev continues unabated, with renewed fighting reported last week. Peace efforts led by Germany in the so-called Minsk group have stalled. Given the US believes it is upholding an important principle of international law, a future Clinton administration is unlikely to recognise Russian-made \u201cfacts on</p> <p>the ground\u201d.</p> <h2>THE BALTIC FRONT<br><br></h2> <p>The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, the isolated enclave it controls on Poland\u2019s and Lithuania\u2019s border, is the latest move in a war of nerves along Europe\u2019s eastern flank. The Baltic sea has also become a contested area as Russian submarines and aircraft test western reactions. Nato has beefed up its defences, and Britain has pledged its support. But the uncomfortable question remains: would an American president</p> <p>go to war to defend Estonia?</p> <h2>CYBER <br>WARFARE<br></h2> <p>The US has formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to disrupt the American presidential electoral process. The suspicion is that Putin, who has been praised by Donald Trump, wants Hillary Clinton defeated and the credibility of the election result put in doubt. Trump has already claimed the poll is fixed against him. Putin denies involvement. But the affair resembles previous cyber attacks on countries that were blamed on government-backed Russian hackers.</p> <h2>THE UNITED NATIONS<br></h2> <p>The US and Putin\u2019s Russia have clashed repeatedly in the UN Security Council, most recently over Moscow\u2019s veto of a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The standoff has raised wider concerns about the effectiveness of the UN system when permanent members appear permanently at odds and its aid convoys are blown up. Russia is accused by the US of ignoring international law and of possible war crimes, and there are moves to refer it to the International Criminal Court.</p>",

His remarks also raised concerns that it was inappropriate for a law enforcement official famous for his \u201claw and order\u201d political views to be calling for citizens to take to the streets.</p> <p>Robert Post, a first amendment expert and the dean of Yale Law School, said Clarke\u2019s comments were \u201chorrible and despicable\u201d but that \u201can American court would view this as venting, basically.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, the supreme court overturned a Ku Klux Klan leader\u2019s conviction for inciting violence.</p> <p>The Brandenburg case set a high bar: \u201cIt says that you must intentionally be inciting imminent violence, and it has to be likely that there\u2019s going to be violence.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s tweet \u201cwould fall far short of that test\u201d, Post said. </p> <p>Eugene Volokh, a Libertarian second amendment scholar at the University of California Los Angeles school of law, said Clarke\u2019s remarks were clearly intended to be figurative. </p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think Sheriff Clarke is trying to get people to do? Is he trying to get them to spear someone with a pitchfork and burn down their house, or is he trying to motivate someone to vote for Trump or support conservative values? It seems to be quite clearly the latter,\u201d he said. </p> <p>When it came to hyperbolic rhetoric about violence, Volokh said, people were more likely to give people with like-minded politics the benefit of the doubt, and to take their political opponents literally. Those who were taking Clarke\u2019s pitchfork remarks seriously were \u201ctaking it seriously because they don\u2019t like the guy who\u2019s saying it,\u201d Volokh said. </p> <p>Incitement of violence is defined very narrowly under the law, leaving wide freedom of speech protections to talk about violence or revolution in hyperbolic or unspecific ways. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt has to be a situation where you\u2019re talking to a crowd and you\u2019re trying to get them to do something right now,\u201d Volokh said. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone looking at this would say, Wow, he\u2019s really asking me to show up with pitchfork and torches outside of the newspaper and burn it down. I don\u2019t think anyone would interpret it that way, especially in light of the photo.\u201d </p> <p>Clarke has built a national platform for himself as a police official with extremely conservative, tough-on-crime views.

  "<p>What if the United States went to war and nobody here even noticed? The question is absurd, isn\u2019t it?

While it\u2019s true that the US has launched drone strikes on al-Qaida targets in Yemen for years, sometimes killing civilians and even US citizens, this particular military engagement has the potential to drag the US straight into a protracted and escalating conflict. And, as everyone knows, America has an uncanny ability to enter protracted and escalating military conflicts.</p> <p>Yet we\u2019ve heard absolutely nothing about this from our presidential candidates.</p> <p>If we investigated, we would find that the Pentagon justified this attack as retaliation.

Jonathan De Mello, head of retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, says he expects price rises in all areas and that some retailers, especially in the clothing sector, will not survive the ensuing turmoil. \u201cThe majority of hedges will last beyond Christmas because most retailers had hedges in place. I think [the first quarter] or the end of [the first quarter] are going to be when they are going to end,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI think we are going to see a lot of price rises.

I think Q1 2017 is going to be a really hard time.\u201d</p> <p>It emerged last week that Tesco had run short on household staples following a row with Unilever after the supermarket refused to pay 10% across-the-board price rises. A deal was struck on Thursday afternoon after the shares of both companies dropped when news of the clash emerged. Analysts quickly pointed to Brexit as the trigger for the dispute.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien says it is likely there have been clashes between retailers and their suppliers already but that the Tesco-Unilever confrontation was the first to become public. He predicts that while currency devaluations could affect the cost of goods by up to 20%, retailers would not be able to pass on such losses to the consumer.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way that retailers will be able to, or will attempt to, pass on that sort of price rise,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is going to differ in different sectors. It could be as much as 3% to 5% but it is difficult to gauge at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe burden is going to be shared. The balance of who is going to take the most share is debatable at this point but the retailers are really stuck in the middle and they are going to get hit the worst, I think, in terms of their margins.\u201d</p> <p>Judging by these predictions, it seems possible that the TVs, consoles and headphones that feature prominently on the Argos website may soon be going up in cost. However, the retailer declines to comment, saying it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to discuss the consequences of Brexit.</p> <p>One suggested salvation for the pound is the election of Donald Trump as US president, which would lead to a decline in the value of the dollar. Judging by the polls, however, that appears as likely as 100% of the British population deciding that Marmite is their favourite taste.</p>",
  "<p>Why are we all so shocked by the sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump? It has always been clear that his attitudes toward women are dangerously retrograde; he\u2019s never tried to hide who he is. Quite the opposite in fact; he\u2019s built a successful brand out of being an offensive playboy who\u2019s allowed to get away with it. In short, he\u2019s built his entire career on the foundation of what feminist academics call \u201crape culture\u201d.</p> <p>If you\u2019re confused by the term, \u201crape culture\u201d describes the normalization of sexual violence in society \u2013 and it\u2019s this very normalization that makes it a difficult thing to explain. Rape culture doesn\u2019t so much actively encourage rape as passively condone it. You can\u2019t pin it down to one particular thing; rather it\u2019s the accumulation of a number of social norms that perpetuate the idea that women are sexual objects, and that sexual objectification is simply a fact of life.</p> <p>Trump is a one-man textbook of such norms. So let\u2019s use him as such. I\u2019ve broken down the various assumptions, stock phrases, and social expectations that, together, constitute rape culture. Trump has helpfully provided examples of each.</p> <h2>Women are sexual objects, to be judged as such</h2> <p><em>\u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that?

Who can unify the party of Abraham Lincoln? Who can avoid a historic fourth consecutive defeat in the election of 2020? </p> <p>Much depends on whether 2016 has an effect on the Senate, where Democrats stand a strong chance of taking control, and on the House, which may now be in play. The maverick businessman has already threatened to dispute the election\u2019s result, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/trump-election-rigging.html\">claiming the election is rigged</a>, and already lashed out at moderate Republicans for not backing him.</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going to be left of the party on November 9,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.wtmj.com/charlie-sykes\">Charlie Sykes</a>, an influential conservative radio talkshow host. \u201cRepublican officials I\u2019ve talked to have gone beyond anger to a sense of anguish about the future of the party,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe damage that Trump has done will not end on November 8. I don\u2019t think any Republicans really know what a post-Trump party looks like.

I think that challenge is one that can be addressed post-election in very short order.\u201d</p> <p>But that shrinking population is not going quietly. The hard core of Trump\u2019s support remains defiant and vociferous and now feels under siege. At a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, this week, his supporters were fuelled by disdain towards a party establishment that they saw as trying to drag their candidate down.</p> <p>\u201cThey are scared because he is going to stop the bullshit,\u201d said a man who declined to give his last name but said he was called Scott, and had traveled from Aurora, Indiana. He called Ryan \u201ca spineless moron\u201d and defended Trump. \u201cHillary\u2019s pulling shit that people have been put in prison for years for,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump kisses some woman on the cheek 30 years ago and Paul Ryan says, \u2018I\u2019m not going to support him any more. I\u2019m not going to defend him anymore.\u2019 He didn\u2019t want to defend him from day one.\u201d</p> <p>Anna Rigdon, wearing a shirt saying, \u201cTrump Pence: fuck your feelings\u201d, expressed similar thoughts. She thought politicians who had backed away from Trump \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d and singled out Ryan and \u201cthe Bush family\u201d in particular.</p> <p>If Trump loses, Rigdon said, \u201cI think it is Paul Ryan\u2019s fault and the other Republicans who are not standing by Donald Trump.\u201d She added that in Ohio\u2019s contested Senate race, she would not vote for the incumbent Republican, Rob Portman, who recently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-13/how-republican-rob-portman-may-derail-the-trump-train-in-ohio\">withdrew his endorsement of Trump</a>.</p> <p>Invariably, Trump supporters rejected surveys that show the Republican nominee facing a catastrophic loss. Linda Hernandez, a middle-aged Hispanic woman wearing a \u201cDeplorables for Trump\u201d shirt, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the polls. I believe that the liberal media is controlling everyone\u2019s minds.\u201d</p> <p>The danger for the Republicans is that, should Trump lose, voters who have not believed the polls and the media will conclude that the party itself betrayed them. Instead of learning lessons, party members fear, Trump\u2019s supports will believe they were stabbed in the back, as Trump has insinuated at rallies. </p> <p>At least three factions of the party will struggle for control: ideologues led by Ryan, an establishment embodied by former presidents George HW and George W Bush (neither of whom endorsed Trump), and a so-called \u201cBreitbart wing\u201d, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">Steve Bannon</a> of the rightwing news network, now chief executive of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a war,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler</a>, a political analyst and former spokesperson for the primary runner-up, Ted Cruz. \u201cThe Breitbart wing is going to try to impose its will on the party and its brand of Republicanism, which is win at all costs without a guiding philosophy. The establishment is well funded but represents the status quo. The conservatives are underfunded and underrepresented and lack a leader to convince Americans why it\u2019s a winning strategy and philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler cited Ryan, <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm\">Mike Pence</a>, the Indiana governor who is Trump\u2019s running mate, and Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas, as potential leaders. But he noted: \u201cRonald Reagan was not obvious. They emerge. They\u2019re not obvious, so I don\u2019t know who they are. You won\u2019t know who they are until they come forward. As we saw with Winston Churchill, great leaders emerge in times of great turmoil.\u201d</p> <p>He also struck a rare optimistic note. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to be a Republican. With turmoil there\u2019s also opportunity. The party could work on a new brand and a new set of leaders.\u201d</p> <p>Others, however, saw no future in Trump\u2019s destructive wake. Asked where the Republican party should go from here, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ttancredo\">Tom Tancredo</a>, a former Republican congressman from Colorado, replied: \u201cTo hell. At least I hope so. If they do go south, the demise of the Republican party is the only good thing that can come of it. It has no relevance philosophically and so it deserves to go.\u201d</p> <p>Tancredo, the head of the Team America political action committee, likened the scenario to the 2004 disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow. \u201cWe have to think about the day after the election and what should we do as conservatives. The major problem trying to have a movement take hold in America is a lack of leader. You have to have someone who can articulate their concerns and inspire people.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest ideas who that may be. I guess they\u2019re yet to be discovered because I can\u2019t name one. I would have said Cruz but he self-destructed plus he\u2019s not charismatic. You need a Reagan.\u201d</p> <p>For the conservative blogger Erick Erickson, the key is rediscovering the party\u2019s moral compass after many defended the indefensible in Trump. \u201cMost important, the Republican party must recommit to a basic principle \u2013 character counts,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/opinion/erick-erickson-the-gop-after-donald-trump.html\">wrote in the New York Times</a> on Friday. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0792704cfd9f04af285b5ab44a90905daff76e94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0792704cfd9f04af285b5ab44a90905daff76e94/127_381_4738_2844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters cheer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The party will survive \u2013 \u2018they always do,\u2019 says the pollster Frank Luntz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There could be light at the end of the tunnel. Clinton, herself deeply unpopular, will be trying to defy political gravity if she runs for a fourth successive Democratic presidential term in 2020. Republicans could also learn from Democrats in 1992 who, after three losses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">reinvented themselves</a> and swept back into power with Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>The Republican pollster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Frank Luntz</a> saw another historical parallel. \u201cI am expecting a Republican insurrection similar to what happened to the Democrats after George McGovern lost in 1972,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery component of the GOP will be at war with each other. There will be an attempt to unseat Paul Ryan as speaker. You\u2019ll hear \u2018I told you so\u2019 from Ted Cruz and John Kasich.</p> <p>\u201cThe House, which will still be controlled by Republicans, will be at war with the Senate \u2013 which is truly up for grabs. It will be nasty, ugly and very personal. Far more effort will be spent blaming each other than trying to pull together.\u201d </p> <p>Still, Luntz said that Republicans would survive just as Democrats did in the 1970s. \u201cThey always do.\u201d</p> <p>But part of the reckoning may have to be a realisation that Trump\u2019s hostile takeover did not occur in a vacuum. Critics have argued that he merely said, in a crude and explicit way, what many rightwing Republicans have been saying for years in code resulting in racially charged anger, obstruction in Congress and cancer in the body politic. </p> <p>Barack Obama, now at the end of his term, recently articulated the idea <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/barack-obama-on-5-days-that-shaped-his-presidency.html\">to New York Magazine</a>. \u201cI see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee [in 2008] to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the Tea Party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhether that changes, I think, will depend in part on the outcome of this election, but it\u2019s also going to depend on the degree of self-reflection inside the Republican party. There have been at least a couple of other times that I\u2019ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break, but it just seems to get worse.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>As if the routine vulgarities of Donald Trump haven\u2019t made politics depressing enough, the New York state assembly is now on its second year of debating whether or not to rename State Route 107 in Oyster Bay, Long Island, \u201cBilly Joel Boulevard\u201d in honor of the Piano Man himself. While fellow singer/songwriter Bob Dylan is basking in the glory of a Nobel Prize for literature, Billy Joel can\u2019t even get the state of New York to write his name on a street sign. Someone should write a song about that.</p> <p>The crux of the argument over the renaming is that Joel is not yet deceased, making the honor premature. People who get streets and roads named after them and statues erected in their likeness tend to be two things: male, as this New Yorker <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/city-of-women\">article</a> points out, and dead. Billy Joel is definitely a man, as you would know if you\u2019ve heard the song Big Shot, but unfortunately for his bid for getting a patch of asphalt named after him, he\u2019s still ticking.</p> <p>Never in my gravest nightmares did I imagine that Christie Brinkley\u2019s ex-husband could be a wedge issue in an election involving human adults in the year 2016. This could only be dumber if the debate was over whether or not to name an abandoned subway tunnel after Rick Springfield.</p> <p>\u201cMy opponent is either impotent or is simply not trying, because everyone loves Billy Joel,\u201d Democratic assembly candidate Dean Hart <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/10/billy-joel-an-issue-in-long-island-assembly-race-106345\">said</a> about incumbent Republican Michael Montesano in a press release issued on Thursday. Yes, he issued a press release. The world must know! Michael Montesano doesn\u2019t care about classic rock! </p> <p>\u201cNext to Teddy Roosevelt, Long Island really doesn\u2019t have a more famous or popular person than Billy Joel,\u201d Hart continues. Bit of a gulf in significance there. We go from a former president of the United States to the man famous for writing Scenes from an Italian Restaurant. Excuse me, but Long Island also gave us guitarist Joe Satriani, Amy Fisher, Stuttering John Melendez from the Howard Stern Show, and former NFL quarterback Vinnie Testaverde. I\u2019d mention Thomas Pynchon, but I\u2019ve clearly already proved my point.</p> <p>Nevertheless, hasn\u2019t Billy Joel done enough, his supporters ask? The residents of suburban New York don\u2019t even bother hiring a DJ for their weddings any more. They just play The Nylon Curtain on repeat and no one complains. But more importantly, shouldn\u2019t Billy Joel get to see Billy Joel Boulevard before he departs this earth? I might not be much of a fan of his, but as a fellow human, I can sympathize with those who want to recognize him while he\u2019s still around.<br></p> <p>Consider the funeral. Your loved ones dress you up in expensive clothes, toss you in a box lined with silk or velvet, then eat a bunch of cheese and drink a few glasses of wine at midday. They say wonderful things about you, pray that you\u2019ve gone to a bespoke afterlife that caters to your every whim, and, most importantly, remark on how good you look. \u201cThey did a great job cleaning Dave up,\u201d they\u2019ll say as they gawp at my eerily beatific, rotting corpse.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get to see any of that \u2013 I\u2019m dead! No wine, no cheese, no silk prison box, and no fancy suit. All the best parts of being dead are lost on the corpse. Why deny Billy Joel the right to see his name slapped on a green road sign before he travels \u201cuptown\u201d for real.</p> <p>These sorts of honors really only serve one purpose, and that\u2019s to lend the honoree a semblance of immortality. Your body might quit working, but there will always be that road for kids to ask their exasperated parents, \u201cwho\u2019s Billy Joel?\u201d The more roads, bridges, burn units, sports arenas, museums and vape shops with our names on them, the greater chance we have of not fading into obscurity. At least, that\u2019s the theory. Nevermind that Billy Joel is already the guy who sang Only the Good Die Young (that\u2019s a bit of a laugh now, eh?). </p> <p>Granted, you\u2019ll still very much not alive, no matter how many places someone has scribbled your name. Also, State Route 107 might be ripped up and replaced with a tube system for self-driving cars in the next 50 years. For now, at least, Billy Joel should be able to drive over a stretch of road bearing his name. It\u2019s as close as any of us get to enjoying our inevitable demise. </p> <p>Actually, a Nobel Prize would be nice too.</p>",

You won\u2019t get that if you dump all that liquid at once.\u201d</p> <p>Podesta\u2019s email is timed at 2.50am. Trump has been criticised for tweeting at 3am, but anyway.

His Spanish is \u201calmost perfect\u201d, according to the Spanish embassy, which awarded him 4 out of 5. He got the same score from the Indonesian embassy, probably due to his childhood in Indonesia.</p> <p>He was awarded 4.5 for Persian, 4 for Swahili, 3.5 for Arabic, Dutch and Greek, 3 for German, 2.5 for Hindi and only 1 for French. The Arab American Institute in Washington said: \u201cWhen you listen to him, you think, \u2018Boy, he really emphasised that second part, the alaikum.\u2019 It\u2019s interesting that even in another language, the president\u2019s signature voice and mannerisms are still prevalent. It\u2019s hard to explain, but his Arabic comes out sounding very Obama-like, as if an Arabic-speaker were to do an impression of the president in Arabic.\u201d</p> <p>And this from the French-American Foundation: \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot give President Obama high marks for his pronunciation. It was nice that he used the French words, but they may as well have been American.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton, as her campaign constantly reminds us, has visited 112 countries, so probably picked up some phrases along the way. Trump is speaking a language of his own already.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Cat woman. Hillary Clinton in San Francisco on Thursday: \u201cThere\u2019s hardly any part of America that he\u2019s not targeted.

  "<p>A former contestant on the Apprentice, Summer Zervos, on Friday accused Donald Trump of groping or aggressively kissing her on two separate occasions in 2007, when she met the businessman privately for what she thought were going to be discussions about job opportunities.</p> <p>Often speaking through tears, Zervos read a prepared statement in the Los Angeles offices of her lawyer, Gloria Allred.

Brushing it off as his form of greeting, she said, she agreed to meet Trump for dinner later that year when he traveled to Los Angeles.<br></p> <p>At a Beverly Hills hotel, Trump\u2019s security guard led her to a bungalow where he was staying. When she was inside, Zervos claimed, Trump greeted her with an open-mouthed, aggressive kiss while grabbing her shoulder , and put his hand on her breast. Several times, she claimed, she pushed him away and indicated he should stop.</p> <p>When Zervos resisted Trump\u2019s advances, she said, he tried to lead her toward the bedroom of the bungalow. \u201cLet\u2019s lay down and watch some telly-telly,\u201d she claimed he said. When she said, \u201cC\u2019mon man, get real,\u201d she claimed, he replied, \u201cGet real,\u201d and thrust his genitals at her.</p> <p>Zervos, who was an Orange County restaurant owner when she appeared on the fifth season of the the Apprentice, said she was making her accusations public because of Trump\u2019s claims that he had never touched a woman without her consent. </p> <p>In his statement, Trump said: \u201cI vaguely remember Ms Zervos as one of the many contestants on The Apprentice over the years. To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life. In fact, Ms Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on 14 April of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California.\u201d </p> <p>Trump went on to claim \u201cthe media is now creating a theater of absurdity that threatens to tear our democratic process apart and poison the minds of the American public\u201d, and said \u201cin the coming days\u201d he would \u201caddress our nation in a more personal way\u201d, bypassing \u201cthe unethical press that wants to see their candidate elected\u201d. </p> <p>Late Friday night, the Trump campaign also released a statement from Zervos\u2019s first cousin, John Barry, who described himself as \u201ccompletely shocked and bewildered\u201d.

Launching on Sunday, his 165-minute opus makes a feature of its sheer unwieldiness, as Curtis veers from social history to conspiracy theory via the odd rambling bar-room anecdote, like a man who\u2019s two-dozen browser tabs into a major Wikipedia binge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKUN1a2AHE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bvKUN1a2AHE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He argues that an army of technocrats, complacent radicals and Faustian internet entrepreneurs have conspired to create an unreal world; one whose familiar and often comforting details blind us to its total inauthenticity.

But those expecting a snappy crash course in our chaotic world (\u201cYou won\u2019t believe how this veteran BBC film-maker explains the Islamic State! What happens at 156:34 will shock you!\u201d) clearly aren\u2019t familiar with his methods. The film may address some of today\u2019s most critical global issues, but it also allocates space to Jane Fonda, the fall of the Soviet Union and a supercut of pre-9/11 disaster movies.

If its colossal running time means it\u2019s unlikely to be watched in a single sitting, each viewer must decide for themselves how exactly to navigate the experience.

  "<p>Could national populism have reached its high-water mark in western politics. Perhaps globally? It may be too early to say, but some signs point to a pushback against rampant xenophobia, bigotry and the ruinous fascination with strongmen. The indications are fragile, but without doubt they are there.</p> <p>Take the US, Germany and France. Donald Trump has had a more successful bid for the presidency than anyone could have imagined a year ago, but his campaign now seems on the wane, damaged by Republican defections and his ramblings on women. The political death of Angela Merkel has been pronounced many times since the 2015 refugee crisis but the chancellor, arguably Europe\u2019s most forceful voice on inclusiveness, simply has no obvious challenger ahead of Germany\u2019s 2017 election. As France heads towards primaries next month, it\u2019s a centrist figure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a> (not Nicolas Sarkozy, who has embraced far-right themes) who leads the polls. This makes it more likely that Marine Le Pen will be soundly beaten in the second round of next year\u2019s presidential election (which she is all but guaranteed to reach).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It might be that populists have over-reached, or that memories of a dark past have come to the fore</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such signals have global significance. The US remains the single most powerful democracy in the world. A Hillary Clinton victory in November would mean an entirely different global environment to the one that would emerge if the US were to end up with a presidency of the type imagined in the 2004 Philip Roth novel, The Plot Against America, in which the pilot Charles Lindbergh defeats Roosevelt in the 1940 election.</p> <p>Germany and France might form an unbalanced couple, but they stand at the heart of European politics: what happens in their elections will largely define what can be salvaged of the EU project \u2013 arguably much more than Brexit negotiations will do. Britain\u2019s current political travails are a seen as a side show in Europe at the moment.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the continent, there are yet more signs of pushback. In central Europe, often described as a hotbed of parochialism and intolerance, illiberal politicians aren\u2019t entirely having their way. This month Poland\u2019s nationalist, ultraconservative government had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/05/poland-signals-u-turn-total-abortion-ban-protests-video-report\">backtrack on plans to curtail abortion rights</a> after thousands of women protested on the streets.

It may be that national populists have overreached (Trump\u2019s racist and misogynist antics); or that memories of a dark past and the need to avert political catastrophe have come to the fore (Germans wanting to counter the far-right Alternative for Germany, French citizens worried about Le Pen). It may be that groups are rekindling the spirit of democratic mobilisation (Polish women and the anti-Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski grassroots, who are such keen demonstrators). It may be that voter apathy also sends a message about policies that stigmatise outsiders (Hungary).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does this sound too optimistic? Precisely because there haven\u2019t been many reasons for optimism recently, it\u2019s important not to ignore what is potentially promising. Likewise, it\u2019s important to see how the connections between international affairs and domestic politics may not all play out in the populists\u2019 favour. Authoritarianism has thrown its weight around in recent years, but right now it\u2019s going through a bad patch.</p> <p>Take Russia. Whatever allowances some in the west might have sought to make for Putin in the past, the Syrian tragedy has made this much more difficult. To claim that Russia\u2019s air assault on Aleppo\u2019s population is no different from western interventions against Isis not only flies in the face of documented facts, it smacks of intellectual and moral disorientation.</p> <p>Geopolitics feeds into politics. Which means there is cautious hope to be drawn from the fact that Putin\u2019s Russia currently finds itself more isolated than it ever has been (only Venezuela\u2019s autocratic regime voted alongside Russia in the UN recently). Russia has been an active backer of populists in Europe and in the US. Putin sympathisers now find themselves having to keep awkwardly silent over the scandal unfolding in Syria, or having to repeat a propaganda line that many citizens may find hard to swallow.</p> <p>This is not to say that national populists or their authoritarian backers are about to be defeated or disempowered. The fuel that powers the far right has yet to be exhausted. But from Clinton\u2019s lead to the surprising strength of Europe\u2019s political centre-ground, and with the novelty of Russia being discredited on many fronts, the picture is not just doom and gloom for the democratically minded. If this is an interconnected world, then the pushback against national populism may be stronger than we think.</p>",

The first describes an America transformed into a&#xa0;theocracy that treats women as mere childbearing chattels \u2013 after a state of emergency is declared following an assassination. (\u201cThey blamed it on the Islamic fanatics at the time\u201d, the novel\u2019s narrator explains.) The second deals with a world in which the planet\u2019s resources are severely depleted. A situation, she explained in the lecture, that leads to civil chaos. \u201cThen \u2026 warlords and demagogues take over, some people forget that all people are people, enemies are created, vilified and dehumanised, minorities are persecuted, and human rights as such are shoved to the wall.\u201d Not so much a distant and frightening future, she said, as \u201cthe cusp of where we are living right now\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"282c473a56c75e10e2e8ac01a645677738c59e5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/282c473a56c75e10e2e8ac01a645677738c59e5a/0_68_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Marshall in the 2003 English National Opera staging of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale by Margaret Atwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Marshall in the 2003 English National Opera staging of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale by Margaret Atwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Readers of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale have&#xa0;indeed found elements of its story looming alarmingly close in recent weeks.

Are&#xa0;we in Gilead \u2013 the America of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale? \u201cClose, yes. For sure.\u201d And everything in it, she says, was based on things that had actually happened. \u201cIncluding everyone tugging on a rope during hangings so that no one is guilty: that\u2019s from English history,\u201d she says. \u201cCeau\u0219escu in Romania forcing women to have children \u2013 quotas for childbirth.

(His one famous failure was in not&#xa0;predicting Trump\u2019s victory in the Republican primaries.) Silver\u2019s article includes a pair of maps. One shows how&#xa0;the US would look if only men voted: almost entirely red. The other shows how the US would look if only women voted: almost entirely blue. \u201cIt spawned a hashtag,\u201d says Atwood (who is a frequent poster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>) \u201ccalled #Repealthe19th. The 19th Amendment is what gave women the vote. So there are Trump supporters who want to take&#xa0;the vote away from women.

Second wave, the image. Now it\u2019s about violence and rape and death: we\u2019ve got down to the nitty-gritty.\u201d Earlier this month, when she spoke at&#xa0;the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/festivals-series/london-literature-festival?gclid=CjwKEAjwhILABRDwo8mlqt6ug38SJACNSq_kIM90R5cOL9yG603aGdq-ldofuRvvMooMmaqKp-IJiBoCwW7w_wcB\" title=\"\">Southbank literature festival</a> in London, she talked about \u201cthe most amazingly vicious online abuse\u201d of women. \u201cWhat&#xa0;century are we in?\u201d she&#xa0;asked. \u201cApparently, the 12th.\u201d</p> <p>When The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was published, she says, the novel was reviewed by British critics as an enjoyable fantasy, and by the Canadians with a certain anxiety (\u201cCould it happen here?\u201d). In America, though, there was a sense of: \u201c\u2018How long have we got?\u2019\u201d She sighs. \u201cApparently, not as long as I thought \u2026 With any cultural change there is a push and a pushback. Trump has brought out a huge pushback that was originally against immigrants. Now it has shifted to being very misogynistic, partly because of Hillary Clinton. You have not seen anything like this since the 17th-century witchhunts, quite frankly.\u201d</p> <p>Can you understand the appeal of&#xa0;Trump, I ask? \u201cHe brings out the temper-tantrum-throwing wilful brat in all of us. \u2018Why can\u2019t I do what I want? Why can\u2019t I have what I want? Those other people are stopping me. Those other people have a bigger lollipop that I do, I\u2019m going to take their lollipop away from them.\u2019 But on the other hand, he couples that with the most amazing whining.\u201d She mentions the complaint by Trump that his microphone malfunctioned during the first televised presidential debate. (\u201cRubbish.\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cI tell you this,\u201d she continues. \u201cHillary Clinton is a better man than Trump. She has more connection to the traditional male virtues. She has comported herself in a much more manly fashion. Ask any real alpha males that you\u2019ll know and they\u2019ll say of Trump, \u2018This is the guy we&#xa0;didn\u2019t like at school because he was a&#xa0;bully, but as soon as anyone pushed back at him he started to whine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What does she think, then, of Clinton\u2019s campaign? \u201cWell, it\u2019s more of a&#xa0;campaign. Trump has taken about 10 different positions on everything, so there is no way of knowing what he really thinks. You actually just don\u2019t know. He will adopt a position depending on what reaction is mirrored back to him. Basically, it\u2019s very close to being a manifestation of a mob: burn them at the stake, screaming and yelling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59cd16e301a7d46db8f812312aa7e5e1e88a3828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59cd16e301a7d46db8f812312aa7e5e1e88a3828/0_0_1400_2250/622.jpg\" alt=\"Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood, a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest\" width=\"622\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood, a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/30/salem-witch-trials-american-imagination\" title=\"\">the Salem witch trials</a>, then? She proceeds to talk about them: Atwood likes to take a long historical sweep. Her heroes of this tragic episode, dramatised by Arthur Miller in The Crucible, are Rebecca Nurse, who refused to admit that she was a witch and declined to accuse others, meaning she was hanged; and Giles Corey, who refused to plead at his trial, meaning that he was pressed \u2013 that is, crushed by heavy stones until his lungs collapsed and he died. By sacrificing himself thus, and not allowing his case to be tried, his family inherited his property, which otherwise would have been confiscated.</p> <p>However, she says, after a fairly long disquisition on the legal history of 17th-century Massachusetts, this is not at all what the Trump situation is like. \u201cSalem was much more dignified \u2026 Salem at least had rules for the trials.\u201d She hunts around for a better comparison. It\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/08/favourite-film-night-of-the-hunter\" title=\"\">Night of the Hunter</a>, she says. \u201cRobert Mitchum. Directed by Charles Laughton. Just a great film. At the end they catch this guy who\u2019s been murdering women and has been trying to get hold of some children to kill them too. He is seen off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t-konY4cHE\" title=\"\">by Lillian Gish</a> playing an old lady in a rocking chair with a shotgun.\u201d (A sudden vision arrives, unbidden, of Atwood in a&#xa0;rocking chair with a shotgun.) \u201cShe peppers him with shot, he gets caught and put in jail and there\u2019s a mob outside who want to lynch him. So the very same Christian, righteous people who have played the virtuous townspeople are now screaming for his blood. This is what it\u2019s like. Those mob scenes at Trump rallies: burn her, lock her up, kill&#xa0;her. They think they are at the wrestling, but let those people out, and&#xa0;you have a lynchmob.\u201d</p> <p>We turn to the scenarios she sketched in the MaddAddam trilogy: a world of internet insecurity, pig-human hybrids, environmental devastation, oil fetishists and complete corporate takeover of states. Do dystopian novels, I wonder, actually do anything? Can they change behaviour? They are, she says, more like weathervanes than guides on averting disaster. \u201cAll dystopian novels are telling you to do is make sure you\u2019ve got a lot of canned goods and a gun.\u201d Do you have canned goods and a gun in Toronto? \u201cI\u2019m too freaking old. I\u2019m probably not going to make it through the zombie apocalypse anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The literary news, as we speak, has been recently all about the \u201cunmasking\u201d by an Italian investigative journalist of the real identity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-unmasking-elena-ferrante-an-impoverishing-act\" title=\"\">Elena Ferrante</a>, the pseudonymous author of the hugely popular Neapolitan novels. \u201cShe probably went too far in putting out a fake autobiography. Which is like an invitation: expose me,\u201d says Atwood. (She is referring to Frantumaglia, which is about to be published in English \u2013 not an autobiography as such, but a collection of letters, essays, interviews and the like.) \u201cBut she\u2019s not committed a crime. Nor do I feel that she was a bad person to write under a pseudonym. She did what she wanted to do. It worked spectacularly well, and then there are the books. People will read them a bit differently, that\u2019s inevitable. But it doesn\u2019t make them bad books.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57906cd966d08edc93eb2266720a9918fdda3df9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57906cd966d08edc93eb2266720a9918fdda3df9/0_0_4005_3080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Atwood in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"769\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I used to go on the Greyhound bus with copies of my books in a cardboard box, and give readings in school gymnasiums\u2019 \u2026 Margaret Atwood in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Bull/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atwood herself published pseudonymously a bit, when she was young \u2013 in the student magazine, to fill the pages.

Invisibility is&#xa0;not her thing: especially when she, and Canadian fellow writers, worked so&#xa0;hard in the 1970s to improve their own visibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m entitled to whinge too much, because it\u2019s my fault. I used to go on the Greyhound bus&#xa0;with copies of my books in a cardboard box, and give readings in school gymnasiums.

His pride and joy was the revolutionary Winchester repeating rifle, one of the first guns to fire rounds repeatedly, taking away the cumbersome need to stop and reload. The Winchester became an icon of the American frontier \u2013 used by cowboys, Native Americans, outlaws, sheriffs and even President Theodore Roosevelt. As the settlers went steadily westwards after the civil war, the Winchester was their weapon of choice \u2013 it became known as the Gun that Won the West, celebrated in celluloid numerous times by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu0h3GRBQ-U\">gun-toting John Wayne</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D5_0cMzFVw\">youthful Jimmy Stewart</a>.</p> <p>Used by the Turks in their 19th-century battles against the Russians, and by the Mexicans in their uprising against the French-backed emperor, the Winchester became known around the world. The company\u2019s officials were always wary of having a history of their beloved rifles written \u2013 we don\u2019t want dead buffalo and Indians on every page, observed my great-great-uncle Ed Pugsley, the chief engineer.</p> <p>My introduction to the Winchester came on a hot August afternoon in 1987, more than a century after Oliver Winchester had started manufacturing his rifles. Visiting my American relatives in Connecticut, we fired tennis balls from an adapted elephant gun into the sparkling waters of the Long Island Sound, just for the fun of it. My great-aunts, legend has it, would fire the tennis-balls at intruders who ventured too close to their family compound.</p> <p>We were having a high old time at the family compound in Branford, Connecticut, which had been built by Oliver\u2019s daughter Jennie and her husband, Thomas Gray Bennett. As a distant family member from London, I had a dim idea of what the Winchester repeating rifle was, having watched a healthy dose of westerns on TV during my early 70s childhood. And as a former air cadet in east London, I learned to fire a .22 rifle and a .303 \u2013 but always on a shooting range, in a highly restricted environment. And here were my relatives merrily shooting tennis balls into the blue yonder, with guns inside their summer houses \u2013 it was an introduction to the gun culture of America, so very different from that back home in Britain.</p> <p>My grandmother Molly, who inherited a not-inconsiderable sum of money as the great-granddaughter of Oliver, married an Englishman and left her family in New England for Cambridge, England. She was ambivalent about the legacy of the Winchester, and would occasionally grunt disapprovingly about gun money, shaking her head. As a child, she took me to CND rallies in Cambridge, and we watched deeply alarming videos about Hiroshima. A strange juxtaposition, the gun heiress turned fervent supporter of nuclear disarmament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9/768_141_2127_2741/776.jpg\" alt=\"Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CS Fly/Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That visit to my American clan stayed with me as I went off to university. I began to read all I could about Oliver Winchester and his rifles. He was born a penniless farm boy, trained as a carpenter building flying buttresses in churches, successfully patented a bestselling shirt collar, and then decided to invest his considerable cash in guns just as the US civil war was looming. When my husband and I moved with our sons across the Atlantic in 2004, my interest in all matters Winchester increased. We bought the caretaker\u2019s cottage on the family\u2019s summer estate of Johnson\u2019s Point in Connecticut, and the idea of writing a book about these mysterious descendants of yesteryear evolved.</p> <p>As I was learning about my Winchester heritage, I was reporting for the BBC on the phenomenon of mass shootings in America. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/sandy-hook-classroom-massacre\">Sandy Hook elementary school massacre</a> in 2012, when a gunman killed 20 young children, six adults, his mother and himself, I arrived to witness a scene of unbearable agony. In this picture-perfect Connecticut town, not far from where Winchester built his repeating rifles, Christmas trees had been put up in memory of every dead child. I stood outside the temporary mortuary where the bodies of the murdered six- and seven-year-olds lay, and wept, imagining how I would feel if my own six-year-old was inside.</p> <p>At school, my children learned what they called \u201chuddle drills\u201d \u2013 what to do if someone is having a really bad day, as my then seven-year-old son explained brightly. I told him reassuringly that I didn\u2019t feel that he would ever have to do a huddle drill for real. In the wake of Sandy Hook, Congress failed to pass even modest gun-control legislation, such as ensuring background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows.</p> <p>As the descendant of a dynasty created by manufacturing weapons of war, writing a book has forced me to examine my own feelings on the topic. One of our relatives, Sarah Winchester, was supposedly so racked with guilt and haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester that she started building a house in California because a medium advised her that endless building would appease the dead. Construction only stopped when she died. Thousands flock every year to the bizarre <a href=\"http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/\">Winchester Mystery House</a>, pulled in by the irresistible tale of guns and guilt. There is scant truth to the myth \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.</p> <p>I am fascinated by the Winchester legacy, but I don\u2019t feel responsible for or guilty about the past. I see our family as a thread in the tapestry of America\u2019s history. There is no airbrushing over the brutality of the settling of America\u2019s west, in which guns were central. The Winchester was deployed to kill Native Americans defending their historic lands \u2013 and yet they also used the rifle with devastating effect, most notably at General Custer\u2019s last stand. African Americans also embraced the Winchester as a defensive weapon in the bloody period after the civil war, in which lynching was common. \u201cA Winchester rifle should have a place of honour in every black home,\u201d as the civil rights crusader Ida B Wells wrote in 1892. And so the Winchester was used for many different causes during a violent period.</p> <p>As a soon-to-be dual US and British citizen, it is hard not to be struck by the starkly different approaches to gun control. When I was growing up in Britain, strict gun laws were passed in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/20/archive-1987-hungerford-massacre-michael-ryan\">Hungerford massacre in 1987</a> and then additional legislation was passed after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/14/dunblane-massacre-scotland-killing\">Dunblane school killings</a>. In the US, where the second amendment provides a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the debate is very different. Although opinion polls suggest the public supports controls on the sale of assault weapons and background checks for everyone who buys a gun, the National Rifle Association has so far lobbied successfully against these measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec/0_0_2693_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hillary Clinton is running in favour of what she calls commonsense gun control, while Donald Trump is staunchly against her proposals. Why such different approaches in two countries sharing a common language and heritage? Guns were embedded in the culture of America at the time of its violent revolutionary war against England, and used to expand the territory of the new nation.</p> <p>When the question of gun control in the US came up in the 1970s, the surviving Winchester relatives were staunchly opposed. But then they had never been fans of Uncle Sam having a say in their business. In the 1890s, when men at the Winchester factory were regularly blown up as they mixed the explosive primer used in the ammunition, my great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, perfected a system where the men mixed the primer using mirrors to keep themselves at a safe distance. He was most pleased to have kept meddling factory inspectors at bay through his own ingenuity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/25/kids-guns-and-the-american-way\">Kids, guns and the American way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, it was heavy-handed government-administered contracts that led to the end of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company as a family concern. When the first world war loomed into view, my great-grandfather, Winchester Bennett, was at the company helm. A highly strung man, he had suffered from nervous anxiety for much of his adult life and was nursed throughout by his devoted wife, Susan. Winchester, named after the gun, was not equipped to deal with the rigours of wartime production and had to leave the company just as the factory was gearing up to produce millions of rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of rifles for the allied wartime effort. Bennett was later treated for addiction at a Connecticut facility specialising in patients with psychiatric disorders.</p> <p>His father, Thomas Gray Bennett, though he was nearly 80, came back on to the company board at this time of personal and professional crisis. Thomas Bennett never approved of doing business with the US government, which insisted on fixed-price contracts. As the costs of labour and materials skyrocketed because of wartime demand, Winchester made less and less money. By the time the war ended, the company was millions of dollars in debt. A wild plan to diversify into selling products \u201cas good as the gun\u201d followed, and the company used the excess factory space left over from the war to manufacture ice-skates, penknives, fishing rods, washing machines, cutlery and all manner of household items. The scheme was a monumental failure and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company went into receivership in 1931.</p> <p>A special summer home is the legacy of the company for our generation. As I rake the beach for oyster shells, if I narrow my eyes I can conjure up the image of a cowboy out west galloping on his horse, his trusty Winchester at his side. The great-aunts have passed on now, but I can still hear the echo of their laughter as they fire the tennis-ball gun out into Long Island Sound.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Winchester: Legend of the West by Laura Trevelyan is published by IB Tauris, \u00a320.
