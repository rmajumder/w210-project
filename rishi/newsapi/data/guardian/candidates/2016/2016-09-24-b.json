  "<p>The gulf between the Labour party\u2019s membership and its MPs has never looked wider. Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-wins-landslide-victory-party\" title=\"\">secured an overwhelming majority in Labour\u2019s leadership contest</a>, increasing his mandate among members. Yet three-quarters of Labour MPs backed a motion of no confidence in him back in June. The result shows how successful he has been on his own terms: since becoming leader, he has reshaped Labour\u2019s membership after his own politics. According to <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/SkyData/status/779649058994528257\" title=\"\">one exit poll</a>, only 37% of members who joined before 2015 voted for Corbyn; among newer members, that figure was 83%.</p> <p>But on any other objective measure, the last year has been a failure. Under Corbyn\u2019s leadership, the party provided chaotic and ineffective opposition during one of the most seismic periods in British political history. His anaemic support of the Remain campaign to stay in Europe was a low point in his leadership. Labour suffers from the <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/09/labour-poll-ratings-over-last-12-months-the-worst-it-has-had-in-opposition/\" title=\"\">worst-ever poll ratings for an opposition party</a> 12 months on from a leadership contest.</p> <p>And there is a real danger that in the wake of the leadership result, the divisiveness of the last 12 months culminates in mutually assured destruction. The best possible outcome is an uneasy coexistence between Corbyn and his MPs. But even that will require a significant change in approach from both sides.</p> <p>This newspaper has always argued Corbyn is not the answer to the Labour\u2019s problems. But after his second leadership win, his MPs have little choice but to give him some space to try to succeed. But they cannot be expected to do so unless Corbyn offers a change in style and leadership. The charge against him is not simply that he does not have the right ideas for Britain (he does not) or that he could never lead Labour to an election victory (he could not). A broad group of MPs who did not support him in last year\u2019s leadership election joined his shadow cabinet in good faith to try to provide constructive support. Many of those who resigned, even those sympathetic to his politics, say <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37457983\" title=\"\">their hand was forced</a> as much by his sectarian politics as his administrative incompetence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-election-result-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-appeals-for-unity-politics-live\">Jeremy Corbyn sweeps to victory increasing his mandate as Labour leader - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corbyn, a self-professed believer in a \u201ckinder, gentler politics\u201d, has been all too keen to proffer rhetorical olive branches. But he has tacitly encouraged a divisive culture, intolerant of dissent. He has said explicitly he will not act against deselection threats made by his supporters against MPs such as Peter Kyle, one of the few MPs who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-says-he-will-not-interfere-in-attempts-to-deselect-labour-mp-peter-kyle_uk_57a1ed3de4b0459aae5eee71\" title=\"\">overturned a Conservative majority against the odds in 2015</a>. He has done far too little to address the shocking abuse directed at female and Jewish MPs by people who claim to be party supporters. In fact, his office has tacitly encouraged it; earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/corbyns-team-mistakenly-issues-list-of-mps-who-undermined-leader\" title=\"\">it published a list of MPs regarded as abusive to the leadership</a>, a move that could not help but make them a target for further abuse.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s leadership has also been racked by incompetence. Several of his former frontbench team have complained it has been impossible to secure meetings with him and that he and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have announced policy in their areas with no consultation or prior warning. He has undercut his party\u2019s public-facing campaigns with <a href=\"http://www.liliangreenwood.co.uk/lilian_s_speech_to_nottingham_south_labour_party_members\" title=\"\">poorly managed reshuffles</a> and called for the immediate triggering of article&#xa0;50 in the wake of the Brexit vote without seeming to realise how foolish that would be. Respected economists who he appointed as advisers have walked away, citing his lack of interest in developing any meaningful policy content. It will require much more than warm words about reaching out to make it possible for his MPs to coexist with him. He and McDonnell will need to resist their core instinct to turn the party into a more doctrinaire closed shop that tolerates less discussion and intellectual dissonance. They must welcome challenges in the form of ideas and debate. They must protect, not encourage, the hounding of MPs who hold a different but no less valid approach to Labour principles. If they fail to do so, the party will end up as a hermetically sealed, intellectual cocoon, loved by its million strong membership \u2013 and overlooked by the wider electorate.</p> <p>Ideas are strengthened and made resilient by challenge and debate, not acquiescence and agreement. Corbyn also needs to recognise that a Labour party wholly remade in his own doctrinaire image is one that does not appeal to huge number of Labour supporters who now feel as though they have no party to represent them. This will require the sort of open and conciliatory style of engagement that we have not seen from Corbyn. Indeed, he has had little incentive to develop it, having spent his parliamentary career in a political echo chamber on the activist fringe, rather than in the constructive sphere of parliamentary committees and frontbench responsibility.</p> <p>But the 172 MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/jeremy-corbyn-loses-labour-mps-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">who expressed no confidence in him</a> also need to learn the lessons of the last year, as many have acknowledged. They rightly see their responsibility to their 9&#xa0;million electors rather than a party membership that has changed beyond recognition in the last two years. But that cannot mean further attempts to depose Corbyn in coming months. They have much to reflect on; many have found themselves on a different side to their voters on the most fundamental question we have faced in recent decades, on Britain\u2019s EU membership. Moreover, trying to undermine Corbyn further will achieve little for their voters. This leadership contest galvanised Corbyn and his supporters, resulting in an even bigger gap between the party\u2019s membership and its voters. Any further attempts to undermine his leadership will be counterproductive as long as his opponents define themselves in opposition to Corbyn rather than in favour of something positive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-mark-ii-looks-like-a-leader-clear-coherent-vision\">Corbyn Mark II looks like a leader \u2013 he must set out a clear, coherent vision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So Labour MPs must hold off any manoeuvres against Corbyn. They have a responsibility to contribute to the business of opposition, whether from the shadow cabinet or select committees, and to do what they can to recruit members to broaden out the Labour church. MPs who disagree that Corbyn has the right ideas for the country must constructively work behind the scenes to develop a positive new Labour agenda. If both sides can shift approach, they may be able to reach a compromise that enables unified opposition in areas where there is broad agreement, such as grammar schools or greater investment in the NHS, but more pluralistic opposition in areas in which Corbyn cannot expect MPs to rally round his minority views, such as on defence, foreign policy and tax.</p> <p>This will hardly move Labour closer to government. But an uncomfortable truce seems, for now, the best that can be hoped for. If neither side is willing to compromise, then the mutual assured destruction of both seems most likely.</p>",

The problems with Corbyn\u2019s leadership aren\u2019t the invention of a hostile media. In my younger, redder days, I believed that qualities of \u201ccompetence\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d were some sort of elitist ploy, words invented by Tories to discredit any leftwing political project. It isn\u2019t just Corbyn\u2019s gaffe-strewn tenure that convinced me otherwise, but the collapse of John McDonnell\u2019s economic advisory committee.</p> <p>And yet, for all this, the anti-Corbyn opposition, \u201cthe 172\u201d \u2013 Labour MPs who voted they had no confidence in the party leader \u2013 have no positive alternative, least of all Owen Smith, a man who spends lonely nights worrying that his choice of coffee mug isn\u2019t proletarian enough.</p> <p>Broad swaths of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) failed to realise that the attempt to unseat Corbyn in the wake of the EU referendum felt like a direct attack on the membership. No one could reasonably expect the bulk of party members to rally around a candidate standing because the electorate couldn\u2019t be trusted to vote properly the first time. It gave members the feeling that the contest was one between rank-and-file and party elites; or youthful optimism and jaded cynicism. This only solidified pro-Corbyn opinion among potential waverers.</p> <p>So if you can\u2019t remove Corbyn through official channels, the only option left is to persuade members with reasoned discussion, right? Wrong, apparently. A better strategy is to wage a low-intensity war against anyone of vaguely leftish sympathies within the party. Re-tweeted the Greens? The procedures committee will show you the door. This sort of antagonism is proven electoral poison.</p> <p>As someone long on the left of the party, I would have been amenable to an alternative candidate who engaged with me on an intellectual level. The problem with this isn\u2019t that it hurts my feelings \u2013 nothing compared with the abuse decent MPs have received at the hands of some on the left \u2013 but that it exposes the intellectual poverty on the right of the party. I voted for Corbyn the first time round because I feared that Labour, and social democracy, faced an existential threat.</p> <p>Pasok, PSOE, Labour in Scotland: traditional socialist parties in Europe, shorn of their traditional support bases seemed vulnerable to populists on left and right. No one on the right of the party has properly addressed this, instead offering a rehashed vision of \u201997 .</p> <p>I felt Labour needed a way of tapping into popular anti-elitism with a progressive, socially just programme, rather than one that made weak, mug-based overtures to controlling immigration. With no one on the Labour right or left offering a credible alternative to Corbyn, the only choice we have is to cooperate, to find grounds for compromise with the bulk of the PLP, and to work for a Labour victory in 2020. I can\u2019t help but feel a twinge of sadness that this, the greatest opportunity for real political change in my lifetime, is all being squandered.</p> <p><em>Alex Hacillo is 24, and joined the Labour party in Liverpool in 2010</em></p> <h2>Isabel Hardman: stop all the bickering and start the long walk to power<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007/0_749_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opponents now have a long time to answer two big questions. The first is: how can they sign up centrist members who could oust Corbyn in another challenge, or after a 2020 election loss? They have twice boasted they wereable to do this before the 2015 and 2016 contests \u2013 and twice miserably failed.</p> <p>The party is becoming less and less attractive a prospect for anyone with a decent perspective on life and interesting hobbies to give up their spare time and money to attend vitriolic branch meetings. Indeed, it\u2019s not just a question of finding new members, but trying to stem the exodus of existing ones.</p> <p>The second question concerns how to heal the divide between centrists and soft left. Moderates are offended by the way Owen Smith and his soft left comrades have explicitly blamed the Blairites for the turmoil in the party, suggesting that things were fine until they started whingeing. Both sides need to put aside their personal gripes with one another, otherwise the walk back from the wilderness will take even longer as everyone bickers about the directions.</p> <p><em>Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator</em></p> <h2>Kerry-Anne Mendoza: it\u2019s time to end a toxic coup and resume the party\u2019s core mission<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3bea8c3c78021bdcf074d31ab7cc4d00a58ba1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3bea8c3c78021bdcf074d31ab7cc4d00a58ba1c/0_1637_3181_1909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry-anne Mendoza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Labour is having a moment of reckoning.

Our future outside the EU, our role as a member of the international community, the future of science and technology, building a sustainable and robust economy, creating fulfilling careers, supporting and empowering those with illnesses and disabilities, making education the foundation block of our society, being a fit and healthy society.</p> <p>Those are the issues that the Labour party could and should be addressing. Instead the rightwing of the party and their friends in the commentariat are attempting to exert their will on the rest using any and all means. This must end. Now.</p> <p>The country is crying out for the kind of vision and values that set a road map to a better future. It\u2019s time for this anti-democratic and toxic coup to end, and for Labour to return to its core mission: to lead a country that works for the many, not for the few.</p> <p><em>Kerry-Anne Mendoza is editor of the Canary</em></p> <h2>Tom Holland: the hard left has given us an unelectable husk of a party<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deb3f8c442771c120030fc5b05cee24c899fa18f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deb3f8c442771c120030fc5b05cee24c899fa18f/0_244_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Holland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Running into a pregnant <em>Glyptapanteles</em> wasp is rarely good news for a caterpillar. The wasp, after drilling an ovipositor into its hapless victim, will lay its eggs inside the caterpillar\u2019s body; the larvae, when they hatch, will then devour their host\u2019s bodily fluids. Taking great care not to damage its vital organs, they will also mind-control it, so that the caterpillar, even after the larvae have erupted through its exoskeleton, continues to defend them as they pupate. Eventually, the wasps hatch. The caterpillar, meanwhile, is left to die.</p> <p>Such is the fate that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election as leader seems to portend for the Labour party. The hard left faction that has seized control of Britain\u2019s main progressive party has every prospect now of devouring it inside out. That this is bad news for anyone who wants to see a Labour government goes without saying.</p> <p>Among the numerous reasons why the incompetent, incurious and pharisaical Corbyn will never be prime minister, the most copper-bottomed is surely this: that British voters will never elect as their leader a sympathiser with the IRA. Corbyn himself can blame this on false consciousness all he likes. If he genuinely cared about securing a Labour victory at the next election, he would have stood down long ago.</p> <p>The reason that he has not, I can only assume, is because - like the zealot he is - he believes in a higher cause. Bad for Labour, and bad for those who would best be served by a Labour government, Corbyn\u2019s re-election is bad as well for the very fabric of our parliamentary democracy.</p> <p><em>Tom Holland is a journalist and author</em></p> <h2>Eliza Filby: centrists should help themselves by taking a long look in the mirror<br></h2> <p>The one standout moment in this tiresome leadership campaign was when Owen Smith asked Jeremy Corbyn to name how many seats Labour would need to win back in order to form a majority government. Corbyn got the answer wrong. It was perhaps symptomatic of the fact that Corbyn may offer a genuine alternative to Labour members sick of centrism but he does not currently offer a credible alternative to the electorate. The British state is about to undergo its biggest overhaul since 1945; this requires an opposition that does not simply oppose but effectively scrutinises.</p> <p>In order to do this, Labour needs unity, ideas, organisation and competence; all of which this leadership is completely lacking. Corbyn now has three options: purge the party of dissenters, push for unity between MPs and party members, or alternatively try to find agreement on key issues (at least on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy). The first option seems depressingly likely, the second depressingly unlikely, and the third the most sensible. A separate Labour party in Scotland also presents problems as well as opportunities.</p> <p>So, what now for Labour centrists? They may choose to sit and wait for Corbyn to fail. But by then it might be too late and a split inevitable. Collaboration with Corbynistas might be too hard to stomach and impossible to maintain. One thing that centrists could do is stop blaming Corbyn for everything and take a long look in the mirror. The foundations of leftwing centrism have completely crumbled and fresh thinking is required.</p> <p>What should be at the forefront of their minds for both MPs and members is the future of the Labour voter. Ukip will redouble its efforts in Labour heartlands and, with the possible resurgence of the Lib Dems and the strength of the SNP, Labour MPs of all shades might find there is no longer a loyal electorate on which they can draw.</p> <p><em>Eliza Filby is the author of God and Mrs Thatcher</em></p> <h2>Neil Kinnock: do not desert the only party that can deliver social justice<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d390c6acb01b1cdc81aa448626ca8d7d198861f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d390c6acb01b1cdc81aa448626ca8d7d198861f/0_1694_3992_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Kinnock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Countless conversations in communities of all kinds in the past year tell me that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/im-taking-my-vote-elsewhere-if-corbyn-wins\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> columnist Barbara Ellen last week </a>spoke for many who react to the current Labour leadership, and some of its followership, with an intention to leave the party and even stop voting Labour.</p> <p>I plead with them to do neither. I urge them to understand that the only people pleased \u2013 and strengthened \u2013 by their departure would be those who provoked them, in despair and anguish, to go. I ask them not to give the Labour party to such people but to stay in the party and to keep on voting Labour. Despite the political tunnel vision and self-indulgence of the current leadership, Labour is still, to borrow Ellen\u2019s words, the \u201cpolitical entity conceived to provide parliamentary representation (and therefore protection) for the most overlooked and vulnerable people in society\u201d; it still needs broad support to secure elected power at local and national levels; it is still the only \u201cpolitical force\u201d that can credibly offer the social justice essential for a productive and equitable country.</p> <p>In a previous existential crisis \u2013 in the 1930s \u2013 the Labour party declared that \u201cthe victory of ideals must be organised\u201d. It is an abiding, inescapable truth. Many democratic socialists would, like me, appeal to all to stay, to organise, and to uphold the reality that only a Labour party that again makes a wide electoral appeal can feasibly earn the parliamentary power to combat the huge injustices and inefficiencies of gross and growing inequality, underinvestment and underperformance.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t an easy course.

How is it possible to do any kind of leftwing politics in a globalised world where governments are up against supranational forces beyond their control? President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Syriza are very different kinds of leftists, but both are the latest to discover that when it comes to fair taxes, ending austerity or tackling inequality, idealism and public support aren\u2019t enough.</p> <p>When tax rises were on the table in France, the French rich rapidly became the Belgian rich (or in Gerard Depardieu\u2019s case, the Russian rich). Greece\u2019s creditors met demands for less austerity by imposing more. Corporations everywhere treat tax demands and regulations as advisory only. We\u2019ve been hearing about globalisation, digitalisation and automation for decades, but the left still hasn\u2019t found a politics to match its challenges.</p> <p>With the leadership election now over, Labour should set about finding one, because if it doesn\u2019t this time there may be no way back for the party if voters in this country decide it hasn\u2019t got any answers.</p> <p><em>Dreda Say Mitchell is an award-winning crime novelist</em></p> <h2>Sue and Jennie: we\u2019re feeling despondent \u2013 and politically homeless<br></h2> <p>Between us we have 100 years on the electoral register, voting Labour every time.

  "<p>Trust \u2013 or rather, the absence of it \u2013 stands suddenly top of journalism\u2019s talking shop. Gallup in the US releases another of its annual polls that shows trust in the mass media \u201cto report the news fully, accurately and fairly\u201d has dropped to its lowest level in polling history \u2013 with only 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of such confidence.</p> <p>Those findings are down eight percentage points from last year. Compare and contrast a whopping 72% trust rating on parallel Gallups in 1972, opinions sampled directly after the Watergate heroics: different reputations, different times.</p> <p>And as for Britain, the ambitious director of the Impress regulation project has been setting out his stall recently. \u201cThe press is sitting on a trust timebomb,\u201d claims Jonathan Heawood. He cites Ipsos Mori results showing that a mere 25% of the UK public trust journalists to tell the truth \u2013 and he produces wider European research to reveal that we\u2019re flat bottom for reverence right across the continent. \u201cOnly 22% of the British public say they tend to trust the press, the lowest rating in Europe. 73%, nearly three-quarters of the public, say they tend not to trust the press, the worst trust rating by a long way \u2013 beyond Greece on 65%, and Serbia on 63%\u201d.</p> <p>Impress, naturally enough, doesn\u2019t let such disquieting perceptions lie. It contrasts newspapers\u2019 ratings\u2019 mire with the somewhat higher confidence levels that broadcasters enjoy. Why? Because they\u2019re monitored by Ofcom rules on evidence checks, fairness, balance and the rest \u2013 an underlying ring of confidence. And now, Heawood claims, the press and attendant websites can choose the same higher ground \u2013 by signing up for Impress regulation and displaying its \u201ctrust mark\u201d on their front pages.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not wander too far into the rivalry between Impress and the Independent Press Standards Organisation for custom post-Leveson charter protection (by one group that Ipsos Mori finds even less beloved: politicians). Simple issues can get very misty on that road. Trust itself, though, is an issue that can\u2019t be avoided.</p> <p>Does it matter? Of course it does \u2013 especially to many journalists. Trust is their obvious key to self-esteem. It says what they do is appreciated and respected. And there\u2019s some occasional evidence of reality here: see the swell of interest in serious newspaper sales and websites in moments of electoral or referendum crisis. But don\u2019t get carried away.</p> <p>Codes and kitemarks of purity are only a tiny piece of this equation. The same public opinion survey Impress commissioned and relies on begins by pointing out that regulation \u201cis not a particularly salient topic and there are generally low levels of engagement with the issue of press misconduct\u201d. Ipsos Mori, one bad news bearer, can\u2019t find room for post-Leveson reform in its list of the top 36 issues facing Britain.</p> <p>No, the problem doesn\u2019t start in newspaper offices or television studios. It\u2019s outside in the wider world. Last week, one major US poll reported that 44% of voters under 35 are choosing to vote for the Libertarian candidate, who hadn\u2019t heard about Aleppo, or the Green nominee. If Trump wins, in short, it will reflect millennial anger over and apathy towards Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Does that remind you of a Brexit result that saw too many young voters stay at home? Or the Brexit surge from voters who did turn out far below the metropolitan media radar? Has a notably antagonistic US posh press dished Trump\u2019s chances?</p> <p>More immediately this weekend, whatever happened to the stop-Corbyn surge in the press and on TV? You can unload many doubts over Labour and Momentum. You can run twin exposures back to back on two different TV channels. But, curiously, very little seems to bite.

Trust what Facebook and Google put on your plate. Trust the view of the world that most fits your needs. Trust what you see as \u201cyourself\u201d. No kitemark is going to offer a different sort of closure there.</p> <p>The whole concept of trust is changing. How do you deal with fairness and balance in an era of post-factual politics (except, like the <em>New York Times</em>, by finally gagging on too many lies and spreading \u201cTrump Gives Up a Lie But Refuses to Repent\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/images/2016/09/17/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf\" title=\"\">across page one</a>)?

  "<p>For one last time, the two candidates came on stage together after weeks of facing off at what often felt like interminable hustings. In a few minutes, only one would return; the other would be soon forgotten. But for the moment, Corbyn and Smith self-consciously joined arms and waved to the audience; a rare show of unity at the end of a fractious Labour leadership contest. </p> <p>Smith forced out the widest smile. Perhaps he was relieved it was all over and he wasn\u2019t going to lose as badly as he had once feared. Corbyn tried to keep his own reaction a little more dignified. Even when everyone else is taking your victory for granted, it\u2019s not a good look to do so yourself.

Smith briefly stood up to congratulate Corbyn and then sat down to contemplate what was left of his political career. </p> <p>The cameras panned to the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who looked utterly miserable. At least he remembered to go through the motions of clapping. If he\u2019d had his way, his seat would have been one of the many empty ones at the back of the hall.</p> <p>After giving his wife and the leading female MPs on Team Corbyn a kiss, the Labour leader went back on stage to make the acceptance speech he had kept in his back pocket for the last couple of months. \u201cThank you for giving me a second mandate in a year to lead our party,\u201d he began. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the volunteers who have worked on my behalf. And I would also like to thank Owen Smith\u2019s supporters.\u201d This came across as rather more double-edged than it was probably intended. While Corbyn had had tens of thousands of volunteers out mobilising support, Smith had struggled to round up more than half a dozen.</p> <p>\u201cI would also like to thank Owen Smith. We\u2019ve had some interesting and good-natured debates,\u201d he continued. This wasn\u2019t exactly the way anyone else remembered the debates, in which both men had repeatedly traded threats and insults, calling one another 50 shades of useless, but the victor always gets to rewrite history. </p> <p>Besides, Corbyn wanted to wipe the slate clean \u2013 though he was not yet ready to explain what steps he would take to do so \u2013 and to remind the party that there was more that united it than divided it. A cross-section of the facial expressions at the conference hall and the party celebrations that had just started a mile down the road at the Momentum event suggested this might be wishful thinking.</p> <p>As Corbyn moved off the internal divisions of the party and on to fighting the Tories, the atmosphere relaxed a little. Watson even managed a nervous half-smile. Sensing he now had the crowd behind him, Corbyn went on to give one of his most convincing speeches, talking about the need to fight against grammar schools, tackle child poverty and hold the government to account over its Brexit negotiations. If he had sounded quite so passionate at key moments earlier in the year, he might have avoided going through a second leadership election.</p> <p>\u201cWe can win the next general election,\u201d he concluded, unintentionally splitting the party he had just spent the last 10 minutes trying to unite. His supporters cheered. They believe they can and will win, if only the British people let slip their collective false consciousness. The moderates believe the opinion polls and reckon they are doomed to defeat while Corbyn is their leader.</p> <p>As the conference hall cleared, the BBC cut to the Labour MP Chuka Umunna back in Westminster. Why go to Liverpool where you\u2019re not wanted. Umunna talked about unity but his body language said the opposite. He couldn\u2019t even bring himself to endorse Corbyn as leader and indicated he had no intention of serving in a shadow cabinet \u2013 even if he was asked. The leadership election was over, but the divisions in the party remained. Same time next year?</p>",
  "<h2>For Donald Trump</h2> <p><strong>How can you be trusted with the nuclear codes?</strong></p> <p>A symbolic question, but one that goes to the heart of concerns about Trump\u2019s suitability for the job of commander-in-chief. He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-habitual-liar-presidential-debate\">Clinton: \u2018habitual liar\u2019 Trump must be curbed in presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?</strong></p> <p>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet.

A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?</strong></p> <p>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?</strong></p> <p>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own. What proof does Trump have that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d?</p> <h2><strong>Trump is doing well if\u2026</strong></h2> <p>\u2026 he can convince viewers at home that he is not crazy. This low bar for success is a big cause for concern among Democrats. Trump has come a long way despite erratic and unpleasant behaviour on a unprecedented scale in modern politics.

Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?</strong></p> <p>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/presidential-debate-preparation-trump-clinton\">Clinton and Trump's first presidential debate: will practice make perfect?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?</strong></p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?</strong></p> <p>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <h2>Clinton is doing well if\u2026</h2> <p>\u2026 Americans finish the debate with a clearer sense of what she stands for. Increasingly, the campaign has become defined by what it stands against \u2013 principally Donald Trump. While this is highly effective at motivating Democrats, it remains to be seen if this is enough to win over independent voters. Clinton needs to show them, not tell them, that she is on their side.</p>",

But he was a tough guy and he did well.\u201d</p> <p>Scalettar\u2019s guidance was overruled, however, because Nixon was eager to get back on the campaign trail. He said: \u201cMy advice was that he should postpone leaving the hospital. That was not to be. If this was a private patient and not a political situation, one could be very insistent on him not leaving the hospital. But I was just a lowly captain.\u201d</p> <p>Nixon\u2019s health continued to suffer and he arrived at the debate with a 102F fever. He refused to postpone the event. Scalettar said: \u201cHe was just not well. He lost 10lbs and his shoe size was too big. He was wan and pasty on TV. People who heard it on the radio thought Nixon won, because that\u2019s show business, right?\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy won one of the tightest elections in history by just over 100,000 votes and Scalettar, now clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University medical center, thinks Nixon\u2019s refusal to take his medical advice played a part. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching Clinton and Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad time in our lives.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Debates matter a lot and they really matter this year\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf477adacf022022c59c627fb5277bf6adfcff35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf477adacf022022c59c627fb5277bf6adfcff35/0_0_2048_1498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George W Bush and Al Gore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George W Bush and Al Gore in the last of their three debates, at Washington University in St Louis in October 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Mitchell/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert Shrum, an adviser to both Al Gore and John Kerry before their presidential debates, also believes this is a key moment. </p> <p>\u201cDebates have been good for the process,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re often substantive and I defend them. What would we do instead?\u201d </p> <p>Do debates affect the outcome of elections? The answer is mixed, according to Shrum. The 1960 debates were a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for Kennedy that \u201cbasically erased the experience argument\u201d. In 1976, Gerald Ford had been gaining on Jimmy Carter until he made a gaffe suggesting that Poland was free of Soviet influence and \u201cthe momentum was broken\u201d.</p> <p>But in 1980 and 1984, Ronald Reagan would have won anyway, Shrum believes, while \u201cin 1992, the debates were very important for Bill Clinton and he did a very good job\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The debates are the only faint hope that Trump can assure people that he is capable of being president</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Shrum</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shrum added that in 2000, focus groups initially thought Gore had beaten Bush, but the post-debate narrative focused on Gore sighing and \u201cinvading Bush\u2019s personal space\u201d.

He had a great mock debate and I knew he was dialled in. He was very focused and ready. He gave one of the best debate performances in modern history.\u201d</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, was widely seen as disappointing. Chen reflected: \u201cPart of it was that being president every day, you\u2019re not used to being told no. Part of it was that he underestimated Mitt.

Murphy was the reformist attorney general of the Whitlam government and was appointed to the high court in 1975 to replace Sir Douglas Menzies. </p> <p>Justice Roslyn Atkinson of the Queensland supreme court broadly set out the history of the Murphy affair <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/journals/QldJSchol/2008/51.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=%22cth%20consol_act%20pcoia1986456%22\">in a speech to a law dinner in 2008</a>. </p> <p>In November 1983, The National Times<em> </em>broke a story that federal and NSW police had commenced a crime intelligence operation against a Sydney solicitor in which they bugged the solicitor\u2019s phone. </p> <p>The National Times<em> </em>claimed that the conversations showed the solicitor and others were involved in fixing judicial proceedings and providing prostitutes to a senior judge.</p> <p>In February 1984, The Age<em> </em>published a front page story with the headline: \u201cSecret tapes of judge, lawyer\u201d, with the sub-heading \u201cSydney solicitor\u2019s phone was tapped\u201d. </p> <p>The article said that an unnamed judge was taped talking to the solicitor about judicial appointments, politicians and other matters. There was also a conversation between the solicitor and the Sydney crime figure Abe Saffron, in which the judge was described as \u201cthe trump\u201d. The provision of \u201cgirls\u201d to the judge was also discussed. </p> <p>In March 1984, Don Lane, a minister in the Bjelke Petersen government said in the Queensland parliament that the judge involved in the illegally taped conversations was Justice Lionel Murphy of the high court. The solicitor was Morgan Ryan. <br></p> <p>Later the chief magistrate of NSW Clarrie Briese and the district court judge Paul Flannery alleged that Murphy had improperly attempted to influence them in relation to charges faced by Ryan. </p> <p>These allegations were investigated by two Senate committees, which split on party lines, although a majority on the second committee found that Murphy\u2019s conduct might have amounted to \u201cproved misbehaviour\u201d. </p> <p>In January 1985, the Commonwealth director of public prosecutions charged Murphy with two attempts of perverting the course of justice in relation to the criminal proceedings against Ryan, who was facing a retrial on an alleged conspiracy to obtain permanent resident status for 22 Koreans with the use of forged documents.</p> <p>This was the first time criminal charges had been laid against a high court judge, and in April 1985 Murphy was committed for trial. The prosecutor was Ian Callinan QC, himself later to be appointed to the high court, with Tom Hughes QC acting on behalf of Murphy. </p> <p> Murphy was acquitted on the count relating to Flannery but convicted on the Briese charge. </p> <p>The facts before the court were that Murphy had told the chief magistrate he was concerned about the conspiracy case against Ryan. Briese later told the High Court judge that he had inquired the magistrate hearing the Ryan case and it was likely that the accused would be committed for trial. Murphy replied: \u201cThe little fellow will be shattered.\u201d </p> <p>Later there was a telephone conversation in which Murphy told Briese he had spoken to the NSW attorney general who was in support of legislation to make magistrates independent, rather than employees of the government. According to Briese, the judge then said to him, \u201cAnd now what about my little mate?\u201d </p> <p>Various questions of law about the charges and the trial went to the high court and some were sent back to the NSW court of criminal appeal, which quashed Murphy\u2019s conviction and sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered a retrial. </p> <p>Murphy was retried before Justice David Hunt and a jury in April 1986. Again he did not give sworn evidence but made a statement from the well of the court. On 28 April 1986, he was acquitted of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to Clarrie Briese. </p> <p>However, the matter did not rest there. The Stewart Royal Commission reported that the police tapes, the transcripts of which had been published by The Age<em>, </em>were genuine. There was a second confidential volume of the report by Justice Donald Stewart that allegedly contained more allegations against Murphy. </p> <p>In response to the judicial-political tempest that was adversely distracting the Hawke government, the cabinet agreed to create the parliamentary commission of inquiry, comprising three former judges, Sir George Lush, Sir Richard Blackburn and Andrew Wells QC. </p> <p>Murphy made an unsuccessful application to the high court seeking an injunction to stop the commission sitting on the ground that the legislation was invalid. </p> <p>In July 1986, Murphy knew he was terminally ill. He returned to the high court to sit, a move that was supported by the government, <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1986-08-20%2F0002;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;page=2;query=Dataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80%20Decade%3A%221980s%22%20Year%3A%221986%22;rec=4;resCount=Default\">which moved to end the work of the parliamentary commission, against opposition protests</a>.</p> <p>In August 1986, Murphy released a media statement that said that in his view, \u201cpurported allegations ... are either untrue or do not constitute misbehaviour\u201d. <br></p> <p>The presiding officers have authorised the clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives to access, after September 25, the commission\u2019s records. </p> <p>The office of Senator Stephen Parry, president of the Senate, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs there is a considerable volume of material that could be of a sensitive nature, the task of reviewing, advising and determining appropriate arrangements for access to the records will take some time.
