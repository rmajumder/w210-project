And playing politics with the supreme court isn\u2019t courage.\u201d</p> <p>The same Morning Call poll put Trump six points behind Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, one of the states he would probably need to win the White House on Tuesday.

The same period in 1908 was 0.42C <em>below</em> the average.</p> <p>So things have changed.</p> <p>Back in 1908 there was also a US presidential election. There were no debates then but, ironically, the same number of questions on climate change were asked in this year\u2019s debates as back then \u2013 zero.</p> <p>We now have the prospect of a US president who either believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, or at best believes it\u2019s just a hoax perpetrated by some vague group because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/the-candidates-on-climate-change/\">it\u2019s a money-making industry</a>\u201d.

No, he\u2019s not the gibbering fool; he is just the appeaser of those fools within his government. And that is no less damaging.</p> <p>It is not a strategy that can last, because while it might help to keep the issue off the political agenda, and keep his leadership somewhat more safe, the months keep passing and the temperature keeps rising.</p> <p>Because of its size, age and dirtiness, Hazelwood carries with it greater significance than do other coal-fired power stations.

  "<p>There is a rest area on the way into Young in southern New South Wales that has become a makeshift camp for backpackers waiting for the start of the Australian cherry-picking season.</p> <p>At this stage, the campers are young French backpackers, a German and a few Australians on their way somewhere else. The backpackers sleep in their cars, while coffee pots, cups and cereal bowls sit on a camp table. Helene Chaphuif, Brice Lancauchez, Charlotte Loiseau and Romain Quiru are killing time because the cherries are about 10 days late this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe were here last year so we came back because it is pretty good money for picking cherries,\u201d said Chaphuif. \u201cWe can earn A$250 a day [about \u00a3150] for a very big day from 5.30am to 2pm.

We were paid A$30-40 for 500kg of fruit. You do a bin in three hours \u2013 so you get about A$20 for three hours. No good. That\u2019s why we come for the cherries.\u201d</p> <p>The group will have been in Australia for two years next March, having qualified for a second year of working holiday visa after working for 88 days on the farms. . They know about the government\u2019s plans to increase the income tax on young working holidaymakers from 13% to 19% as it is the talk of the fruit trail, all over social media.</p> <p>\u201cIt is affecting people, they are really aware of it,\u201d said Joanne Johnson, who runs a temporary recruitment agency in Young. \u201cWe had a lot of French backpackers last year who were angry about the plan. Now they are telling friends to go to New Zealand instead.\u201d</p> <p>The issue is red hot because the National Farmers\u2019 Federation (NFF) estimates young backpackers make up 25% of Australia\u2019s agricultural workforce \u2013 for seasonal harvest jobs, like cherry picking, growers say it is much higher.

In a world where every backpacker has a smartphone and is on social media, news of the proposed new tax has travelled like a bush fire. At a senate inquiry into the bill, forced by Labor and the minor parties, the NFF estimated a fall in applications for farm work of between 40% and 90% since the tax increase was proposed..</p> <p>Minor party senator Nick Xenophon said that in his home state of South Australia, tourist operators in the Riverland had struggled to fill backpacker hostels which were fully booked last year. \u201cThat is going to be pretty catastrophic for the bush, for the regions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The president of the NFF, Brent Finlay, told the committee of a mango farm he visited near Humpty Doo in the Northern Territory. \u201cThe mango farmers left 15% of their crop on their trees last year because they did not have enough labour,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThey were planning to plant another 40,000 trees \u2013 they have the water and they have the infrastructure \u2013 to double the size of their farm, and they won\u2019t go ahead with that work because they know they cannot get a labour force at the current rate.</p> <p>\u201cI have spoken to that farm a number of times this season, and their mango season [began] at the start of August \u2026 They are significantly down [in workers] again this year.\u201d</p> <p>In Tasmania, Australia\u2019s southern-most state, Howard Hansen of Hansen Orchards and Timothy Reid of Reid Fruits are two of the biggest fruit growers and the biggest employers of backpackers in the state.</p> <p>Reid\u2019s company has invested more than A$30m in the business in the past 20 years. In the last financial year, he completed 817 tax statements for employees at the end of the season and 65% were backpackers.</p> <p>\u201cAll of that has been based on the availability of labour in what is a very labour-intensive industry,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe are heavily reliant on backpackers. We have a policy of employing locals first, but there are simply not enough local people, particularly in that peak period when we require harvest.</p> <p>\u201cWe have over 600 people on our farm during harvest. Again, around 65% of them are backpackers. The locals are really good but without the backpackers we do not have a hope.\u201d Hansen said that more than 35% of a payroll worth A$6.5m to A$7m last year went to travellers on working holiday visas. He said the tax plan also threatens the jobs of the Australians who make up the remainder of the workers.</p> <p>\u201cFor more than 25 years, we have used the itinerant labour supply as the spike of labour we need to help harvest the crops,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIf we cannot harvest the crop, we won\u2019t have a crop to pack for the rest of the year, so we will not need as many Australians. We will not need to maintain orchards; we will not need to prune them; we will not need to make the capital investment. It is not just the jobs of the itinerant people that are at risk; it is the Australians as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/backpacker-tax-restores-balance-local-workforce-sussan-ley-qanda\">Backpacker tax restores 'balance' with local workforce, Sussan Ley tells Q&amp;A</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson\u2019s agency placed 300 people with local growers last year but she is unsure how many will arrive this time. And if the tax does go ahead, it will require a change mid-harvest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the [backpackers] that have already started and have done their tax declarations? Do we get a new tax declaration now to override the others as they continue picking?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe ones flying in and out should be charged the tax rate but the ones that are staying here, that are earning the money to spend on their trip, they will pay their accommodation, get their food and drinks and the money goes back into the community.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the backpackers in Young insist the higher tax plan would not have changed their own travel decisions. \u201cIt would still be better than it is in France,\u201d Chaphuif says. \u201cYes, it not as good as it was but it is still better than in France and it\u2019s easy to get a job.

But there is a feeling among many workers that their lives have become bleaker as high inflation erodes household incomes, while companies fared better thanks to state support and a weak rouble.</p> <p>This squeeze on the working classes has not manifested itself in the kind of new populist movements seen in EU countries. Russia expert Charles Movit at consultancy IHS Economics says: \u201cThe media is totally controlled by the state in Russia and the tradition of strong leaders is ingrained.

  "<p>The decline of traditional US industries has formed the backdrop to Donald Trump\u2019s central pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. It has also energised the support of a former mainstay of the Democrat vote, the white working class. Five key sectors in particular have suffered since their heydays in the previous century.</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h2> <p>Fewer than one in 10 Americans work in manufacturing, compared to one in four in 1960. While Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) is often blamed for shipping American manufacturing jobs south of the border to Mexico, the number of employees in manufacturing actually increased in the US after it was enacted in 1994. But economists argue that China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 has had the biggest impact on American manufacturing jobs by flooding the US with cheap imports that have knocked out homemade goods.</p> <h2><strong>Coal mining</strong><br></h2> <p>Coal has had an ill-fated recent history in the US, as momentum has grown around a push for renewable energy. Employment peaked in the 1920s, when almost half a million people worked in the coal mines. But those jobs were shed over the ensuing decades as improvements in technology made mines more efficient. Nevertheless, US coal production had grown continuously up until its peak in 2008. Since then, production has dropped as the government has steadily phased out more coal energy plants in favour of renewable power such as wind and solar.</p> <h2><strong>Steel</strong></h2> <p>The US industry has collapsed due to competition from cheap overseas steel. Production of American steel peaked in the 1970s, and its decline was accelerated by the 2008 financial crisis. The situation has been made worse by the slowdown of the oil industry \u2013 a heavy user of steel. Automation has been a key driver of job losses, however.</p> <h2><strong>Textiles</strong></h2> <p>America used to make a lot of its own clothes, but the signing of trade deals and much cheaper labour costs overseas have led to the majority of clothing companies sending production offshore. In the 1960s, approximately 95% of clothing worn in the US was made domestically, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association. Now, 97% of clothing and 98% of shoes sold in the US are made overseas. The trend is set to continue, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks clothing, leather, and allied manufacturing as the most rapidly declining industry in the US. The bureau forecast the industry to decline by -5.9% between 2014 and 2024.</p> <h2><strong>Cars</strong></h2> <p>America was the world\u2019s leading automotive manufacturer in the early 1900s, when technology created the era of mass production. Annual sales of American cars peaked in 1978 at 12.9m but declined to 7m in 1982, as Japan usurped the US as the world\u2019s leading car producer. Car sales were also hit in the 2000s by a sustained increase in petrol prices. This left General Motors and Chrysler poorly positioned to handle the recession in 2008 and needing an $85bn (\u00a368bn) government bailout. Since 2010, the American automotive industry has rebounded, adding jobs consistently.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to correct the byline.

So, surely, engaging an architectural practice south of the border to oversee the project would be politic?</p> <p>That\u2019s the thinking behind the Mexican architectural practice Estudio 314\u2019s proposal, which offers a distinctly Latin take on the Republican wall. A team of seven interns working under 314\u2019s creative director, Leonardo D\u00edaz Borioli and Hassanaly Ladha from the American experimental design lab the Mamertine Group, reimagined the border proposal in the spirit of the great 20th-century Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.</p> <p>Barrag\u00e1n, who won the Pritzker prize in 1980 and died in 1988 at the age of 86, was known for combining simple, modernist designs with lyrical, spiritual flourishes, employing bright pinks, as well as other startling pastel shades, in his otherwise restrained works.</p> <p>Estudio 314\u2019s rendering adopts a Barrag\u00e1n colour scheme with an equally faithful lack of ornament, though the studio has a little fun with other features in this imaginative, uncommissioned proposal. This wall also encloses \u201ca prison where 11 million undocumented people will be processed, classified, indoctrinated, and/or deported\u201d, the studio explains, making reference to Trump\u2019s immigration plans. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb776a82142d8945230c01e3e9aa686e123ebd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb776a82142d8945230c01e3e9aa686e123ebd6/0_333_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior view of the house and studio of Mexican architec Luis Barragan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior view of the house and studio of the Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At other points, the wall could also accommodate a shopping mall, or even an observation terrace, where would-be migrants might look upon, but not touch, the Land of the Free.</p> <p>Of course the architectural practice, which is based in Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s birthplace of Guadalajara, does not sincerely believe its pink wall will break ground anytime soon. Instead, 314, which is more used to working on hospitality and public-park commissions, hopes its proposal will \u201callow the public to imagine the policy proposal in all of its gorgeous perversity\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-links-mexico-border-wall-plan-to-israels-successful-separation-barrier\">Donald Trump links Mexico border wall plan to Israel's 'successful' separation barrier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBecause the wall has to be beautiful, it has been inspired by Luis Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s pink walls that are emblematic of Mexico,\u201d says 314, adding: \u201cIt also takes advantage of the tradition in architecture of megalomaniac wall building.\u201d</p> <p>Well, quite. And while Barrag\u00e1n may have approved of the pigmentation and the clean lines, there\u2019s very little else likely to endear the scheme to the late Pritzker laureate, including the flamboyantly haired client north of the border and his swingeing terms of payment.</p> <p>As the architecture critic Jonathan Glancey put it in a 2001 article, Barrag\u00e1n was a generous man. \u201cWhen he was asked to rebuild and extend a convent in Tlalpan not far from his own home, he paid for the extra work needed to give the resident nuns a special design far and above what they had expected. The result was a sensual, spiritual place influenced by the Court of the Myrtles at the Alhambra.\u201d</p> <p>It seems unlikely that, in years to come, anyone will be choosing similar words to describe this wall or its chief commissioner, no matter what the colour.</p>",

  "<p><strong></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong>The US is the closest it\u2019s ever been to breaking the 240-year male stronghold on the presidency.

But there is a case to be made that the first woman to get this close to the presidency would probably look a lot like Clinton: a nationally recognizable figure with an extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and close proximity to power.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a saying, the first into battle needs to wear the most armor,\u201d said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.barbaraleefoundation.org/\">Barbara Lee Family Foundation</a>, which studies women running for executive office.</p> <p>She continued: \u201cBecause women have higher and harder barriers to clear the path to executive office, the women that win need to exceed expectations \u2013 so by comparison they tend to be more qualified than their opponents.\u201d</p> <p>A 2011 <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00512.x/abstract\">study</a> identified what the researchers called the \u201cJackie (and Jill) Robinson effect\u201d, a reference to the first African American player in Major League Baseball.

The most common route to the US presidency is through the Senate or a governor\u2019s mansion, which greatly narrows the pool of prospective female candidates, since there are currently only 20 women serving in the 100-strong US Senate, 84 congresswomen (19%) and six female governors.</p> <p>Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 1987, has spent a lot of time over the last 18 months thinking about what has changed for women since she first entered Congress in 1973.<br></p> <p>\u201cSexism is a lot harder to pinpoint than it was but it\u2019s clearly still there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When Schroeder first arrived in Congress she faced questions from her male colleagues about how she managed to raise two small children while being a lawmaker.

Sob. What place for regular TV lolz in 2016, when nobody can afford anything, all our heroes have perished and the world is on fire? Good news! The modern US comedy is here to help, offering an escape from our misery into someone else\u2019s. Louie planted the seed, Girls squatted down and watered it, and now these downbeat half-hours are everywhere, following their own rules about how depressing and uneventful comedy can be. And here we have another peak for the form with the tragic and hilarious, loose and often plain weird Atlanta, which finally airs in the UK this week.</p> <p>Showrunner and star Donald Glover \u2013 AKA <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fwcj8NhL1I\">Troy the expressive nerd in Community</a> \u2013 is Earn, a late-20s loser in the Georgia suburbs. Earn is smart but his millennial non-job in sales doesn\u2019t cover his rent. Van (Zazie Beetz), the mother of his child, only lets him stay with her out of sexual convenience and pity. When Earn\u2019s cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry) achieves local notoriety rapping under the name Paper Boi, Earn spots an opportunity: he\u2019ll be Alfred\u2019s manager. It\u2019s a role that turns out to be akin to managing someone else\u2019s farts with a net.</p> <p>The United States is thousands of little places, and the best of this new generation of micro-coms have a unique sense of location. Glover, who\u2019s from the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, shows us dark, still streets with none of the dangerous energy of the inner city. This is the slower death of the outskirts. On the upside, such areas have space for eccentrics and absurdity. You know that feeling when you\u2019re cradling your sleeping daughter on a night bus, and the man opposite insists you share his sandwich, and you don\u2019t because, although you\u2019ve failed at life, you\u2019ve not yet hit the level of being fed by bus randoms; but then he vanishes, and perhaps wasn\u2019t there in the first place? No? In Atlanta, woozy vignettes like this feel more natural than punchlines.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0_U8ca4040\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R0_U8ca4040?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But blasts of violence underline that young, black America is on a precipice. Take Earn at the police station, waiting to be bailed and trying not to provoke the screw-ups all around him: edgy farce briefly becomes unbearably sharp when a white cop brutalises a mentally ill suspect. The moment would feel groundbreaking in a drama; being able to swerve into racial politics and back out into comedy \u2013 there follows a silly scene where two people in the seats either side of Earn have an intimate chat as if he isn\u2019t there \u2013 it\u2019s even more remarkable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/21/golden-age-black-tv-false-dawn-david-simon\">Is this a golden age for black TV makers or another false dawn?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Glover has rejected claims made for his shattering of moulds and capturing of zeitgeists, and Atlanta does have some traditional sitcom bones. Earn is the sane man in the room, forever peering with tired incredulity at buffoons, mainly Alfred\u2019s hanger-on mate Darius (Keith Stanfield), a classic comedy savant full of stoner wisdom, such as his theory that Malcolm X is alive because \u2013 hey \u2013 since the funeral, nobody\u2019s seen his body! (Earn: \u201cThat\u2019s how funerals work.\u201d)</p> <p>Having fame as his goal gives Earn an endless supply of idiots to cry-laugh at. Like a negative image of Entourage where nothing has gone right instead of everything, the boys drift on the edge of the music scene, bumping into pomposity and corruption whenever they go in. Alfred is already jaded at being even slightly famous, annoyed by his fans and aware that his tough alter ego is a construct. In this world, it\u2019s probably not worth all the bullshit an artist has to cut through to remain authentic. With voices like Glover\u2019s speaking clearly, though, 21st-century sitcom is managing. Let\u2019s cling to that.</p> <p><em>Atlanta airs Saturday, 10pm, Fox</em></p>",

Then, such words sparked much controversy \u2013 particularly among suburban women. On Friday, they were showcased by one of the most popular entertainers in the world.</p> <p>The potential for Clinton to make history on 8 November was a dominant theme at the concert, which featured not only Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 but also Chance the Rapper, J Cole and Big Sean.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here to celebrate our next and first woman president in the history of the United States of America,\u201d said Chance the Rapper, whose legal name is Chancellor Bennett.</p> <p>Between songs, Beyonc\u00e9, the only woman to perform, grew ever more personal. \u201cThere was a time when a woman\u2019s opinion did not matter,\u201d she said. \u201cLess than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote.</p> <p>\u201cLook how far we\u2019ve come, from having no voice to being on the brink of making history. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country, and know that her possibilities are limitless. And that is why I\u2019m with her.\u201d</p> <p>Blue Ivy, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z\u2019s daughter, was backstage, drawing. The power couple met Clinton there, discussing a bitter campaign season, an aide said.</p> <p>By the time Clinton appeared, the audience was in a state of euphoria. She kept her remarks short.</p> <p>She implored the crowd to vote, giving out a number they could text for information and a website that would inform them of the nearest polling station. With the election days away, there was little else to say. Clinton reminded the crowd, which was mostly African American, of issues such as criminal justice reform. She would represent the entire nation, she said, not just a privileged few.</p> <p>It was Clinton\u2019s third public event on a day that included stops in four states. Beginning in Westchester, New York, where the former secretary of state prefers to stay in her Chappaqua home, she visited the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. In the early hours of Saturday, she landed in Miami, where she was set to hold a rally on Saturday.</p> <p>Clinton was delivering her closing argument not just in swing states where the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has proven competitive, but also in states where she has held a consistent advantage. As she has often remarked on the campaign trail, she is taking nothing for granted in a race even she has said should have her ahead by 50 points.</p> <p>Disbelief that Trump remains a formidable opponent was a prevalent theme on one of the final days of her second bid for the presidency. In Pittsburgh, she was accompanied by the billionaire Mark Cuban, who took pointed shots at Trump\u2019s wealth while asking the crowd at Heinz Field, home to the Steelers of the NFL, how they could possibly believe the Republican nominee was a messiah for the working class.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"111072c940a10541c49219b2c11ef4c078dc2bfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111072c940a10541c49219b2c11ef4c078dc2bfe/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9 performs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9 performs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDo you think he has the temperament to do the right thing?\u201d Cuban asked his hometown crowd. \u201cDo you think he has the fortitude to do the right thing?

  "<p>After the incredulity, the despair, and then the cautious return to optimism, the presidential campaign has entered a phase of almost intolerable anxiety. National polls that don\u2019t signify much are instantly interpreted as omens of the apocalypse; tiny anecdotes about early voting figures induce heart-stopping panic, or get clung to like life-rafts, depending on the direction in which they point.

(She thinks Trump\u2019s hardcore supporters, meanwhile, are in the grip of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8193053\">\u201ctraumatic bonding\u201d</a>, as with Stockholm syndrome \u2013 an emotional dependence forged through abuse.) </p> <p>This is a kind of psychological entanglement with national and international news that most of us, most of the time, are spared; but the Trump candidacy has removed the possibility of such distance. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network reported a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/10/donald_trump_is_a_human_trigger.html\">33% increase in calls</a> to its support hotline during the weekend following the release of Trump\u2019s notorious Access Hollywood tape.</p> <h2>Armchair diagnosis: dos and don\u2019ts</h2> <p>Alongside its psychological impact on the rest of us, the campaign has also felt distinctive \u2013 and distinctively disturbing \u2013 in the ways that Trump\u2019s own psychology has come to dominate it. </p> <p>While Hillary Clinton\u2019s inner life remains largely mysterious, information about Trump\u2019s insecurities leaks from his every public statement \u2013 even before the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/politics/donald-trump-interviews.html\">obtained tapes</a> of interviews with a biographer in which Trump\u2019s morbid fear of public humiliation was made plain. His former ghostwriter, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">Tony Schwartz</a>, has pointed out how Trump\u2019s attacks on others aren\u2019t random, but constitute a precise inventory of his own faults: \u201cunstable\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d, \u201cbigoted\u201d, \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d, exhausted and prone to lying. </p> <p>As Sheena Monnin, the former Miss Pennsylvania sued by Trump after she criticized his Miss USA pageant, put it in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/10/25/former-miss-pennsylvania-sheena-monnin-intv-sued-by-trump-sot-cooper.cnn\">an interview</a> with CNN: \u201cI have a degree in psychology, and I understand that underneath the bullying tactics, there\u2019s usually a lot of emptiness, and a strong need to feed the ego.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-alt=\"{&quot;chart&quot;:&quot;trump&quot;}\"> </figure>  <p>Trump told his biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio: \u201cI don\u2019t like to analyse myself, because I might not like what I see.\u201d But the rest of us haven\u2019t had much choice. Like a traffic pile-up, the candidate\u2019s involuntary self-exposure has been impossible not to gawp at. (On that note, the October APA survey found that the election was having a significant negative impact on productivity.)</p> <p>Yet throughout this intensely psychological election, psychology professionals have been restrained by a widespread, though fragmenting, consensus that Trump\u2019s mental health ought not to be discussed at all. </p> <p>This stance is most clearly expressed in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s so-called <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/psychiatrists-cant-tell-us-what-they-think-about-trump/\">Goldwater rule</a> \u2013 the prohibition on diagnosis-at-a-distance introduced following the incident in 1964 when 1,100 psychiatrists told a news magazine they believed that Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president, was unfit for office. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2016/08/the-goldwater-rule\">finger-wagging statement</a> released in August (\u201cThe Goldwater rule: why breaking it is unethical and irresponsible\u201d), the APA\u2019s president, Maria Oquendo, reaffirmed the ban. But while there are certainly strong arguments in favour of it \u2013 it risks undermining public confidence in psychiatrists, and stigmatising people with mental illness \u2013 it\u2019s been far from obvious, in 2016, that these outweigh the ethical arguments for flouting it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/12/12447742/diagnosing-trump-sham-psychology\">Writing in Vox</a>, the psychologist Cedar Riener compared psychiatrists disregarding the rule to a doctor diagnosing cancer \u201cjust by looking at my behaviour or public statements\u201d. But in the case of psychological disorders, unlike physical illnesses, behaviour and speech are always the primary sources of diagnostic data. And it has often seemed as if we might have more direct access to the darkest recesses of Trump\u2019s mind than to some of our closest friends.</p> <p>\u201cLike many Americans, I was more amused than alarmed by Trump at the beginning,\u201d says <a href=\"http://dohertyrelationshipinstitute.com/\">Bill Doherty</a>, a marriage and family therapist from Minnesota. But as the Trump movement picked up steam, Doherty happened to be travelling in Austria, where he encountered a neo-fascist political demonstration and visited a concentration camp. \u201cSo I did some reading about the responses of mental health professionals in Germany and Austria in the 1930s, and they were largely silent, and some were complicit.\u201d </p> <p>Upon his return, he wrote a manifesto \u2013 <a href=\"http://citizentherapists.com/\">Citizen Therapists Against Trumpism</a> \u2013 which more than 3,300 of his colleagues have now signed. Doherty insists this doesn\u2019t violate the Goldwater rule \u2013 he\u2019s condemning Trumpism as a threat to public health, not diagnosing Trump as, say, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/22/is-donald-trump-a-textbook-narcissist/\">narcissist</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/trump-and-sociopathy/491966/\">sociopath</a>, the disorders most frequently attributed to him. </p> <p>As \u201ccitizen therapists\u201d, Doherty says, \u201cwe must be willing to speak out on issues that affect the mental health of our clients, instead of just sitting in our offices and dealing with the fallout.\u201d </p> <p>Trump-induced distress is especially acute, he says, for anyone who has been exposed to a personality style like his \u2013 focused on bullying, scapegoating and the kneejerk demeaning of critics \u2013 earlier in their personal lives. His status as a presidential candidate \u201cbrings legitimacy to his way of relating to other people. There have always been personalities like Trump, but his power and the hundreds of people at his rallies say to anyone who has any psychological vulnerability that, yes, their fears were legitimate, and that there\u2019s no accountability for anyone who says and does these things. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened in their lives: there\u2019s been no accountability for the people who harmed them.\u201d</p> <h2>Daddy issues: \u2018a fantasy of being rescued by a powerful father figure\u2019</h2> <p>Beyond the confines of therapy, the rise of Trump has demonstrated more broadly how bad we are at understanding politics in psychological terms. For months, an <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/15/12462760/trump-resentment-economic-anxiety\">almost entirely futile debate</a> between pundits has sought to establish whether Trump\u2019s supporters are motivated by economic anxiety or by racism, as if the two could be neatly distinguished and measured. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-alt=\"{&quot;chart&quot;:&quot;clinton&quot;}\"> </figure>  <p>For Jonathan Shedler, professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado school of medicine, his appeal is better understood through the lens of \u201ctransference\u201d: in times of stress, whatever the complex blend of causes for that stress, people revert to a childhood desire for an omnipotent protector \u2013 an understandable need in young children, but dysfunctional in adulthood. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is benefiting from a childlike fantasy of being rescued by an all-powerful, larger-than-life father figure, so all of these qualities get attributed to Trump,\u201d he says. If the candidate\u2019s serially outrageous behaviour fails to alienate them, that\u2019s at least partly because the appealing qualities they\u2019re seeing aren\u2019t really in him; instead, \u201cthey\u2019re in the minds of the people who are doing the attributing, expressing their not-quite-conscious yearnings.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the question of whether Trump himself is suffering from a personality disorder is beside the point, Shedler argues \u2013 the consequence of trying to force our thinking about personality into a \u201cmedical model\u201d in which narcissism or antisocial attitudes, like cancer, are discrete diseases, invading an otherwise healthy body. But Trump\u2019s narcissism, insecurities and viciousness are intrinsic components of who he is, and they\u2019ve already damaged the world\u2019s wellbeing \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re best thought of as formal disorders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/voters-experiences-us-2016-election-trump-clinton-campaign\">Pain, anger and fear: US voters deprived of a serious presidential election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a rally in Henderson, Nevada, earlier this month, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-waste-time-money-energy-if-lose-229206\">told supporters</a>: \u201cIf I don\u2019t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime, by a factor of 100.\u201d</p> <p>It was a fairly typical statement from Trump, in its profound self-absorption and total lack of interest in the impact of his victory or defeat on the country he proposes to lead.

A rule that covers the dependent children of insured workers up to the age of 26, touted as a boon for parents of college kids, has also led to the coverage of many of her workers\u2019 adult offspring even though they are not in school. If those legal adults don\u2019t have their own coverage, they turn to their parents\u2019 insurance. The average number of dependents on War Fab\u2019s insurance in 2012 was 2.2; in 2016 it is almost 4.9, and some of the ensuing costs have had to be passed on to workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\" data-alt=\"unemployment chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\">unemployment chart</a> </figure>  <p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to dig its way out of the last recession with record low interest rates has also hurt War Fab.

The perpetual fog of American forgetting-gas had done its work. If two years are all it took to erase the memory of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, then we shouldn\u2019t hope for much awareness of that earlier crisis some 80 years ago, though there are a few old heads still around who lived it, and the experience of those times can be found readily enough in the archives and histories of the era. </p> <p>The country, to put it mildly, was different back then. Life was harder, and in places like the Texas hinterland \u2013 which today forms the big beating heart of the state\u2019s Republican base \u2013 it was a close approximation of 14th-century European peasant hell. The vast majority of rural Texans lived without electric power, which meant no refrigeration, no water pumps, no indoor plumbing, no furnaces, no electric stoves, no incandescent lights, no motors to power machines for milking or shearing. </p> <p> Even for those of us only one or two generations removed from the farm, it\u2019s almost impossible to conceive just how different life was, although the phrase \u201cnasty, brutish, and short\u201d comes to mind. Among the best guides to that time is \u201cThe Sad Irons\u201d chapter of The Path to Power, the first volume of Robert Caro\u2019s biography of Lyndon Johnson, which delivers a harrowing portrait of life as a medieval slog plunked down in the middle of 20th-century America. To take just one aspect of the slog: water. \u201cPacking water\u201d from the source \u2013 a stream or a well \u2013 to the house was a daily beatdown that often fell to the farm wife. As Caro writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A federal study of nearly half a million farm families \u2026 would show that, on the average, a person living on a farm used 40 gallons of water every day. Since the average farm family was five persons, the family used 200 gallons, or four-fifths of a ton, of water each day \u2013 73,000 gallons, or almost 300 tons, in a year. The study showed that, on the average, the well was located 253 feet from the house \u2013 and that to pump by hand and carry to the house 73,000 gallons of water a year would require someone to put in during that year 63 eight-hour days, and walk 1,750 miles.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/donald-trump-endless-war-memorial-day\">Endless war: Trump and the fantasy of cost-free conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Laundry was done outside, an all-day, muscle-intensive process that began with a huge vat of boiling water suspended over a roaring fire \u2013 imagine that on a July day in Texas \u2013 next to which someone \u2013 almost always the farm wife \u2013 would stand \u201cpunching\u201d clothes with a paddle or broomstick, the human equivalent of an automatic washing machine. Cooking was done with wood stoves, which were kept burning most of the day \u2013 summer and winter \u2013 for meals and baking, which in turn required constant tending \u2013 firewood in, ashes out. Because of the lack of refrigeration, most meals had to be prepared from scratch. In order not to starve in winter, a family had to can fruit and vegetables in summer, a hellishly hot process that went on for days and required the utmost precision. The wood stoves were also used to heat irons for pressing clothes, actual six- or seven-pound slabs of iron that had to be scrubbed, sanded, and scraped every few minutes to remove the soot. Farm wives dreaded the tedium of ironing day; hence, \u201cthe sad irons\u201d. Caro goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> A Hill Country farm wife had to do her chores even if she was ill \u2013 no matter how ill. Because Hill Country women were too poor to afford proper medical care they often suffered perineal tears in childbirth. During the 1930s, the federal government sent physicians to examine a sampling of Hill Country women. The doctors found that, out of 275 women, 158 had perineal tears. Many of them, the team of gynecologists reported, were third-degree tears, \u201ctears so bad that it is difficult to see how they stand on their feet.\u201d But they were standing on their feet, and doing all the chores that Hill Country wives had always done \u2013 hauling the water, hauling the wood, canning, washing, ironing, helping with the shearing, the plowing and the picking.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because there was no electricity. </p> <p>This state of affairs wasn\u2019t limited to Texas. In the early 1930s, more than six million of America\u2019s 6.8m farms were without electricity. From sundown to sunup these farmers and their families practically lived in the dark. Most kerosene lamps provided 25 watts of light at best, barely sufficient for reading, and they were dirty, difficult to use, and dangerous. Many farmers preferred to do their pre-dawn chores in the dark rather than risk having a kerosene lamp in the barn. Radio, of course, was out of the question. The news and entertainment available to urban America were effectively blacked out in rural areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/nra-annual-meeting-guns-american-dream-hunter-s-thompson\">Fear, loathing and firearms: sensory overload inside the NRA's Mall of Death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then the Great Depression transformed what was an extremely hard life into an impossible one. With prices for crops, in real terms, falling below what they\u2019d been in colonial times, financial disaster began to overwhelm rural America. By the end of 1931, 20,000 farms a month were being foreclosed, with even greater numbers on the horizon. Farmers\u2019 pleas for relief \u2013 among them, a moratorium on foreclosures \u2013 were rejected by President Hoover, who in effect told America to quit whining and go chew on its moral fiber. Hoover seemed ignorant of a basic fact of human nature: people tend not to be models of obedience when they\u2019re starving to death. \u201cThey had put their faith in government,\u201d as one contemporary reporter said of the farmers, \u201cand government had failed \u2026 they reached a point where they could stand the strain no longer and moved toward open rebellion.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019re not likely to find this episode of American history in the school books. In Iowa, the Farmers\u2019 Holiday Association organized a strike in which farmers refused to bring food to market for 30 days. The strike soon spread to the Dakotas, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and beyond. Roads were picketed, then blockaded to enforce the strike. Telephone operators coordinated with striking farmers to warn them when soldiers or lawmen were headed their way. When 60 strikers were arrested in Council Bluffs, Iowa, a thousand farmers marched on the jail and forced their release. Four thousand men occupied the Lincoln, Nebraska, statehouse, and another 7,000 marched on the statehouse in Columbus, Ohio with the intention of establishing a \u201cworkers\u2019 and farmers\u2019 republic\u201d. Across the midwest, farmers began to band together in armed groups to stop foreclosures; lawyers and judges were threatened with hanging, stripped and beaten, and in at least one case, murdered. \u201cRebellion in the Cornbelt: American Farmers Beat Their Ploughshares Into Swords\u201d was the title of a December 1932 article in Harper\u2019s that described the farmers\u2019 increasing desperation and militancy.</p> <p> The cities were no calmer. Five thousand men took over the Municipal Building in Seattle. Thousands of unpaid teachers in Chicago mobbed the city\u2019s banks, and in New York, a Communist party rally in Union Square drew 35,000. Twenty-five thousand \u201cBonus Marchers\u201d\u2013 first world war veterans \u2013 occupied Washington, setting up camp with their families on the Mall; Hoover had them routed by US soldiers using teargas and fixed bayonets. Campaigning for re-election that fall, the president was greeted by snarling crowds and chants of \u201cHang Hoover!\u201d A gridlocked Congress dithered and bickered, inspiring one columnist to label it, \u201cThe Monkey House\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>To scholars it\u2019s known as \u201cthe mixed economy\u201d, the combination of dynamic free markets, effective government, and a strong labor movement that characterizes the world\u2019s most prosperous nations. Strict laissez-faire capitalism created extraordinary wealth in late 19th- and early 20th-century America. It also created extraordinary concentrations of economic and political power that threatened to undermine democracy, along with such virulent side-effects as frequent bank panics, wild vacillations of boom and bust, extreme social and income inequality, and monopoly control of major industries. The Gilded Age robber barons \u2013 the Goulds, the Vanderbilts, the Morgans and Rockefellers \u2013 did quite well under laissez-faire. Most of the rest of Americans were still stuck in the ditch, with little to no economic security, life expectancy of roughly 45 years and horrific infant mortality rates that claimed 300 babies per 1,000 in the cities.</p> <p>Recognition was growing that the extraordinary pressures of industrial capitalism required an updating of the social contract. Theodore Roosevelt acknowledged as much when he said in 1910, \u201cThe citizens of the United States must effectively control the mighty commercial forces which they have called into being.\u201d But it took the leadership of another Roosevelt, Franklin, along with the existential crisis of the Great Depression, to galvanize the political will that brought about this transition from laissez-faire capitalism to the mixed economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"192e81140b75f24c218da8eafa7176b4180f01c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/192e81140b75f24c218da8eafa7176b4180f01c1/0_0_2966_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural fresco titled The New Deal, at the Leonardo Da Vinci art school in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"979\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural fresco titled The New Deal, at the Leonardo Da Vinci art school in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt gave it a name, the New Deal, and it transformed American life so thoroughly that it\u2019s become invisible to us, as taken for granted as the air we breathe and the ground beneath our feet. Or as, for instance: electricity. As Caro shows in The Path to Power<em>,</em> 30 million farmers and their families lived in the preindustrial dark not because of technological obstacles \u2013 many lived within sight of power lines \u2013 or prohibitive cost to the utility company \u2013 plenty of farmers offered to pay the expense of running a line out to their homes \u2013 or that utility companies couldn\u2019t make a profit on rural lines \u2013 studies in Minnesota and Alabama showed that rural lines were profitable \u2013 but because rural electric service wouldn\u2019t be as profitable for utility companies as the urban market. The companies based their decision, as companies do, on capital risk and rate of return. Considerations of fairness, fellow feeling, or the greater social good simply didn\u2019t factor into the corporate calculus.</p> <p>This is known among economists as \u201cmarket failure\u201d. Sam Rayburn, the Texas congressman who led the legislative fight to bring electricity to rural America, stated it plainly during debate on the House floor: \u201cWhen free enterprise had the opportunity to electrify farm homes \u2013 after 50 years, they had electrified 3%.\u201d The Public Utilities Act of 1935 and the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 \u2013 crucial New Deal legislation \u2013 \u201cbrought the lights\u201d to rural America over the strenuous opposition of the utility lobby, which put out fake \u201cspontaneous\u201d mass mailings to members of Congress (one of the first instances of astroturfing in American politics) and pushed a whisper campaign alleging that President Roosevelt was insane. John Carpenter, president of Texas Power &amp; Light \u2013 there\u2019s a freeway named after him in Dallas \u2013 so loathed Sam Rayburn that he offered to spend any amount of money to defeat him in the next election. Rayburn won. The lights went on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/republican-party-donald-trump-madman-in-his-castle\">Donald Trump: the madman in his castle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another example: banks. When Roosevelt took office, the banking industry was in freefall, a \u201cmarket failure\u201d that threatened to finish off what was left of the US economy. The system of government support and regulation established by the New Deal over banks \u2013 deposit insurance, capital requirements, the Glass-Steagall Act (separating commercial and investment banks) \u2013 and over the financial industry in general \u2013 such as the Securities Act of 1933, AKA the \u201cTruth-in-Securities Act\u201d, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (if you think Wall Street is a rigged game these days, it\u2019s a seminary compared with the fraud-fest of the Roaring Twenties) \u2013 made bank panics and market crashes a thing of the past. From the mid-1930s into the early 1980s, the US financial industry enjoyed remarkable stability. Bank failures were rare, isolated events. The bipolar booms and busts of laissez-faire capitalism became the much more manageable phenomenon of the business cycle. This began to change with deregulation, starting with the bipartisan overhaul of the savings and loan industry in the early 1980s. \u201cAll in all, I think we hit the jackpot,\u201d said President Reagan as he signed the Garn-St Germain Act into law. Not quite. Within a few short years, there was no savings and loan industry, thanks to the frenzy of speculation and self-dealing that followed passage of Garn-St Germain. The biggest bank crisis since the Great Depression had erased an entire sector of American finance, leaving the American taxpayer on the hook for $160bn \u2013 a huge amount of money at the time, chump change compared with what was coming. The New Deal framework continued to be dismantled through the 1990s \u2013 Glass-Steagall bit the dust in 1998 \u2013 and, just as importantly, regulation was never extended to new markets in financial exotica like credit default swaps and derivatives. Banking and finance grew increasingly volatile, culminating (so far?) in the Great Recession of 2008, when only massive government intervention saved the economy.</p> <p>The air we breathe. The ground beneath our feet. New Deal initiatives produced much of the infrastructure that we rely on to this day, the roads, waterways, airports, bridges, sewers and water mains, courthouses, libraries and communications networks. The omnibus Farm Relief Act of 1933 saved and stabilized American agriculture, and began establishing the institutions that would make farming an economically feasible way of life for future generations. The national framework of social insurance \u2013 social security, unemployment and disability benefits, work programs and workers\u2019 compensation \u2013 protected citizens from the kinds of risks that private markets couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t insure. The final piece of the mixed economy got its due with the Wagner Act (1935), which established the rights of workers to unionize and bargain collectively with employers, helping to ensure that rising productivity would be reflected in rising wages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e323c5894e50f07ed060f0d13ddc2cf8fa99452a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e323c5894e50f07ed060f0d13ddc2cf8fa99452a/0_77_3498_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Works Progress Administration (WPA) crew rebuilding the Morris Canal in New Jersey.

Fred Koch, the multimillionaire father of the future multibillionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, had this to say in 1938: \u201cthe only sound countries in the world are Germany, Italy, and Japan.\u201d He found Germany to be a heartening counter-example to Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal: \u201cWhen you contrast the state of mind of Germany today [1938] with what it was in 1925, you begin to think that perhaps this course of idleness, feeding at the public trough, dependence on government, etc, with which we are afflicted is not permanent and can be overcome.\u201d</p> <p>The comparison is instructive. Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in January 1933. Five weeks later, Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as US president. Two leaders, both taking office at the same time, both faced with the economic and social chaos of the Great Depression. To say that they took vastly different approaches, with correspondingly divergent outcomes, would be an understatement on the order of a piano falling on your head. History shows that Fred Koch was about as wrong as a human being can be, and Nazi Germany is only the half of it. By every measure \u2013 life expectancy, infant mortality, income, education, productivity, corporate profits, scientific and technological innovation \u2013 the mixed economy ushered in by the New Deal was a huge success. Within a generation, the United States was enjoying the fastest sustained growth in recorded history, and, moreover, the prosperity was shared broadly, with income rising faster at the bottom and middle of society than at the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/american-politics-election-voters-suckers\">The phony in American politics: how voters turn into suckers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the 1950s, there was broad consensus in America that the mixed economy was \u201can established and useful reality\u201d, to borrow a phrase from a Roosevelt-era president of the US Chamber of Commerce (he was referring to collective bargaining).

Such was the political consensus that his legislation initiating the interstate highway system passed Congress with one dissenting vote in the Senate, and by voice vote in the House. In private, he mocked the arch-conservatives who dreamed of dismantling the New Deal. \u201cThere is a tiny splinter group \u2026 that believes you can do such things,\u201d he wrote in a letter to his brother Edgar. \u201cAmong them are HL Hunt \u2026 a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas.

Around 2009, 2010, around the time we were crawling out from under the wreckage of 2008 and saw that the Wall Street crowd had come through just fine, thank you, that seems to be when a critical mass of the American population began to realize that, hey, we were missing something; that maybe our well was running dry. People were angry. We had good reason to be. We saw great prosperity at the top, scant trickle-down toward the bottom. In Texas, and especially in rural Texas \u2013 where, by the way, electricity and access to electronic media have been settled facts of life for years \u2013 the Tea Party rose with a mighty roar to rage against liberals, the government and the newly elected Democratic president.</p> <p>If that rage seems somewhat misdirected, here\u2019s an explanation: 40 years of well-funded, highly organized laissez-faire proselytizing and government-bashing have done a number on the American mind. The country got conned by a profound ideological shift, starting in the early 1970s as hardcore free-market, anti-government advocates launched a concerted effort to change the political landscape. Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson\u2019s recent book American Amnesia ably tells the story, from the business elite who funded the movement (Charles and David Koch prominent among them), to the conservative thinktanks that developed the ideology, to the political actors who machined it into policy. The movement\u2019s shock troops included tough-talking ideologues like Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d Ayn Rand, author of romance novels for business moguls, became a movement icon with her depictions of rugged capitalist heroes taking on wimpy liberals and overbearing governments. One of Rand\u2019s inner circle, Alan Greenspan, would serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank from 1988 to 2006, where he presided over the broad deregulation of the financial system. (Later he would profess \u201cshocked disbelief\u201d at the meltdown of 2008, and allow that he\u2019d \u201cfound a flaw\u201d in his Randian ideology.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5432a911d1ac9d6db2ea7cd263401d0e5e5b0399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5432a911d1ac9d6db2ea7cd263401d0e5e5b0399/0_151_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in Zuccotti Park to voice and discuss their frustration with the economy and Wall Street in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators in New York voice their frustration with the economy and Wall Street in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KeystoneUSA-Zum/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A very narrow slice of America \u2013 the 1% \u2013 reaped spectacular wealth from this political sea change. When Forbes magazine published its first annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans in 1982, there were two billionaires on the roster, and the entire 400 had a combined net worth of $225bn in today\u2019s dollars. By 2014, 113 billionaires were left off the list because they didn\u2019t make they cut ($1.55bn); the combined net worth of the Forbes class of 2014 was $2.3tn. Meanwhile, earnings for working- and middle-class Americans stagnated even as we worked more hours, took fewer vacations and kept increasing our productivity. These days it\u2019s not uncommon for hedge fund managers to make $1bn a year. CEOs routinely pull in annual compensation in the tens of millions of dollars. Even assuming these people are very good at what they do, you have to wonder: is anyone really that good?</p> <p>According to them, yes. What\u2019s more, they\u2019re liable to tell you they did it all themselves. Sanford Weill, Citigroup\u2019s former chairman who clocked $785m over a five-year period, declared, \u201cWe didn\u2019t rely on somebody else to build what we built.\u201d A few years later, Citigroup would be rescued by the government to the tune of $476bn in cash and guarantees. More recently, tech venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya asserted, \u201cIf companies shut down, the stock market would collapse. If the government shuts down, nothing happens, and we all move on, because it just doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Granted, a thriving mixed economy depends on individual initiative, innovation and risk-taking. But it also depends on the institutions and social structures that only well-functioning governance can provide, such as: laws, both civil and criminal. Private property rights. Secure and enforceable contracts, copyrights and patents. Stable banks. Well-regulated international commerce, including treaties, trade agreements, secure borders and customs controls. \u201cI can guarantee that if you don\u2019t have a legal structure you will not have innovation,\u201d said Jim Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, in a 2015 article in Wired. \u201cInstead you will have chaos \u2026 every innovator survives on the oxygen of multiple regulatory systems.\u201d</p> <p>The wealth that results from private enterprise is very much a social construct. President Obama famously overstated the case when he said in 2012, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business \u2013 you didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain\u2019s ideological twin to Ronald Reagan, equally overstated the case with her famous pronouncement, \u201cThere is no such thing as society.\u201d The truth is it takes both, and there\u2019s no readier example than the cellphone most of us are never without. In American Amnesia we find the story of Dr Vannevar Bush, FDR\u2019s science czar during the second world war, and how Bush, at Roosevelt\u2019s urging and with strong bipartisan support from Congress, set the path for America\u2019s huge postwar spending on research and development in science, technology, and medicine. As Hacker and Pierson write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fruits of these investments ranged from radar and GPS, to advanced medical technology, to robotics and the computing systems that figure in nearly every modern technology. Far from crowding out private R&amp;D, moreover, these public investments spurred additional private innovation. The computer pioneers who developed better and smaller systems not only relied on publicly fostered breakthroughs in technology; they also would have found little market for their most profitable products if not for the internet, GPS, and other government-sponsored platforms for the digital revolution.</p> </blockquote> <p>If, as the authors of American Amnesia point out, you crack open that smartphone, you\u2019ll find that every component is the product of research that the US government either funded or carried out directly: lithium-ion batteries, GPS, cellular technology, touch-screen and LCDs, internet connectivity, algorithmic applications. The internet itself is a government creation; the Department of Defense developed its precursor, the Arpanet, in order to connect with computing centers at major universities. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f846fac98238750248115eecdd4d9a31ae31b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f846fac98238750248115eecdd4d9a31ae31b3/0_0_4458_2675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The smartphone: a triumph of US government investment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The smartphone: a triumph of US government investment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">American exceptionalism: the great game and the noble way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So we can only stand amazed at the Olympian chutzpah of Silicon Valley billionaires when they talk about creating libertarian utopias that will transcend government. Venture capitalist Tim Draper has proposed making Silicon Valley its own semi-autonomous state. Google\u2019s Larry Page wants to construct a \u201cGoogle Island\u201d where tech research can proceed free of government meddling. PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel, whose fortune was built not just on the internet but through helpful government regulation (such as the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s rule limiting losses on identity theft; how many of us would put our credit card information on the internet if the downside was losing everything we own?) is a prime mover of the Seasteading Institute, dedicated to the creation of manmade island nations beyond the reach of government.</p> <p>When faced with this sort of nonsense, one can\u2019t help but think of the little boy who declares independence from his family, and runs away as far as the tree house in his backyard. The worldview of Thiel and company is about as juvenile as that, a kind of nerdy romanticism that recalls the capitalist fantasies of Ayn Rand. If not for the collective (Randians break out in hives when they encounter that word) efforts of American society, the industry in which tech moguls have so fantastically prospered wouldn\u2019t exist. But it\u2019s even more basic than that. The development and widespread availability of vaccines and antibiotics following the second world war are due in large part to initiatives carried out by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Agriculture, and other government agencies. Longevity, quality of life \u2013 like wealth creation, these are social constructs. But it\u2019s even more basic than modern medicine, and reaches back before the New Deal, to some of the very first initiatives of progressive government. The sharp improvement in mortality that began in the early years of the 20th century was largely the result of many more children surviving into adulthood. The cause was simple, though it took huge investments by government to make happen: cities began to clean up their water supplies. Filtration. Chlorination. Basic stuff we take for granted. If a good many of us are alive today, breathing and walking and talking and in some cases making a career out of raging against the government, it\u2019s because our great-granddaddy didn\u2019t die from cholera or typhoid way back in the day.</p> <p>The air we breathe.

By virtually every measure relative to other rich nations, the US has lost ground since the 1970s. We\u2019re shorter (height is an excellent indicator of social conditions), we don\u2019t live as long, more of our babies die before their first birthdays, wages and educational achievement have stagnated, and inequalities of wealth and opportunity are higher than at any time since the late 19th century. Mortality rates for middle-aged white Americans have actually risen the past 15 years, especially for non-college-educated whites. Maternal mortality rose 27% nationwide between 2000 and 2014. In Texas, the maternal mortality rate doubled between 2010 and 2014.</p> <p>The very rich, of course, can buy what they need \u2013 healthcare, clean water, political clout. They have their walled compounds and private islands to retreat to. As for the rest of us \u2013 for instance, all the good citizens out there in rural Texas, Tea Party Texas, the hard country that was transformed by the New Deal \u2013 one tries to imagine how it might look in 70 or 80 years if current trends continue. Crumbling roads, jerry-rigged bridges, worn-out farms. A grudging, \u201cmarket-based\u201d energy grid. Clean water a rarity, and healthcare that\u2019s hit and miss. Perineal tears, perhaps, are once again commonplace. A far-fetched scenario, surely, but no harder for us to imagine in 2016 than the lived reality of rural Texas 80 years ago.</p>",

The spread of laws requiring voters to show ID at the polls, restrictions on early voting times, and poll location closures are all designed to disadvantage racial minorities who tend to vote for Democrats, advocates say. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/21/alabama-voter-id-law-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/588gq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2820959\"            data-video-name=\"The new civil rights march: resisting Alabama\u2019s photo ID law \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5807c0bbe4b0cd26ff71ed84\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161019voteridfinalpluto2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161019voteridfinalpluto2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161019voteridfinalpluto2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/21/alabama-voter-id-law-video\">The new civil rights march: resisting Alabama\u2019s photo ID law</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The NAACP filed a new lawsuit against North Carolina this week alleging that black voters were being disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-voter-suppression-campaign-north-carolina-florida\">purged from the state\u2019s voter rolls</a>. \u201cThis sounds like something that was put together in 1901,\u201d a federal judge said at an emergency hearing, calling the purging process \u201cinsane\u201d.<br></p> <p>The judge issued an order Friday finding that the purge likely violated the National Voter Registration Act, and ordered that state elections officials \u201ctake all steps necessary to restore the voter registrations that were canceled.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated, unprecedented claims that the election has already been \u201crigged\u201d against him have given new fuel to conservative claims that non-citizens are voting and that votes are being stolen on a massive scale.

In Arizona, more than 1,000 local Republicans have signed up to be poll watchers, a fivefold increase since the last presidential election, state party spokesman Tim Sifert said, though it\u2019s not clear how many will actually show up. </p> <p>In Fort Worth, Texas, the county Republican party office has been fielding calls from supporters about poll watching, and they now have enough volunteers to put a Republican in some role in all of the county\u2019s 346 voting locations, county chairman Tim O\u2019Hare said. The number of Republican volunteers in previous years was \u201cnot even close\u201d, he said. \u201cIn any modern time, we\u2019ve never had somebody at every spot.\u201d</p> <p>In Virginia, Reagan George, a voter fraud prevention advocate who leads Republican poll watcher training sessions, said: \u201cFrom what I\u2019m gathering from the people I\u2019ve made contact with, they\u2019ve probably trained more people with this election than they have in 30 years.\u201d The state party did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In Pennsylvania, where Trump has repeatedly made wild allegations of voter fraud, a state GOP spokeswoman said they had measured \u201ca small uptick\u201d in poll watcher registration since 2012. Local Republican officials in other battleground states downplayed the issue, with an Ohio Trump campaign spokesman saying the campaign would monitor voting activities \u201cas candidates from both parties in Ohio have done in every recent statewide and presidential election\u201d, and a Republican party spokeswoman from Michigan saying there was \u201cnothing different\u201d about poll watching this election cycle. </p> <p>The Republican National Committee is still being monitored by a federal judge over past alleged intimidation of minority voters. In 1981, the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers wearing \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d arm bands to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods. Under a federal consent decree, the RNC is still banned from participating in any \u201cballot security\u201d programs \u201caimed at preventing voter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>The Democratic National Committee has been battling in court this week to prove that the RNC has violated this ban. In legal filings, lawyers for the RNC said it has nothing to do with Trump\u2019s proposed poll watching efforts and that it is abiding by its consent decree. It slammed what it called the Democrats\u2019 \u201ctabloid litigation tactics\u201d.</p> <p>While small-scale voter fraud has been documented, there is simply no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud or \u201celection theft\u201d, as others describe it. The Bush administration\u2019s own crackdown against the practice, led by the former attorney general Gonzales and lasting five years, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/us/how-charges-of-voter-fraud-became-a-political-strategy.html?_r=0\">resulted in just 86 convictions by 2007</a>, many of which were for minor infractions such as completing multiple voter registration forms.

The ruling has also weakened the Department of Justice\u2019s authority and resources to monitor local polling places. The DoJ will still send \u201chundreds\u201d of monitors across the country and work \u201ccooperatively\u201d with local jurisdictions to \u201ckeep an eye on the proceedings\u201d, Vanita Gupta, the head of the department\u2019s civil rights division, told the Guardian in a statement.</p> <p>Some voters have already reported tense interactions at the polls during early voting. Alyssa Day, a New York Times-bestselling author who lives in Florida, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssa_day/status/793083990076952576?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">she watched</a> an older white man scream insults at a young black woman inside a polling place on Monday in St Johns County. \u201cHe started yelling, \u2018She\u2019s a racist, she\u2019s a racist,\u201d and she was trying to explain he had said something offensive to her in the parking lot and she told him, basically, \u2018Leave me alone,\u2019\u201d Day told the Guardian. Inside the polling place, she said the man was shouting: \u201cI\u2019m going to sue you.\u201d</p> <p>The man appeared to be just another voter, not a poll watcher or affiliated with a campaign, Day said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy at the polling place quickly intervened, Day said, and the young woman was able to vote. But Day offered to walk the woman back to her car afterwards, she said. \u201cShe was shaken. I was very shaken,\u201d Day said. \u201cI think this election year has been so incredibly divisive, and that\u2019s carrying right into the polling places.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jason Wilson contributed reporting. </em></p>",
  "<p>It is autumn in Stars Hollow. There is a chill in the air and the gazebo in the town\u2019s central square is decorated with pumpkins, porcelain pigs and cockerels that nestle among haystacks and horns of plenty. On one side of the square stands the white clapboard steepled church; across the way is the traditional, red-brick school building. The bookshop, diner and grocers are framed by wrought iron gaslights, all adorned by golden leaf wreaths and decorative ears of corn.</p> <p>This place, which has come to mean so much to me, is the epitome of festive New England. I may have grown up in suburban Manchester, England, but it feels like home. In my mind, I\u2019ve escaped here so many times, and now here I am, drinking in a town as picturesque as a film set \u2013 which is exactly what it is, on the Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank, Los Angeles. Stars Hollow, the fictional home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/24/gilmore-girls-new-episodes-netflix-reboot\">Gilmore Girls</a>, the noughties TV series about a mother and daughter, is a quiet, eccentric town where nothing bad happens. Unlike the big television dramas of recent years (The Fall, The Bridge, The Missing) there are no murders; no one is kidnapped or abused. Instead the show follows the life of Lorelai Gilmore, who got pregnant at 16 and ran away from her wealthy, overbearing parents, and Rory, her daughter and closest friend, who is turning 16 as the story begins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I first watched Gilmore Girls around the same time I first saw my mum cry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is sunny and safe here. There is no dramatic music to make you uncomfortable, only the beat of a soft snare to signify oncoming drama. When a character is upset, it is usually because a town meeting, held in Miss Patty\u2019s dance studio, has not gone their way, or because someone they love failed to show up. When there are tears, they are warranted.</p> <p>It\u2019s all grounded in the community of the town. Stars Hollow is to Gilmore Girls what New York is to Sex And The City \u2013 just with more fairy lights and (much) less fellatio. The drama is played out in episodes that can feel surreal verging on the ridiculous (a town dance marathon, a cat\u2019s wake, an all-night civil war re-enactment in the snow). Now, nine years after it ended, the show is back for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGNNSmGDpU\">four feature-length episodes</a> \u2013 and it still feels different from anything else on TV. Sure, we have the pastel-hued utopia that is The Great British Bake Off, and Strictly Come Dancing with its feel-good factor, but that\u2019s reality TV. Drama-wise, there is nothing quite like the comfort of Stars Hollow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c65ebaef4ddc0c07b881bef7d46aba9bf7f3948b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c65ebaef4ddc0c07b881bef7d46aba9bf7f3948b/108_161_2565_1539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madeleine Albright and Alexis Bledel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madeleine Albright and Alexis Bledel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Br/Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first watched Gilmore Girls around the same time I first saw my mum cry. I was 21, newly returned to Manchester after a year spent studying at an American university, and I was, as my mum would say, \u201cfull of it\u201d: overflowing with excitement and not shutting up. She was driving and I was in the passenger seat; I had just picked up a set of photographs of the best year of my life, and was using them as visual prompts to enthuse about the friends I had made, the places I had been, the ludicrous frat parties I had gone to. Mum was silent for the most part, until she burst into tears. I was dumbstruck. There is nothing more terrifying than seeing the strongest person you know overcome by sadness. Eventually she said, \u201cI am just so jealous\u201d, words I could never have imagined she would say.</p> <p>The last 12 months had been markedly different for her. My father, after a bumpy few years, had finally been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s that winter. I had cried confused, angry tears and swiftly gone into denial, easily achieved when you are living 5,000 miles away and readily distracted by weekends on the beach, southern Californian boys and jello shots. Mum, on the other hand, had been on the frontline, trying to cope as her husband of 25 years deteriorated into a frustrated, aggressive shadow of his former self. She was emotionally battered and I had failed to notice. We had always been so close and yet here we were, in a car on the way home from Snappy Snaps, canyons apart. I didn\u2019t know what to say and feared I never would. I was already losing my father; I couldn\u2019t cope with losing my mother, too.</p> <p>To say Gilmore Girls was our salvation might sound nonsensical but, looking back, it was (especially when accompanied by crisps and wine). My mum was very different from Lorelai (she isn\u2019t 16 years older than me for a start). And if I was a bit like Rory, in the sense that I always cared a lot about school, my hair has never been that shiny. Our home in Cheadle, with its John Lewis and TGI Fridays, was no Stars Hollow, where <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/FeliciaFitzpatrick/13-stars-hollow-town-events-wed-like-to-participa-jbnr?utm_term=.dx56YXGoy#.jidRNqkvp\">every season is marked by some kind of elaborate festive jamboree</a> (a hay maze for spring, a carnival for the end of summer). But the show spoke to us because of that deep bond between mother and daughter.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792371/\">Amy Sherman-Palladino</a>, Gilmore Girls\u2019 creator and writer, thinks her show would never get commissioned today. \u201cNot in a million years. Wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d she tells me. \u201cNot unless the mother and daughter could fly or solve crimes.\u201d She was a writer on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/03/roseanne-your-next-box-set\">Roseanne</a> before she was asked to pitch her own show to the Warner Brothers network. \u201cI had come into this meeting with a bunch of hungry executives \u2013 it was just before lunch \u2013 with a lot of extensive, thought-out pitches that were making them yawn and think about their laundry. At the last minute, I said, \u2018Well, there is this thing I haven\u2019t really worked out yet, but I always liked the concept of a mother and daughter being friends more than they are mother and daughter.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Great, that\u2019s it, let\u2019s lunch.\u2019\u201d On the way out, she confessed to her manager that she hadn\u2019t really thought this through; he told her to \u201cgo figure it out\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92a8a35369f4eaf4785bca0c295fc0b2febb9cda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a8a35369f4eaf4785bca0c295fc0b2febb9cda/0_222_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore and Alexis Bledel as her daughter, Rory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore and Alexis Bledel as her daughter, Rory, who is just 16 years her junior, in an episode from season two in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo:The WB/Ron Batzdorff</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That weekend, Sherman-Palladino happened to be visiting Connecticut with her husband (and collaborator), Dan. They had never been before, and were thoroughly charmed. \u201cIt was autumn, and there were pumpkin patches and beautiful people who were driving by asking, \u2018Excuse me, which way to the hayride?\u2019 And we were like, \u2018Are you kidding me? Who lives like this?\u2019\u201d She figured that this was exactly the sort of place a smart 16-year-old deciding to raise a child on her own would settle \u2013 \u201csome place safe, where everyone is going to keep an eye on me and my kid\u201d. By the end of the weekend, the show had fallen into place.</p> <p>Gilmore Girls first aired in 2000 and managed to hold its own in the same time slot as that little-known sitcom, Friends. As the series progressed, it became a hit, attracting fans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/georgelucas\">George Lucas</a>, who was somewhat starstruck when he visited the set with his daughter \u2013 \u201cHe sat there for like two hours talking about how great it feels to be in Stars Hollow,\u201d Dan Palladino tells me. But it never really took off in the UK in the same way \u2013 when I mention it now, people often think I am banging on about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/feb/28/my-favourite-tv-show-the-golden-girls\">The Golden Girls</a>; it wasn\u2019t until 2006 that I sat down to watch a box set of the first season with my mum.</p> <p>We were enchanted. Here were two quick-witted women who spoke a mile a minute \u2013 the show is famous for its fast-paced dialogue, which is all Sherman-Palladino (at one point, there was <a href=\"http://moveablefest.com/moveable_fest/2012/06/amy-sherman-palladino-interview-gilmoregirls.html\">a rumour circulating on the internet</a> that she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a>, writing under a pseudonym, because a woman couldn\u2019t possibly be that sharp). The Gilmores loved books, films, magazines, fashion and making each other laugh. Their verbal sparring was littered with <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/gilmore-girls-pop-culture-references-by-the-numbers.html\">cultural references</a> from high (Lorelai points out that the cold makes people do odd things: \u201cHey, did anyone ever think that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\">Sylvia Plath</a> wasn\u2019t crazy, she was just cold?\u201d) to low (Rory on her mother\u2019s turn in a charity fashion show: \u201cMy mom\u2019s a model.

Sherman-Palladino kept the schmaltz, or what she calls \u201ctreacle matter\u201d, to a minimum: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a lot of \u2018I love you\u2019 or hugging because I feel the love was shown through the way people treated each other.\u201d</p> <p>Rory, played by a fresh-faced <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088127/\">Alexis Bledel</a> in her first acting gig, was a smart, funny, serious teenager. I had never seen a character so concerned about homework not cast as the typical nerd before. I realised Rory was different 10 minutes into the pilot. She is sitting in class, quietly working on an essay about Huckleberry Finn, seemingly unaware of the \u201ccool\u201d girls mocking her for getting on with her assignment while they paint their nails. The camera zooms in on her, she looks up briefly and smiles to herself, unperturbed. Here was a character who got off on doing well in school and hanging out with her mum. My schooldays were well behind me, but I could definitely relate.</p> <p>Over the next two years, my mum and I watched all seven seasons together. Dan Palladino tells me we are far from the only mother and daughter to connect with Gilmore Girls in this way. \u201cWe got tons telling us they watched it together, sometimes because they are really close, but also those who didn\u2019t have much in common and found they both liked it.\u201d Nor were we the only ones who used it as a means of escape. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many times we\u2019ve heard from people whose mothers were going through something like cancer, and the daughter would bring the shows over to watch,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum and I would spend 45 minutes in Stars Hollow and everything would feel a little better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is how it was for us. When things got tough, one of us would ask, \u201cShall we do a Lorelai?\u201d and pop an episode on. My dad would recognise the Warner Brothers music, familiar to him from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-west-wing\">West Wing</a>-watching days, and get confused when he heard the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdd7REkQoCU\">Carole King Where You Lead theme tune</a>, as opposed to the stirring drum roll of The West Wing. He\u2019d take himself off to another part of the house to sit by himself and stare into space. After helplessly watching him leave the room, Mum and I would spend 45 minutes in Stars Hollow and everything would feel a little better; it was the televisual equivalent of a large glass of wine after a hard day. I didn\u2019t know how to protect my mother, and we didn\u2019t know how to discuss emotions because we\u2019d never really had to: we had always been so happy. All we could do was sit and watch a TV programme about a rock-solid relationship and hope that the same applied to us.</p> <p>When it first aired, Gilmore Girls was refreshing television. While Sherman-Palladino didn\u2019t set out to break ground, exactly, she was aware of the climate in which she was writing. \u201cWomen at the time, in TV, were split into two groups: there was the popular pretty girl, or the angry girl who wore combat boots. As the cries of \u2018make women stronger\u2019 came out, all they did was take the same pretty woman and put a gun in her hand and have her run around in heels. The concept of strong women is still, and was especially then, a terrifying concept to a lot of the networks, because they were afraid that that\u2019s not how people want to see women. But it is how women wanted to see women.\u201d</p> <p>Of course there are love interests and heartache, but they are never front and centre. Rory\u2019s dream is to go to Harvard and work for a major daily newspaper (\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many women tell me they wanted to go to an Ivy League college because of the show,\u201d says Bledel, whose eyes are as ludicrously blue in real life as they are on screen). She hero-worships CNN reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/15/christiane-amanpour-interview\">Christiane Amanpour</a>, who makes a cameo appearance, as do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/madeleine-albright-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton\">Madeleine Albright</a>, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/10178/\">Norman Mailer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\">Sonic Youth</a> and Carole King (as Sophie, who owns the music shop). Lorelai dreams of opening her own inn with her best friend, played by the then little-known Melissa McCarthy, and (spoiler alert) ends up doing exactly that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f99d899cf298a43469873fcab28ea5be6e63aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f99d899cf298a43469873fcab28ea5be6e63aa/67_292_4829_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gilmore Girls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham and Bledel in the new series: \u2018It\u2019s a quiet show.

But in Lorelai, Sherman-Palladino simply wrote a woman she liked: \u201cShe was pretty tough, made her own money, but she also liked men. She wasn\u2019t demonising them. Her problems did not stem from men. They stemmed from her upbringing, mistakes she made and miscommunications with her mother. The real places that problems stem from.\u201d</p> <p>Since this month\u2019s revival was announced last October, there has been <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a18783/gilmore-girls-boyfriend-debate/\">endless</a> <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.uk/2016/09/124653/rory-gilmore-boyfriends#slide\">speculation</a> as to who Lorelai and Rory will end up with. It\u2019s an irritating framing of the show\u2019s return; personally, I\u2019m more interested to know which newspaper Rory ends up writing for (in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL4MP2HHd6A\">series finale</a>, we left her covering Barack Obama\u2019s campaign trail for an online magazine). \u201cThe boys are sort of incidental,\u201d agrees Lauren Graham, who plays Lorelai, as we chat under the town\u2019s gazebo while my inner fan girl does a jig. \u201cIt\u2019s more about their relationship, their work \u2013 it\u2019s just a piece of their life.\u201d When she says this, I\u2019ve never wanted to go for a martini with her more. (That is what Lorelai drinks to get through dinners with her parents. It\u2019s also how I came to be that 22-year-old tosser who ordered martinis wherever I could.)</p> <p>Fans didn\u2019t get the ending they wanted when Gilmore Girls wound up in 2007, as the Palladinos, who had<a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2006/04/24/amy-sherman-palladino-leaving-gilmore\"> failed to reach an agreement on contracts and staff with the network</a>, left before the final season was written. The show missed their voice, and played out without the finale Amy Sherman-Palladino <a href=\"http://www.tvguide.com/news/gilmore-girls-what-are-the-final-four-words/\">had in mind</a>; later this month, we will get to see it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a place to go in between watching Donald Trump trying to take the world down into the fourth rung of hell</p> <footer> <cite>Sherman-Palladino</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the last couple of years, the Gilmores have found a fresh teenage audience. In 2014, Netflix put all seven seasons on air again in the US (and, this summer, in the UK). Graham explains why she thinks it has struck a new chord: \u201cI just think it is a really welcoming world. My boyfriend has a 14-year-old and I\u2019m like, \u2018Get your face out of your phone!\u2019 and I wonder if this is almost like a period piece.\u201d And it\u2019s true: already the show feels dated, a world of flip phones, where the only filters are those used for coffee. Sherman-Palladino thinks the timing is key for the revival: \u201cIt\u2019s a place to go in between watching Donald Trump trying to take the world down into the fourth rung of hell.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-04-15/the-gilmore-girls-reunion-was-inspired-by-sherlock\">Inspired by the Sherlock format</a>, Sherman-Palladino has written the series in the form of four 90-minute films. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTnU5MG5Edw\">first trailer</a>, released in July, features updated cultural references \u2013 for instance, the leads debating whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer</a> would like Lorelai (answer: no, because of the comedian\u2019s love of water sports \u2013 the Gilmores do not do sport).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGNNSmGDpU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kGGNNSmGDpU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I ask Sherman-Palladino to pick an episode that best sums up the show for anyone unfamiliar with it. She chooses Road Trip To Harvard from the second season: Lorelai has called off an engagement and suggests a trip to Harvard to Rory, as a cover for running away. \u201cThen she sees that in a couple of years her whole life is going to change, because her daughter is going to be gone in this wonderful place. It\u2019s a quiet episode, but it\u2019s about these two women and how they belong to each other.\u201d</p> <p>In autumn 2010, my mother and I set out on a road trip \u201cto find Stars Hollow\u201d. My dad was living in a care home and my brother was living in New York. We flew to Boston in November, and my brother drove up to meet us. We knew it was the wrong state, but one afternoon we asked him to drive us out of the city in an attempt to find a little town that might be like the set of Gilmore Girls. He was bemused but obliging. We ended up in Salem, which was just creepy, and asked my brother to drive us back to the city so we could make the free wine and cheese hour at the hotel. I sense Lorelai and Rory would have done the same.</p> <p>Recently, I asked my mum why she enjoyed Gilmore Girls so much. \u201cI loved the relationship between Lorelai and Rory, and hoped that our relationship was similar,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw the parallel between you and Rory \u2013 determined, sensible, ambitious, with journalistic hopes, but not too nerdy.\u201d Thanks, Mum. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m like Lorelai,\u201d she continued, \u201cthough I did work behind the bar at a Berni Inn in 1976.\u201d Then she turned serious. \u201cI think I saw how the relationship flourished despite the lack of a permanent father figure in Rory\u2019s life, at the same time as we were losing our own male lead.\u201d And with that, we popped a Lorelai on.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80109415\">Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life</a> is released on Netflix on 25 November</p>",

The vanity thing, that\u2019s why I keep doing these Sassy Trump videos. </p> <p>People seem to like Cockney Trump but if I do him with a tough guy voice, he might love it. He projects this image of himself as a tough guy. But if he sees a video with him bitching to an audience of coal miners in West Virginia for two minutes about hairspray \u2013 <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/i-cant-stop-watching-trump-rant-about-hairspray-and-the-1775497234\">which he did!</a> \u2013 and suddenly he\u2019s got this voice to match his gestures, I think that might get under his skin.\u201d So with the election looming, is there an ultimate goal? \u201cMy ideal outcome would be Trump making a speech complaining about his depiction in one of my videos, and then I get to redub that video.

Since June, former American Office producer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onlxn\">Owen Ellickson</a> has been taking to the platform to pen Trump Leaks, an epic satirical imagining of leaked transcripts from the orange meanie\u2019s inner circle, delivered 140 characters at a time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://storify.com/michaeljweigel/trump-ryan-a-twitter-saga\">Trump Leaks</a> sees the Donald and operatives such as lapdog governor Chris Christie and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scramble to revive their flagging presidential run, usually managing to make things worse in the process. Responding to real news stories such as Trump\u2019s flagging poll numbers and <em>that</em> tape, Ellickson\u2019s tweets resemble a sitcom script being delivered on the fly, complete with in-jokes and bizarre subplots involving wrestlers, killer clowns, and the revelation that former Fox News chief Roger Ailes is in fact a shapeshifting vampire squid.

One storyline saw a Trump acolyte obtain a warhead, while Trump himself has taken to shouting, \u201cTHE AGE OF MAN IS OVER.

But it\u2019s Bee\u2019s furious monologues that really mark the show out. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/25/samantha-bee-trump-clinton-debate-abortion\">Samantha Bee on final election debate: 'Spare us the handwringing, GOP'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing provides better fuel to her furnace than the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\">Back To The Future\u2019s Biff Tannen appears to be running for president</a>. Her thoughts on \u201cadolescent boner boss\u201d Trump are wrathful and bang on target; jet-propelled but never losing grip on her superb command of language. Her schooling of Trump on the facts around third-trimester terminations (\u201cIt sounds like he has confused abortions with bear attacks\u201d) is a standout.</p> <p>While other US hosts direct their fury within the bounds of decency, Bee leaves you gasping at her candour and roaring in appreciation for her verbal smackdowns. She may be preaching to the liberal choir, but the catharsis of her well-scripted anger makes her the nasty woman to watch. <strong>Julia Raeside</strong></p> <h2>The Nuisance Committee</h2> <p><em><strong>The foul-mouthed card-game makers who are pranking Trump with adverts</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad240f7115fdbd9cfd9d250f410755a21dc4ef01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad240f7115fdbd9cfd9d250f410755a21dc4ef01/0_275_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nuisance Committee\u2019s billboard in Dearborn, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nuisance Committee\u2019s billboard in Dearborn, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t read this but he is scared of it,\u201d says a sign on Interstate 94 in Dearborn, Michigan (below). The reason he can\u2019t read it is because the phrase is written in Arabic. Dearborn has the highest proportion of Arab-American citizens in the US. Any of them reading it are encouraged to visit the website on the billboard, <a href=\"http://www.trumpisscared.org/\">TrumpIsScared.org</a>, which lists Trump\u2019s many acts of Islamophobia. The ad wasn\u2019t erected by Dearborn residents, but by one of the makers of <a href=\"https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/ \">Cards Against Humanity</a>, the infamous board game where players are tasked with creating the most offensive phrase possible. \u201cI knew we\u2019d hit a home run when I posted [the billboard] on Facebook and a friend in Saudi Arabia typed in the comments: \u2018LOL,\u2019\u201d says Melissa Harris of The Nuisance Committee. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/arabic-billboard-mocks-donald-trumps-fear-of-muslims\">Arabic billboard mocks Donald Trump's fear of Muslims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee was set up by Cards co-creator Max Temkin and a group of friends after Trump won the Republican nomination. A registered super PAC (campaign group), it is funded by sales of special editions of Temkin\u2019s game \u2013 one Trump-themed, the other Clinton. <a href=\"https://americavoteswithcardsagainsthumanity.com/ \">So far it\u2019s raised more than $430,000</a>. Much of the cash has funded mischievous stunts. As well as the Dearborn billboard, there have been others outside Virginia\u2019s evangelical Liberty University (Trump\u2019s claim that, \u201cnobody reads the Bible more than me\u201d) and one in Arizona featuring Trump\u2019s line about local senator John McCain not being a war hero because he got captured. Best and weirdest of all was a sign that appeared outside a university in Florida: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/one-2016s-coolest-anti-trump-ads-has-headline-most-you-wont-understand-174093 \">DONALD TRUMPS MAINS HANZO AND COMPLAINS ABOUT TEAM COMP IN CHAT.</a>\u201d Which unless you\u2019re a regular player of Blizzard\u2019s first-person shooter Overwatch might as well be written in Arabic.

Resembling a whirring, spinning drill head, this futurist work imagines the square-jawed Italian dictator as a series of stacked discs, so he appears the same from all sides while looking in every direction at once. Appropriately for Trump, that work was inspired by classical busts of the two-faced god Janus. <strong>Skye Sherwin</strong></p>",
  "<p>When I read that Boris Johnson wrote two different newspaper columns to help him decide whether he should back the remain campaign or Brexit, I was astonished. A journalist doing double the amount of required work for no extra pay? But looking at Johnson\u2019s Teflon \u2013 no, let\u2019s not sugar coat this, his cockroach-like survival skills \u2013 I\u2019ve decided I could learn something.</p> <p>As you might have heard, in three days\u2019 time there will be this election thingummybob, somewhere. So this week I shall write two columns, one for each of the two possible outcomes (please, no one mention hanging chads) so that you, dear readers, can deploy the relevant one come Wednesday morning. Consider this my homage to the Johnsonian approach, without the risk of me then becoming foreign secretary. Because while America may be a divided country, nobody wants that.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Wow, welcome to the dawn of President Trump, folks. Who could have foreseen that 6 November bombshell in Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, that Anthony Weiner was in the pay of Vladimir Putin all along? This did at least explain his otherwise completely inexplicable behaviour, but the fact that Clinton\u2019s closest aide was married to a Russian spy was too much for some, and so they handed the election to the guy who used to sell mail-order steaks.</p> <p>The result was announced just a few hours ago, and already Trump has ordered that the White House be gold plated and renamed Trump Mansion. In its current state, he said, the presidential residence is \u201ca disaster, a total disaster, a place for losers\u201d, but he will soon make it \u201ctremendous, the best, the most expensive building anyone\u2019s ever seen, even better than the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Plaza_Hotel_and_Casino\">Trump Plaza and Casino</a> in New Jersey\u201d (which closed two years ago and left thousands unemployed).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the stock market has plunged but Trump says this is just because the markets are \u201cstupid\u201d and, anyway, Americans will soon be using rubles, which is \u201cthe best, the richest currency\u201d according to Trump\u2019s \u201csmartest guys. I have the smartest guys\u201d. Because no US politician wants to work with him, he has put his children into office \u2013 his son Donnie as secretary of defence, Eric as secretary of state, 10-year-old Barron as chief of staff, and Ivanka as attorney general because, her father explained, \u201cshe\u2019ll look tremendous in a general\u2019s uniform\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/29/paddington-bear-today-anyone-give-warm-welcome\">If Paddington Bear pitched up today, would anyone give him a warm welcome?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one has seen the Clintons since the vote was confirmed, though there is a rumour they were seen fleeing the country in Barbra Streisand\u2019s private jet.

Coca Cola says it has lost the recipe for all its drinks except New Coke.</p> <p>The American experiment is over. Prince William has offered amnesty to any US citizens who wish to return to their colonial overlords, but Nigel Farage has dismissed this, because he is now America\u2019s colonial overlord. Chaos reigns.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s President Clinton! Again! It certainly was a close-run race, especially with that whole email issue. Who could have foreseen that they would reveal he was swapping dick pics with one DonaldTrump@donaldtrump.com? \u201cI saw your dick pic, and you have the dick of a loser. Mine is tremendous, incredible, doctors tell me I have the greatest dick of all time,\u201d Trump wrote in the first email, with photographic evidence.</p> <p>Reports say the two men sent one another more than 572,000 photos of their penises (the FBI has asked for a collective lobotomy after reviewing the evidence). Since the result was announced, Trump has been seen sitting in his penthouse suite in <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/new-york-ny/trump-tower/\">Trump Tower</a>, repeatedly muttering, \u201cRosebud, rosebud.\u201d (Rosebud, Melania has revealed, was her name for his penis. He thought it was because it smelled good.)</p> <p>Meanwhile President Clinton the second has appealed for calm (and help with setting up her White House email). As promised to the gods in return for ensuring her victory, she passes legislation that no member of the Kardashian family will be on TV again, ever. But trouble lies ahead: Ivanka, her heart filled with fury, vows to avenge her father. She doubles the size of her lifestyle website, which features coded messages that subliminally sow unrest and revolution. Due to their unwavering inability to resist luxury jeans and \u201chandbag organisers\u201d, Americans are soon fully indoctrinated. Chaos reigns.</p>",

Sisters in Kenya fighting against genital cutting, and sisters in Iraq building safe houses as fast as women are being taken and enslaved. Again and again there was one panicked question: is it possible that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/barack-obama-samantha-bee-halloween-episode-trump\">could become president</a> of the United States?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want us to declare we are united and will never elect an assaulting, insulting, disgusting man to lead our nation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They are all trying to make sense of how a man like this could be on the brink of becoming the most powerful person in the world. A man who has openly admitted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragged</a> that he can grab women without consent by their genitalia. A man who has now been accused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">numerous women</a> of harassment or assault. A man who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit\">fending off a lawsuit</a> from a woman who claimed she was raped by him as a 13-year-old. A man who has an ex-wife who claimed in a divorce deposition that he raped her. A man who appears to project his own sexual predation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">fictional Mexican rapists</a> and innocent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">African American youth</a>.</p> <p>My sisters wanted me to remind American women that this election is our election. Yes, we could have the first woman president. But more importantly this election will determine whether we stand against blatant misogyny, or whether we reward it. It is an election which has unleashed the subculture of sexual violence in America \u2013 and that could be our breakthrough, or our breakdown.</p> <p>They reminded me that next Tuesday, we have the power to direct this moment of truth. We as women have such difficulty believing that how we are seen and treated could be the central criteria for judging our candidates. Patriarchy has normalized our suffering, and made us terrified about speaking up. How often do we excuse the most oppressive, denigrating behavior of male leaders, because we believe there is something more important? We as woman often put everything else before ourselves.</p> <p>But this time it should be different. The truth despite the differences between us is that we are 50% of the population of the world. Women do two-thirds of the work of the world but get paid 10% of the income. If we were to start tomorrow refusing to nurse, serve, clean, teach, nanny, mother, organize, create, lead, support, sell, arrange, the world would come to a complete halt. Everything would crumble.</p> <p>There are an endless list of reasons not to vote for Donald Trump. By contrast, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for all her real flaws \u2013 is a woman who knows what it feels like to be hurt and humiliated by a womanizer. If we choose Trump and not her, all our years of struggle will be for naught. The culture under a Trump will be a Doris Lessing-esque nightmare. I don\u2019t want to spend the next four years using their language, playing in the cesspool of their degradation. I get to determine my own identity. I am done being traumatized.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/white-people-racism-america\">It's time for white people to reckon with racism | Eve Ensler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t have to trust Hillary Clinton. You don\u2019t have to like her. You need to help get her elected and then trust us \u2013 trust this covenant of women and loving men, this new army which will have the power joined in our newfound numbers. If, once she has settled in office, Hillary Clinton does not move to implement our collective vision, we will rise and push her ceaselessly at every front. With Trump, there is no front. It\u2019s scorched earth. There is only a hate-filled man and the haters around him, the haters he will grow and give permission to \u2013 who have already let us know in no uncertain terms that they will assault, degrade, deny, diminish and destroy us and our rights.<br></p> <p>If we send Trump back to his gross phallic tower, we will be saying we want these horrifying woman-hating days to be over forever. Defeating him will give us ground to fight the last dirty gasp of the patriarchy which is built on a conviction that subordinated people must stay in their assigned place. So much of the fury that Trump has unleashed is because all too many of us are perceived as breaking the chains of a society built on gender and race hierarchies. I want this to be the moment where all of us who identify as women say what happens to us is the bellwether of the future of life on this planet, and must be heeded. This is our world. I want us to declare we are united and will never elect an assaulting, insulting, disgusting degrading man to lead our nation \u2013 and we will ever let another one like him get this far. Their days are over.</p> <p>Our sisters, our women leaders, our young daughters everywhere are looking to us. As one character says in the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/\">Cloud Atlas</a>: \u201cBy each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.\u201d</p> <p>If you only vote for one reason, vote for women, for your daughters and sons and for all people. Vote in solidarity with women across the planet. Rise, sisters. Rise.</p>",
  "<p>Indonesian president Joko Widodo has cancelled his imminent visit to Australia after violent Islamist protests erupted in Jakarta.</p> <p>President Widodo \u2013 known as Jokowi \u2013 was set to arrive on Sunday for a three-day visit to meet his Australian counterpart, prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, as well as other ministers and business leaders. He was also scheduled to address the Australian parliament on Monday. </p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/05/indonesian-president-blames-political-actors-for-stoking-jakarta-blasphemy-protests\">protests in the streets of Jakarta</a>, which began peacefully on Friday in response to accusations the governor, a Christian, had insulted the Qur\u2019an, turned violent.</p> <p>Turnbull said he had received a call from Jokowi on Saturday afternoon to express regret that his trip would have to be rescheduled \u201cas a result of the security situation in Jakarta which requires his personal attention\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI said we were sorry we would not be able to welcome him to Australia tomorrow but entirely understood the need for him to remain in Indonesia at this time,\u201d said Turnbull.</p> <p>\u201cWhile disappointing, we agreed the postponement will not affect the need for continued and enhanced cooperation across a range of shared interests and challenges, including the threat of terrorism to our region.\u201d</p> <p>In September, the Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahja Purnama, was accused by Muslim groups of insulting the religion after he said political opponents had used a verse of the Qur\u2019an to deceive voters and tell them they should not choose non-Muslims as leaders. Critics interpreted his comments as a criticism of the Qur\u2019an, and he apologised.</p> <p>Purnama, the first ethnic Chinese to lead the Indonesian capital, is up for re-election in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cc6a41665601c7805ea3fe6e524749dd0a5b58a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cc6a41665601c7805ea3fe6e524749dd0a5b58a/0_207_4532_2719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jakarta protest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Islamic demonstrators march in central Jakarta after a day of protest on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Wray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jokowi called for calm as the protests \u2013 which swelled to an estimated 150,000 people following Friday prayers \u2013 escalated later in the night, and hit out at unnamed politicians for stoking the situation.</p> <p>\u201cWe deplore the incident after the Isha prayers, when should have already disbanded but became violent. And, we see this was steered by political actors who were exploiting the situation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Widodo, a Muslim, has vowed not to interfere in any legal proceedings against Purnama, according to media reports. But he said at his news conference that any legal process involving Purnama would be executed \u201cswiftly, firmly and transparently\u201d.</p> <p>One protester has died, reportedly of an asthma attack, and 12 were injured in early skirmishes but reports later emerged of dozens of protesters and security personnel being treated for injuries. Police fired teargas and a watercannon at the crowds gathered around the presidential palace. More than 18,000 personnel and military were deployed ahead of the rallies, the national police chief, General Tito, said.</p> <p>Turnbull said the visit would be rescheduled as soon as \u201cmutually convenient dates\u201d were found.</p> <p>Negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement would continue, he said.</p>",

The latest recipes were released Thursday morning, of course with a twist this year: Since Hillary Clinton is the first female nominee of a major party, it was her husband, Bill, who was asked to furnish a cookie recipe, along with Melania Trump.</p> <p>The Clintons don\u2019t exactly win points for creativity this year. The campaign submitted the \u201cClinton Family\u2019s Chocolate Chip Cookies\u201d \u2014 a reprise of Hillary Clinton\u2019s earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions. And Melania Trump\u2019s submission: \u201cMelania Trump\u2019s Star Cookies.\u201d <em>Family Circle</em> readers will <a href=\"http://www.familycircle.com/recipes/desserts/cookies/family-circle-2016-presidential-cookie-poll/\">vote on the recipes</a> in a poll on the magazine\u2019s website.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t so much a story about cookies as it is a story about Hillary Clinton. Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn\u2019t set it aside to stand by her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Her career became an issue in the Democratic primary. There were questions about whether then-Gov. Bill Clinton had funneled state business into her law firm.</p> <p>When asked about her career in a press gaggle, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EGranwN_uk\">Clinton responded</a>, \u201cYou know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that\u2019s all that I can tell you.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:20:01.488Z\">at 2.20am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581d3f28e4b07ceadb3a2a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:08:48.725Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some video of Beyonce\u2019s arrival in Cleveland:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/794723013891649536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The much awaited Beyonc\u00e9 entrance at the Clinton rally <a href=\"https://t.co/UtwwZ6gfau\">pic.twitter.com/UtwwZ6gfau</a></p>&mdash; Anthony Zurcher (@awzurcher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/794723013891649536\">November 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794722799642378240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Beyonce&#39;s backup dancers are wearing &quot;I&#39;m with her&quot; t-shirts.</p>&mdash; Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794722799642378240\">November 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:09:21.992Z\">at 2.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581d3d9be4b07ceadb3a2a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:03:12.665Z\">2.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cThere was a time a woman\u2019s opinion did not matter,\u201d Beyonce says. \u201cLess than 100 years ago women did not have the right to vote.
