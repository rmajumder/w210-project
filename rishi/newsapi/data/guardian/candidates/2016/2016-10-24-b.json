  "<p>The missing white stone head of baby Jesus has been returned to a Canadian church after its bright orange <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/canada-baby-jesus-head-statue-church-restoration\">replacement was widely mocked</a>.<br></p> <p>On Friday, an anonymous woman returned the original head to Sainte Anne des Pins Catholic church in downtown Sudbury,<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/jesus-statue-head-returned-1.3817883\"> according to the CBC</a>. </p> <p>The head had been taken off the white stone statue of Mary holding the baby Jesus several times before, and left on the ground by vandals. The head was once again removed from the statue outside the church about a year ago, but this time was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>While the church\u2019s priest, G\u00e9rard Lajeunesse, had asked local businesses about crafting a new head after several months, a local artist, Heather Wise, had offered to help craft a new one.

The incident was even likened to the now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/22/spain-church-mural-ruin-restoration\">infamous attempt by a Spanish woman to restore a crumbling fresco of Jesus</a>. An Instagram account called \u201ctemporaryjesushead\u201d was created <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/jesus-head-reaction-1.3816238\">to lampoon the sculpture</a>, photoshopping the head on to images of ET, from the 1982 film;

At 23, he is five years too old to be taken in under the Dublin regulation.</p> <p>\u201cI am six months here in the camp. My whole family, my brothers and sisters are living in the UK, and my nephews. I have no one in my country. So what I have to do, I have to join my family. But they say \u2018no, no\u2019 you are not a teenager. You should go back to your country.</p> <p>\u201cThey said I should apply for asylum. I am allowed to apply for asylum in France but I don\u2019t want, I want to rejoin my family in UK. My brother, sisters, sisters-in-law have been there for 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cI am an educated person. How can I live here?,\u201d he asks pointing to the camp. \u201c[The Taliban] said \u2018you are not muslim, you are working for government officials\u2019,\u201d he says to explain why he fled his country.</p> <p>\u201cOfficials say I have no reason to be here. But why would I be here? I have a problem. [You have to ask] why am I here in this jungle place.\u201d</p> <p>He says he does not want to be cleared from the site but will reluctantly board the bus when his time comes.</p> <p>\u201cI am not happy. I am not happy with what happened with me. My family are like a few hundred kilometres from me and now I have to go a thousand kilometres back.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s UK and France double standards. They look after the children. And I understand, they are helpless. But I am helpless too.\u201d</p> <p>He said the challenges in the camp were a symptom of war and injustice that the west has had a part in.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 10,000 individuals in there, 10,000 minds in there. Each one of them has a story, has their individual problem, each one has their reason to be there. Some of them are crazy, sometimes there are fights. But you have to ask, what made them like that. No one wants to be in the jungle, no one.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the squalor of the camp, the lack access to cooking facilities, to privacy, to education, he said: \u201cThis is a violation of human rights. The UK and France are responsible for this. This is an injustice.\u201d</p> <p>He spent $13,000 to get to France to be within what he thought was a whisker of his family, but now the devastation is writ large on his face as he heads to join the queues for the buses. \u201cI understand they want to help children and take them to the UK. but I am a human too.

They are worried France won\u2019t grant them asylum because it doesn\u2019t recognise them as persecuted, based on the experience of others who have been rejected.</em></p> <p><em>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said everyone in the Calais camp would be offered the chance to be transferred to a reception centre where they could apply for asylum. </em><em>\u201cThere will be no blanket decisions for certain nationalities,\u201d spokeswoman Laura Padoan said.</em></p> <p><em>French asylum chief Pascal Brice recently visited the Jungle and offered reassurances to the migrants and refugees, including the Oromo group, said Solan. </em><em>Brice was not available for comment when the Thomson Reuters Foundation contacted his office on Monday.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cIf they accept us we want to stay here (in France),\u201d said Solan, who did not want to give his full name. \u201cWe are not searching for a better country, we are here (in Calais) because England accepts Oromo people.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>Solan has been moving back and forth between Calais and a makeshift migrant camp in Paris for the past year, he said. In that time many other Oromo have come and gone from Calais - some as young as 12 or as old as 65. Many lose hope of reaching Britain and instead go to the Netherlands or Germany, he said.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cI am asking for everybody to stay with us, to support us, to save our children, to save our home, to save our story, to save our land,\u201d he said. </em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580e0837e4b0c146d589141b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T13:12:06.082Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tim Farron</strong>, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has pre-empted the Commons statement by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, with his own statement demanding she make clear how many children Britain will take from the camp. <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is unbelievable that the day before demolition is due to take place, our Government still can\u2019t tell us how many children we will take and when they will arrive. </p> <p>The Home Secretary must clarify this in her statement to Parliament today and take this opportunity to rebuild Britain\u2019s reputation as a compassionate and caring country. </p> <p>The UK Government has a moral responsibility to ensure that all vulnerable children are either transferred to the UK or moved to places of safety before camp clearance starts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580e043ce4b024af0e451a7c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T13:08:46.386Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Youth charities scathing over treatment of children</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Youth charities working in Calais amid the eviction have been scathing about the failure to safeguard children earlier, <strong>Lisa O\u2019Carroll</strong> reports.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s has been a very rapid attempt by the French and UK governments to do their homework on the back of the bus.

The queue for children seemed least organised, moving slowly with pushing and shoving at points.</p> <p>Adults, on the other hand, were being processed swiftly, shown a map of French regions and asked where they would like to go.

Under pressure from Britain, which sees it as having a \u201cpull\u201d effect on migration, the camp is closed in 2002. Hundreds of mainly Afghan migrants then set up camp east of Calais, on a patch of scrubland next to a road travelled by lorries heading for Calais port. The migrants call it \u201cthe Jungle\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>September 2009</strong>, the Jungle is demolished for the first time on the orders of then president Nicolas Sarkozy, following a mass police raid in which scores of people are arrested.<br></li> <li>In <strong>early 2015</strong>, a new settlement - labelled the \u201cNew Jungle\u201d - sprouts up near a state-run day centre for migrants established at the site. The camp later becomes simply known as the Jungle. <br></li> <li>From <strong>mid-2015 on</strong>, migrants attempting to board lorries or enter the Channel Tunnel frequently clash with police around the camp, which mushrooms in size as asylum-seekers pour into Europe in unprecedented numbers. That November, France\u2019s top administrative court rapped the government over conditions in the camp, describing them as \u201cinhuman\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>January 2016</strong>, the port of Calais is shut for more than three hours after dozens of migrants occupy a moored Britain-bound ferry. A month later, around 20 people are arrested in Calais at a banned rally by supporters of Germany\u2019s xenophobic Pegida movement.<br></li> <li>The southern half of the Jungle camp is demolished in late <strong>February 2016 and early March</strong>, sparking protests. Iranian migrants protesting at the destruction of their shacks sew their mouths shut. The evicted migrants moved to the northern part of the camp.<br></li> <li>On <strong>26 September</strong>, President Francois Hollande says the Jungle will be demolished by the end of the year and that the migrants - estimated to number around 6,000 - will be moved to shelters around the country.<br></li> <li>On <strong>October 21</strong> the interior ministry confirms the operation to tear down the camp will start on Monday, 24 October (today). Migrants began evacuating early in the morning, with the first bus carrying about 50 Sudanese leaving the Jungle at about 08:45 am (0645 GMT). <br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580de333e4b0c146d5891341\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:34:47.178Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">600 people bussed away from Calais camp by 11.30am</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">By 11:30, 600 refugees &amp; migrants had left by bus to places including burgundy, north eastern France, western France <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/calais?src=hash\">#calais</a></p>&mdash; Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:35:04.270Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580de2ade4b0ce434eca471c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:31:36.233Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our reporters have arrived back at the processing queues and say that all is now calm in the area.

  "<p>Donald Trump used to spend most of his campaign rallies citing his awesome polls in what passed for stump speeches during the primaries. He was up, and his rivals were down. He was a winner, and all the governors and senators were losers.</p> <p>But now the polls aren\u2019t so gold-plated, and he thinks they\u2019re mostly all wrong.</p> <p>\u201cEven though we\u2019re doing pretty good in the polls, I don\u2019t believe the polls anymore,\u201d the GOP nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/18/stop-whining-obama-knocks-trump\">said</a> last week in Colorado Springs. \u201cBelieve me folks, we\u2019re doing great. If we keep our spirit, and we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me.\u201d</p> <p>This is the last resort of losing campaigns: the grasping at straws that comes with the sinking feeling that all the time, money and hopes have been for naught. In their final throes, campaigns cling, sometimes bitterly, to an outlier poll, while they mutter darkly about the elites, or the media, or the polls themselves.</p> <p>In that regard, Trump is no different from past failures of presidential nominees. But in other ways, he is uniquely of this political moment. What used to be called a <a href=\"http://time.com/4381539/brexit-global-populism/\">throw-the-bums-out</a> mood has turned into a desire to blow the bums up.</p> <p>Previous campaigns used to invoke the ghost of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1948\">Harry Truman</a> to delude themselves through the final days. They loved that old photo of the newly elected president grinning as he brandished the newspaper that declared \u201c<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-deweydefeats-story-story.html\">Dewey Defeats Truman</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has no need for Truman because he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/trump-clinton-polls-brexit\">Nigel Farage</a>. Never mind that the beer-swilling former leader of the UK Independence party never quite made it to prime minister. Never mind that he was not the mainstream leadership of the \u201cleave\u201d campaign that won the referendum on the European Union.</p> <p>Instead, Trump carries Nigel Farage and Brexit on the campaign trail like some anti-elitist talisman, warding off all the polls that show him losing.</p> <p>\u201cWe will win,\u201d he said in Pennsylvania last week. \u201cWe will shock the world. This is going to be Brexit-plus.\u201d</p> <p>To the extent that you can consider this an argument, there are two strands to it. One is that the polls were all wrong about Brexit. The other is that Trump is a natural-born winner who has shocked the world through this entire election. So why would 8 November be any different?</p> <p>First, the Brexit polls. Referendum votes are notoriously hard to model for pollsters for the simple reason that there haven\u2019t been many of them. Will people actually show up when they say they are likely voters? In that sense, the Brexit polls were more unpredictable than presidential election ones are.</p> <p>Still, late surges in turnout can affect the accuracy of polls. Just ask the Kerry campaign, which was openly celebrating its victory based on the first waves of exit polling in 2004. That polling failed to detect the early-day voting patterns in outer suburbs that tipped the contest to President Bush.</p> <p>Turnout is everything in any election, and the Bush campaign had a best-in-class turnout operation that the Obama campaign learned from in 2008. If Team Trump has something similar, they have done a stunning job of keeping it hidden from the nation at large.</p> <p>Then there are the <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/\">Brexit numbers</a> themselves. Until a month out, the \u201cremain\u201d campaign was ahead in the majority of polls. But as the campaign intensified, the Brexit team pulled ahead. Of 18 polls in the first half of June, the leave campaign was ahead in 11 of them, while one was tied.</p> <p>In the final week, in the midst coverage of the assassination of MP Jo Cox, the polls leaned back in favor of remain. Polling averages ended with the race with the narrowest of edges for remain, between 0.5 and 2 points.</p> <p>Today in the presidential contest, the national polling averages \u2013 a truly blunt measure in a state-by-state election \u2013 place Clinton\u2019s lead at between 6 and 7 points. In the last three months of polling, just eight national polls have given Trump a lead and eight are tied.</p> <p>Of those 16 more positive polls for Trump, fully nine are the same outlier: a tracking poll by the LA Times and University of Southern California with an unusual methodology that is either \u201c<a href=\"http://cesrusc.org/election/\">pioneering</a>\u201d as its pollsters suggest, or an embarrassment, as its rivals suggest.</p> <p>Since the numbers don\u2019t exactly point to another Brexit, all that\u2019s left is Trump\u2019s volatility. Surely a candidate who came out of nowhere could pull off the biggest surprise in political history? Didn\u2019t he do the same in the primaries?</p> <p>Not quite. Trump was consistently ahead in the primary polling from July of last year, just one month after entering the race. You don\u2019t need both hands to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html#polls\">count the national polls</a> in which he was trailing during that time.</p> <p>Whatever the anti-Trump pundits and forecasters were basing their predictions on, it wasn\u2019t the polling numbers. Instead, it was more likely their personal shock and disbelief at the sight of Trump\u2019s success inside the GOP.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal volatility does not and did not translate into polling volatility. While the candidate may be confusing, his numbers are not. He may blow as hot and cold as a Katy Perry song, but the polls are somewhat less colorful.</p> <p>Which brings us back to Brexit. The one takeaway that is relevant to this presidential contest is the importance of turnout. Polling is meaningless if the models are all wrong: if likely voters simply don\u2019t bother with that whole ballot thing. Elections are won with actual votes, not polling data.</p> <p>So it\u2019s possible Trump could still win, but it\u2019s not probable. The balance of probabilities lies with the polling trends, which have proved remarkably consistent through this very long election.</p> <p>Trump was heading to clear victory through the primaries; he\u2019s heading to a clear defeat now. </p>",

  "<p>How political are your pubes? It\u2019s not a question most of us spend much time worrying about, yet when you\u2019re a woman, how you choose to cultivate your lady garden sprouts up as a topic with tedious regularity. In its latest incarnation, the arbiters at <a href=\"http://www.tatler.com/beauty/too-posh-for-bush-beauty-waxing-review-bikini-wax\">Tatler magazine have declared the \u201cfreedom bush\u201d back in fashion</a> (those who sneer at the notion of the pudenda being subject to changing aesthetic trends would do well to remember that dark mid-noughties period: the \u201cvajazzle years\u201d). If even the conservative, conventional Sloane is cultivating a full bush then, it\u2019s worth noting, that could indeed hint at a seismic shift in societal norms regarding pubic grooming. But equally, after years and years of the same \u201cdebate\u201d, is it not time that feminist coverage in the media was directed elsewhere? In other words, magazine editors, enough already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/year-of-the-bush-female-body-hair-cameron-diaz-pubic\">It's the year of the bush \u2013 time to rediscover all female body hair | Emer O'Toole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are just emerging from a period that has seen a new generation embrace feminism in a way that the capitalist post-feminists of the 1990s could scarcely have imagined. Much of this has been powerful and positive: the conversation about the importance of sexual consent, for instance, and how it operates within a culture that continues to trivialise rape, has never been louder and more energetic. The fightback against street harassment has been equally inspirational. But at the same time a strand of feminism in the media has spent the last few years concerning itself with issues that many would dismiss as trivial, including pubes, and footwear, and 50 Shades of Grey, not to mention that perennial question that birthed a million op-eds: is Beyonc\u00e9 a feminist or not?</p> <p>As a writer, I have been guilty of entering into some of these debates. With an internet media run on opinion, feminist polemic can feel like one of the few journalistic avenues open to the young, aspiring woman writer (critiquing media sexism is how I began my own career, and I am grateful to it, but I have said my piece on women\u2019s magazines). For a long while, talking about the more trivial aspects of the feminist debate \u2013 as opposed to, for instance, boring old domestic violence \u2013 was the only way to get feminism covered in the mainstream media.</p> <p>But as time has gone on, the focus on the fluffy \u2013 so often to the point where it appears to be given equal billing to more urgent and distressing issues affecting women \u2013 has irked me, and other feminists writers, more and more. Perhaps it is because I have been in this game for a while now, and have thus seen the same topics recycled several times over with very little new being said (my friend and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/emer-o-toole\">colleague Emer O\u2019Toole</a> wrote the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/year-of-the-bush-female-body-hair-cameron-diaz-pubic\">definitive piece on female body hair</a> several years ago \u2013 what could be left to say about it?). Or perhaps it is because I have grown up a tad in the past five years. But more than either of those two things, I would reason that this is a time when the need for feminism is making itself acutely obvious in all manner of ways. There is so very little to laugh about, to the point where even the notion of a \u201cfreedom foof\u201d fails to raise a smile.</p> <p>Donald Trump, a man with so much obvious contempt for women that it feels almost unbelievable \u2013 like watching a fictional dystopia play out on our TV screens \u2013 is running for president. Analysis has shown that, if women were excluded and only US men were eligible to vote, Trump would win the election. It is abundantly clear that there are millions of people who would rather have a fascist than a female as leader. We are told that women can achieve anything in this day and age \u2013 \u201cso what are you whining about?\u201d being the inevitable subtext. \u201cLook at Hillary,\u201d we are told, to which the inevitable rebuttal is: \u201cYes, look at Hillary.

The way the previous sexual behaviour of the complainant in the Ched Evans case was pored over during his successful appeal and in court this month has caused widespread dismay. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-05-11/debates/16051141000001/DomesticViolenceRefuges\">Then there\u2019s the closure of domestic violence shelters</a> \u2013 17% have closed due to funding cuts, 32 of which were specialist services for black and ethnic minority women, and 48% of 167 domestic violence services in England said they were running services without any funding. Two women a week are murdered by their partners or ex-partners, and vulnerable women such as female asylum seekers continue to be abused. There were 99 pregnant women held in Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre last year. <a href=\"http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/three-serco-officers-in-the-dock-over-alleged-rape-and-sexual-activity-with-female-detainee/story-29818634-detail/story.html\">Three Serco workers are currently in court over the alleged rape of a Yarl\u2019s Wood detainee</a>.

I returned home depressed and tearful. Faced with these sobering facts, is it any wonder, really, that so many people seek refuge in arguing instead about bikini waxes?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been to enough schools to talk to young women about feminism to know that feminist \u201cfluff\u201d can be an easy way to open a discussion \u2013 a \u201cgateway drug\u201d if you will, for those unfamiliar with the topic, or put off or intimidated by the stereotypes surrounding it. It\u2019s important that teenage girls particularly question why it is they feel pressured into certain sexual behaviours. That issue does not go away once you declare that the \u201cfull bush\u201d is back. The impact of pornography on the way young people conduct relationships goes way beyond a few wax strips, taking in issues of consent, coercion and abuse, objectification, grooming and revenge porn. It\u2019s all cheerful stuff.</p> <p>The personal is political, the feminists of the 1970s told us, and this has morphed into a strange kind of choice feminism where women are encouraged to examine their clothing, their footwear, their grooming, their behaviour, every little choice that they make, in order to assess whether it matches up. But the big picture is now so alarmingly vivid that it obscures these trivial questions. Freedom is never so easy to imagine as when it might be taken away. Most women know that our bushes have very little to do with it.</p>",

Titled A Rape on Campus, it told a harrowing story of a student, \u201cJackie\u201d, who claimed to have been gang-raped by seven fraternity brothers in an initiation ritual.

On Thursday and Friday, when Erdely testified, attorneys for Eramo pressed the reporter on why discrepancies in Jackie\u2019s story didn\u2019t give her pause. The lawyer also asked Erdely why she had not contacted friends of Jackie\u2019s to see if they could corroborate her story.

So the Guardian looked at how the press is reporting on these allegations in the wake of the debacle at Rolling Stone.</p> <p>Since a 2005 tape revealed the presidential candidate bragging that his fame allowed him to grope and kiss women without their permission, seven women have publicly accused him of doing just that.

Anderson couldn\u2019t exactly remember the place where the alleged incident happened or the date. She remembered vividly the club\u2019s red sofas and she was pretty sure the encounter took place at the China Club. While Anderson Googled China Club to see if she recognized the interior, Tumulty worked to establish whether Trump was known to frequent the China Club \u2013 he was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Tumulty then asked Anderson if there were events in her life which might undermine her credibility. She volunteered that during an acrimonious breakup, she and her partner had restraining orders against one another. \u201cEverything we asked, she was willing to provide,\u201d Tumulty said. Smaller details, like the fact that Anderson claimed to be a registered independent, checked out, too.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, if the little checkable details don\u2019t add up, people are going to have reasons, legitimately, to doubt the big one. That\u2019s how you can nail it down after this many years,\u201d Tumulty said. </p> <p>The process unfolded in almost the opposite manner to how Rolling Stone appears to have vetted Jackie\u2019s story. Reporters scrutinizing the feature noticed that Erdely\u2019s piece failed to indicate whether she had contacted Jackie\u2019s alleged attackers for their end of the story. (She had not.) The article even left readers to wonder whether Erdely had contacted friends of Jackie\u2019s who appear in the narrative and could have corroborated \u2013 or raised questions about \u2013 key parts of Jackie\u2019s allegations. She had not \u2013 and <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/everything-we-know-uva-rape-case.html\">later reporting</a> revealed that if she had, Jackie\u2019s friends might have provided reasons to doubt her recollections.</p> <p>Reporters unveiling new accusations against Trump appear not to be taking the same risks. The New York Times, in vetting separate <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0\">allegations</a> against Trump of inappropriate touching or unwanted kissing, contacted six people in whom the women had confided over the years. One was the sister of Rachel Crooks, who recalled that Crooks had phoned her in tears right after an encounter with Trump. Crooks claims that Trump shook her hand in introduction, but would not let go and began kissing her.</p> <p>After the Trump campaign lashed out at Stoynoff, People magazine produced the <a href=\"http://people.com/politics/people-writer-attack-by-donald-trump-corroborated-six-named-sources/\">accounts</a> of six colleagues and close friends who recall Stoynoff recounting a similar story. The Guardian reached out to a friend, a family member, and an acquaintance of Cathy Heller while reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">her claim</a> that Trump forcibly kissed her. The Palm Beach Post corroborated Mindy McGillivray\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/national-govt--politics/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/aLcLWjmxbmudQMc7TXuxiK/\">accusation</a> that Trump groped her at Mar-a-Lago by speaking with a photographer who was on location at the time. The photographer remembers McGillivray pulling him aside to say, \u201cDonald just grabbed my ass!\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Michael Barbaro, the reporter who wrote the Times story, declined to speak for this story, in reply to an email sent to both him and his coauthor, Megan Twohey. \u201cOur reporting here speaks for itself,\u201d he wrote. But in May, after the two reporters published an investigation into Trump\u2019s treatment of women, the two spoke briefly about their vetting process on <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/16/new_york_times_reporters_explain_defend_story_on_donald_trumps_relationships_with_women.html\">CBS This Morning</a>.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/23/trump-threatens-to-sue-sexual-assault-accusers-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58mdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2831074\"            data-video-name=\"Trump threatens to sue sexual assault accusers \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580c1820e4b05ae7c6c56138\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023trumpsue_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733820&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733820&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/23/trump-threatens-to-sue-sexual-assault-accusers-video\">Trump threatens to sue sexual assault accusers</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDid you find things that were worse than anything you reported, but because of the New York [Times]\u2019 standards, you could not put it in the paper?\u201d Charlie Rose asked.</p> <p>Barbaro replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to go too deep into our process, but we felt very strongly that unless something could be verified in a lot of different ways, we weren\u2019t going to put it in the New York Times. So you can kind of leave that to your imagination that, yeah, certainly some things hit the cutting room floor, which happens in your journalism, and happens in ours.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Tumulty says she is in touch with other women making accusations against Trump whose stories she has declined to publish. She believes that the women are credible, but it poses an obstacle that they are not willing to publicly disclose their names. The benefit of naming an accuser is twofold: not only does it give the accused a greater ability to respond, but it can also help convey the credibility of the accuser, who has staked her reputation on her word.</p> <p>Making a similar calculation, the Guardian first heard Heller\u2019s account in February, but declined to publish her claims because she was not willing to use her name at the time.<strong> </strong>In other instances, it has refrained from publishing accusations it could not corroborate.</p> <p>But from a vantage point of judging the press, perhaps the most interesting Trump allegation is one that reporters have been unable to corroborate. To the contrary, those who have tried have raised serious questions about the credibility, and even the existence, of the accuser.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/23/reality-tv-trump-groping-tape-contracts\">TV contracts keep lid on stars' offensive remarks, insiders say: 'Tapes are deleted'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The accusation comes from a mysterious lawsuit filed against Trump and the celebrity and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, accusing both men of violently raping the plaintiff when she was 13 years old.

The same call has been taken up by up by Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, another candidate for the right.</p> <p>Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister and a socialist, is more cautious. In an interview with la Voix du Nord, he said: \u201cChallenging Le Touquet agreements by moving the border to the English coast would reopen the border we closed in Calais, and so give a strong signal to smugglers and migrants to return en masse there. It would start again from scratch.\u201d</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, argued: \u201cIf the border is moved to the other side of the Channel, as some suggest, we\u2019ll have to put out boats to rescue people who will be in the water.\u201d</p> <p>Cazeneuve insists that unlike 2003, when the Sangatte camp was destroyed in a short-term operation, a comprehensive strategy is in place. This includes dispersal of refugees to regional camps, securing the tunnel, a crackdown on 33 illegal immigration routes and the maintenance of a stronger police presence on the French coast.</p> <p>But if this does not work, the call for more drastic action will grow ever louder during the presidential campaign.</p>",

The hybrid frozen war in Ukraine and the bombardment of Aleppo in Syria, revealing a determination to keep Bashar al-Assad in power, top the list. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/oct/21/russian-warships-pass-through-english-channel-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58ft4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2826094\"            data-video-name=\"Russian warships pass through English channel \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5809eb1be4b0cd26ff71f78c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/21/161021Fleet3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/21/161021Fleet3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/21/161021Fleet3_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/oct/21/russian-warships-pass-through-english-channel-video\">Russian warships pass through English channel</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Add to that Putin\u2019s sudden scrapping of a 20-year-old US-Russian agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons. He also deployed short-range, nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe, unnerving Nato members Poland and Lithuania. He moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/30/assad-russian-s300-missiles-syria\">advanced S-300 and S-400 ground-to-air missiles, and radar into Syria</a> in a sign that he now regards the country as his preserve, and can see off any plan for a Turkish or American no-fly zone. In a display of military reach he dispatched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/russian-fleet-could-pass-through-the-channel-as-early-as-thursday-night\">Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier</a>, and its taskforce, to the waters off Syria so its SU-30s and MiG-29 aircrafts can drop yet more bombs on Syria.</p> <p>He even raised the spectre of the Cuban missile crisis by saying he was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam, a move calculated to unnerve US public opinion. At the same time, Putin is trying to challenge western diplomatic alliances \u2013 notably with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/erdogan-russia-turkey-foreign-policy\">Turkey</a>, Egypt, China and Libya.</p> <p>All the while he experiments with new techniques \u2013 the unprecedented use of cyber warfare, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/putin-russia-us-democrats-hacking-cyber-attacks\">hacking of Democratic politicians\u2019 emails</a>, and wider use of information wars to destabilise the Baltics or fund parties of the right in eastern Europe. The only common factor, apart from the aggression, is his unpredictability, adding to Putin\u2019s self-image as a master of political intrigue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is self-evident Russia experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet bloc as a downgrade</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Marc Ayrault</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Putin hopes he is striking at a moment of peculiar western vulnerability, making the west look flat-footed. Hugo Swire, a Foreign Office minister under David Cameron, explained: \u201cThe truth is that with America increasingly absorbed by a sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">surreal presidential election</a>, France and Germany facing elections of their own next year, [US secretary of state John] Kerry soon to leave office and a change of leadership at the UN, a degree of paralysis has entered into our relations with Russia.\u201d</p> <p>Many acknowledge the west must take its share of the blame for the collapse of relations. The mistakes are real, notably the scale of Nato expansion to the east and in the Baltics. Russia also feels deeply that it was duped into accepting a UN resolution criticising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/27/g8-gaddafi-libya-russia\">Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011</a>, only to find it was used as cover for regime change. Hillary Clinton, then at the State Department, did little to mange the Russians. Russia has not voted for humanitarian action at the UN since.</p> <p>Britain acknowledges errors over Ukraine and Syria. The former Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon Fraser recently accepted: \u201cWith hindsight we might have foreseen in 2013 that the combination of formally signing a deep free trade agreement [with Ukraine], with the internal unrest facing President Putin on his return to office, and the perception that had arisen of greater reticence in western foreign policy, could result in a more aggressive Russian response in Ukraine, and opportunism in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>By refusing to respond to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/syrian-chemical-attack-sarin-says-un\">Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons in 2013</a>, Sawers argues, the west \u201cvacated the theatre and the Russians moved in. It was certainly a mistake. Chemical weapons were being used against civilians in Damascus by their own regime. We had upheld a taboo against the use of chemical weapons and we failed to uphold it on this occasion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91820c40e14704d6dbab1ccfed8df2b6ef76f01e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91820c40e14704d6dbab1ccfed8df2b6ef76f01e/102_626_4420_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children on rubble of Aleppo houses.

Some believe Russian statehood requires a more aggressive foreign policy. The Kremlin, faced by an ailing economy and declining population, needs external threats of war and violence in the media because Putin \u201chas no civilian project to offer to society\u201d, said Dr Andrew Monaghan at Chatham House. Putin instead offers a mobilisation strategy. The answer is to confront and push back, acknowledging that Putin sees offers of dialogue as a sign of weakness.</p> <p>Others insist the west must continue to engage and keep pressing the reset button because coexistence is the only option.</p> <p>In the US and Europe, the question about what to do with Russia is far from settled, something Putin is likely to continue to exploit.</p> <h2>A Europe divided between sanctions and detente</h2> <p>The French foreign minister has probably led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/21/syria-un-aid-airstrike-russia-boris-johnson\">European outrage at Putin\u2019s behaviour in eastern Aleppo</a>, describing the crisis as the worst for Europe since the second world war.

Some, including Front National leader Marine le Pen appreciate his authoritarianism and fight against Islamic extremism. The former president Nicolas Sarkozy, who met Putin in June, has promised to lift economic sanctions against Moscow. He has derided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/vladimir-putin-declines-french-offer-of-syria-only-talks-in-paris\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s refusal to meet Putin in Paris</a> last week as irresponsible. By contrast, his rival for the nomination on the French right, Alain Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 the favourite to win the race for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e \u2013 said the weakness of the US has been a \u201csource of disquiet\u201d, and that he would welcome the election of the more interventionist Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In Germany, where the contest over Russia and sanctions has been most intense, Putin can also exploit divisions. He can see the SPD, the junior partner in the coalition, trying to manoeuvre itself once again into the party of detente, knowing this will be electorally popular, particularly in the old East Germany.<br></p> <p>But faced by the scar of Aleppo, even Rolf M\u00fctzenich, the party\u2019s deputy floor leader in the Bundestag and an opponent of Nato\u2019s buildup against Moscow, harshly criticised SPD \u201crapprochement romantics\u201d last year and warned against the \u201cmisconception that old-style <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/26/angela-merkel-farewell-ostpolitik-putin-threat-europe\">Ostpolitik</a></em> was possible following the annexation of Crimea\u201d.</p> <p>The Greens\u2019 foreign policy spokesman, Omid Nouripour, is more confrontational, calling for the end of Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline that will make Germany even more dependent on Russian energy. He has called for sanctions against the bosses of Rosneft and Gazprom, the two firms that will benefit from the pipeline\u2019s construction.</p> <p>Manfred Weber, the head of the Conservative European Peoples party group in the European parliament, declared: \u201cAppeasement of Russia has failed. As long as Putin is shelling civilians, he cannot be a partner.\u201d But Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU is reluctant to impose sanctions over Syria, arguing they only have an effect in the long term, and Aleppo requires an immediate solution.</p> <p>The German chancellor, who has probably devoted more hours to the Putin relationship than any other western politician, is exasperated. She is a dealmaker, but in 2014 \u2013 following a conversation with Putin on Ukraine\u2019s annexation \u2013 she told Obama that the Russian president was \u201cliving in a different world\u201d. But a second round of sanctions in an election year is not attractive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d65f1d6b97ba0d4b25e5c79196b7a5ad4a56f938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d65f1d6b97ba0d4b25e5c79196b7a5ad4a56f938/0_265_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin.

Tony Brenton, Britain\u2019s ambassador to Moscow from 2004 to 2008, calls for realism. He argues that the post-war international system \u2013 or \u201cliberal hegemony\u201d as he puts it \u2013 no longer works. \u201cWe have failed with Russia and we are failing with China,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brenton\u2019s answer is to accept the limits of 21st-century western influence. \u201cWe are going to have to moderate our own ambitions. We can defend ourselves. We can protect our interests. But telling other bad countries how they should behave is less and less possible,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was an accepted game.

There is no accepted language.</p> <footer> <cite>Diplomat</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On Syria and \u201cthe whole mess in the Middle East\u201d, Brenton said that there was not a lot the west could do. He said Putin\u2019s goal was to gain a clear military victory in Aleppo so he can negotiate with the US and its allies from a position of strength. In this scenario, Washington would be left with \u201cunattractive options\u201d.</p> <h2>The US: \u2018We took our eye off the ball\u2019</h2> <p>Throughout his presidency, Barack Obama has viewed Russia largely through the prism of its ailing economy and early on concluded Moscow was essentially a weak adversary trying to compensate for its impotence with shows of military bravado. Putin was \u201cpursuing 19th-century policies with 20th-century weapons in the 21st century\u201d, the president told at least one foreign visitor.</p> <p>During his 2012 re-election campaign, when his opponent Mitt Romney suggested Russia might be the country\u2019s \u201cNo 1 geopolitical foe\u201d, the president led the derision.</p> <p>\u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the cold war\u2019s been over for 20 years,\u201d Obama said in one of the presidential debates.</p> <p>More recently, he has adjusted his rhetoric to claim Putin was over-stretching Moscow\u2019s capacity and would ultimately become trapped in Syria as the US was trapped in Iraq and Afghanistan. The word \u201cquagmire\u201d began to appear more frequently in the talking points being distributed by senior administration officials.</p> <p>A President Clinton would take a more hawkish view, and she would find support in the Senate. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee and a Russia specialist, said the US needed to revisit its whole approach to Russia. He said: \u201cThrough its words and deeds, it appears Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is not a partner for peace.\u201d</p> <p>That view has extended to the US military. General Tommy Franks, head of the US army, said: \u201cI think we were all optimistic. Perhaps [we] misread certain things, but also in the last 15 years our focus has been on Iraq and Afghanistan. We reduced the volume of people who could speak and read Russian. We were so busy trying to produce Arabic and Pashto speakers. We took our eye off the ball.\u201d</p> <h2>What\u2019s next? How the west could respond to Russian threats </h2> <p>The EU, in search of a policy response, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/may-european-leaders-stop-russian-atrocities-syria-brexi\">reaching again for sanctions</a>. They have been estimated to have cost the Russian economy $280bn in capital inflows and to be taking roughly 0.5% a year off the GDP. In a society devoid of internal political and institutional constraints on the behaviour of the elite, extended sanctions could weaken Putin\u2019s grip on power.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ef3dc036243a75f442fb2507ebaa21cdc873e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef3dc036243a75f442fb2507ebaa21cdc873e81/169_69_2831_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Putin (left) and Obama on the sidelines of the G20 summit in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putin (left) and Obama on the sidelines of the G20 summit in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexei Druzhinin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Lough, a Chatham House associate fellow, said sanctions now needed to be extended to target the individuals responsible for and contributing to the policies designed to destabilise the EU\u2019s eastern neighbours.</p> <p>\u201cThese should include all senior civilian and military officials in occupied Crimea, the heads of Russian state media as well as editors, news presenters and reporters engaged in state propaganda operations designed to provide falsified reporting of western policies towards Russia and neighbouring countries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bill Browder, a former investment banker whose lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in Russian custody in 2009, is another exponent of sanctions. Magnitsky was jailed after exposing a $230m tax fraud carried out by corrupt Russian officials and involving taxes paid by Browder\u2019s firm, Hermitage Capital.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you do is go after Putin\u2019s wealth and the wealth of his country,\u201d Browder said. \u201cPutin has been a kleptocrat all his life.\u201d Browder suggests dramatically increasing the US and EU sanctions list, which already features Putin\u2019s cronies but should be expanded to the \u201c10,000 people who\u2019ve stolen all the money\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/russia-should-be-investigated-for-syrian-war-crimes-says-boris-johnson\">Russia should be investigated for Syrian war crimes, says Boris Johnson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next step, Browder said, was to cut Russia off from Swift, the international banking payment system. Iranian banks were disconnected in 2012 \u2013 a move that forced Tehran to negotiate over its nuclear programme. Many Russian state banks are vulnerable to collapse.</p> <p>But ultimately the key decisions will be taken in the new White House. Anthony Cordesman, a strategic analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the new administration must confront three realities. \u201cFirst, Russia is a now broad strategic rival and is likely to remain so at least as long as Putin is in power. Second, the US can\u2019t rebalance to Asia away from Europe or the Middle East. And third, short of being chased off the stage, the United States will have to play out a weak hand in Syria to limit and contain Russian influence.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are no easy answers to the Russians,\u201d said a Washington-based European diplomat. \u201cThey are deploying such aggressive rhetoric and policy. During the cold war there was an accepted vocabulary between the sides. There was a game, there was an accepted game,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cNow the danger is there is no order.

On Saturday, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, promised to block it because it would \u201cdestroy democracy\u201d. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, said he was \u201cpro-competition\u201d.</p> <p>The companies\u2019 bosses announced late on Saturday night that they had signed a deal \u2013 the biggest corporate takeover of the year \u2013 which was a \u201cperfect match\u201d of firms to \u201cbring a fresh approach to how the media and communications industry works\u201d.</p> <p>The deal, unanimously approved by both companies\u2019 boards, values Time Warner at $107.50 a share \u2013 a 20% premium on its closing price on Friday. It unites a historic phone company that traces its roots back more than 130 years to Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, with the producer of some of the world\u2019s most popular movies and TV shows, including Veep and Game of Thrones.</p> <p>AT&amp;T and Time Warner would have combined market value of more than $310bn. If the deal goes through and the companies aren\u2019t forced to sell assets, it would have AT&amp;T\u2019s assets of more than 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-TV subscribers through DirecTV, which AT&amp;T bought for $50bn in 2015, as well as Time Warner\u2019s extensive collection of Hollywood movies and TV channels and productions. Time Warner owns Warner Brothers (Harry Potter and Batman) as well as HBO, CNN and DC Comics. It also holds a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T\u2019s chief executive, who will lead the combined company, said the corporate tie-up would transform consumers\u2019 experience of watching media on their phones at a time when many young people are giving up on pay TV. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe premium content is always going to win,\u201d he said, on a late night conference call announcing the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s been true on the big screen, the TV screen and we believe it is true on the mobile screen.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we combine Time Warner content with our scale and distribution \u2026 we\u2019re going to have something really special.\u201d</p> <p>The deal faces the prospect of a tough battle with politicians and regulators fearful that such a tie-up could lead to less consumer choice, higher prices and a possible threat to media plurality.<br></p> <p>Trump has vowed to block the deal if he wins next month\u2019s election. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/donald-trump-gettysburg-contract-with-america-sue-accusers-hillary-clinton\">a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>, on Saturday, he said it would give the combined company \u201ctoo much concentration of power\u201d.<br></p> <p>Speaking about his continuing battle with the \u201cdishonest mainstream media\u201d, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people.</p> <p>\u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said he would also consider \u201cbreaking\u201d up the last big media deal, Comcast\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/13/comcast-general-electric-nbc-universal-rockefeller-plaza?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+%28Media%29\">acquisition of NBC Universal in 2013</a>. \u201cDeals like this destroy democracy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Sunday, Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to Trump, said the deal was evidence of the \u201cmonopoly power of media conglomerates\u201d. \u201cAT&amp;T, the original and abusive \u201cMa Bell\u201d telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly anti-Trump CNN,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cDonald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few.\u201d</p> <p>Hillary Clinton did not immediately comment but she has promised to bring in tougher scrutiny on big corporations. Earlier this month she vowed to \u201cstrengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinise mergers and acquisitions, so the big don\u2019t keep getting bigger and bigger\u201d. </p> <p>Kaine told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m pro-competition. Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon later told reporters there were \u201ca number of questions and concerns\u201d about the deal but said that more needed to be known \u201cbefore any conclusions should be reached.\u201d </p> <p>Al Franken, a Democratic senator for Minnesota and regular critic of other cable and media tie-ups, said: \u201cI\u2019m skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices and even worse service for consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, said in a joint statement: \u201cAn acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Lee later said a hearing would be held sometime this year.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are also likely to review the deal, which comes shortly after cable provider Comcast took full control of NBC Universal. It is expected that the combined AT&amp;T/Time Warner group will have to promise to provide competitor content the same access to its customers as its own content.</p> <p>Disney executives have called for \u201cvery close regulatory scrutiny\u201d of the deal. </p> <p>Stephenson, who said he hoped the deal would be completed next year, said he did not expect any significant challenge from regulators as AT&amp;T is not buying up a direct competitor but adding to its business by purchasing a supplier. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not a horizontal deal.

  "<p>Everybody has fear,\u201d says Albert Woodfox. \u201cFear is the soul telling the body that it\u2019s in danger. Some people overcome that fear. I overcame it by having a cause. That\u2019s what the party told me: always be honourable, always serve the people.\u201d Woodfox, now a grizzled 69-year-old, has had more reasons to be afraid than most, and when he says that he has known \u201cmore pain and suffering than any human being should be asked to suffer\u201d, he is not exaggerating. At the hands of the American penal and judicial system he has endured wrongful imprisonment and deprivation of basic needs to a degree that seems outlandish in an advanced democracy. Yet his experience is not unique. It is an extreme version of something inflicted on thousands of others, and it is on behalf of these others that, he says, he continues to fight.</p> <p>This February, as he puts it, \u201cI walked through the gates of hell into freedom.\u201d He was released from 45 years incarceration, almost 44 of them in solitary confinement, for most of the time in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola prison. Originally imprisoned for armed robbery, he was later sentenced for the fatal stabbing in 1972 of a prison guard called Brent Miller, a conviction ruled unsafe three times by a federal judge. Together with two other prisoners subjected to decades of solitary, Robert King and Herman Wallace, Woodfox was one of the \u201cAngola Three\u201d, whose treatment provoked <a href=\"http://angola3.org/\">sustained campaigns for their release</a> . Wallace was convicted along with Woodfox for Miller\u2019s murder, King for a separate murder of another prisoner, of which he was eventually cleared.</p> <p>Even had he been guilty of Miller\u2019s murder, decades of solitary confinement would be an exceptionally sadistic punishment, one <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097#.WAiWPdfd79I\">defined as \u201ctorture\u201d by the United Nations</a>. Woodfox believes it was inflicted on him because he joined the Black Panthers in prison, the \u201cparty\u201d to which he refers. \u201cI know how many times they offered that if I gave up my party they\u2019d let me out of solitary. Each time I told them, get out of my face.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From my mom I inherited values and principles that I was able to use: loyalty and devotion, education and discipline</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The phrase \u201csolitary confinement\u201d might suggest total isolation, a blank-walled cell with a lightbulb, food pushed through a slot in the wall, a condition which over any length of time would destroy anyone. Woodfox is at pains to say that in Angola his was not this \u201cHollywood\u201d version but rather 23 hours a day locked into an 9ft by 6ft (2.7 metres by 1.8 metres) cell, barred at one end, in a tier of \u201c14, 15, 16\u201d similar cells. Some communication was possible with neighbours, even if he could not see them, or with other inmates on their way to the showers. The Angola Three made themselves chess sets out of twisted toilet paper and played games by shouting moves to each other. Woodfox would also walk repeatedly up and down his three-yard-long universe in an effort to keep fit.</p> <p>The former attorney general of Louisiana James \u201cBuddy\u201d Caldwell has tried to argue that this wasn\u2019t really solitary at all, on the basis of the limited human contact allowed \u2013 that, rather than being absolutely unsurvivable, it was merely almost so. The United Nations disagrees with his definition and says that no form of solitary confinement should be imposed for more than 15 days \u2013 that is, about a thousandth of Woodfox\u2019s punishment \u2013 after which some of the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible. CCR, or closed cell restricted, to give the term preferred by the prison system, is incomprehensibly harsh. Some inmates, none of whom suffered it as long as Woodfox did, curled themselves up in foetal positions, others screamed. \u201cThat may seem good,\u201d says Woodfox of the fact he could talk to other prisoners, \u201cbut given the nature of some of these guys driven insane, sometimes it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4192956eb15158f36a9d315fc02bb5e4230caf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4192956eb15158f36a9d315fc02bb5e4230caf7/0_0_3200_4000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Woodfox, less than 24 hours after his release from the Louisiana State Penitentiary.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Woodfox, less than 24 hours after his release from the Louisiana State Penitentiary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/New York Times/Redux/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He himself suffered panic attacks \u2013 sweating, a feeling of being smothered that obliged him to sleep sitting up. So he was not unscathed, but with the two other members of the Angola Three \u201ccame to the conclusion that we were going to survive\u201d. They taught themselves criminal law and civil law and committed themselves to fighting for their own and others\u2019 causes. \u201cFrom my mom,\u201d Woodfox also says, \u201cI inherited values and principles that I was able to use: loyalty and devotion, education and discipline. I was able to self-educate, to define who I was.\u201d How did he get the books? \u201cIn prison there\u2019s always a black market system.\u201d</p> <p>The Angola Three would fight for better conditions in the prison \u2013 for example, for access to TV, newspapers and occasional exercise that was initially denied them, and against the degrading way in which their food was pushed into their cell along the ground, under the wall of bars. They used hunger strikes if necessary, \u201cthe most effective but the most brutal way\u201d. They would campaign for their own release and against wider injustices in American society. \u201cWe argued, but we never broke faith,\u201d Woodfox says in <a href=\"http://\"><em>Cruel and Unusual</em></a>, a feature documentary about the Angola Three that will be shown on Channel 4 later this year. \u201cWe could die in prison if that\u2019s what it took. Once you break that spirit, you can\u2019t get it back.\u201d</p> <p>Now he sits in the Washington flat (contemporary in style, greyish-white, subdued) of one of his loyal band of supporters, where he is staying in the brief pause between one public event in the nation\u2019s capital and another in Chicago. He combines an astonishing level of outward calm and peace with a sense of something held in. He is both polite and frank but also seems removed, as his way of dealing with his drastic experiences. Above all, he seems to be maintaining the ferocious self-discipline that kept him sane inside. \u201cI still have claustrophobic attacks, panic attacks,\u201d he says, \u201cI still get angry. I just choose to use my anger as a means for changing things\u201d.</p> <p>He has had the Rip Van Winkle experience of leaving society in one era and re-entering it in another, except that he didn\u2019t find that racial politics in the United States had made as much progress as you might think. It was as if the hair, fashion and music of 1971 were still the same, only in the field of social relations. \u201cSo far,\u201d he says of the state of America before and after his imprisonment, \u201cmy observation is that while there appear to be changes in the country, the changes that did occur are really superficial.\u201d He sees the successes of Donald Trump as evidence: \u201cHe has made racism and bigotry legitimate. He is not going to go away if he loses. It will take another generation to get rid of this kind of garbage.\u201d</p> <p>As far as Woodfox is concerned, he has been grappling with racism all his life, ever since he grew up in New Orleans. He also admits faults of his own. \u201cA lot of people have no idea how African Americans lived in the 60s,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority lived in ghettoes, the majority couldn\u2019t get jobs or else they got worse paid for the same jobs than white people did. I was a petty criminal at one time. It was a way to survive at times of desperation. I wasn\u2019t stealing just to steal, I would steal to bring food into the house. Other than that, it was bullshit things like stealing a car. But I was still a predator on my own people.\u201d</p> <p>Then he was sent to Angola, 140 miles inland from New Orleans, the largest maximum security prison in the US and a place whose notorious horrors have long exercised a special fascination on writers, film-makers and reformers. It occupies a former plantation \u2013 its name refers to the place of origin of its slaves \u2013 and following the civil war was owned by a former Confederate major who ran it along lines very like its former existence. African Americans sent there on often slender pretexts were forced to work its fields for the profit of its owners, in a way barely distinguishable from slavery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When society looks the other way, the judicial system becomes judge, jury and executioner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite periodic attempts at reform, a recitative of outrage about Angola sounds through the decades, in magazines, books and newspapers. Its regime was \u201cprobably as close to slavery as any person could come in 1930\u201d. In 1952 it was \u201cthe worst prison in America\u201d. In the 1960s it was \u201cthe bloodiest prison in the south\u201d. In 1971 the American Bar Association said that its conditions were \u201cmedieval, squalid and horrifying\u201d. \u201cEvery week,\u201d says Woodfox, \u201csomeone there was killed or seriously injured.\u201d \u201cI know guys in Angola\u201d, he also says, \u201cwho have been there 40 years for having a bag of dope.\u201d In this telling, given that prisoners still work in its farms and factories for minimal pay, 200-year-old habits are dying hard.</p> <p>Woodfox states his innocence of the armed robbery charge that had him sent to Angola: \u201cI lent my car to my friend and he was involved in a shoot-out with the police.\u201d Inside the prison, he started protesting for better conditions. He joined the Black Panthers, the revolutionary black nationalist movement that had reached the peak of its fame and influence in the late 1960s. Woodfox had encountered them in New York while on the run from imprisonment, and been inspired by the confidence and empowerment, until then unfamiliar to him, with which he saw the party\u2019s young black men speak. In Angola he followed the Panthers\u2019 model of self-defence: \u201cWe were organising against racism and against corruption.\u201d They fought, for example, the appropriation by security staff of food and clothing meant for prisoners.</p> <p>He helped start \u201canti-rape squads\u201d. \u201cEvery Thursday \u2013 you call it Fresh Fish Day \u2013 when new arrivals come by bus and get assigned to various camps. Guys would gang up on them, trick them into accepting gifts and then demand payment, which they can\u2019t pay. So they\u2019d say \u2018you\u2019ve got to be my gal-boy\u2019. They\u2019d make them into prostitutes, rent them out.\u201d Sometimes \u201cit would be two or three guys on one man\u201d. Sometimes victims would die as a result of their assaults. Woodfox says that the guards knew about it, but they were paid off.</p> <p>He and his allies would \u201clook for first-timers when they got off the bus and try and educate them.\u201d He says they were \u201cloved and respected\u201d by other inmates, but \u201cthe predators hated our guts\u201d. The anti-rape squads were threatened with weapons. \u201cThey said \u2018it\u2019s not your business\u2019. We said \u2018we\u2019re making it our business\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Then Brent Miller, 23 years old and married for two months to 17-year-old Teenie, was killed, stabbed 38 times with a knife and a sharpened lawnmower blade. \u201cI never met him, I never talked with him,\u201d says Woodfox. \u201cI was in the dining hall eating breakfast.\u201d He had witnesses to back him up. The prosecution\u2019s chief witness was Hezekiah Brown, a serial rapist serving life without parole, who was described as a \u201cprofessional snitch\u201d by a fellow inmate and of whom a deputy warden of the prison would say \u201cHezekiah was one you could put words into his mouth\u201d. Having first said that he did not witness the crime, he was offered privileges, luxuries such as cigarettes and ultimately freedom <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96255685\">to testify against Woodfox and Wallace</a>. He was <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96199165\">threatened with solitary if he did not</a>.</p> <p>Bloody fingerprints at the scene of the crime matched neither of the accused\u2019s and no effort was made to find out whose they were, out of the limited pool of prisoners. Later, during the protracted appeals against their convictions, DNA evidence that might have exonerated Woodfox and Wallace went missing. Among those unconvinced by the evidence would be Miller\u2019s widow, Teenie. \u201cBrent was my whole life,\u201d she later said, \u201che was witty, handsome and talented. He sang and played the drums. He was an all-round good soul.\u201d But she became \u201cvery, very angry\u201d that, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/03/wife-murdered- prison- guard-urges- justice-man- placed-solitary- years-ago/\">in her view, the wrong men were convicted</a>.</p> <p>Woodfox and Wallace were tried separately in the court house in St Francisville, which, as the place where many of the penitentiary\u2019s large staff live, is almost a company town. All-white juries, who had not been told of Brown\u2019s incentives, found them guilty. Woodfox and Wallace were put in solitary, in principle a short-term disciplinary measure. It has to be renewed after 90 days, which it was, again and again, until the days turned into years and decades. \u201cThey were saying we were physically dangerous to ourselves or others,\u201d says Woodfox, \u201cthey didn\u2019t let us out because of our reputation, that the young would copy us\u2026 bullsh-i-i-i-i-t.\u201d During this time, to fast-forward more than half a lifetime of legal agonies, dragged out by the authorities to a barely credible degree, the following landmark dates stand out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/chelsea-manning-solitary-confinement-suicide-attempt-military\">Chelsea Manning emerges from solitary confinement after suicide attempt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1992 Woodfox\u2019s conviction was overturned. In 1993 he was indicted again and for some reason he had to wait until 1998 before a retrial, at which point he was convicted again. The jury\u2019s forewoman at the time of the reindictment was Anne Butler, formerly married to a former Angola warden, Murray Henderson, and author of a book in which she stated her belief in the guilt of the accused. Even she, it was reported, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96199165\">wondered why she was allowed on the jury</a>.</p> <p>Woodfox\u2019s second conviction was overturned in 2008 by James J Brady, senior federal judge for the Middle District of Louisiana, and then reinstated in 2010 by a higher court, the Fifth Circuit. It was overturned again in 2013, a decision upheld in 2014 by the Fifth Circuit. In 2015 the state indicted Woodfox for the third time after which Judge Brady issued a rare writ banning a retrial, on the basis that the state were unlikely to give him a fair trial, that key witnesses were all dead and that Woodfox\u2019s age and health meant that he too might die before the process was concluded. The state appealed and in November 2015 the Fifth <a href=\"http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_05fbfe11-86e8-5aab-8d7e-f15fad6f8e23.html\">found Brady\u2019s writ excessive</a>, a judgment then appealed by Woodfox.</p> <p>Early this year, on the advice of his lawyers and in order to end the interminable legal struggle, he reached an agreement with the state whereby he pleaded no contest to its charges and was released on his birthday, 19 February. This wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cThe internal struggle for me was,\u201d he recently said, \u201cI had spent 43 years of my life never backing down, never compromising what I believe in.\u201d But \u201csomehow my daughter and my grandkids and great grandkids coming to visit gave me the strength to say, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re not compromising on anything. It\u2019s not a plea of guilt. This is a plea for freedom.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in 2001, Robert King\u2019s conviction was overturned and he was released. Herman Wallace had his conviction overturned in 2013 but, even though he was in the final stages of liver cancer, the prison still prevaricated about his release. Only under the threat of being charged with contempt of court did they let him out. He was reindicted by the state two days later. The day after that he died.</p> <p>During this time the Angola Three became famous for the injustice of their cases and the cruelty to which they were subjected. Their story became the centre of the ongoing campaign to end solitary confinement and the International Coalition to Free the Angola Three was created. The founder of The Body Shop, Anita Roddick, championed their cause and her husband Gordon continued to do so after her death.</p> <p>The Angola Three endured, day after day, the extreme deprivations and arbitrary humiliations of CCR. Woodfox\u2019s mother and sister died while he was inside, and he was banned from attending their funerals. His brother Michael survives, and visited every month even when displaced by Hurricane Katrina \u2013 even when it required a five- or six-hour drive for the two hours\u2019 visiting time permitted by the prison.</p> <p>The Angola Three were subjected to routine strip and anal cavity searches, sometimes six times a day, until in 1978, their lawsuit to have them restricted was successful. In 2013 the searches started on Woodfox again, requiring another court order that was then appealed by the state. I ask if there were exceptions to what appears to be a story of unmitigated official brutality. \u201cThere are exceptions, people who are able to hold on to their humanity, who are able to avoid the <em>Robocop</em> syndrome. But absolute power corrupts. Prison guards have absolute power because they realise they can do pretty much what they want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020bbddd84310f078b437d4d12c76f93aac09d5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020bbddd84310f078b437d4d12c76f93aac09d5b/0_251_2396_1437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Woodfox leaves prison with his brother Michel Mable, who visited him every month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Woodfox leaves prison with his brother Michel Mable, who visited him every month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billy Sothern/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Angola, he also says, \u201cyou have families that go back generations. They graduate from high school and a week later, they work in Angola. It keeps a tradition going. They become part of the system. Who knows how long it\u2019s been going on?\u201d</p> <p>Of course, those responsible for the Angola Three\u2019s confinement see things differently. One is the devout Southern Baptist Burl Cain, who was warden of Angola from 1992 until he stood down on 1 January this year, under allegations that <a href=\"http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_d6826c2e-136d-5a19-a62d-fcf3383887e6.html\">he inappropriately entered into business deals with relatives of inmates</a>. Described by <em>The Economist</em> as <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/01/story-cain\">\u201ca rockstar of the correctional world\u201d</a>, he won fame and praise for reducing Angola\u2019s rates of violence. In his words, he \u201ctransformed this place from a facility of violence and despair to one of peace and morality\u201d, a task he set about with what one prisoner called \u201ca Bible in one hand and a sword in the other\u201d or what the Baptist Press called <a href=\"http://www.bpnews.net/46003/angola-warden-burl-cain-slates-jan-1-retirement\">\u201ca firm hand and a strong love for Jesus.\u201d</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-membership\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/life-in-solitary-confinement-the-story-of-the-angola-3-28047089600\">Life in solitary confinement: the story of the Angola 3</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://louisianajusticeinstitute.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/angola-warden-burl-cain-on-black.html\">Interviewed in 2008 by Woodfox\u2019s attorney Nick Trenticosta</a>, Cain cited a 1973 letter in which the prisoner called violent revolution \u201ca highly necessary occurrence in life\u201d. Trenticosta asked if the passage of time, years of good behaviour and the overturning of his second conviction counted for anything. \u201cHe\u2019s just good because he is locked in CCR,\u201d said Cain, \u201cnot because he\u2019s good at heart\u2026 Because the lion in a cage can\u2019t cause much trouble, you see.\u201d Trenticosta asked Cain to assume \u201cif you can\u201d that Woodfox was innocent of Miller\u2019s killing. \u201cI would still keep him in CCR. I still know that he is still trying to practise Black Pantherism, and I still would not want him walking around my prison, because he would organise the young new inmates.\u201d</p> <p>The most persistent adversary of the Angola Three is <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/03/36-years-solitude\">Buddy Caldwell</a>, attorney general of Louisiana until he was voted out last year amid accusations of what his opponent called <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/incumbent_caldwell_under_ attac.html\">\u201ccronyism, nepotism and corruption\u201d</a>. It was under his direction that the state fought so hard to keep Woodfox in prison, where he would probably still be today if Caldwell were still in office. \u201cThis is the most dangerous person on the planet,\u201d Caldwell has said, and \u201cI oppose letting him out with every fibre of my being.\u201d He has stated his complete faith in the process that led to Woodfox and Wallace\u2019s convictions and has praised Hezekiah Brown\u2019s courage for testifying in the face of possible intimidation.</p> <p>Miller\u2019s siblings, unlike his widow, believe in Woodfox and Wallace\u2019s guilt and opposed his release. There is also a website, the <a href=\"http://www.odmp.org/officer/9311-corrections- sergeant-brent- miller angola\">Officer Down Memorial Page</a>, which remembers \u201call of law enforcement\u2019s heroes\u201d: it simply states, without reference to the vacated convictions, that he was killed by members of the Black Panthers, \u201ca racist, radical group that professed the murders of law enforcement officers\u201d. But Woodfox and Wallace\u2019s accusers have failed, over decades of legal scrutiny, to make their case without glaring flaws.</p> <p>Central to the case of the Angola Three are the fears and emotions that the Black Panthers still arouse, 50 years after their founding and more than 30 years after they faded away in the early 80s. J Edgar Hoover called them \u201cthe greatest threat to the internal security of the country\u201d and, as is now known, set about destabilising them, getting its leaders locked up and, if desired, killed. In this context, where someone like Woodfox is deemed a threat to the future of the US, the attitudes and practices of someone like Cain become, though not justifiable, explicable.</p> <p>It is also is a matter of record that Black Panthers advocated violence and expressed sympathy for the likes of Stalin, Mao Zedong and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/black-panthers-north-korea-us-imperialism\">the regime of North Korea</a>. As well as fighting flagrant injustice and founding free food and health programmes for the poor, some of its factions resorted to criminal gangsterism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/18/black-powers-coolest-radicals-black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution-stanley-nelson-interview\">included murder, torture and rape among their methods</a>. Now that Woodfox is free and dedicated to campaigning, I ask him if he means to do this by legal and democratic means. \u201cThat\u2019s the culture and tradition of America,\u201d he answers. Of the letter cited by Cain, he says that he wasn\u2019t \u201cadvocating revolution, just explaining what it would entail\u201d.</p> <p>But he is not going to disavow the party, and the day before our interview he shared a platform in a Washington convention centre with Bobby Seale, who with Huey Newton founded the Panthers. Rather, he sees campaigns like Black Lives Matter, with which he is involved, as \u201can extension of what the Black Panther Party was\u201d. They want \u201cwhat our ancestors have always been asking for, just to be equal\u201d. To achieve this \u201cwe have to do something different, because we are too predictable. We\u2019re not even allowed the right to resist. If we do, we\u2019re criminals.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/apr/27/6x9-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement\">6\u00d79: A virtual experience of solitary confinement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was, he says, \u201cso disappointing when I got out to find that conditions when I left 45 years ago are still here. With the first black president, everyone thought we had reached a milestone, but it just looked different.\u201d If, he continues \u201cAmerica has nothing else to thank Donald Trump for, it is to show that racism is very much alive. He didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. I thought the battle would be economic, not sick-assed philosophy about racism 45 years later.\u201d</p> <p>And so he is travelling and speaking, jetting from one American city to another to speak of his experiences and to fight, along with Robert King, for \u201cthe abolishment of solitary confinement and freedom for political prisoners\u201d \u2013 and political prisoners is what he believes many of those incarcerated in America to be \u2013 \u201cwho remain victims of the criminal injustice system in the USA.\u201d Apart from his fugitive trip to New York, he had never been out of Louisiana until this year, but now he travels from coast to coast and north to south, and is coming to Britain next month for a multi-city tour. All this from a man who came out of jail with hepatitis C, diabetes, renal failure and hypertension. His health has improved dramatically in the months of his freedom, partly due to receiving treatments denied him inside.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some kind of civil oversight,\u201d he says, \u201cto hold the administration accountable. When society looks the other way then the judicial system, from police to the courts to the prisons, becomes judge, jury and executioner.\u201d The treatment of people like himself \u201cis more than a legal issue, it\u2019s a moral issue. It\u2019s no different to what they do in other countries that we call dictatorships. We just have a more sophisticated way of doing it.\u201d</p> <p>He gets support from the people who campaigned for his release, from fellow activists, and especially from his brother \u2013 \u201cmy rock\u201d \u2013 who is all that is left of the family he grew up with. But in general he likes to downplay the drama of his transition and to stress that, through continuing the activism that he started inside prison, his move to life outside was made easier. \u201cThere\u2019s some residue, but it doesn\u2019t dominate my life. I was not connected to the prison system. I did not have to break a lot of ties to the prison culture. I was already free in my mind. There was more like a physical adjustment. I had to learn to live beyond a 9ft cell.\u201d Has he even had a holiday since his release in February? \u201cI went to Yosemite. I read a lot of <em>National Geographic</em> in prison and I had a lifetime desire to go there. It was overwhelming.\u201d</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>The European Freedom Tour: see Albert Woodfox talk</h2> <p>Albert Woodfox and his fellow surviving member of the Angola Three, Robert King, will visit the UK and France next month, kicking off on 1 November with the launch of Amnesty UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/write-for-rights/\">Write for Rights</a> campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0083fc499a5886ae8fe817c3d309bf9afe7bceb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0083fc499a5886ae8fe817c3d309bf9afe7bceb7/1973_287_4171_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Woodfox is greeted by Robert King during Woodfox\u2019s first post-release appearance in New Orleans, February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Woodfox is greeted by Robert King during Woodfox\u2019s first post-release appearance in New Orleans, February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Becherer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Thursday 3 November, Liverpool</strong><br>John Foster Building, John Moores University, 80-98 Mount Pleasant, L3 5UZ, 5.30pm. <a href=\"https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/events/ccse-angola-3\">Click here to reserve your free place.</a> </p> <p><strong>Friday 4 November, Manchester</strong><br>Brooks Building, Faculty of Education, Metropolitan University, 53 Bonsall St, M15 6GX, 5.30pm. <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/black-power-and-the-struggle-for-freedom-the-story-of-the-angola-3-tickets-28650793294\">Click here to reserve your free place.</a></p> <p><strong>Monday 7 November, London (Guardian event)</strong><br>Simon Hattenstone talks to Albert Woodfox and Robert King on the eve of the US election.
