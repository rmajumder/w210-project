  "<p>A year from now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\" title=\"\">Germany</a> will be in the final stages of a general election that will shape European politics for the rest of this decade and beyond. With 12 months still to go, the question of whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> will lead her centre-right CDU party into that election is the great unknown. Mrs Merkel has been chancellor for 11 years and is nearing the end of her third term. She is globally respected and generally popular with voters, but she cannot go on forever. Her handling of the refugee question has shaken up German politics and damaged (though in some quarters burnished) her mystique, causing speculation that the Merkel era may be nearing its end.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\" title=\"\">The weekend elections</a> in Germany\u2019s most north-eastern region, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, were the latest lightning-rod for post-Merkel speculation, given a special twist by the fact that the chancellor herself sits for the region. <a href=\"http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2016-09-04-LT-DE-MV/index.shtml\" title=\"\">The results on Sunday</a> were unquestionably bad for the CDU, whose vote fell by 4% from 23% to 19%, slipping into third place behind the centre-left SPD on 31% and the anti-migrant AfD on 21%. The region will continue to be governed by a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of SPD and CDU, similar to the one that Mrs Merkel leads at federal level. Yet the setback has triggered the once unmentionable subject of the CDU adopting a&#xa0;new leader in time for the general election.</p> <p>Objectively, there is not much basis for such speculation. The 4% fall in the CDU share in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern does not, on its own, justify real panic. All major parties lost vote share on Sunday. The AfD\u2019s genuinely spectacular success has also been drawn from all parties, including from the Left party and the SPD. More enduringly, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not typical of Germany as a whole. It is one of the poorest regions in the country and formerly part of communist East Germany. Markedly the strongest vote for the AfD, moreover, <a href=\"http://wahlen.mvnet.de/dateien/atlanten/ergebnisse.2016/landtagswahl.html\" title=\"\">was in the extreme east</a>, the poorest part of all. It&#xa0;has been a long time since the former DDR was the CDU stronghold that it was in the aftermath of German reunification.</p> <p>It is of course true that the results in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern illustrate political trends that can be seen all over Europe, including Germany. Anti-migrant feeling has risen everywhere, as has racial tension. Dissatisfaction with national governments is widespread and hostility to the European Union has grown. But these trends take different and nuanced forms in each country and in each region of each country. Mrs Merkel is admired as well as disliked for her handling of the migrant situation. It is misleading to see everything in European domestic politics through the single prism of&#xa0;Brexit \u2013 or any other preoccupation.</p> <p>Nevertheless there is absolutely no doubt that this result will be weighed alongside those in the upcoming regional contests in Lower Saxony and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_state_election,_2016\" title=\"\">Berlin</a> to form a general view of Mrs Merkel\u2019s standing as the general election draws nearer. Nor is there much doubt that a politician who has dominated her country for so long will eventually and rightly come under pressure from a new generation. Mrs Merkel\u2019s weaknesses are under the microscope at the moment. Yet the instinct for stability is strong in Germany and it would be foolish not to remember Mrs Merkel\u2019s great strengths too, especially when there is little evidence yet that a different centre-right leader would win more support.</p>",

He replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Access to the single market is not really up for grabs. It is there for everybody. There are many, many countries, many countries outside the European Union, that do a better job, frankly, of exporting to the single market than we do, even without a trade arrangement. So of course we want to have access to the single market. We don\u2019t need to be a member of it to do it. Indeed, being a member of it has caused some of the problems of sovereignty that this referendum was driven by.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, when the pro-European Tory<strong> Anna Soubry</strong> asked Davis to confirm that he was willing to abandon single market membership, Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I\u2019m saying is that this government is looking at every option. But the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said he did not accept the claim that there was a trade off between getting control of immigration and protecting free trade by remaining in the single market.</strong> It was a false choice, he argued, because it was in the interests of both sides to promote free trade. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9281e4b01f3b27891895#block-57cd9281e4b01f3b27891895\"> 4.46pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system would be \u201cmore rigorous\u201d than a points-based system. </strong>He said Theresa May was \u201cvery clear\u201d in her comments in China earlier.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She was concerned that a points-based system was too open-ended, that it did not actually put a control on the number of people coming to the UK. And therefore she wanted something which sounded like it would be more rigorous not less.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would oppose any attempt to undermine workers\u2019 rights as part of the Brexit settlement.</strong> He said this in response to a question from Labour\u2019s<strong> Angela Eagle</strong> (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9736e4b01f3b278918ba#block-57cd9736e4b01f3b278918ba\">5.05pm)</a> using language very similar to that he used<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html\"> in his ConservativeHome article in July. </a>In that article he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The great British industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. I am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government would have to decide whether or not it wanted to remain part of the European customs union before invoking article 50, starting the formal EU withdrawal process. </strong>(See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9a6ee4b01f3b278918c7#block-57cd9a6ee4b01f3b278918c7\"> 5.20pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say whether the UK would remain part of Europol.</strong> Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asked this. Davis said the government wanted to preserve the relationship with the EU on security matters as best we can. He went on: \u201cOf course we are aiming to maintain that. And that\u2019s the answer.\u201d But he seemed to be making a general point, not answering the specific question about Europol. That is how Cooper interpreted his answer.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/772827185128280064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked if Gov had made decision on whether we shd stay in Europol (fundamental for fighting crime &amp; trafficking).

I will probably be writing that sentence again after David Davis\u2019s Commons statement, and probably quite regularly for the rest of the decade. In truth May and her team may have little idea what the final Brexit settlement will look like and, as they try to craft a deal acceptable to both Nigel Farage, the CBI and the EU, the outcome is likely to emerge slowly and haphazardly. (That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasongroves1/status/745278844135931904\">David Cameron once said a Brexit vote would mean \u201cthree years of Euro-wank.)</a></p> <p> But some of May\u2019s comments were moderately revealing. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May said that leaving the EU would give the UK \u201csome control\u201d over EU migration - suggesting that the restrictions on EU migration might just be partial.</strong> She said that at present the UK could not restrict EU migration. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we will now have an ability to do, which we haven\u2019t had before, is when we come out of the EU, we will be able to have some control on movement of people coming from the EU into the UK, which of course was one element over which we weren\u2019t able to have control before. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is not entirely clear what May meant, but hardline anti-Europeans like Nigel Farage (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0#block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0\">9.33am)</a> are likely to be worried by her tone. My colleague <strong>Alan Travis </strong>says this could be a hint that free movement could remain for EU citizens with job offers in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alantravis40/status/772767292937625600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May says she wants to &quot;gain an element of control&quot; over immigration.

She explained her point with a story about what she learnt when she visited Heathrow to speak to Border Force staff with David Cameron after they took office.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And we talked to Border Force officers there. And we said to them, \u2018What\u2019s the most important thing that we can focus on?\u2019 And they said, \u2018You need to look at the issue of students who come here, who appear to have met the criteria, they don\u2019t speak English, they don\u2019t know which institution they are going to and they don\u2019t know what course it is they\u2019re doing\u2019.

This is what May actually said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You really don\u2019t want to ask a former home secretary about the intricacies of a points-based system because it might take a very long time to answer your question. One of the issues is whether or not points-based systems do work.</p> </blockquote> <p>May said what people wanted was \u201can ability to be able to control the movement of people from the European Union ... not free movement as it has been in the past.\u201d She left reporters with the impression that EU citizens could still take priority over non-EU citizens under the immigration rules that will eventually be adopted post-Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Farage,</strong> the outgoing Ukip leader, has responded this morning by issuing a statement criticising May\u2019s stance. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May\u2019s track record on immigration as Home Secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me. There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May\u2019s reluctance to trigger article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted Leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding. </p> <p>The people were clear in wanting a points-based immigration system which is why so many went out and voted to Leave the European Union. Any watering down from that will lead to real anger.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage also said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d to give EU citizens priority under the post-Brexit immigration rules.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given that myself and others also campaigned for a migration system that would treat all who wanted to come equally, any preference for EU nationals would be totally unacceptable. If the establishment think they can stitch-up Brexit then they better be ready for the huge electoral consequences from a British public who on June 23rd voted for radical political change and now expect it to be delivered without failure.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8147a569d00ec5b6455039bdfe650c31cd3f4500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8147a569d00ec5b6455039bdfe650c31cd3f4500/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cd1e14e4b0c2a396c06d43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T08:09:54.430Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs return to the Commons today after their summer recess and the highlight will be a statement from<strong> David Davis</strong>, the new Brexit secretary, about the government\u2019s plans for leaving the EU.

In a statement released overnight Davis stressed that Britain\u2019s future outside the EU would be marvellous.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit isn\u2019t about making the best of a bad job.

At the 1968 Olympics, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists on the podium as a gesture against racial discrimination while in the 1990s the NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf refused to stand for the anthem, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/rodriguez-yankees-home-hostile-home.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">calling the US flag</a> a \u201csymbol of oppression, of tyranny\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cMy understanding, at least, is he is exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. I think there is a long history of sports figures doing so,\u201d Obama said. </p> <p>Kaepernick has also pledged to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/colin-kaepernick-pledges-1-million-charity-anthem-protest-spreads-n641886\">donate $1m to community projects</a> as he seeks to effect change in the US. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt his sincerity, based on what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI think he cares about some real legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, what he\u2019s done is he\u2019s generated more conversation about some topics that need to be talked about.\u201d</p> <p>There are signs that Kaepernick\u2019s actions are starting to influence other athletes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/colin-kaepernick-eric-reid-kneel-national-anthem-protest-san-francisco-49ers\">His team-mate Eric Reid also sat out the anthem last week</a>, while the first white athlete to join the protest, the US football international Megan Rapinoe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/megan-rapinoe-anthem-protest-colin-kaepernick\">did not stand</a> for the Star-Spangled Banner during a game on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very intentional,\u201d Rapinoe told American Soccer Now after the game. \u201cIt was a little nod to Kaepernick and everything that he\u2019s standing for right now. I think it\u2019s actually pretty disgusting the way he was treated and the way that a lot of the media has covered it and made it about something that it absolutely isn\u2019t. We need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties. It was something small that I could do and something that I plan to keep doing in the future and hopefully spark some meaningful conversation around it. It\u2019s important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this. We don\u2019t need to be the leading voice, of course, but standing in support of them is something that\u2019s really powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s stance is in contrast to the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest\">who has condemned Kaepernick</a>. \u201cI have followed it and I think it\u2019s personally not a good thing,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing, and you know, maybe he should find a country that works better for him. Let him try \u2013 it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick is one of a number of high-profile black quarterbacks, a position that until recently was traditionally dominated by white athletes. In 2013, he led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl, where they lost to the Baltimore Ravens. However, his form has dipped and he lost his place as a starter last season. </p>",

She knows she\u2019d be (only) the third best-looking bartender in the bar, she says.

That\u2019s an odd moment, but also the moment Schumer\u2019s show intersects with what we\u2019ve just seen at Edinburgh: an outpouring of emotional candour from clowns no longer prepared to conceal their tears. For years, cynics have been caustic about the preponderance of \u201cdead dad\u201d shows at Edinburgh \u2013 a catch-all complaint about the supposed obligation to make shows with an emotional or narrative arc that\u2019s anathema (some would say) to standup comedy.

It sometimes felt like it. Or is it a valuable airing of feelings that society prefers us to deny or suppress? Well, it\u2019s that too. It certainly enriches or complicates our expectations of what a comedy show can deliver. In that Schumer moment, when the audience collectively gave her a supportive hug, or the closing stages of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/richard-gadd-review-banshee-labyrinth-edinburgh\">Richard Gadd\u2019s award-winning show</a>, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/22/richard-gadd-edinburgh-festival-fringe-comedy\">talks frankly</a> about the sexual assault he\u2019s spent four years running from, the audience-performer relationship is more about emotional intimacy and support than it is about laughter.<br></p> <p>The difference is, Schumer stumbled upon that connection seemingly by accident. Her show wasn\u2019t structured to foreground her distress or self-loathing \u2013 which were present only as a subtext or low drumbeat beneath the sassier shtick about her sex life, schmoozing with Hillary Clinton, or indeed gun crime. That\u2019s how comedians\u2019 real-world problems traditionally operate in their work: as something occasionally alluded to (although you\u2019re never sure if they\u2019re joking or not); as something to speculate about, or read about in interviews. Maybe the bottling-up of broiling feelings that couldn\u2019t be expressed, gives some acts their comic charge? Or maybe it denied us intimate, insightful comedy shows that those acts never felt it appropriate to make?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer: \u2018I'm not trying to be likable\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I really enjoyed Schumer\u2019s show \u2013 and she\u2019s perhaps a bad example to hang these thoughts on because, by any normal standards, she\u2019s an emotionally intelligent and candid comic.

As an audience member, I\u2019m happy with that. I don\u2019t (always) need the full story: I think the hints, loose ends and contradictions add up to something complex and human, and funny too. But a new context has been established for emotional candour in comedy, and next to its oversharing figureheads, Schumer looks positively coy by comparison.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort near Aberdeen is being sued for breach of privacy and damages by a rambler who was filmed without her consent on the course.</p> <p>A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a retired social worker and environmental activist, has accused Trump\u2019s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course. <br></p> <p>Beyts\u2019s lawyer, Mike Dailly, has accused Trump\u2019s staff of illegally filming and retaining that footage, after the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-scottish-golf-resort-admits-breaching-data-protection-law\">revealed </a><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-scottish-golf-resort-admits-breaching-data-protection-law\">last month</a> that the resort had breached the UK\u2019s strict laws on data protection and privacy.</p> <p>Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by the Republican presidential candidate, admitted it had failed to register with the information commissioner\u2019s office, the UK\u2019s data protection regulator. This was despite operating at least nine CCTV cameras at the resort and holding records on thousands of guests, 95 employees and a large number of contractors and suppliers. </p> <p>The resort also breached official guidelines on using CCTV by failing to display prominent signs warning visitors and guests at the course and its 19-bedroom boutique hotel that they were being filmed. </p> <p>In a statement, TIGCS said the failure to register with the commissioner was a clerical error, and it had submitted its registration on 10 August. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Under Scotland\u2019s wide-ranging laws that uphold public access to open land, Beyts and a friend had used a public footpath across the Trump course to walk past the clubhouse to reach a thick band of sand dunes and beach bordering the course. </p> <p>As they came back from their walk, the pair say there were challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer. </p> <p>Three days later she was visited at home by two Police Scotland officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump\u2019s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight. </p> <p>Beyts, 62, has been a longstanding critic of Trump\u2019s development, and her prosecution raised fresh accusations from Trump\u2019s critics that his staff were deliberately persecuting his opponents and closely monitored their movements on the resort.</p> <p>Dailly, the principal solicitor at Govan Law Centre in Glasgow, said the resort\u2019s admissions raised substantial doubts about the legality of its use and circulation of any video footage, whether taken by a CCTV camera or a smartphone. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the golf course has admitted that they weren\u2019t registered with the ICO,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means they weren\u2019t in a position to be processing people\u2019s data [lawfully] because they weren\u2019t doing it under the auspices of the legislation.\u201d</p> <p>Dailly has written twice to TIGCS advising it that Betys is seeking \u00a33,000 damages under the Data Protection Act for breach of privacy and for being \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d by being filmed. He said Beyts would start court proceedings if the company rejected her damages demand.</p> <p>TIGCS told the Guardian that the complaint was without foundation. \u201cMs Beyts has no claim against us,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cCCTV footage had no part in the police investigation. Her prosecution was based on three eyewitness accounts.\u201d The company did not answer further questions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Scottish spokeswoman, Sarah Malone, told the Sunday Herald in April that the complaint against Beyts was wholly justified. \u201cThis disgusting and shameful act took place in broad daylight in full view of our staff and guests by an individual who has been disruptive in the past,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On 24 May, Beyts received an official warning letter from local prosecutors under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act that put the charges on record for two years, without involving a court hearing, which she has since refused to accept. Her refusal means local prosecutors have six months to take further action.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Beyts said she was not pursuing the case for the money. A keen rambler and outdoors enthusiast, she said the experience in April had left her feeling vulnerable and insecure every time she went for a walk and needed to urinate outside. She now fears she could be filmed anywhere.</p> <p> \u201cIt is absolutely not about the money: it\u2019s about the principle, making sure that people can feel free to walk on a place where they previously they could walk, unmolested, to stop people feeling intimidated.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Free college for 80% of American households? Who couldn\u2019t fall in love with a proposal like that?</p> <p>Plenty of us, it seems. Either Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan to make attending college more affordable by making it free to families of four with incomes of $85,000 or less doesn\u2019t go far enough, or it goes too far.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee can\u2019t seem to get many people to celebrate one of the linchpins of her campaign. Even those on the left view this simply as a watered-down version of what Bernie Sanders proposed in the primary: making all public colleges and universities free to attend for everyone, regardless of income.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s tweaks to the plan recognize the fact that a universal tuition-free system would give the children of affluent families a free ride that they don\u2019t need. But as students head off to campus and parents, wincing, start writing hefty checks, the Clinton plan is fielding attacks not just from disappointed Sanders supporters but also the right and <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-hillary-clinton-college-tuition-20160711-story.html\">even the center</a>.</p> <p>The truth is, the critics may all be right. Like healthcare, higher education in the US is a complex web. Wading in and dramatically altering one part of it \u2013 public colleges and universities and their relationship with the federal government \u2013 without having a detailed plan to address <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/colleges-free-tuition-clinton-226585\">the fallout on another part, private colleges</a>, would be foolish. </p> <p>Some could see enrollment drop sharply and some \u2013 not the Yales and Princetons, but the smaller institutions that play a valuable role \u2013 may have to close their doors. </p> <p>Moreover, what would the plan mean for how different states fund their public institutions? Chaos could follow if such details were not carefully considered \u2013 and even if they are. </p> <p>Consider Obamacare. Yes, millions of previously-uninsured Americans now have access to doctors, but others can no longer see long-time family physicians who don\u2019t accept Obamacare policies while some must switch policies every year as providers drop off exchanges or ratchet up premiums and deductibles.</p> <p>Add to such concerns the fact that the more money the federal government injects into the education system, the higher tuition rises. A <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr733.pdf\">2015 study by the Federal Reserve of New York</a> documented this lockstep relationship, having set out to examine the impact of greater access to credit on tuition. What they found was not just correlation, the Fed\u2019s analysts concluded, but causation.</p> <p>\u201cInstitutions more exposed to changes in these programs increased their tuition disproportionately around these policy changes,\u201d the study said. The result: Colleges collected 60% of all additional aid, whether by increasing tuition bills or cutting back on the grants they offered to students. Why would a 100% tuition subsidy be any different? What\u2019s more, this time it would be the taxpayer footing the bill.</p> <p>There is no question that no one who wants to attend college and who is qualified to attend should be unable to go simply because they cannot cobble together the right loans and grants, or because they are too anxious about what kind of debt burden awaits. It is not in our national interest to ration access to college according to who can afford to pay, or who is savviest at working the system. </p> <p>But before we implement a costly and revolutionary free-college plan, it might be worth asking how likely it is to achieve its most important objective: a closing of the wealth gap. </p> <p>Will it mean more students from lower-income families can attend college \u2013 a significant enough shift to really have an impact? Or will it just be a big help to middle class families with two or three children? </p> <p>Sure, that would ensure that such families wouldn\u2019t have to make any difficult economic tradeoffs. For a middle class family, free tuition might spell the difference between allowing a child to graduate with or without debt. But that wouldn\u2019t be transformative. It would not mean the difference between living in poverty and living in the middle class.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s plan may well not make a difference for students from the poorest families either. With more students who don\u2019t have to worry about their ability to foot a tuition bill, state colleges still won\u2019t be able to admit everyone who knocks on their door. They will become increasingly selective: more students will find themselves without access to free college. And those who win admittance won\u2019t necessarily be those students who most need the \u201cfree\u201d part of it. </p> <p>The poorer a student is, the more likely he or she is to have come from a school in a low-income neighborhood that has fewer resources and where <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/the-racial-achievement-gap-segregated-schools-and-segregated-neighborhoods-a-constitutional-insult/\">tremendous barriers exist to academic achievement</a>. Such a student will have to compete against those from wealthier communities. The absence of tuition fees might become academic. Those who do defy the odds will triumph, but it\u2019s not going to be any easier and it may be tougher. </p> <p>All of these plans attack the college cost problem \u2013 and it is a very, very large problem \u2013 from the perspective of alleviating what students end up paying, whether in the form of tuition bills or debt relief.</p> <p>Why aren\u2019t any politicians discussing what colleges could do to address the affordability crisis? Why are <a href=\"http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septoct-2011/administrators-ate-my-tuition/\">numbers of administrators soaring</a>, even as colleges and universities cut back on academic instructors or shift to using adjunct professors, some of whom end up living at the poverty level themselves? What is the rationale for paying six-figure salaries to members of bloated administrative staffs, when the typical member of the class of 2016 <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/05/02/student-debt-is-about-to-set-another-record-but-the-picture-isnt-all-bad/\">graduated with $37,172 of debt</a>?</p> <p>Where are the proposals for colleges to put some of their own money on the line? If they are convinced these tuition levels are correct, and that degrees students earn translate into well-paying jobs enabling them to pay off the debt rapidly, then perhaps they will be willing to work alongside governments in solving the affordability crisis. If not, why not? </p> <p>Clearly, ready access to federal government/taxpayer-backed funds and private loans has enabled colleges to expand, to pay administrative staff well, to overhaul buildings \u2013 if not always to pay academic staff well or support all the academic programs they once provided. </p> <p>Some colleges understand this. At one small liberal arts college, Washington College, Sheila Bair, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, gave all graduating seniors who took out federal loans to cover their final spring semester <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/04/18/washington-college-gives-graduating-seniors-a-parting-gift-debt-reduction/\">a grant to pay off that amount</a>, at an average of $2,630. That will cut the debt burden for graduates by about 10% immediately, and given that debt accrues interest, could end up being even more valuable. </p> <p>Bair has put in place another program to fund gifted but financially needy students.

But would they solve the crisis, or just create two or three more small but equally significant ones? </p> <p>Why not lean on the architects of this crisis, the states that have chopped funding to colleges and the colleges which have continued to raise tuition rates, and establish a creative series of sticks and carrots for reducing the tuition burden and the level of debt under which students stagger?</p> <p>It\u2019s no trickier than trying to implement all the details that would flow from making college free for every family of four with an income of $85,000 or less, even if it\u2019s less emotionally satisfying. And it might work.</p> <p>In the meantime, Clinton could also shift her attention to the problem of segregated schools in the poorest parts of the country, with the most scanty resources.

He has not only gathered the hate and distaste of the world, but with this visit to my country he has confirmed that he is without a doubt someone who cannot be trusted.

It is clear that Trump loves only ratings, not credibility. His campaign is a farce and he has been deceiving his followers since the beginning. But the biggest issue is that he handles information like a virus, which has sickened the American people.</p> <p>Trump has said that Mexican and Latin American migrants are the ones who bring guns, crime and drugs into the US, that we Mexicans are responsible for violence. But while he points with one hand to Mexico, with his other hand he encourages the American people to arm themselves \u2013 according to US government figures, seven out of 10 seized weapons in Mexico come from the United States.</p> <p>Trump proves with such statements that he doesn\u2019t care about facts, he doesn\u2019t care about reality. Instead he keeps spreading his distorted point of view, suggesting that he\u2019s completely ignorant or he\u2019s lying.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, in front of the cameras he didn\u2019t have any choice but to recognise Mexico as a commercial partner, and the hard work Mexicans do in the US.

  "<p>The man elected to rebuild Concacaf after decades of misconduct by officials believes it may take years to change a culture of corruption across the region.</p> <p>The new Concacaf president Victor Montagliani, who leads soccer across North and Central America and the Caribbean, told the Guardian how rebuilding a shattered confederation that is the center of investigations by both Fifa and the US Department of Justice was similar to recovering from a death. </p> <p>He added that players and fans, rather than top level executives, had saved the sport after events last year saw world football\u2019s leadership \u2013 including Fifa president <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36245660\">Sepp Blatter, his Uefa counterpart Michel Platini</a>, and a cast of other regional bosses and business figures \u2013 revealed as crooked, corrupt or, at best, conflicted. </p> <p>\u201cIt is like anything in your life that has had a negative affect or is a tragedy,\u201d said Montagliani who has also served as president of Canada Soccer since 2012.</p> <p>\u201cMoving on doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It is daily, day-out and day-in. Eventually, you do come out of it but what we need to remember is that we don\u2019t forget our history. We want to make sure that, from a confederation standpoint, history never repeats itself.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/01/copa-america-begins-after-scandal-jeffrey-webb-power-broker-illegal-trial-us\">'We have to get back to football': Copa Am\u00e9rica begins amid ashes of scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Montagliani was elected president last May to become the confederation\u2019s third president in a year. His predecessors include Jeffrey Webb, a banker from the Cayman Islands, and Alfredo Hawit, a lawyer from Honduras. In the past 12 months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/11/fifa-alfredo-hawit-admits-corruption\">both pled guilty to corruption-related charges</a> laid by the DOJ while the infamous Jack Warner of Trinidad, Concacaf president from 1990 to 2011, faces <a href=\"http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,230099.html\">an extradition request</a> from US authorities in addition to a $50m lawsuit from Concacaf alleging fraudulent misuse of funds. </p> <p>\u201cI am not going to sit calmly in the chair and announce that we are all done,\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cWe are out [of trouble] in some areas but from an overall cultural perspective it is going to take time. Whether you look from the outside in or the inside out, we know that it is a massive challenge There is no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Montagliani is something of a poster boy for reform within the sport. While other federations supported a Fifa status quo even amid the worldwide scandal that unraveled in 2015, Montagliani led Canada Soccer to announce it would vote against Blatter in his bid for reelection that year. Montagliani and Canada instead publicly announced support for Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan, whose challenge for Fifa\u2019s leadership ultimately failed (<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/usa-back-prince-ali-canada-endorse-infantino-045402063--sow.html\">Canada Soccer switched their allegiance </a>to Gianni Infantino in 2016).</p> <p>The 50-year-old has built a career as a risk manager with Vancouver insurance firms and recently headed the organizing committee for the 2015 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, hosted by Canada. He also sits on Fifa\u2019s Reform Committee, Legal Committee, and the Israel-Palestine Relations Committee (yes, Fifa has one). </p> <p>\u201cI totally get the skepticism from the public about reform and I think everyone at Fifa gets it,\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cWe are starting to see a bit of humbleness from the sport\u2019s leaders and that is a good thing. The one thing that people have to realize is that as much as there has been a bit of a shitstorm here in the past few years, the game itself is in good shape. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for two reasons: the players and the fans. The fans want to go and see Messi and Neymar and their clubs and those two elements have saved the game. At the end of the day it is not guys like me who are going to save the game. What I have got to make sure of is that we serve the players and fans to the maximum so this kind of shit doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p> <p>Concacaf, whose 41-members include regional giants Mexico and the United States as well as small Caribbean islands like St Lucia and Montserrat, was effectively eviscerated by last year\u2019s corruption scandal. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article22409883.html\">Its Miami headquarters were raided by the FBI</a> and 16 individuals with ties to the organization as federation representatives or as commercial partners were indicted. In addition, Traffic Sports International and Traffic Sports USA \u2013 related companies boasting media and events partnerships with Concacaf \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.us/concacaf-gold-cup/story/2515574/concacaf-ends-partnership-with-traffic-sports-fraud-charges\">pled guilty to wire fraud conspiracy</a>. </p> <p>Montagliani has unique perspective on Concacaf\u2019s commercial partnerships. He sat on the evaluation committee that initially appointed Traffic as a media and marketing rights holder in 2012 and then later headed a review committee that severed Concacaf\u2019s Traffic deal in 2015 after the revelations. </p> <p>\u201cWe have started the conversation with both Fifa and the Department of Justice [about cleaning up Concacaf],\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cMore so with Fifa than the DOJ. The DOJ are the silent types, let me put it that way. They don\u2019t necessarily say anything if you are doing well but if you are not doing well you will hear about it. Hopefully, there are no other crabs on the rocks for us. If there are we will deal with it and [the DOJ] will deal with it but we are going to do the right thing. </p> <p>\u201cThe clean up is not so much just governance. That should be obvious to everybody. It is also a corporate clean up: how we do things; how we communicate; a lot of little things. I did a tour with our new general secretary last month to visit all our current sponsors and partners. More than one of them said to me that I was the first president to have ever gone to visit them. These are some of our sponsors that have been with us since the 1990s. A little thing like that makes a cultural change in the organization.\u201d </p> <p>Big money sponsors aside, Montagliani stressed it was important for the sport\u2019s administrators to reflect on the depth of their responsibilities. \u201cWhat motivates me more than anything is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are wearing a suit and are a sports executive or any of that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI still feel sometimes like a little 12-year-old boy, sitting in front of the TV screaming at his favorite team. I have to remind people of that because this job is not always like the corporate world where you are doing things because of a bottom line and there are shareholders. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes, the bottom line is is not necessarily that you made \u2018x\u2019 amount of dollars on the Gold Cup. Sometimes, it is making sure 14-year-old girls from Haiti get an opportunity to play in a tournament.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>As the presidential election enters the home stretch, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is in a vulnerable position. In recent weeks, the Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">changed key aides</a> yet again, flip-flopped on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">his signature issue of immigration</a> and stayed well behind Hillary Clinton in fundraising, organization and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">polling</a>.</p> <p>Trump is by no means out of the race, but his path to victory relies as much on Clinton missteps as on his own successes. That means he now has a clear goal. He is not going to try to be a normal candidate. There will be no attempt to pivot to the center. There will not be a softer side. </p> <p>Trump will be the same fiery demagogue that tore up the Republican primary. The goal will not be to dam his torrent of political incorrectness. It will be to channel it, to produce maximum appeal to voters.</p> <p>The biggest change in the Trump campaign in recent weeks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">the replacement</a> of top aide Paul Manafort with a two-headed team, pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and rightwing publisher Steve Bannon as campaign CEO. The two took over in mid-August, after a series of revelations about Manafort\u2019s ties to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">allies of Russian president Vladimir Putin</a>. </p> <p>A veteran of Republican campaigns since 1976, Manafort was brought on to help guide the campaign through the arcane process of delegate selection for the Republican convention in Cleveland. He was then able to push out Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s previous campaign manager, who was known for his brash, hard-charging style. </p> <p>Manafort is known for his charisma, but he was not able to bring it to bear on Trump. Before the billionaire clinched the nomination, Manafort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/21/trump-campaign-republican-establishment-election-strategy\">promised top Republicans</a> his candidate was putting on \u201can act\u201d for primary voters. Trump was reportedly furious, and therefore did his utmost to demonstrate that he was just being himself.</p> <p>Trump subsequently meandered from controversy to controversy, a situation not helped by the fact that unlike Lewandowski, Manafort did not travel with him. It is almost unheard for campaign managers to travel with their candidate, but no candidate in American history has been so impulsive as Trump. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result?

As a result, the campaign\u2019s brains trust, which also includes Trump\u2019s son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/jared-kushner-new-york-observer-jewish-antisemitism\">Jared Kushner</a>, has no experience working for a presidential candidate in a general election. It is however well-attuned to Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic ways.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes is that Trump now uses a teleprompter when speaking, even at his raucous campaign rallies. Although he has long disdained the device and boasted of his ability to improvise every night, thanks to the arrival of Conway he has finally been persuaded to stick to something resembling a script. </p> <p>No one, of course, should mistake Trump for an automaton. He uses his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things: as the basis for a series of wild riffs. But the presence of the teleprompter means that Trump at least gets back to the basic notes, rather than off on a politically costly solo.</p> <p>The most glaring sign Trump\u2019s new reliance on technology came at the end of August, at an Iowa fundraiser for Senator Joni Ernst that was held in a barn on the state fairgrounds, where livestock normally compete for blue ribbons.

This was most clear in his immigration speech in Phoenix on Wednesday, where Trump definitely took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">hardline stance</a>, doubling down on the inflammatory rhetoric that drove his surge to the nomination. </p> <p>Proclaiming \u201cthere will be no amnesty\u201d, parading family members of Americans killed by illegal immigrants, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">framed the issue</a> not as \u201ca humanitarian crisis\u201d, as he said earlier that day in Mexico, or even an economic one.

A Labor government in the 1940s amalgamated a number of small neighbouring councils into a larger City of Sydney which included a string of Labor-voting working class suburbs in areas like Alexandria, Redfern, Glebe and Newtown.</p> <p>A Liberal government in the 1960s broke off those suburbs into a separate South Sydney council, allowing conservative business interests in the Sydney city centre to control the council. Another Labor government brought these suburbs together in the early 1980s, and then the Greiner Liberal government in 1989 broke Sydney and South Sydney apart.</p> <p>The Carr Labor government thought it was on to a winner in 2004 when it merged the traditionally Labor-voting suburbs of South Sydney council with a much smaller CBD-based City of Sydney council, but their plans were undone when Moore announced she would return to local politics and run for lord mayor.</p> <p>Moore easily won election in 2004, and went on to win second and third terms in 2008 and 2012. Not only did she win the lord mayoralty but candidates on her ticket won enough seats on the council to give her an absolute majority on the local council.</p> <p>After 12 years as mayor, Moore remains very popular with residents of the city, but has drawn the enmity of the state government and some local business interests.</p> <p>The city has acted as a rival source of influence to the state government, loudly advocating for improved public transport, improving cycleways and other local infrastructure, and regularly disagreeing with the Liberal state government. </p> <p>The City of Sydney is not the most populous council in New South Wales, but is much more financially powerful than its neighbours thanks to rates revenue from the central business district. The council has been effective at using these financial resources to improve services and infrastructure for local residents, and has been a constant thorn in the side of Labor and Liberal state governments over the past 12 years.</p> <p>Recent state legislation was aimed at shifting the balance away from residents and towards businesses. In most councils ratepaying businesses have a right to vote, but the vote is voluntary and most businesses don\u2019t bother to enrol or vote.</p> <p>The 2014 law which only applies to the City of Sydney, makes it compulsory for local businesses to enrol and vote and gives each business two votes.</p> <p>Only 1,709 businesses enrolled to vote in the City of Sydney at the 2012 election. This year that number is just shy of 23,000, suggesting as many as 45,000 new business votes could be cast.
