  "<p>Heaven knows, James DeMonaco\u2019s dystopian grindhouse-horror franchise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/24/the-purge-anarchy-review-james-demonaco\">The Purge</a> was never exactly subtle, and now it has set about creating a ferociously unsubtle satirical twist on Hillary Clinton\u2019s forthcoming battle with the forces of darkness. The scene is still America of the not-so-distant future and the citizenry are still subject to the annual cathartic \u201cPurge\u201d, in which people can kill whomsoever they wish in a 12-hour opportunity window for Dionysiac violence. </p> <p>Elizabeth Mitchell plays Democratic senator Charlie Roan, whose family were once slaughtered this way, and she is now committed to abolition; on the terrifying night of the Purge itself, she is subject to a brutal assault from assassins paid for by the reactionary elitists who invented the Purge \u2013 besuited elderly white men who resemble a Masonic amalgam of the NRA and the Republican right. So she is forced to lead a rainbow alliance of white, black and Latino social-justice warriors in a fightback against this hateful libertarian institution. </p> <p>The premise of The Purge never stopped being a nifty high concept. But this loses narrative interest after about 10 minutes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXMp9fBomJw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RXMp9fBomJw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%.</p> <p><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening.

After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884/0_225_1704_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finn Dempsey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bef773e4b0568600c0434b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:33:27.015Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/uk-retail-sales-brexit-slow-puncture-not-car-crash\">UK retail sales show Brexit effect will be more slow puncture than car crash | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57befc81e4b0fe30498a4aff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:16:08.579Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US rates could rise shortly - Fed board member</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent.</p> <p>Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening.</p> <p>He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/768812018560303104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed&#39;s Kaplan on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC\">@CNBC</a> I&#39;m focused on fundamental drivers;

  "<p>Three years ago, Rorie Mcleod Arnould was shocked when he heard that on his university campus, two indigenous students witnessed their peers laughing at an elder as she gave a blessing at a convocation ceremony.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mcleod Arnould, then a politics student and the vice-president of the University of Winnipeg Students\u2019 Association, was even more startled when he spoke with members of the school\u2019s Aboriginal Students\u2019 Council and heard many more experiences of racism on campus. </p> <p>\u201cIt was an awakening moment,\u201d says Mcleod Arnould, 26. </p> <p>The incident spurred him and other students to action to make their campus inclusive of indigenous students and have a \u201cconsequential effect on their education\u201d. \u201cOur minds went to what would be the most ambitious project we could undertake?\u201d</p> <p>The answer to that question goes into effect this fall, when every new undergraduate student at the University of Winnipeg must meet an i<a href=\"http://uwinnipeg.ca/indigenous-course-requirement/\">ndigenous course requirement</a> to graduate. Lakehead University, in Thunder Bay, Ontario, is also introducing an <a href=\"https://www.lakeheadu.ca/faculty-and-staff/departments/services/ai/icr\">indigenous content requirement</a> this fall for new undergraduate students, making the two universities the first in Canada to mandate a baseline knowledge about indigenous people and culture for all students, regardless of faculty.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels good to learn about our own history,\u201d says Kevin Settee, an Anishinaabe and Cree student who is president of the University of Winnipeg Students\u2019 Association. </p> <p>So far, there are 60 courses approved or in development that students can take to fulfill the requirement, ranging from a course on indigenous people and treaties, to an indigenous women\u2019s history class.</p> <p>For Settee, his experience taking an optional native studies class at his high school in downtown Winnipeg, a city home to Canada\u2019s largest urban aboriginal population, motivated him to advocate for mandatory indigenous classes. </p> <p>The class marked the first time Settee wanted to go to school and learn. \u201cI thought if I can learn this kind of stuff in university, I\u2019m going to stay on my educational journey,\u201d says the 25-year-old. </p> <p>Settee considers the indigenous course requirement equally important for non-indigenous students. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for people to wake up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter what field you\u2019re going to be working in, you\u2019re going to be interacting with indigenous people. Everyone needs to have that baseline understanding of history and culture.\u201d</p> <p>The adoption of mandatory indigenous courses at two Canadian universities comes as indigenous issues are increasingly in the spotlight in the country. Since Justin Trudeau\u2019s election victory last October, helped in part by a record number of indigenous voters, issues plaguing First Nations have been a focus of the new government.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at this point in time in Canada, particularly following the<a href=\"http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3\"> Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a>, where Canadians understand there\u2019s been something structurally and terribly wrong with the relationship with indigenous peoples and we need to change it,\u201d says Peggy Smith, an associate professor in the faculty of natural resources management at Lakehead University. </p> <p>For the past 15 years, Smith has taught a mandatory course, Aboriginal Peoples and Natural Resources, for third-year natural resource management students. Smith, who is of Cree ancestry, says the reluctance from students she occasionally encountered when she started teaching the course has largely disappeared.</p> <p>Students are grateful to graduate with a sense of knowledge about indigenous people and their role and relationships with lands and resources, says Smith, whose classroom experiences led her to join the push for the university to adopt an indigenous content requirement. </p> <p>The process to implement the indigenous requirement at both universities has involved challenges. Settee, with the University of Winnipeg\u2019s students\u2019 association, says he heard from faculty and students against the move, with some students leaving racist comments in an online feedback form about the requirement. Smith has heard heard worries that instructors are not qualified to teach indigenous content, but believes the university\u2019s move to hire an indigenous curriculum specialist, who will provide support to faculty as needed, will help.</p> <p>Back on the University on Winnipeg\u2019s campus, preparations are under way to welcome the school\u2019s newest undergraduate students, the first cohort to which the indigenous content requirement will apply. There\u2019s excitement on campus, says Settee, but also a sense that there\u2019s much work still to do. \u201cEducation is one of the best ways to raise awareness and create change,\u201d he says. \u201cI just hope that people can make change with the knowledge they can get from these courses, and I hope it inspires people to take more of these courses.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>This month, pharmaceutical company, Mylan, crowed that they smashed second-quarter expectations; with <a href=\"http://newsroom.mylan.com/2016-08-09-Mylan-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2016-Results-Including-Total-Revenues-Up-8\">earnings of $2.56bn, up 8%</a> from the year before.

I am a mother in one of those families. </p> <p>When our beautiful daughter Emma was born in 2010, everything about her was perfect \u2013 she\u2019d laugh while her 10 soft fingers would grab 10 wiggling toes. The only thing that seemed to trip her up was something that seemed to come pretty naturally to most newborns: eating. She was clearly in pain while she nursed, and we could not figure out why. The answer would emerge over the course of the subsequent months, through many medical visits: Emma was one of millions of children who, due to a series of genetic and environmental factors, was born with food allergies. We would later find out that one of her allergies was severe and life threatening: ingesting peanuts swiftly sends her into anaphylaxis. </p> <p>The news was terrifying at first, and my husband and I quickly set up systems with her allergist to make sure she was safe in every possible setting or scenario. The central factor in every part of our plan was whether she would have quick and easy access to her EpiPen, which can immediately halt an anaphylaxis attack by delivering epinephrine, via injection. The EpiPen became an essential part of our lives overnight, and we would pay for as many as our health insurance would cover. But we learned over time that this life-saving device \u2013 a triumph of modern medical science \u2013 was becoming more and more difficult to access. Each dose must be replaced once a year, and each time we refilled the prescription, our pharmacist would report that the price jumped dramatically again. </p> <p>Mylan was behind those increases, raising the price from $57 a shot when it took over sales of the product less than a decade ago to more than $600 today. This price jump exposes not just some gaping moral and ethical holes in America\u2019s healthcare system, but some dangerous market distortions taking place in the US pharmaceutical industry. </p> <p>First, the price has quadrupled in just nine years, with no perceivable improvement to the product to justify the increase. The drug still only contains <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business\">about $1</a> of active ingredient. Second, consumers have no viable alternative, because Mylan holds a monopoly on the product. Other manufacturers have attempted to diversify the market, only to be stopped short by the US Food and Drug Administration. We\u2019ve seen pharmaceutical executives callously take advantage of this \u201cmarket opportunity\u201d a number of times before with different drugs, most notably when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/entrepreneur-defends-raise-price-daraprim-drug\">disgraced Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO</a>, Martin Shkreli, was exposed for price-gouging pills to $750. </p> <p>Third, this drug is quite literally the difference between life and death for many families, because allergies do not discriminate between those who have quality health insurance or none at all. So far, my family has been lucky enough to have the means and insurance to keep adjusting to the jarring price hikes, but many are not so fortunate. Parents all over the country have shared their stories of helplessly watching the price of this life saving medication rise beyond their reach, or taking <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/06/epipen-prices-allergies/\">drastic measures</a> to afford the medication.</p> <p>The bottom line is that no parent should have to send their child off to school or camp, hoping and praying for their child\u2019s basic safety, because they cannot afford to purchase essential medication. Public officials weighed in this week, from Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is calling for hearings scrutinizing the price hike, to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-24/the-senator-s-daughter-who-raised-prices-on-anti-allergy-epipen\">Hillary Clinton</a>, who called on Mylan to \u201cimmediately reduce the price of EpiPens\u201d.</p> <p>The fact is that Mylan, and many other companies like them, were able to inflate prices on life-saving, one-of-a-kind medications, because they could. </p> <p>The American medical system is simply broken. We are far from a free market where competition is open and companies are incentivized to spur innovation and compete fairly for market share. Instead, the powerful few are able to enjoy exorbitant profits at the expense of desperate families like mine, who will pay anything to simply keep their children safe.</p>",

For years these socially dysfunctional millennials have sheltered behind their bedroom laptops, watching porn, sending abusive tweets (anonymously) and eating pizza in their underpants. Mainstream politics \u2013 both left and right \u2013 has previously ignored this developing phenomenon. But with Donald Trump they have found a champion who understands their anger. And they have become his digital vanguard. Tonight in Nevada, Hilary Clinton will give a major speech linking Trump to the alt right. And&nbsp;with this speech the alt right will further enter the political mainstream.</p> <p>One account of their rise to political significance cites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/03/gamergate-corruption-games-anita-sarkeesian-zoe-quinn\" title=\"\">the 2014 Gamergate controversy</a>. This vicious internet culture war took place between those who were pressing for a more inclusive video gaming culture (more women, less violence) and those who reacted against what they saw as a humourless leftwing threat to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/08/reason-sexist-gaming-cover-magazines_n_5288969.html\" title=\"\">their enjoyment of guns and boobs</a>. These burgeoning alt right gamers have little in common with traditional Republican conservatives and their evangelical Christian values. They don\u2019t go to church. Indeed, many are aggressively atheistic.</p> <p>Rather, they come together on blogs and online community forums like 4chan where they fulminate against social justice warriors \u2013 SJWs \u2013 who want to spoil their fun. They hate the liberal apparatus of the state, including the mainstream press and Ivy League academia that they collectively dub as The Cathedral. And they hate normies \u2013 normal people \u2013 and their repressive political philosophy, democracy. Instead of democracy, they propose that the US should be run like a large company with a CEO at its head, preferably one from Silicon Valley. Someone like PayPal founder Peter Thiel, whose views include : \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/22/peter-thiel-paypal-donald-trump-silicon-valley-libertarian\" title=\"\">I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.</a>\u201d But Trump will do for now. Oh, and only intelligent people should be in charge, and that means white people.</p> <p>\u201cEver since Mill wrote his response to Carlyle on The Negro Question, writers of the English Protestant tradition have been defending the blatantly theological position that \u2018all men are created equal\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11434098/alt-right-explained\" title=\"\">wrote the computer programmer and alt-right hero Curtis Yarvin</a> under his pen name Mencius Moldbug. He continued: \u201cNote that exactly the same rhetorical strategy can prove the existence of God or the Flying Spaghetti Monster for that matter.\u201d</p> <p>Traditional Republicans are now regularly dismissed by the revolting term cuckservatives \u2013 an insult first used by white supremacists of Christian conservatives who, they said, have allowed themselves to be cuckolded by racial minorities. They darkly summon the idea of interracial sex \u2013 a theme that was also an obsessive preoccupation of the KKK. And its meaning broadens out to refer to those who witness their country being taken away and don\u2019t have the balls to do anything to stop it. That\u2019s why they want a US version of Putin. Because they don\u2019t think he would allow that to happen.</p> <p>Of course, racism has a long and inglorious history in US politics. But it now has a very new iteration in the nerdy tech-savvy generation of the alt right. Racism 2.0. They don\u2019t speak of eugenics but rather of maintaining \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d. And they have a thing about IQ tests showing that white people are cleverer than others.</p> <p>I know, we\u2019ve heard all this crap many times before. But there is something new here. For in cross-pollinating with the anonymity and viciousness of the internet, with porn and video games replacing Christianity as the common language in which conservatives talk to each other, with openly anti-democratic impulses being justified as rationality, the virus of racism is capable of spreading as never before. The age of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Christian right is over. And something worse is set to take its place.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\" title=\"\"><em>@giles_fraser</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Bono\u2019s ego: the final frontier.

  "<p>Whenever I think about the dysfunctional horror of the looming presidential election in America \u2013 so weird that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\"> Nigel Farage can pop up in Mississippi</a> on the Trump campaign \u2013 I can\u2019t get Susan Sarandon or Plato out of my mind. Let\u2019s talk first about the actor. When did Plato make a decent movie, eh?</p> <p>A few weeks ago Sarandon gave a magazine interview to an overawed writer in which she set out her well-known political stall as a radical feminist who backed Bernie Sanders and doesn\u2019t think much of Hillary Clinton. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about her I find feminist except that she\u2019s a woman,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That betrays a casual, right-on ignorance of Clinton\u2019s record over many decades, but never mind, Sarandon\u2019s distaste is shared by many educated American women. \u201cShe\u2019s a hawk, she\u2019ll probably get us into another war,\u201d etc etc, all good Islington-to-Santa Monica stuff. What was startling to me was that yet again Sarandon declined to say she\u2019d vote for Clinton in November.</p> <p>\u201cI go by issues, I don\u2019t vote with my vagina,\u201d Sarandon tells audiences. She did it again <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3728085/Susan-Sarandon-says-s-not-convinced-Hillary-Clinton-won-t-vote-vagina-Republican-Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-says-her.html\">in Australia the other day</a>. She\u2019s even hinted that she might vote Trump on the grounds that his election \u201cwill bring the revolution immediately\u201d. How flakey is that?</p> <p>All right, she\u2019s only an actor, they get paid to read other people\u2019s lines. But even though Bernie Sanders himself has finally backed Clinton with grumpy ill-grace, I keep hearing Americans \u2013 particularly younger, educated women \u2013 saying similar things: that they\u2019ll vote Trump against the \u201cWashington elite\u201d or just abstain.</p> <p>The Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen recently wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/donlad-trump-republicans-us-elections-dictatorship \">a belter of a column</a> mocking leading American Republicans who keep busts of Churchill on their desks as a symbol of defiant courage but don\u2019t have the guts to denounce and disown Trump, who has captured the ugly, angry party they spent decades creating for short-term gain.</p> <p>That\u2019s not quite fair on many Republicans. The Bush family and some other notables are standing aloof. Other figures have publicly stated \u2013 at political or personal risk to themselves \u2013 that they will vote for Clinton rather than for a man whose dangerous and volatile unsuitability makes him a threat to constitutional government.</p> <p>There is a pretty disheartening <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\">list of rebels and appeasers</a>. At the party convention, Trump\u2019s beaten rival, Senator Ted Cruz, was booed for telling people to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d. Since he\u2019s called Trump \u201ca pathological liar, utterly amoral, a narcissist \u2026 and a serial philanderer,\u201d we can take him as a no.</p> <p>That makes Cruz and rejectionist Republicans better Americans than Susan Sarandon. Her arrogant emphasis on what matters to Susan seems \u2013 so far \u2013 to obscure her view of the bigger political picture, possibly to link her more closely than she might wish to the \u201cTrump the Selfie\u201d mood that is drawing millions of resentful Americans into a dark and angry narcissism.</p> <p>Which brings me to Plato. Concerned friends in the US sent me some extracts from a <a href=\"http://chironpublications.com/shop/trump/\">newly published book</a>, A Clear and Present Danger: Narcissism in the Era of Donald Trump \u2013 essays by prominent writers, academics and doctors on the polarising disorder they see sweeping their own country \u2013 while noting, as both Trump and Farage have done, that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote serves to remind us that the revolt against elites and globalisation exists in Europe too.</p> <p>A lot of this stuff has been around for decades. As a student 50 years ago I read the American historian Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay The Paranoid Style of American Politics, in which anti-foreigner nativism could easily be harnessed against newcomers, outsiders, black people, capitalism, Jews, the usual suspects. The leftwing social critic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch\">Christopher Lasch</a> published The Culture of Narcissism as a consequence of post-war consumer capitalism as long ago as 1979. In Willie Loman, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller\">Arthur Miller\u2019s</a> Death of a Salesman created a Trump voter in 1949.</p> <p>Lasch and Miller lived long enough to experience the Reagan presidency, its negative impacts softened by the incumbent\u2019s relaxed and sunny disposition. The prospect of a Trump victory against Clinton \u2013 always a vulnerable candidate in my book \u2013 would seriously have frightened, though possibly not surprised, them. It\u2019s been a long time coming and the Reagan/Goldwater wing of the Republican party has made the bouffant-haired Frankenstein possible.</p> <p>Ted Cruz is not alone in identifying Trump\u2019s very obvious self-absorption, the quality so grotesque it rendered him almost a stealth candidate until too late. What no one understood at first was how much his excesses would appeal to voters \u2013 not all of them poor white people whose jobs, prospects and traditions have been attacked or destroyed \u2013 who feel marginalised or threatened.</p> <p>It\u2019s part-cultural, part-economic, but it thrives in the celebrity culture we now inhabit, vastly enhanced by 24/7 social media. As harsh reality becomes more unpleasant, the temptation is to blur the edges between reality and illusion, to retreat into a magic world and the cult of self. Facebook, Google and YouTube make it ever more possible. Even the TV networks are making money out of Trump.</p> <p>Of course, Plato didn\u2019t do Twitter or have a presence on Facebook. But Andrew Sullivan, the British expat writer in the US, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html\">wrote a piece</a> reminding New York magazine\u2019s readers how the great man had warned that \u201ctyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy,\u201d in terms that describe the Trump scenario very well.</p> <p>Plato was no friend of democracy (as pandering classics professors routinely fail to tell us in their TV series on Greek democracy), not least because it killed his hero Socrates. He saw it as a system that gradually expanded freedom and equality to the point where authority imploded and its ensuing disorders allow a demagogue to seize power, promising to \u201ctake back control\u201d or \u201cget our country back\u201d.</p> <p>Being of the elite himself, Plato explained, but with a populist touch, the emerging tyrant forces the now defenceless elite to compromise, flee or face retribution. Sound familiar? It certainly does. Watch those wobbling Republican millionaires shaking behind their locked gates. In an age that has delivered painful inequality in most advanced societies (unadvanced ones always have it), anger against elite wealth is very real and understandable. Which of us would not see more bankers jailed?</p> <p>Yet Trump supporters seem even more blind to his faults than Susan Sarandon or Nigel Farage. Trump still hasn\u2019t published his tax return, as all candidates have done for 40 years, and evidence emerges daily of strange financial ties/debts to Russian and Chinese interests. </p> <p>The distinction between fact and fantasy is fast eroding. Trump is behind in most polls and may be rightly thrashed in November, a fading nightmare by Christmas. He may just \u201cdo a Brexit\u201d and win. Does Farage get any of this, do you suppose? As a Poundland Trump, Farage tapped into suppressed resentment over \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d feelings, but never provided any answers beyond that magic word: Brexit.</p> <p>Yet on Wednesday night in Mississippi we saw a man whose creed is self-governing \u201csovereign\u201d states interfering in another country\u2019s sovereignty (he complained when Obama did it in the referendum), not against a candidate whose toxic rage so clearly threatens us all, but on his side. I wish I could say Susan Sarandon showed a better grip on reality. There\u2019s still time.</p>",

And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.\u201d</p> <p>More than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2bn in funding since its creation, <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP\">the Associated Press reported</a>. It has a staff of nearly 500 people.</p> <p>The foundation clearly means a lot to the 42nd president. Addressing staff recently, Bill Clinton commented: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of interesting things in my life, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done anything that I\u2019ve loved this much as this foundation.\u201d He admitted the prospect of scaling it down \u201cis like a root canal for me\u201d.</p> <h2>Has the foundation succeeded?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/team/lawrence-m-noble\">Larry Noble</a>, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, says: \u201cThe foundation does real work.

Clinton\u2019s supporters say it enabled the number of people receiving HIV/Aids medication to soar from 200,000 to 11.5 million and supported physical education programmes that helped more than 18 million students.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lauraseay.wordpress.com/bio/\">Laura Seay</a>, an academic who witnessed the foundation\u2019s work firsthand in east Africa, said: \u201cThe perspective that it is some kind of slush fund is based on a real misunderstanding of what the Clinton Foundation does. The Clintons don\u2019t take a salary from it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Seay was researching a PhD from 2005 to 2007 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/congo-child-soldiers-ntaganda-monuc\">where militias roamed</a> and few aid organisations ventured. She recalled how, with Clinton Foundation funding, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/democratic-republic-congo-optimism\">Heal Africa hospital</a> in Goma treated 60 HIV-positive Congolese children, most of whom survived. \u201cI know teens &amp; young adults who were kids then &amp; are alive today because the Clinton Foundation saved their lives when no one else would,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasinafrica/status/767779911696261120\">she tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Seay, assistant professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, adds in an interview: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation was the organisation that took the risk on this. What it showed was that in really difficult circumstances you can save a lot of lives and change the way a lot of NGOs think about conflict zones. It really was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton also used his name to negotiate with international pharmaceutical giants to slash the price of HIV/Aids drugs, Seay argues.</p> <p>The foundation has been particularly active in Rwanda but not without criticism. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/us/politics/rwanda-bill-hillary-clinton-foundation.html?_r=0\">According to the New York Times</a>, in 2011 it successfully lobbied Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department to approve an unconventional medical training programme there. A dispute over the plan was mediated by Cheryl Mills, who spent five years on the foundation board before switching to the state department.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s banner event, the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, is a forum for philanthropists to announce funding commitments including, in 2007, $2m to help build the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda\">Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village</a> for orphans of the genocide and Aids.</p> <p>Speaking by phone from Rwanda, its director, Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura, says of the foundation: \u201cIt seems to be doing some very good work in the country.

It holds an A rating from <a href=\"https://www.charitywatch.org/home\">CharityWatch</a>, having spent 88% of its budget on programmes rather than overheads.</p> <p>Its list of donors includes Trump, who gave between $100,000 and $250,000 in 2009 and has attended a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative. One Clinton ally, noting Trump\u2019s demands for <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN10X18W\">a special prosecutor</a> to look into the foundation, says: \u201cAs a donor, Trump is calling for an investigation of himself.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/jennifer-granholm/clinton-surrogate-spins-clinton-foundation-defense/\">the Politifact website contends</a> that the foundation violated its memorandum of understanding with the state department with three significant omissions, including not reporting a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html\">$500,000 donation from Algeria</a> in 2010.</p> <h2>What is the main allegation now?</h2> <p>Pay for play. Donors to the foundation are said to have jumped the queue and gained special access to the state department. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/82df550e1ec646098b434f7d5771f625/many-donors-clinton-foundation-met-her-state\">The AP wrote this week</a>: \u201cMore than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money \u2013 either personally or through companies or groups \u2013 to the Clinton Foundation. It\u2019s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.\u201d</p> <p>The AP found that at least 85 of 154 people<strong> </strong>with private interests who either met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton also gave a combined total of $156m to her family\u2019s charities. Trump, struggling in the polls, sensed an opening and piled on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,\u201d he told a rally on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Giuliani fumed: \u201cIt is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the state department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>But Hillary Clinton insists that the data was cherry picked from a subset of her schedule. She told CNN on Wednesday: \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of smoke and there\u2019s no fire. This AP report? Put it in context, excludes nearly 2,000 meetings I had with world leaders, plus countless other meetings with government officials when I was secretary of state. It looked at a small portion of my time.</p> <p>\u201cIt drew the conclusion and made the suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great, Elie Wiesel, or Melinda Gates, or the Nobel prize winner, Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders. That is absurd. These are people I was proud to meet with, who any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with and hear about their work and their insight.\u201d</p> <p>However, there has also been a steady trickle of emails into the public domain that reveal how <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/clinton-foundation-huma-abedin-doug-band-227275\">donors sought meetings with Clinton</a> by trying to call in favours from the foundation.

Elizabeth Trudeau, a spokesperson for the state department, says: \u201cThe state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.\u201d There is no proof of a quid pro quo or anything illegal.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/peter-schweizer/\">Peter Schweizer</a>, author of the book Clinton Cash and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, said: \u201cIt\u2019s naive to believe that people throw money at politics and don\u2019t expect something in return. They claimed there was going to be a wall between the Clinton Foundation and state department and this clearly shows there was communication between people at the Clinton Foundation and state department. There needs to be an investigation into exactly what happened and we also need legislation.

I don\u2019t think \u2018inevitable overlap\u2019 involves dual payrolls.\u201d</p> <h2>So how does the issue look?</h2> <p>Not good, especially as it fills a new vacuum in the dog days of August in which Trump has managed to avoid his usual attention-grabbing gaffes. It gives the appearance, at least, of a blurred line and intersecting interests between the Clinton Foundation and state department.</p> <p>\u201cThe frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton,\u201d the AP report said.</p> <p>Scott Amey, general counsel at the <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/\">Project on Government Oversight</a>, said: \u201cI think this is an example that may not be illegal but certainly should have been handled with more communication to show there was no actual or apparent conflicts of interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, in giving money to the Clinton Foundation, did donors feel they deserved or were going to receive special access to Hillary at the state department? We don\u2019t know. Only time will tell. It seems some favours were called in and some minor efforts were made to provide access.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps some overlap between between the entities was inevitable. But Amey adds: \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes here is they didn\u2019t set up proper firewalls to prevent those blurred lines. I would be less sceptical if I had seen emails back from the state department saying: \u2018We can\u2019t do this, you should go through the official channels.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f/0_122_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative on 22 September 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2014 in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bill Clinton announced that, if Hillary wins the presidency, he will step down from the board of the foundation and it will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations.

Noble says of Clinton: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have to shut it down. If you look at it like a business, what you have to do is totally separate yourself from it.

The PP, however, has denied trying to bully S\u00e1nchez into caving, saying the timing is simply down to the electoral calendar.</p> <p>Although the PP took the most votes in the December and June elections, it was unable to win the 176 seats necessary to give it a majority in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress of deputies on either occasion.

For her sophomore year, she had to take out another $25,000 loan \u2013 slightly higher than last year\u2019s since her tuition went up by 2.59% this year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe are in chains. Don\u2019t you get it? We are never going to break free,\u201d one character says in the play. </p> <p>To make their case, Pierce and the cast use various statistics and numbers throughout the performance. But it is the stories of the characters and the actors themselves that connect with the audience. </p> <p>Over the past couple of years, Pierce has taken her play around some college campuses and high schools and asked the audience how they felt after watching the play. The most common responses were depressed and sad. As a result, Pierce said that the crew workshopped it to \u201cmake it less painful\u201d and to evoke a sense of solidarity.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually say that they have hope. That they feel a type of solidarity, that they are not alone,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cToo often we feel like that because it\u2019s such a hush-hush issue. It\u2019s a taboo to talk about your student loan debt.\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/07/expensive-college-education-reinforces-racial-inequality-us-america\">Half of black college students graduate with more than $25,000 in student loan debt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Sunday, after the first performance of Financial Slavery during its run at the Fringe festival, members of the audience said the play made them feel sad, anxious, enlightened and swindled. </p> <p>One attendee was a young woman who had just finished law school with $110,000 in student debt. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it, but don\u2019t know how I am going to pay for it,\u201d she told everyone in the theatre.</p> <p>There was a mother with three kids in college, who cosigned on a total of $160,000 worth of loans. \u201cMy name is on there,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>There was a dad who said: \u201cBernie Sanders tried to get us to wake up on this issue.\u201d And then there was a single mother who said that if she was able to figure it out, others should be able to as well.</p> <p>The play does not shy away from stirring up a caldron of complicated thoughts and feelings. Yes, education is important, but should going to college result in mountains of debt? Should tuition keep going up? Who is responsible for knowing exactly what the interest will amount to? Should we talk about the cost of books, meal plans and housing that often add thousands of dollars on top of tuition?

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s movement has often been compared to that of a rightwing European party. Now, his union with Europe\u2019s right is official. At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">rally on Wednesday</a> Trump presented himself as America\u2019s Nigel Farage, holding the former Ukip leader up as his populist, nationalist twin.</p> <p>Make it a long-lost twin for Trump, who when first asked for an opinion on whether Britain should leave the European Union <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/22/donald-trump-brexit-my-inclination-would-be-get-ou/\" title=\"\">appeared to be unfamiliar</a> with the referendum in question. Fast-forward to the day after the referendum, though, and Trump would boast he had predicted the British exit from the EU all along. Earlier this month he rebranded himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/766246213079498752\" title=\"\">\u201cMr Brexit\u201d</a> in a tweet; and now he\u2019s getting even more explicit about what promise he sees in the tale of British secession.</p> <p>\u201cOn 23 June, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence \u2013 which is what we\u2019re looking to do also, folks! \u2013 from international government,\u201d Trump told his audience in Jackson, Mississippi.</p> <p>Jackson is a place where the memory of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/17/confederate-flag-symbol-charleston-white-anxiety\" title=\"\">Confederacy</a> is still fresh, and as such a curious one in which to be touting a second <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/nigel-farage-eu-referendum-this-victory-for-real-people-video\" title=\"\">independence day</a>, of sorts. But such white nationalist fervour seemed to play well with the overwhelmingly white crowd assembled in the largely black city on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The architects of Brexit like to frame the vote as a righteous backlash against powerful elites. As Farage put it on Wednesday: \u201cYou can beat the pollsters. You can beat the commentators \u2026 Anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.\u201d</p> <p>According to this oft trotted-out framing, Trump\u2019s reviled Washington establishment is a parallel for Farage\u2019s European Commission. But the hyper-focus on anti-elitism obscures the far less righteous xenophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment that were also elements of the leave campaign.</p> <p>Such uninspiring qualities are the core of Trump\u2019s movement too, and that was apparent in no small number of crowd-pleasing lines. \u201cWhy do our leaders spend so much more time talking about how to help people [who are] here illegally than they spend trying to help American citizens?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cThe media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in violation of the law.\u201d</p> <p>The bigotry of Trump\u2019s campaign is, if anything, more extreme. While leave campaign leaders such as Boris Johnson would at least distance themselves from the anti-immigrant rhetoric espoused by Farage and others, Trump has embraced it. And even Farage himself has <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nigel-farage-donald-trump-republican-convention-muslims-us-election-2016-a7153206.html\" title=\"\">suggested</a> that some of Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric goes too far.</p> <p>Trump has long harnessed America\u2019s wave of white nationalism. But with the encouragement of his campaign\u2019s new chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-campaign-chief-breitbart\" title=\"\">Stephen Bannon</a> (previously an outspoken Brexit cheerleader at the rightwing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\" title=\"\">Breitbart </a>news website), he has now harnessed something else. Namely, he\u2019s enlisted Farage to help him airbrush bigotry from his message in much the same way Farage did with Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s telling that in the wake of Brexit\u2019s victory Farage has, rather than assuming a position of leadership, found himself stoking populist flames elsewhere. And it underscores another unspoken parallel with Trump: trafficking in the politics of anger \u2013 not governance \u2013 is what he does best. If Trump wins in November, expect more of the same.</p>",

This comes after US peers finished the day on the back foot thanks to fresh political disquiet about excessive and potentially unethical pricing of life-saving drugs, Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton demanding that generic and specialty pharma group Mylan lower the \u2018outrageous\u2019 price ($300; +500% over 6 years) of its allergy injection EpiPen.</p> <p>This echoes the populist swipe and US congressional challenge of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/18/martin-shkreli-resigns-turing-pharmaceuticals-fraud-charges\">Martin Shkreli, founder and former CEO of Turing Pharma</a></strong> which recently hiked the price of an Aids medicine by 5,000% overnight. It also serves to strike fear into the hearts of healthcare groups and their investors everywhere. As always, the industry remains between a rock and a hard place, treading the fine line between balancing the costs of clinical success (and failure) with the economic laws of supply and demand, all the while trying (often in vain) to satisfy demanding stakeholders without appearing to view the sick as merely a commercial opportunity.</p> </blockquote>",

In another image, a police officer appears to write out a fine. </p> <p>A spokesman for Vantage News, which released the pictures in the UK, said they were taken at about 11am (10am BST) on Tuesday. \u201cThe woman was fined, she left the beach and so did the police,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the council of state, France\u2019s highest administrative court, will examine a request by the French Human Rights League to scrap the burkini bans. Lawyers argue that the short-term decrees are illegal.</p> <p>The Nice mayor\u2019s office denied that she had been forced to remove clothing, telling Agence France-Presse that the woman was showing police the swimsuit she was wearing under her tunic over a pair of leggings.</p> <p>The woman was wearing ordinary clothes and not a burkini, or full-body swimsuit. The photographer noticed the police presence, but was standing far from the scene and took the pictures with a long lens, his French photo agency <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/france/2016/08/24/femme-voilee-verbalisee-a-nice-il-n-y-a-aucune-mise-en-scene_1474409\">told newspaper Lib\u00e9ration</a>.</p> <p>Last week, Nice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\">banned the burkini</a> on its beaches, following about 15 seaside areas in south-east France where mayors have done the same.</p> <p>Nice\u2019s deputy mayor, Christian Estrosi, from the centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains party, said a municipal police team had \u201cacted perfectly to make sure that [the] decree was respected\u201d. He threatened legal action against anyone disseminating pictures of municipal police. A total of 24 women have been stopped by police in the city since the burkini ban came into force.</p> <p>The pictures of the woman removing the item of clothing were met with outrage. \u201cI am so ashamed,\u201d tweeted the French feminist Caroline De Haas.</p> <p>Accounts of other women being stopped by police for wearing Muslim headscarves and long-sleeved clothing on beaches caused fury among the ruling Socialist party and rights groups. </p> <p>In Cannes, a 34-year-old mother of two described how she had been stopped and fined on a beach, where she was sitting with her children, while wearing clothes and a headscarf.</p> <p> \u201cI was sitting on a beach with my family. I was wearing a classic headscarf. I had no intention of swimming,\u201d said the former flight attendant from Toulouse, giving her name only as Siam.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/arrete-anti-burkini-une-femme-voilee-dans-l-incomprehension-apres-avoir-ete-verbalisee-1029001.html\">Speaking to BFMTV</a>, she said three police officers had approached her and said a decree issued by the mayor of Cannes stipulated that everyone had to wear correct and appropriate clothing, and that she should tie her headscarf round her head as a bandana or leave the beach. </p> <p> She told the police that she thought her clothing was normal and appropriate, she had not shocked anyone and there was no law stopping her being dressed as she was. </p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in a burkini, I wasn\u2019t in a burqa, I wasn\u2019t naked, so I considered my clothing was appropriate,\u201d she said. She described a mini-riot around her as about 10 people ran over in support, telling the police that the family was not bothering anyone, while about 10 others verbally insulted her. \u201cThere were insults like \u2018Go home\u2019, \u2018We don\u2019t want that here\u2019, \u2018France is a Catholic country\u2019. My daughter was crying, she didn\u2019t understand why her mother was being asked to leave.\u201d </p> <p>She was fined by police, who wrote on her ticket that her clothing did not conform with \u201cgood manners\u201d or French secularism.</p> <p> Mathilde Cusin, a journalist who was at the scene, said: \u201cSome people clearly applauded the police ... People asked her to leave or take off her headscarf. It felt like I was watching a pack turn on a woman seated on the ground in tears with her daughter.\u201d</p> <p> The mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, <a href=\"http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20160823.OBS6733/verbalisees-pour-un-simple-voile-la-derive-des-arretes-anti-burkinis.html\">told magazine L\u2019Obs</a> that he supported the police who had taken the decision to enforce the ban on any \u201costentatious outfits\u201d at the beach. </p> <p> Other footage, posted on Twitter by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FeizaK/status/768119575628177409\">Feiza Ben Mohamed</a> of the Nice-based Federation of Muslims in the South, appeared to show a woman in headscarf, trousers and tunic top being apprehended by police for standing on a beach.

The various mayoral decrees do not explicitly use the word burkini; instead they ban \u201cbeachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation,\u201d citing reasons such as the need to protect public order, hygiene or French laws on secularism. </p> <p> But wearing a burkini remains legal in France. It is also legal to wear in public a Muslim headscarf that does not cover the face.</p> <p> The burkini bans have prompted a row over the French principle of <em><em>la\u00efcit\u00e9</em></em> (secularism), amid accusations that politicians are twisting and distorting this principle for political gain, and to target Muslims.</p> <p>The French republic is built on a strict separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. In theory, the state is neutral in terms of religion and allows everyone the freedom to practise their faith as long as there is no threat to public order.<br></p> <p> Beno\u00eet Hamon, a former education minister running to be the Socialists\u2019 presidential candidate in the 2017 election, said a woman being stopped by police for wearing a headscarf on a beach made a mockery of French secularism and warned against \u201can obsessive oneupmanship against Muslims\u201d by politicians. </p> <p>The Green party senator Esther Benbassa tweeted: \u201cWomen in headscarves stopped by police on the beach.

The Vermont senator spoke for almost 50 minutes, much of which was spent hailing the success of his primary campaign. </p> <p>Sanders cited his popularity among young voters as proof that \u201cour vision is the future of this country\u201d and took a dig at the Democrats, claiming that his campaign \u201ctook on virtually the entire Democratic party establishment\u201d.</p> <p>Our Revolution would build on the popularity of the primary campaign, Sanders said, by supporting \u201cprogressives at every level\u201d as the group bid to plant liberal politicians throughout the country. </p> <p>\u201cReal change never ever takes place from the top on down,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt happens when people come together and demand fundamental change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>He listed five of the progressives Our Revolution would be supporting, with the variation between level of office illustrating the breadth of the organization\u2019s vision.

It\u2019s a very, very hard thing.\u201d</p> <p>The remarks are the strongest evidence yet that Trump is softening his previous stance on illegal immigration, after a meeting with Latino Republicans over the weekend led multiple outlets to report that Trump had vowed to move beyond his pledge to deport all undocumented immigrants from the country, as well as US citizens born to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign threw cold water on those reports at the time. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said on Saturday: \u201cTrump said nothing today that he hasn\u2019t said many times before, including in his convention speech \u2013 enforce our immigration laws, uphold the constitution and be fair and humane while putting American workers first.\u201d</p> <p>Since fall of last year, Trump vowed to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to eject undocumented migrants from the US, but campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, a new addition to the campaign after a leadership shakeup earlier this month, waffled on whether the candidate still embraced that idea on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks unfold, as the weeks unfold, he will lay out the specifics of that plan that he would implement as president of the United States,\u201d Conway told CNN. Asked about whether those specifics included a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d Conway replied: \u201cTo be determined.\u201d</p> <p>John Weaver, former senior strategist for the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, told the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs that Trump\u2019s newfound openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants reads highly familiar - despite Trump decrying the position as tantamount to amnesty during the Republican presidential primaries.</p> <p>\u201cHe has jack rabbit trailed his way to John Kasich\u2019s correct view on immigration,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut, alas it won\u2019t last.

Using his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things, the Republican nominee went on a number of memorable riffs. Voters learned that many of the Hollywood celebrities supporting Hillary Clinton \u201cweren\u2019t very hot any more,\u201d that Trump\u2019s much vaunted border wall would also have \u201cprotection for tunnels\u201d and that in a succinct summation of his message \u201ceverything is bad.\u201d</p> <p>With the hire of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway last week, Trump had started to resemble a more traditional candidate. The teleprompters which he once disdained became a staple of rallies and the campaign\u2019s press office would send out prepared remarks for every speech. It was a far cry from the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d philosophy which guided the nominee\u2019s first campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and it was far more effective than efforts of replacement Paul Manafort to rein the outspoken real estate developer. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">expressed a statement of regret</a> last week in North Carolina, the closest he has ever come to an apology for his multitude of controversial remarks in the course of his campaign.</p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s remarks Wednesday were classic unscripted statements from the candidate. He stoked controversy by hinting at unfounded rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health when he apparently misspoke that his Democratic rival was \u201cpremedicated\u201d in lieu of saying \u201cpremeditated\u201d as was in his prepared remarks. Trump dwelled on the phrase and suggested that he liked \u201cpremedicated\u201d better. It was a return to form for the Republican nominee and one that was received to cheers from his supportive crowd. The question as Trump moves forward with yet another reinvented campaign team is whether this was a brief lapse in style or if it simply further evidence that no operative can tame the bombastic populist on the stump.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0c60e4b0fe30498a473f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T21:11:28.665Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of Donald Trump\u2019s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in office during a \u201cMoms 4 Trump\u201d event in Loudoun County, Virginia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHow many of you would wear a wool coat in August?\u201d John Jaggers asked the a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432\">according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror</a>. \u201cThe woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States wears a wool coat at every single thing.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-louisiana-floods-supplies\">visited Baton Rouge last Friday</a>, handing out water and diapers.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I don\u2019t worry too much about politics,\u201d said Obama, wearing a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves and an unbuttoned collar, standing in front of piles of waterlogged debris. \u201cThe second thing I have seen historically is that, when disasters strike, that\u2019s probably one of the few times when Washington tends not to get political.</p> <p>\u201cI guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican. What they care about is making sure they\u2019re getting the drywall out and the carpet out, there\u2019s not any mould building, they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible. That\u2019s what they care about. That\u2019s what I care about.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-disaster-obama-baton-rouge-mississippi\">The storm and its flooding</a> have damaged an estimated 60,000 homes and forced thousands to seek temporary housing. More than 115,000 people have registered for federal disaster aid. Obama said federal support is at $127m so far. At least 40 state highways remained closed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/barack-obama-fema-louisiana-flood-recovery-culture-katrina\">Obama praises Fema's 'change of culture' during tour of Louisiana flood recovery</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0242e4b048662988fcc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T20:23:53.754Z\">9.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>At a private fundraiser on Sunday in Provincetown, Massachusetts, for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Cher praised Clinton while comparing Donald Trump to Stalin and Hitler.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/24/cher-trump-hitler-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x6qd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681977\"            data-video-name=\"Cher compares Donald Trump to Hitler at Clinton fundraiser \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bdf9ebe4b0fe30498a4716\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160824cher_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160824cher.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160824cher_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/24/cher-trump-hitler-video\">Cher compares Donald Trump to Hitler at Clinton fundraiser</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDo you remember Fun With Dick and Jane?

Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">I'm a doctor.

  "<p>During the final weeks of her life, all spent in an Indian hospital, my grandmother deteriorated peacefully, and gracefully, until she slipped into a coma and breathed her last. My 10-year-old self remembers a thing or two about this time.</p> <p>The hospital\u2019s egg curry, a much-loved north Indian dish, was amazing. The tiny cakes with real butter icing that defied all dietary guidelines weren\u2019t bad either so my cousins and I, gathered in the small room, took turns selecting the menu and outwitting the nurses, who sweetly played along, praising the voracious appetite of our fading grandma. Enveloped in grief at their mother\u2019s impending death, the adults couldn\u2019t bear to look at the food \u2013 if our mirth seemed out of place, they never said so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">I'm a doctor.

We often sat within her line of sight and sometimes when she wasn\u2019t tired, she would lift her hand in blessing. She didn\u2019t have any last-minute advice for us neither did she say goodbye. She never cried and she never complained. In fact, she barely spoke but she smiled when possible. The kind of quiet, contented smile that said she was at peace with life even though she was dying far too young. I remember thinking how much she loved her grandchildren \u2013 the feeling was so powerful and visceral that it never struck me there could be suffering behind it.</p> <p>But my grandmother\u2019s skin had turned bright yellow and explanations were called for.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is she yellow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey say it\u2019s jaundice,\u201d the adults replied.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does she have a drip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor ordered it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is she sleepy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, can we have the egg curry?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was through incidental observations that as children we became witness to life drawing to a close.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were no doctors in our family and there was no sophisticated understanding of the process of illness and dying. Since the adults didn\u2019t know much, there were no customised, careful explanations for the children. In fact, as loss stared us in the face, there was very little to say. But what we lacked in words we made up for in another way \u2013 we stuck together to observe the ritual of dying. </p> <p>Alongside our parents, we watched our beloved grandmother sleep, awake, groan and smile. We watched her totter to the bathroom and then confined to her bed. We watched her eat half her food and then none at all. We learnt to scrutinise the doctors\u2019 expressions and understand that our sorrow wasn\u2019t their fault. We saw how hard the nurses worked and came to fill in their gaps without rancour.</p> <p>Thus it was through incidental observations that as children we became witness to life drawing to a close. It was a gradual and real schooling so that when our grandmother finally died, we were sad but neither inconsolable nor traumatised. Years later, as grown-ups, we find ourselves helping our own children navigate illness and loss \u2013 as the cycle continues, we summon our own memories about the importance of just having been at the bedside.</p> <p>I found myself thinking of all this when I looked after an elderly patient who came for an elective procedure which went horribly wrong. As organ after organ failed, my patient retained an uncommon spirit of optimism, expressing hope that he would get home to see his grandchildren whom he greatly missed.</p> <p>In the week he became irretrievably ill, his daughter came up to me, wringing her hands.</p> <p>\u201cWhat should I do about the kids?\u201d</p> <p>I waited, sensing there was more. As it turned out, her children, 8 and 13, had not been in at all. She had protected them from his temporary problems and when his condition took another downturn, she was grateful that they were occupied at school. She maintained an anxious vigil over him but kept hoping for a day to come when her father was well enough to greet his grandchildren like his old self.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d I gently asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat they\u2019ll have lifelong nightmares. Isn\u2019t it better if they remember him being well?\u201d</p> <p>I felt a stab of regret. It\u2019s true that her father looked pale and gaunt but the warmth in his eyes was unmistakeable. And he could still speak, telling me he didn\u2019t have long and thanking me for my care. He didn\u2019t want to burden his daughter but I longed to fulfil his final desire without compounding her dilemma.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you do if you were me?\u201d she tearfully asked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>GPs report meeting adults ... who fall apart when a parent falls ill because they have never encountered illness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There, she had asked the question I had dreaded. I believed that although there had been better opportunities, a visit to their grandfather\u2019s bedside would still be meaningful and provide an opening to a later unavoidable conversation with the children about illness and mortality. I thought the children were old enough to be left confused by the turn of events and wondered what views they might form of what happened in a hospital. I feared that their mother, coping with bereavement, might struggle to find reasonable explanations later. And I fretted that the emerging disagreement in the family over the children would test adult relationships. So I told her sincerely, \u201cI would find it heartbreaking but I\u2019d try to bring them in.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to children visiting sick or dying relatives in hospital, every family decides differently. Granted, hospitals aren\u2019t designed for the ease of young (or old) visitors. There is a maddening lack of space, chair and amenities and visitors can feel conscious of getting in the way. It\u2019s unlikely that these deficiencies will disappear anytime soon though people do find their way around them.</p> <p>Studies show that childhood bereavement alone is unlikely to be related to adult outcomes. Rather, factors such as parental support, open communication, age-appropriate explanation and the presence of other adverse social and psychological events may have more impact than the fact of the death. </p> <p>In hospitals and nursing homes, there is a stark lack of young visitors to the bedsides of their elderly relatives. When children do visit, they are nearly always parked on a device, making real engagement impossible. We seem happy to let our children Google illness, just not let them near it. But making illness and mortality invisible to our children has unexpected consequences. GPs report meeting adults in their 40s who fall apart when a parent falls ill because they have never encountered illness up close and don\u2019t know how to deal with their own emotions, let alone their children\u2019s.</p> <p>There is an epidemic of loneliness among our elderly population as they trudge from residential care to hospital and back again. For staff, the loneliness is in plain sight \u2013 every doctor has met a patient who begs to stay an extra day because \u201cit\u2019s nice here, people talk to me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/what-its-like-to-survive-cancer-by-those-who-have-been-given-the-all-clear\">What it's like to survive cancer, by those who have done it | Guardian readers and Sarah Marsh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Addressing loneliness is hard when there are a dozen other priorities even though a visit from a loved one is worth a dozen pills. And the comfort of strangers is no match for the consolation of family, so every day we convince and cajole relatives to visit, until it becomes a job as routine as checking bloods.</p> <p>Patients cheer up when anyone visits but when children come they have an unfailing effect on lifting the mood and alleviating the loneliness of patients. Occasionally, I\u2019ve needed to take one of my children on a weekend ward-round and felt bad about it. But my misgivings have melted at the sheer delight of patients. Nothing banishes the dreariness of being in hospital than an innocent banter with a child. The food tastes nicer, the pain seems bearable and life itself seems more hopeful. Indeed, children inject a kind of optimism and happiness in patients that it\u2019s hard to replicate. Countless patients have thanked my children, saying, \u201cYou remind me of my grandchildren,\u201d prompting one green medical student to ask me, \u201cThen where are <em>their</em> grandchildren?\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, for my patient, time ran out and his grandchildren didn\u2019t come in. But the encounter was another reminder of the therapeutic benefit of young visitors to the bedside.</p> <p>We cannot forever shield our children from the realities of life. It\u2019s normal to feel apprehensive but there are steps parents can take to prepare everyone for a visit. We need to protect our children but we also need to spare a thought for our elderly who have often given years to building a bond with our young only to be deprived of it when they most need it. Being sick is hard enough, they don\u2019t need to be lonely too.</p>"
