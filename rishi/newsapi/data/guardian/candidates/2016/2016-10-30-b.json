  "<p>No election has a global impact to match a US presidential contest. Few White House races have been more bitter than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">the current one</a> between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. So any public official who intervenes in it, 11 days before polling, needs to be very sure what they are doing. Such interventions don\u2019t come bigger than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\" title=\"\">FBI director James Comey\u2019s announcement</a> that the bureau is reopening its probe of Mrs Clinton\u2019s private emails. The potential impact is huge. Until last Friday, Mrs Clinton was looking on course to hand Mr Trump a decisive beating. It may still happen. But that is now all up in the air.</p> <p>Mr Comey\u2019s defence appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he didn\u2019t. It is certainly true that US politics has become so polarised and so riddled with paranoia that the FBI director faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fbi-guilty-political-act-crucial-moment\" title=\"\">an unenviable choice</a>. If he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the election, whatever the result, one or both sides would be certain to cry foul. Conspiracy theorists would have had a field day. Yet by making it public now, he makes the investigation itself into a red-hot pre-election issue in a contest that will shape not just America but the world \u2013 and that\u2019s awful.</p> <p>This is precisely why the US Justice Department, with which the FBI works, has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias. The department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election. A memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of US attorneys general every four years, including in 2016. Mr Comey has broken with this. Former Justice Department officials from both political parties have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comey-is-damaging-our-democracy/2016/10/29/894d0f5e-9e49-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.9ea156488389\" title=\"\">denounced him for this</a> over the weekend. The current attorney general is believed to have advised against it, too.</p> <p>Mr Comey has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways. First, the investigation is at an embryonic stage. It may go no further. In his Friday announcement he spoke of emails \u201cthat appear to be pertinent\u201d to the previous investigation he completed \u2013 concluding then that there was no case to answer \u2013 in the summer. But the emails come from a separate investigation, may not even be from Mrs Clinton at all and the FBI chief has not read them. His phrasing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\" title=\"\">extraordinarily vague</a>. Mr Comey has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo. There are echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/13/operation-midland-report-due-met-police-alleged-vip-ring\" title=\"\">British police blunders</a> over child sex allegations. Even louder are the echoes of anti-Clinton fanatics like <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org\" title=\"\">Judicial Watch</a>. This strikes at the democratic process, not just individuals.</p> <p>Second, Mr Comey should not have deferred to Congress, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">as he did last week</a>. The investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics. That\u2019s especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a polarised and acrimonious polity as the US Congress has become. One of the recipients of Mr Comey\u2019s report, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\" title=\"\">Jason Chaffetz</a>, announced even before the FBI director\u2019s move that he intends to begin oversight hearings into Mrs Clinton as soon as she is elected, if she is. Incredible though it may seem to the outside world and many Americans, impeachment efforts by Republicans against Mrs Clinton are already a serious possibility. Law enforcement officials have to be completely scrupulous in such a world. Mr Comey has not been. It is a step towards a lawless process.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton is in many respects the author of her own problems on the email row. But Mr Comey took exactly the wrong decision. If the emails needed investigation, he should have authorised one behind closed doors, carried it out thoroughly, reported it to prosecutors and made an announcement, if one was necessary, in the fullness of time. This is called due process and it is a bulwark of the rule of law, not rule by politicians \u2013 least of all rule by a potential tyrant like Mr Trump.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Comey has rocket-fuelled a venomous contest just when Mr Trump was desperate for a lifeline, just when Republican candidates in other races were craving something to energise their voters and just when some media were becoming bored with the predictability of the White House contest. His action was at best naive and at worst an abuse of office. It may, ultimately, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/29/fbi-email-probe-election-clinton-presidency\" title=\"\">rather less effect on the election outcome</a> than some suppose. Yet it is no consolation that Mr Comey has also guaranteed that, if no charges are brought, he will inevitably be accused of rigging the outcome.</p>",

Choi has denied misappropriating some of the money for personal use.</p> <p>She is alleged to have secured her daughter a place at a prestigious university by forcing a change to the admission criteria \u2013 a claim that has provoked outrage in a country where students endure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/15/south-korea-students\">intense competition</a> to gain places at top schools.</p> <p>While prosecutors prepare to question Choi, who has never held public office and does not have security clearance, details emerged of her central role in Park\u2019s public and private lives.</p> <p>She is said to have become a close confidante of Park in the late 1970s, when Park was grieving over the assassination of her father, Park Chung-hee, a dictator who took power in a military coup in 1961 but who was credited with helping turn South Korea into an industrial powerhouse.</p> <p>Park Chung-hee was killed by his own chief of intelligence at the end of an alcohol-fuelled private dinner.</p> <p>Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, befriended Park after her mother, Yuk Young-soo, was killed by a North Korean spy with a bullet intended for her husband. The older Choi claimed that Yuk had appeared to him in a dream and asked him to help her traumatised daughter.</p> <p>Choi reportedly married six times, had numerous aliases and founded a shady pseudo-Christian cult called the Church of Eternal Life.</p> <p>Choi Soon-sil and Park grew closer still after the death of Choi\u2019s father in 1994, four years before Park was elected to the national assembly.</p> <p>Choi\u2019s ex-husband worked as a close aide to Park in the run-up to her successful presidential bid in 2012, and was allegedly with the president on the day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/16/rescuers-battle-to-save-476-passengers-after-ferry-sinks-off-south-korea\">Sewol ferry tragedy</a> in April 2014, in which 300 schoolchildren, teachers and crew drowned.</p> <p>At the weekend thousands of protesters accused Park of betraying public trust and of gross mismanagement, and one recent poll showed 70% of voters wanted her to resign or be impeached.</p> <p>Few observers believe the crisis will lead to her resignation, with little more than a year left of her single five-year term in the Blue House. Opposition parties have demanded an investigation, but have stopped short of calling for her impeachment.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Park offered the country a brief apology, but insisted Choi\u2019s influence had not extended beyond checking drafts of her speeches soon after she entered the presidential Blue House in early 2013. \u201cChoi is someone who helped me in a difficult time in the past, and I received her help on some of my speeches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Files obtained from Choi\u2019s personal computer by the broadcaster JTBC TV, however, suggest Choi edited some of Park\u2019s key speeches and received confidential documents, including files relating to Japan and North Korea.</p> <p>In an interview with South Korea\u2019s Segye Ilbo newspaper last week, Choi confirmed she had received drafts of Park\u2019s speeches but denied she had influenced government policy or benefitted financially.</p> <p>Park sought to defuse the controversy by demanding the resignation of 10 of her senior secretaries and promising a cabinet reshuffle, but the move has done little to cool criticism of her conduct.</p> <p>Some observers believe that Park will ride out calls for her resignation, with opposition parties reluctant to plunge the country into the political uncertainty that would accompany a lengthy impeachment trial.</p> <p>Victor Cha, a senior adviser and Korea chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Park was unlikely to quit. \u201cDespite calls from the opposition parties for her resignation (which are only likely to grow during the Choi investigation), the more likely outcome is that she may heed demands to leave the Saenuri party, particularly if Saenuri wants to distance itself from Park in the 2017 presidential election year,\u201d Cha <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/controversy-roils-park-government\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea\u2019s largest newspaper, said the scandal marked \u201c<a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/10/26/2016102601669.html\">a complete collapse</a> of a president\u2019s ability to run a government\u201d. The conservative newspaper called on Park\u2019s entire secretariat to resign and the appointment of a caretaker prime minister, effectively ending her role in running the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way open to her is to pull out of government and put the public good first,\u201d it said. \u201cMany people are ashamed for her.

It\u2019s no worse than people expect from the power elite. America, as seen from Meigs County, is a place where bankers can unfairly foreclose on your house and then get paid by Washington for doing it \u2013 and then Washington will demand you sign the bill. His business shenanigans don\u2019t register as shocking because it\u2019s assumed that to get even close to that level you\u2019ve already sold your soul; that\u2019s just how it works. None of the bankers went to jail, and now the banks pay Hillary Clinton the equivalent of 37 years of the median wage in this county per speech to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/hillary-clinton-wall-street-banks-speeches-conflict-of-interest\" title=\"\"> lecture for them</a>.</p> <p>The year 2016 will be political shorthand, in the way you can say \u201c2008\u201d and people think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/13/lehman-brothers-collapse-five-years-later-shiver-spine\" title=\"\">Lehman</a> and <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2008/03/a_quickie_guide_to_the_fall_of.html\" title=\"\">Bear</a> and bailouts.

Trump will still walk away from this thing a winner by his lights if Clinton wins \u2013 not leader of anything, with a reputation left in pitiful dirty tatters, but as head demagogue. He\u2019ll have millions of adoring fans and a revenue stream. He will avoid responsibility for what is to come.</p> <p>Pain and rage and fear and hate are all closely connected; unleashing them all in an unexamined pulsating mass of conspiracy-laden megalomania was ill-advised at best.

Because whatever you think of him, he\u2019s not a vote for the status quo.</p>",

Would he be interested in viewing it?</p> <p>\u201cDavid recognised immediately that [the footage] was explosive,\u201d says the Post\u2019s executive editor Martin Baron, \u201cand the first task was to make sure it was authenticated, which he was able to do pretty quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The Post sent a transcript of the video \u2013 outtakes from a 2005 edition of the NBC show Access Hollywood, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">Trump is heard bragging</a> that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star \u2026 you can do anything [to women] \u2026 grab them by the pussy\u201d \u2013 to the Trump campaign for comment. </p> <p>\u201cThey asked us for the actual video,\u201d says the softly-spoken Baron, \u201cand shortly after that they sent us Donald Trump\u2019s initial response.\u201d Five hours on from the tip-off, the video and accompanying piece went live on the Post, reverberating around the world.</p> <p>While Grope-gate (as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/10/trumps-defense-gropegate-accusers-too-ugly-molest\">some</a> are inevitably calling it) may be a far cry from Watergate, the Post\u2019s most famous scoop, it was nevertheless a momentum-shifting event in the presidential race, which has seen Trump, who had previously claimed that he could <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters\">\u201cshoot somebody\u201d on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue</a> and not lose votes, since <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/clinton-holds-lead-in-new-polls-but-trump-tape-impact-mixed.html\">struggle</a> to regain his swagger. Yet, while the Trump revelations have lately flowed thick and fast, there has been criticism (even in the Post) that much of the US media was initially slow to take Trump seriously, particularly early on in the Republican primaries.</p> <p>Baron vigorously defends his corner. \u201cAt the Post, we took the candidacy seriously from the very beginning,\u201d he insists, going on to cite reporting, among other things, on Trump Mortgage, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/trump-university-claim-revisited-by-new-york-appeals-court\">Trump University</a>, and his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/06/donald-trumps-greed-helped-ruin-atlantic-city-is-the-rest-of-the-country-next/?utm_term=.4d2a700971f6\">\u201cmultiple bankruptcies in Atlantic City\u201d</a>. </p> <p>\u201cOther people reacted in a different way. Certainly there was a tremendous amount of cable coverage of his rallies,\u201d he says. \u201cWall-to-wall, they would cover his rallies from beginning to end, on live television. I don\u2019t happen to think that was a wise decision on their part.\u201d</p> <p>Baron does concede, however, that Trump is \u201cskilful\u201d at using the media. \u201c[During the primaries] he would call into shows, which would normally require a candidate to show up in person, they would just take his phone call and he\u2019d be on the air, and then he\u2019d call the next show. He\u2019s been by far the most accessible presidential candidate ever.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, even when the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/13/donald-trump-just-banned-the-washington-post-from-covering-him-that-should-bother-everyone/\">barred</a> the Post\u2019s reporters from his events (for, they claimed, inaccurate reporting), he still made himself available to Baron\u2019s team. \u201cWe had actual published interviews with him, [even] while we were on the blacklist,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Born in 1954 and raised in Tampa, Florida, Baron, who\u2019s a fluent Spanish speaker, cut his teeth at the Miami Herald, which he first joined in 1976. He went on to work at some of America\u2019s most prestigious titles \u2013 the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. As Globe editor, the paper won six Pulitzer prizes, including in 2003 for the Spotlight team\u2019s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests, which was turned into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/28/spotlight-review-catholic-church-called-to-account-over-child-abuse\">Oscar-winning movie Spotlight</a> last year.

Beyond financial capital, the Amazon CEO has provided the Post with \u201cintellectual capital, too\u201d, Baron explains. \u201cHe\u2019s basically forced us to confront how the internet is different and how we have to adapt to it and embrace it. He\u2019s also given us what he calls \u2018runway\u2019, which is time to experiment. So, in funding the experiments, we have time to let them play out, without having to adhere to some strict timeline or strict requirements for profit.\u201d</p> <p>One area Bezos was especially keen that Baron address was the issue of aggregation. \u201cOne of the first questions he asked was: \u2018You do these long narratives, these deep investigations, but after you\u2019re published, within 15 minutes, half a dozen websites have decided to aggregate you \u2013 and they get more traffic than you do. How do you propose to deal with that?\u2019\u201d Baron\u2019s solution was, in effect, to fight fire with fire; hiring in-house bloggers, not only did the Post start aggregating itself, but it began aggregating other people\u2019s content too.</p> <p>Since acquiring the Post, Bezos \u2013 who\u2019s added 140 employees in three years \u2013 has held regular conference calls with senior staff. So how interested is he in the editorial side of the paper? The question isn\u2019t even complete before Baron jumps in: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t inject himself at all into our journalism. He doesn\u2019t suggest stories for us to do. He doesn\u2019t critique us in any way. Every once in a while, when he sees a story which delights him, he tells us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/washington-post-amazon-jeff-bezos\">The Washington Post embarks on Amazon adventure with Jeff Bezos | Dan Gillmor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[The conference calls] are all about tactics and strategy. We talked about aggregation, way back when. We\u2019ve talked about our audience engagement team. But in terms of particular stories, particular projects, or particular avenues of coverage, he does not get involved at all.\u201d</p> <p>When asked what he thinks the Post\u2019s output and business model will look like in five years time, Baron concedes that he simply doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI always say the people who are most certain about what the model will be are the furthest removed from any responsibility for actually making that model occur,\u201d he says a touch world-wearily.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened so fast, and the pace of change has really accelerated. Today we\u2019re sitting here talking about what we are doing for Facebook Live. Or what we\u2019re doing for Snapchat. We\u2019re talking about using bots for Amazon Echo, which we did to provide scores during the Olympics. And during this election we\u2019ll be [using bots] to provide election results. [These aren\u2019t] things we talked about a year ago \u2013 maybe we should have, but we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his ink-stained background, Baron believes that if institutions such as the Post are to survive, they have to think and behave like technology companies: they need to move fast, take risks, and accept that failure is an essential part of experimentation. \u201cI think people [at the Post] do feel free to propose new ideas and try new things,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no penalty for failing. If it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d But, he adds quickly, newspapers must always stick to their principles and values. \u201cWe can never violate that.

When Murphy next mentioned Trump, Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DteDRD6cbbM\">a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani</a>: \u201cA noun, a verb and Donald Trump: that\u2019s his answer to everything.\u201d</p> <p>The race in Florida, among the most closely watched in the country, could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. Democrats see the vote as a referendum on Trump. But Murphy\u2019s mentions of the businessman underscored the potential limitations of using the top of the ticket to mount attacks down the ballot.</p> <p>Murphy has questioned how Rubio can endorse Trump, whom Rubio has called \u201ca con man\u201d, untrustworthy with the nuclear codes, and \u201cthe most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency\u201d. In recent weeks, polls have given the Democrat hope, in part because Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton in Florida by around three points. But with nine days left before Election Day, Rubio is about seven points up on Trump in the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Less than ideal choices\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This week, both candidates spoke to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that these are less than ideal choices before us,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we need a senator willing to stand up to the next president no matter who it is \u2013 even if it\u2019s from your own party.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio was speaking on the day the FBI director, James Comey, said the agency was reviewing emails that might be pertinent to the closed investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state. </p> <p>\u201cThe question now is will Patrick Murphy still 100% trust Hillary Clinton, as he has said in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, who spoke earlier in the week after appearing with Clinton at a rally in Coconut Creek, said there was no comparison between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful that Senator Rubio\u2019s connecting me to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou look at what she\u2019s been fighting for her entire life, and you contrast that to Donald Trump. You talk about a contrast of both qualifications and temperament for who our next world leader is going to be.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Trump\u2019s litany of inflammatory comments \u2013 against immigrants, Muslims, women, the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero, prisoners of war and more \u2013 Murphy said it was \u201cappalling to a lot of Floridians that Marco Rubio continues to stand by Donald Trump\u2019s side\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people had the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,\u201d he added, noting the flurry of Republicans who withdrew their support earlier this month after a video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">unearthed from 2005</a> in which the former reality TV star bragged about groping and kissing women without consent.</p> <p>Rubio, despite condemning Trump\u2019s comments, was not among them. He has kept Trump at a distance, however, making no campaign appearances with the nominee despite his frequent presence in Florida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"281fee7cc4c65d703cf356526fa3bcb4b81df19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281fee7cc4c65d703cf356526fa3bcb4b81df19d/90_137_2285_2855/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton campaigns with Patrick Murphy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton campaigns with Patrick Murphy in Coconut Creek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubio\u2019s rationale rests primarily in the balance of the supreme court, where the vacancy left by Antonin Scalia remains. In the primary, Rubio doubted whether Trump would nominate a conservative. He told the Guardian a list of potential appointees released by Trump was \u201cencouraging\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see who wins the election and whether he\u2019ll actually do that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be held to the same standard, whether it\u2019s a Republican president or a Democrat president \u2026 I\u2019m looking for people that will apply the constitution according to the original intent of the words of the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio also expressed confidence that he would be judged on his own record. Saying his opponent lacked any legislative accomplishments despite having served in Congress for four years, Rubio touted his own work on issues such as human trafficking, sanctions against Venezuela and Hezbollah, and veterans affairs.</p> <p>Asked if he would be willing to work with Clinton, he stopped short of naming potential areas of agreement. \u201cI have a record of working with people across the aisle, and I\u2019ll work with anyone if they\u2019re pursuing ideas that I think are good for America,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, whose time in Congress has been been spent in the minority, denied he had little to show. He listed funding for the Everglades, preventing cuts to a key component of Medicare, and securing lower flood insurance rates, and stated his commitment to issues such as climate change, equal pay and raising the minimum wage.</p> <p>He has nonetheless struggled with a lack of name recognition, compounded by limited resources after national Democratic groups withdrew millions of dollars in reserved ad spending. </p> <p>The decision has drawn criticism from some observers, for its apparent abandonment of a race many believe is winnable. Others complain of a missed opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to Rubio, whom many believe will make another run for the presidency, potentially challenging Clinton in 2020. </p> <p>But some involved in Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake the Senate defended their move, citing Florida\u2019s expensive media markets in comparison to battlegrounds such as Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina, where money can prove more influential. </p> <p>\u201cI do think the threat of him running for president in 2020 is real,\u201d a Senate Democratic strategist said of Rubio. \u201cBut our goal is to take back the Senate and win the White House right now. We\u2019re not running a campaign for 2020.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>\u2018The height of cynicism\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21b31afa73452caf397e45eeb3e7899bb63f540e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b31afa73452caf397e45eeb3e7899bb63f540e/0_353_3408_2045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rubio and Murphy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rubio and Murphy meet to debate at Broward College in Davie, earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another Democratic strategist familiar with the Florida Senate race said internal polling conducted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign showed Murphy trailing Rubio by high single digits. On Thursday, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/senate-update-rubio-is-keeping-the-republicans-hopes-alive-in-the-senate\">FiveThirtyEight</a> gave Rubio an 81% chance of defeating Murphy, finding the sitting senator ahead in 48 of 50 public polls. On Sunday, two new polls showed Rubio up by eight and nine points.</p> <p>Pressure to reinvest in the race did pay some dividends last week, when a Super Pac affiliated with Senate minority leader Harry Reid confirmed it was transferring a seven-figure sum to a pro-Murphy super pac in Florida.

For one thing, Rubio has a solid base of support among Hispanic voters, many of whom identify with the Spanish-speaking son of Cuban immigrants and in 2012 accounted for 17% of Florida\u2019s electorate. </p> <p>Murphy ramped up his outreach to the Hispanic community \u2013 somewhat belatedly, some say. In doing so, he sought to revive Rubio\u2019s involvement in a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, noting that the senator backed away from the issue when faced with backlash from conservatives.</p> <p>It has been an uphill battle. In Miami\u2019s Little Havana recently, at one of Clinton\u2019s 81 Florida field offices, volunteers labored to get out the vote. Dozens of voters, mostly Latino, entered and left the building.</p> <p>Among them were Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez.

  "<p>The dealmakers behind the proposed mega-merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner have accomplished the impossible: uniting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their condemnation of the deal.<br></p> <p>Trump, needless to say, has been the most vituperative. The merger would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/trump-att-time-warner-deal-clinton-kaine\">destroy democracy</a>\u201d, he said. But pretty much everyone in Washington has publicly come out against it. Sanders, Clinton\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination and now campaigning on her behalf, is already <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/10/25/sanders-we-must-do-everything-possible-to-press-clinton-on-att-time-warner/\">preparing to battle a future Clinton administration</a> to ensure that anti-trust regulators turn thumbs-down on the deal. Lining up beside him? Powerhouse senator Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>The two companies and their bankers must feel that they have walked straight into a buzzsaw. The Senate will hold a hearing on it on 7 December, after the election. Will tempers have cooled by then? Maybe, maybe not.</p> <p>So, what on earth drove Time Warner and AT&amp;T to sprint to the altar during an election season in which populist politicians are dominating the airwaves and the debate? Insanity? Desperation? A sense that there was an opportunity that was just too good to pass up? Or simply an urge to annoy the politicians?<br></p> <p>The word to bear in mind might simply be \u201cpanic\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s no shock to anyone who keeps an eye on these worlds that companies that distribute all the content that we consume, and the companies that produce it (translation: AT&amp;T as the party of the first part, and Time Warner as the party of the second part) have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/att-time-warner-acquisition-customer-service-impact\">vested interest in forging alliances among themselves</a>. The closer and more seamless those alliances are, the faster and more creatively they can work on developing and delivering more of that content for all our devices, especially those smartphones and tablets from which we are unable to wean ourselves. </p> <p>Those that get it right have captive audiences simply because they are delivering a growing proportion of that content. It\u2019s an enticing prospect.</p> <p>Analysts have been expecting that we\u2019d see yet another wave of convergence \u2013 a buzzword in this media/telecommunications universe for the better part of two decades now, having been behind the merger that formed Time Warner itself in 1995 \u2013 for several years. </p> <p>This time, it\u2019s happening in different ways, not always via mergers. Apple and Time Warner\u2019s HBO have linked their brands already, with Apple distributing the HBO Now service. Imagine <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-rosa/apple-and-hbo-think-diffe_b_10279702.html\">what might happen</a> if Apple \u2013 with its cash mountain \u2013 decided to snap up HBO\u2019s parent company, Time Warner, and pursue the myriad potential synergies between its own platforms and Time Warner\u2019s content? </p> <p>I suspect it\u2019s safe to say that the folks at AT&amp;T did just that \u2013 and panicked. </p> <p>Or else they considered what might happen if another giant rival with the potential to build a mammoth platform and plenty of cash \u2013 like Google, which has already pushed into live-TV streaming \u2013 pre-empted them. Or they allowed companies like Amazon or Netflix to get further ahead with their own plans. </p> <p>Facing that kind of strategic risk, a little bit of political risk may not look like anything terribly threatening. Sure, the politicians may indulge in a lot of saber rattling for the benefit of voters, especially since the deal was announced in the final days of the presidential election campaign. But it will be many months before regulators will rule on it \u2013 even if a deep-pocketed rival doesn\u2019t muscle in and outbid AT&amp;T for Time Warner.</p> <p>Will the public outrage endure? The dealmakers and the board members at both companies seem to be making a calculated decision that the answer is \u201cno\u201d. </p> <p>That seems optimistic. We already <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/internet-u-s-compare-globally-hint-slower-expensive/\">pay far more</a> than citizens in most other parts of the world for basic broadband access, thanks to the fact that most communities offer very limited options to their citizens. Most telecommunications services are equally pricey, relative to those offered elsewhere, from <a href=\"https://www.billshark.com/u-s-mobile-plans-expensive/\">mobile phones</a> to cable television services. The number of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21702177-television-last-having-its-digital-revolution-moment-cutting-cord\">cord-cutters</a> continue to grow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/att-time-warner-acquisition-customer-service-impact\">What will AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner mean for customers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two companies have an idea of what they\u2019ll do to keep their own customers loyal. \u201cPremium content always wins,\u201d said Randall Stephenson, CEO and chairman of AT&amp;T, in the company\u2019s press release announcing the transaction. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the world\u2019s best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen. A big customer pain point is paying for content once but not being able to access it on any device, anywhere. Our goal is to solve that.\u201d</p> <p>At what price, though? Stephenson does refer to delivering \u201cvalue\u201d to customers, and certainly, you can expect to hear Time Warner and AT&amp;T insist that because their proposed match is a \u201cvertical\u201d merger rather than a \u201chorizontal\u201d one, this should pose less of an antitrust threat. In other words, consumers won\u2019t see prices soar as a result of reduced competition.</p> <p>In a horizontal transaction, two companies that compete to provide roughly the same kind of services or goods (think, Cox Communications and Comcast), merge and become one, meaning that there are fewer entities involved in setting prices for content as purchasers, or for services as providers. In a vertical transaction, such as the proposed merger, companies that are in different parts of the business (in this case, content and distribution) join forces.</p> <p>But in markets where competition is already restricted \u2013 such as, say, the internet \u2013 price increases could be a result of even vertical mergers. That\u2019s the conclusion of studies by one economist, John Kwoka of Northeastern University, who found that of the 1,000 mergers of all kinds that he evaluated over the last two decades, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/25/att-time-warner-blocked/\">at least a third generated price increases in excess of 10%</a>. A remarkable 80% of them raised prices to consumers to some degree; the average increase was about 7%. </p> <p>Ponder that, antitrust regulators.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways in which this could happen. For instance, all of the programming that Time Warner produces could suddenly become unavailable to competitors to the newly merged entity\u2019s rival distributors, except at a much higher price. You have an AT&amp;T smartphone and want to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones? Congrats \u2013 you can do so on any device you own for half the price you\u2019d pay if you have a Verizon phone and want to watch on your iPad. </p> <p>It\u2019s up to the politicians not just to be blowhards about the deal or threaten to axe it. Consumers may end up with great, efficiently delivered and fairly priced content as a result of mergers like the one that AT&amp;T and Time Warner are proposing. The trick is to ensure how that potential is realized. Will the regulators do their job?</p> <p>That\u2019s why what happens in the weeks following the election is going to be so crucial. Who will the new president choose to advise her (or him) on issues like commerce and telecommunications? Who will (s)he tap for membership on the Federal Trade Commission (which governs antitrust issues) and the Federal Communications Commission (which oversees telecommunications policy, and of which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/technology/chief-who-sharpened-fccs-teeth-faces-final-hurdles.html\">the next president must name a new chairman</a>), two of the key regulators associated with this industry?</p> <p>Regulators have the ability to lay down the law and make the deal much more consumer-friendly in any number of ways, demanding (for instance) that the new company make HBO shows available more readily via apps or streaming, meaning that we wouldn\u2019t be forced to sign up for costly packages.</p> <p>For once, all the heated political rhetoric might come in useful, if it ensures that the regulators keep their eye on the ball. I wish I was confident that the attention span of outraged politicians was as long as that of the strategic thinkers and panicky dealmakers \u2013 but I\u2019m not.</p>",

  "<p>Tony Schwartz\u2019s former editor has a nickname for him. \u201cHe\u2019s Dr Frankenstein,\u201d was how Edward Kosner put it in the New Yorker. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">FBI director Comey faces fury for cryptic letter about Clinton email inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fairness, there have been many Dr Frankensteins behind the rise and rampage of Donald Trump. They\u2019ve included the Republican party, with its years of divisiveness and racially charged rhetoric; the media, with its collective chase of the next shiny object; and the baby boomers feeling the cultural and economic ground give way.</p> <p>But it was Schwartz who sparked this strange political creature into life. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/19/trump-co-writer-says-candidate-could-end-civilisation-the-art-of-the-deal-tony-schwartz\">ghostwriter of Trump\u2019s bestselling 1987 book The Art of the Deal</a>, he did more than anyone to create the businessman\u2019s public persona. In it he translated Trump\u2019s coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d, which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the greatest, the most beautiful. Schwartz helped give Trump the sweet smell of success \u2013 now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the American dream.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been horrifying,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the nearly 30 years after the book was published, the main thing I felt was, I want to be as far away from this man as I can, but I didn\u2019t feel I created Frankenstein, because he was a real estate developer and reality television star. Who cared? It wasn\u2019t that consequential to the world.\u201d</p> <p>But building on the foundation of The Art of the Deal, Trump spent a decade hosting the reality TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/mark-burnett-donald-trump-apprentice-tapes\">The Apprentice</a>, reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d (and blurring the boundaries between reality and reality television, just as he would throughout the presidential campaign). Many supporters say they trust him to run America like a company; the business of America is business. It was no coincidence that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">launched his presidential campaign</a> at Trump Tower, a marbled cathedral of capitalism in Manhattan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is a man who is a chameleon and doesn\u2019t have any core beliefs beyond his own aggrandisement and power</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Schwartz, 64, continues: \u201cI simply didn\u2019t think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this wasn\u2019t going to just fade away, that he was actually in a position to win the nomination. That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve contributed to creating the public image of the man who is sociopathic and people don\u2019t realise it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If he were writing The Art of the Deal today, he\u2019d call it \u201cThe Sociopath\u201d<em> </em>instead, Schwartz <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">told the <em>New Yorker</em> in July</a>, an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter. \u201cI certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what I knew about a man I considered to be so dangerous, and I am very relieved that I did.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump he observed was vulgar and vainglorious, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">a narcissistic liar</a> with a short attention span, no appetite for reading books and an \u201cextremely mixed\u201d business record. A Trump presidency could, he warns, lead to martial law, the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear war: \u201cStaggeringly dangerous. Worse than I imagined when he began to run. Unthinkable. Horrifying. He\u2019s way more out of control in the last couple of months than I\u2019ve ever seen him. He doesn\u2019t have any core beliefs beyond his own aggrandisement and power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0946058be14987797a4cc0e7f47e40f9bd7ff7e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0946058be14987797a4cc0e7f47e40f9bd7ff7e7/310_213_2423_1454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Schwartz, left, with Ivana Trump, photographer Francesco Scavullo, and Donald Trump at the book party for The Art of the Deal at Trump Tower, in December 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schwartz, left, with Ivana Trump, photographer Francesco Scavullo, and Donald Trump at the book party for The Art of the Deal at Trump Tower, in December 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Schwartz fell into writing the book almost by accident. A liberal journalist in Ronald Reagan\u2019s America, he wrote a scathing magazine article on Trump, only to receive a note from the entrepreneur, ever greedy for attention, saying he liked it. When Schwartz went to interview him for Playboy, Trump said he wanted to write an autobiography, even though he was only 38. Schwartz suggested instead a book called The Art of the Deal. Trump agreed \u2013 and said he should write it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/world-series-chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians\">World Series trumps presidential election in two title-starved midwest cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a high mortgage and a second child on the way, Schwartz needed the money. He struck his own deal: a joint byline, half of the $500,000 advance and half the royalties. It paid off in financial if not spiritual terms: The Art of the Deal sold more than a million copies and spent 13 weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list.</p> <p>Even at the time, Schwartz felt he was selling out, but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long, long time thinking about why I did it,\u201d he muses. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the only choice I made that I\u2019m not proud of in my life. It\u2019s a complicated question to say whether I would do it differently today and here\u2019s why: if I knew everything I know about what would happen to Trump, of course I wouldn\u2019t do it. </p> <p>\u201cBut the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so powerful, in a negative way, that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Schwartz quit journalism and set up a consulting firm, <a href=\"https://theenergyproject.com/\">The Energy Project,</a> which aims to boost employees\u2019 productivity with happier, healthier workplaces. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 30 years doing stuff I\u2019m proud of, that I\u2019m not sure I would have gotten to if I hadn\u2019t written that book. It gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking. So it\u2019s complicated, right?</p> <p>\u201cOne does good things and bad things over the course of a life and, if you get to the age I am and feel good about the life you\u2019ve lived, it\u2019s hard to say, \u2018Gee, I wish I\u2019d done this differently or that differently.\u2019 Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have landed where I did.\u201d</p> <p>Schwartz delivered <a href=\"https://www.oxford-union.org/term_events/27\">an address to the Oxford Union</a> in the UK last Friday with the title \u201cInto the belly of the beast: how Donald Trump led me on the path to dharma [enlightenment]\u201d. He says: \u201cWhat are the consequences of the choices you make that you rationalise to yourself, but can little imagine potentially huge consequences?\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen who else will find a moment of zen after election day on 8 November. Probably not the Republicans, facing bitter infighting after Trump\u2019s hostile takeover. It will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely. Last December, the Republican candidate Jeb Bush <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261438-jeb-trump-playing-the-media-like-a-fiddle\">told press reporters:</a> \u201cHe\u2019s playing you guys like a fiddle \u2026 by saying outrageous things and garnering attention.\u201d</p> <p>In February, Les Moonves, chairman of TV network CBS, declared: \u201cIt may not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d By March Trump was already estimated to have earned <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html?_r=0\">$2bn of media attention.</a> There will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given \u2013 and whether his bigotry should have been called out sooner, rather than normalised and mainstreamed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a reporter for many years.

The New York Times obtained records showing the billionaire may not have paid tax for 18 years. Then the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">revealed a 2005 video</a> in which Trump bragged about groping women (something Schwartz says he did not witness in 18 months shadowing him). This opened the floodgates for a dozen women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault or unwanted advances.</p> <p>Schwartz reflects: \u201cI think my journey has a parallel in the journey of the media over the past six to 12 months.

It\u2019s true for the media, for politics, for the culture of this country and for the whole issue of polarisation. Assuming it ends without Trump being elected, we have to use this as an opportunity to question a lot of assumptions that vast numbers of people had accepted and he has proved are not true.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump does lose the election, as opinion polls strongly suggest, there will tremendous relief for Schwartz. \u201cThis is an inflection point and if he\u2019s as soundly rejected as it looks like he will be, it\u2019ll be quite a contrast, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/trump-clinton-polls-brexit\">to Brexit</a>. It will suggest the forces of progress and evolution hurled away the forces of hatred and fear.\u201d</p> <p>But how would Trump, whose entire personal mythology is based on winning with swagger, react to the devastating loss? Schwartz knows it won\u2019t be pretty. \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s terrified and angry about it and bewildered by it. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly how he\u2019s going to respond. It won\u2019t be in a healthy way.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance he\u2019s going to do everything he can to blame this on someone other than himself. To insist it\u2019s a rigged election and to try to mobilise the angry people who are his base to do something violent and crazy, which he can then blame on the next administration.

  "<p>This is what greets you when you arrive at a Trump rally: two 18-wheelers parked outside the sports stadium where the Republican nominee will be speaking, placed end-to-end so that nobody can miss them. The front truck, painted white, has \u201cThe Donald for President\u201d scrawled across its side, above the slogans: \u201cAll lives matter\u201d, \u201cBuild the wall\u201d, and \u201cKeep Mexican dope in Mexico\u201d.</p> <p>It is a relatively gentle introduction to Trumpworld, a scattering of antagonism for the gathering crowd.

After we have spent months watching the impossible happen, of hearing the defense of the indefensible, of observing American values \u2013 one after another \u00ad\u2013 fall like bowling pins, it\u2019s time to ask: what has this sometimes maddening, bizarre, gruesome, hilarious, shocking, scary Trump phenomenon been about? More urgently, once the pall of this most baffling of presidential elections has cleared and 8 November fades into the background, what will the Donald have left behind?</p> <p>Some of the answers to those questions come easily, shared freely by Trump\u2019s supporters as they wait in line. Conspiracy theories are one aspect of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Donald likely to be with us for a long time.</p> <p>Here\u2019s Vjekoslav Grgas, a Croatian American, standing dutifully in the non-VIP line. In five short minutes, he rattles off a litany of horror stories. Did you know that three men were assassinated at the Democratic national convention in July to cover up the fact that they were the source of the WikiLeaks dump of hacked Democratic emails? Or that the liberal financier George Soros bankrolled several US foreign policy disasters, and that Hillary Clinton personally pocketed 99% of the donations to the Clinton Foundation following the 2010 Haiti earthquake?

Phrases are thrown out<strong> </strong>from the line with such repetitive frequency that they take on the blandness of cliches. One of the VIP Bikers for Trump, John Hearl, is among many at the rally who says he likes the reality TV star because unlike career politicians, Trump \u201cspeaks his own mind\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said, and if that offends somebody, well then, they just have to understand the goal of all this.\u201d</p> <p>Which is?</p> <p>\u201cAmerica first.\u201d</p> <p>A little further ahead in the VIP line stands Carole Urban, wearing a sequined hat in the colors of the American flag. She says she is also looking forward to hearing Trump speaking, because \u201che\u2019s down to our level. He\u2019s not like past presidents who prepare a beautiful speech but it\u2019s not coming from the heart. He speaks it like it is.\u201d</p> <p>Beautiful speeches from past presidents. Is she referring to Obama?</p> <p>She pulls her shoulders back and with a note of indignation says: \u201cWhen I first heard Obama I was elected, I thought he could improve our country. I voted for him in 2008. I was so disillusioned in him \u2013 after four years, he helped ruin this country.\u201d</p> <p>Was part of that disillusionment to do with Obama\u2019s \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d, as she puts it? <br></p> <p>She shrugs a second time. \u201cYes, I was angry about his oratory. The way he was speaking, it touched my soul, it was so beautiful. A black person, everyone says, but he\u2019s actually mulatto. I thought he could do a great job helping American people, but it didn\u2019t happen like that.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Urban about how, as a woman, she feels about Trump\u2019s self-confessed sexually predatory behavior, she gets indignant. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this being brought up. Words come out in the wrong way at times; you put your foot in your mouth. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is remotely derogatory to women.\u201d</p> <p>To follow Urban\u2019s train of thought: Trump is loved by his supporters not just because of the content of what he says, such as his seemingly endless ability to insult anyone from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/trump_mexico_not_sending_us_their_best_criminals_drug_dealers_and_rapists_are_crossing_border.html\">Mexicans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/\">Muslims</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/\">African Americans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a44629/donald-trump-insults-women/\">women</a>. It\u2019s also the way he says it. It\u2019s the language he uses: unscripted, unpolished, and not infrequently unintelligible. He is the antithesis of the fancy, considered Obama, with the Harvard law degree and the \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d.</p> <p>The contrast is worth exploring. Here is Obama speaking on the campaign trail at a similar end-game stage in the 2008 election: \u201cHope! That\u2019s what kept our parents going when times were tough. It\u2019s what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in America; what led those who couldn\u2019t vote to march and organize and stand for freedom, that led them to cry out: \u2018It may look dark tonight, but if I hold on to hope, tomorrow will be brighter.\u2019\u201d </p> <p></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwiVqCbizKg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AwiVqCbizKg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And here is Trump speaking tonight at the rally, reproduced verbatim: \u201cBikers love me. I will see these bikers, oftentimes on Harleys, not always, but a lot of times. I feel so safe with these bikers. A lot of times they don\u2019t want to come inside, they just want to make sure I feel safe. I love you guys, I love you guys.\u201d</p> <p>Or this on his rival: \u201cHillary lied. No, no, no, she lied. She\u2019s a liar. And she lied and she lied. She lied. It\u2019s so important we vote in November so that we get rid of these liars, these incompetent people, the Hillary Clintons.\u201d</p> <p>So what if Trump\u2019s diction is less than perfect? There are no rules on how a would-be president should communicate with the people, nor are there minimum standards of rhetorical prowess for the White House.</p> <p>What seems apparent is that Trump has given his followers the license to emulate him in throwing caution to the wind and saying things that previously were considered unacceptable. Trump has also opened a new era in American politics in which it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or how you say it. Be as offensive as you like.

Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d chants fill thestadium. </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani comes on to introduce the main speaker and immediately launches into a story about locker rooms, turning the candidate\u2019s excuse for why he bragged about grabbing \u201cpussy\u201d into a joke. Then he turns his comments on Clinton, adding: \u201cI\u2019m going to get down off the stage with you into the basket of deplorables. Because unlike Clinton, you speak the truth. You\u2019re for real, she\u2019s a phoney.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a disconnect between the ugly schoolyard name-calling coming from the speakers and the outward appearance of their audience. Yes, there are the usual smattering of patriotic followers in costume of the sort that frequent any Republican event: women robed in the Stars and Stripes; men posing as Uncle Sam with crooked top hats like wonky chimneys on their heads.

She\u2019s unfit to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Trump enters the auditorium and the atmosphere rises to another level. Before he arrived it was already electric; now it\u2019s like one of those static balls that make your hair stand on end.</p> <p>The candidate launches into his routinely un-beautiful speech. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Crooked Hillary, what about the crooked media? CNN is a disgrace. CNN is a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>A huge boo erupts from the stadium floor as the crowd turns towards the media compound where reporters and camera operators are penned in for the duration. Trump\u2019s invective has an immediate and chilling impact among the crowd. Men and women who only moments ago were pleasantly talking to us, sharing generously their reflections on the state of the nation, are now jabbing their fingers in our direction and spitting: \u201cCNN sucks!

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the story of Noel Field is in my DNA.\u201d </p> <p>Kati Marton takes a sip of coffee. Her parents were Hungarian journalists, jailed by the Soviet regime in Budapest in the 1950s. Her father was kept in a secret police prison cell that once held Field, in a jail that also held Field\u2019s wife, Herta. When all concerned were free, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101850.html\">Endre and Illona Marton</a> were the first and only journalists to interview Field.

He was a Boston quaker, born in 1904, a brilliant mind who completed Harvard in two years and joined the state department.

It mines a rich seam: spies and spying, central Europe between the wars and after, the devastating effects of totalitarianism, fanaticism and betrayal.</p> <p>\u201cI have a fascination with espionage that goes back to my earliest childhood,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I first heard the word \u2018spy\u2019, the Hungarian word for it, when I was six years old when my parents were falsely accused of being spies \u2013 for being good journalists really, the last independent journalists in Budapest in the 1950s. And the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre.\u201d<br></p> <p>In precis, Field\u2019s bizarre saga is this. Appalled by the horrors of the first world war, an internationalist and pacifist, he was pushed left by the Great Depression, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1927/03/the-case-of-sacco-and-vanzetti/306625/\">the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti</a> and President Hoover\u2019s brutal treatment of <a href=\"https://zinnedproject.org/materials/the-bonus-army/\">the Bonus Army</a>.

During the second world war, he ran aid for the Unitarian Service Committee \u2013 and channelled it to communists first. He also worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a predecessor of the CIA. In peacetime, he went to Prague. He hoped to find new purpose but he was seized, taken to Hungary, imprisoned and brutally tortured.</p> <p>Field became a pawn in the last Stalinist purges, his name deployed in show trials to incriminate others though he was never tried himself. As Marton tells in shattering sequence, in the most extraordinary passages of an extraordinary book, family members went behind the Iron Curtain to find him. They paid a terrible cost. Field\u2019s faith never wavered, though, and in Budapest in 1970 he was buried with full Soviet honours.</p> <h2>\u2018The fixed point has always been Budapest\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c38fda2ed1ec9e49157b947afb911d53c689bec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c38fda2ed1ec9e49157b947afb911d53c689bec/0_0_1200_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An identification card issued in 1946, by the US war department for Noel Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Government</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Marton\u2019s last book but one, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/books/review/Furst-t.html\">Enemies of the People</a>, she told her parents\u2019 story: how they were taken from her when she was five, how they came back, how they fled to freedom.

Then she turned homewards once more.</p> <p>\u201cMy life has been a rather turbulent one,\u201d she says, after <a href=\"http://www.womanaroundtown.com/sections/woman-around-town/woman-around-town-kati-marton-her-own-person\">40 years or more</a> as an award-winning journalist and writer, \u201cbut the fixed point has always been Budapest and what happened in those years, because they were shrouded in mystery. My parents did not fancy talking about either the communist period or even less the one that preceded it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I finished my last book I was looking for a way to get out of my own saga. And I picked up [the historian] Arthur Schlesinger\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/reviews/001126.26franket.html\">A Life in the 20th Century</a>, and up popped this name, Noel Field, as someone who had worked with Schlesinger and the OSS and whom Schlesinger had never trusted.\u201d</p> <p>Marton began work, quickly finding that \u201csurviving family members were very receptive to my research because they themselves didn\u2019t know very much\u201d. The Field family made available correspondence which \u201cforms very much the spine of this book\u201d.</p> <p>Marton discovered a truly extraordinary character, a man whose motives might genuinely be described as good who ended up working against his own country, in the service of a nightmare regime. Field suffered brutally for such loyalty. But he was directly implicated in the death of at least one person and his name was used to condemn many others. Throughout the book, the horrors of the Gulag loom large.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a human drama in a political context,\u201d Marton says, \u201cbut to me what\u2019s interesting is what motivates such a person \u2013 well-born, superbly educated with every privilege, poised on a dream career \u2013 to espouse one of the most violent, destructive ideologies?\u201d</p> <p>She cannot have imagined that her attempt to answer this question would be published at such a propitious time. For one thing, the book has come out in the midst of a presidential election in which one candidate\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">apparent ties to Russia and a brutal Russian leader</a> have been constantly, hotly and sensationally debated. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">Donald Trump and Russia: a web that grows more tangled all the time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the name \u201cDonald Trump\u201d comes up in conversation, Marton \u2013 a friend of the Clintons \u2013 grimaces and elides, though she alights on an issue nonetheless distinctly linked to the rise of the Republican presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very involved with refugee issues,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an overseer of the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> and I\u2019m a refugee myself, having benefited from American largesse. And [in the 1930s] as now the country was showing its worst side, its least generous side to refugees, in that case fleeing Nazism. And this played a big role in Field\u2019s radicalisation.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the connection to today\u2019s world is very interesting to me, regarding the power of an idea to blind a man and how fanaticism works. And when I finished writing this, I thought: \u2018Holy cow, how am I ever going to get the public\u2019s attention when the public is obsessed with Trump and the \u2018war against terror\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to write an essay and put it right at the front of the book, called The Capture of Minds, whereby I connect the capture of young, alienated, lost idealists today by a really destructive, toxic but addictive ideology, that is Islamic fundamentalism, with its 1930s equivalent, which was global communism and Stalinism, for another disenchanted generation which had basically given up on their own countries\u2019 ability to set things to rights.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica then was a nation that was deeply divided, and its youth had given up on politics as usual. So they were very susceptible to a messiah promising to right every wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Witches in the government</h2> <p>Inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/true-believer-kati-marton.html?_r=0\">reviewers</a> of Marton\u2019s book have cited the novels of John Le Carr\u00e9, presenting Field as a spy who did not come in from the cold. The sheer naivety of her subject, however, sometimes brings the book closer, in a bizarre way, to the comedies of PG Wodehouse. In one extraordinary scene, Field, intoxicated on his faith, bounds up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to sing the Internationale in Russian, horrified NKVD handlers milling embarrassedly about below. Imagine a great lost masterpiece \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/07/pg-wodehouse-creative-writing-leave-it-to-psmith-reading-group\">Psmith</a>: Stalinist Spy. </p> <p>But if there is comedy in Marton\u2019s larger story, it is pitch black. Somehow, while Field was spying for Stalin in 1930s Washington, he went undetected. Some suspected him in Europe but the story of how he went east \u2013 was arrested, jailed, tortured and finally released into carefully controlled retirement \u2013 is shot through with instances of remarkable human frailty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a/82_0_4831_2900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alger Hiss\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two police photographs, circa 1949, of former US state department official and accused communist spy Alger Hiss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orwell also looms over Marton\u2019s tale, in Spain and in the cells and torture chambers of eastern Europe.

And he was not alone, in his spying and in the terrible, contradictory price that he paid.</p> <p>By the time of the communist witch-hunts of the 1950s, Marton says, the reds under America\u2019s bed existed mostly in the tortured mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/donald-trump-on-terror-mccarthyism-for-new-age\">Senator Joe McCarthy</a>. \u201cBut in the 30s, in the highest reaches of the American government, I\u2019m talking in the White House, the state department, there <em>were</em> witches \u2026 I loved finding these super-weird nutcases who absolutely believed in Stalin and were then destroyed by him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/cambridge-spy-guy-burgess-charmed-observer-files\">How Cambridge spy Guy Burgess charmed the Observer\u2019s man in Moscow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cJ Edgar Hoover, who eventually came to run the reign of terror in Washington, when he knew everything about everybody\u2019s lives, was flat-footed when it came to members of the US government who were betraying their own country.\u201d</p> <p>Among Americans who spied for Russia, such as contemporaries and friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/19/joan-brady-alger-hiss-was-framed-by-nixon\">Alger Hiss</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/reviews/990103.03persict.html\">Laurence Duggan</a>, Noel Field may indeed be a minor figure.

He was much less of a cynic than your lot, if I may call them that. He was needy of family, a larger family, and a sense of belonging, which the party offered even if he was not allowed to join that party until he was useless to Moscow as a spy.</p> <p>\u201cThen he joined, and typically for this man who never failed to make the wrong choice, he joined the Communist party in the year that it imploded, 1956, with Khrushchev denouncing Stalin followed by the Hungarian revolution, the first armed popular uprising against Soviet rule. That\u2019s when Field finally came in from the cold, as an open member of the Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>Marton\u2019s book may help bring Field to the light, alongside Hiss and Philby, Blunt and Maclean in the halls of Anglo-American infamy.</p> <ul> <li><em>True Believer: Stalin\u2019s Last American Spy, by Kati Marton, is out now in the US.

  "<p>Bruce Springsteen exists at that rarefied level of fame where you get to move like a Dalek, without ever actually having to touch anything. When he is out in public, at least \u2013 when he is being the Springsteen who is Brooooooce, the Springsteen who is the Boss, rather than the one who\u2019s been married for 25 years and has three kids \u2013 no obstacles stand in his way. No door is left unopened, no person steps out in front of him, and if you find yourself in his orbit, you can\u2019t help but find the gravitational pull of stardom yanking you into your position.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen and experienced this a couple of times. In 2010, when he attended a screening of the documentary about him, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4de878485ffee\"><em>The Promise</em></a>, at BFI Southbank in London, a friend and I were walking down the red carpet towards the cinema when there was a stir around us; we felt it before we noticed the faces lining the barriers turning in one direction. Behind us, Springsteen had alighted from a people carrier. We panicked \u2013 We\u2019re not meant to be here! Where do we go? \u2013 and made ourselves as small and invisible at the edge of the carpet as we could while he ambled past and the energy followed behind. I don\u2019t remember how the doors opened, but I\u2019m pretty sure he didn\u2019t have to lift a finger.</p> <p>Then backstage at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, this past June. Springsteen was just finishing his final number \u2013 an acoustic version of his wonderful 1975 redemption song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\">Thunder Road</a>. We were in the access tunnel at the side of the stage, where a fleet of black luxury cars lined up, windows tinted, engines ticking over, waiting for him and the band to leave the stage, to be whisked from the stadium before the house lights have flashed on, while tens of thousands are still finishing their drinks and working out where the nearest exit is. It is, doubtless, the same wherever he plays.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x5kXnq5IjdU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\">Watch a young Bruce Springsteen perform Thunder Road</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The 67-year-old Bruce Springsteen who enters the room at his favoured London luxury hotel \u2013 door opened by someone else, naturally, and it took three people to wait with me for him to enter \u2013 has skin the colour of wealth and clothes so casual they could only be expensive: a close-fitting jacket, a slightly scoop-necked T-shirt, and jeans whose left leg is flecked with white paint, as if he\u2019s just been touching up the cornicing in the corridors. You half wonder if someone splattered the paint on for him, just to keep things looking blue collar.</p> <p>He\u2019s here promoting his autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/born-to-run-memoir-bruce-springsteen-review\"><em>Born to Run</em></a>. Before London, he\u2019d been on a nine-date book tour of US cities, meeting his flock, opening \u2013 touchingly \u2013 with an <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7525558/bruce-springsteen-born-to-run-book-signing-freehold-new-jersey\">appearance</a> in his home town of Freehold, New Jersey (pop: 12,052), to which people travelled from across the east coast. Even that turned into a major operation: the <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/27/bruce-springsteen-book-new-jersey-born-to-run\">reported</a> that at least eight police officers were on duty around the branch of Barnes and Noble, with around twice that number of private security guards.</p> <p>Springsteen estimates he has scrawled his signature on 17,000 copies of the book. Perhaps surprisingly, he\u2019s rather enjoyed the experience. \u201cYou meet the fans \u2013 only for 10 seconds, but you meet them one by one,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they have an opportunity: what\u2019s the one thing you always wanted to say over the 40 years of the relationship we\u2019ve had? I actually found it quite moving. Always enjoyed that part. I used to love to drift around, bump into people, see what their lives were like, wander into their lives for a few moments then drift back out. It appealed to the transient nature of my personality. I liked the idea of being here and then being gone, this little spirit moving through the world.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of days before we meet, he opens the European leg of his promo jaunt with an event in front of an invited audience of journalists at the ICA in London, where he notes that when the fans have met him, one of the commonest responses has been: \u201cYou\u2019re shorter than I expected.\u201d Here, too, the reverence is striking. When questions are opened to the floor, someone identifying himself as \u201cEddie from Ireland\u201d tells Springsteen: \u201cSuch is the affection that the people of Ireland have for you, that if you ran for president of Ireland in the morning, you\u2019d be elected.\u201d When the event winds up, a throng of middle-aged men gathers at the front of the stage to get their copies of <em>Born to Run</em> signed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Trump\u2019s case, the facade is easy to see through, and what you see is a bundle of anxiety, fragility and insecurity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a pretty decent book, in a genre \u2013 the rock autobiography \u2013 replete with stinkers. (But then, you\u2019d hope it would be a pretty decent book given that Springsteen was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/05/bruce-springsteens-born-to-run-races-to-top-of-book-charts\">reportedly paid $10m</a> to write it.) It deserves to have topped the bestseller lists on both sides of the Atlantic, for its honesty about Springsteen\u2019s difficult childhood, his troubled relationship with his father, his struggles with depression, and his unyielding faith in the redemptive power of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He writes about the first time depression struck, in the early 1980s, in a way that resonates powerfully: he is on a road trip with a friend, stopping at a small-town fair, when, \u201cFrom nowhere, a despair overcomes me; I feel an envy of these men and women and their late summer ritual, the small pleasures that bind them and this town together. Now, for all I know these folks may hate this one-dog dump and each other\u2019s guts and be screwing one another\u2019s husbands and wives like rabbits. Why wouldn\u2019t they? But right now, all I can think of is that I want to be amongst them, of them, and I can\u2019t. I can only watch.\u201d</p> <p>That depression still haunts him, fended off by performing \u2013 in the book he talks of being \u201ccrushed between 60 and 62, good for a year, and out again from 63 to 64\u201d \u2013 and I want to ask what his favoured antidepressant is, whether Sertraline (Zoloft in the States) performed the miracles for him it did for me. But there doesn\u2019t really seem to be a good way to ask about a hero\u2019s pill regimen.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s less than a month, when we speak, before the US elections, and Springsteen is getting increasingly confident that Donald Trump won\u2019t win. He\u2019s no less scathing about the Republican candidate for that confidence, though. We talk about the contrast between the American ideal of masculinity \u2013 generous, confident, empathetic, determined; the one you think of when you imagine the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d who fought in the second world war \u2013 and the one Trump presents. He laughs at the difference. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s case, the facade is easy to see through, and what you see is a bundle of anxiety, fragility and insecurity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the thinnest possible mask of masculinity. And it wouldn\u2019t fool anybody from the Greatest Generation.\u201d There\u2019s a faint hesitation around his use of those words, as if acknowledging that not everyone who fought in the war, including his father, was necessarily great. \u201cIt\u2019s such a thin costume that for me it doesn\u2019t hold for a moment. But there have been quite a few people he has attracted along the way, so I suppose the bluster works to a certain degree. He\u2019s really quite an embarrassment if you\u2019re from the USA. It\u2019s simply the most rigid and thinnest veil of masculinity over a mess.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JygWoIeW224\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JygWoIeW224?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JygWoIeW224\">Watch Bruce Springsteen campaign for Barack Obama in 2012.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Springsteen notes that he\u2019s been asked about Trump a lot as he\u2019s promoted his book. And, despite a reputation for political engagement, he\u2019s evidently a little tired of it. In fact, he\u2019s been relatively quiet this election. Though he appeared at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/nov/06/bruce-springsteen-barack-obama-video\">campaign events for both Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/03/uselections2004.arts\">John Kerry</a>, he hasn\u2019t stumped for Hillary Clinton. His most notable piece of activism this year came in April when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/08/bruce-springsteen-cancels-north-carolina-concert-lgbt-discrimination-law\">pulled out of a show in North Carolina</a> in protest at the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom law\u201d, dictating which public toilets transgender people could use: \u201cTo my mind, it\u2019s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognising the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress,\u201d he wrote on his website at the time.</p> <p>His politics are simple, and basically non-partisan. When he\u2019s used his voice it has tended to be to support specific causes \u2013 his tours have supported food banks in cities where he\u2019s played; he went on Amnesty International\u2019s Human Rights Now! tour in 1988; he donated \u00a316,000 to Durham miners during the 1985 miners\u2019 strike. In song, he has returned repeatedly \u2013 not just in Born in the USA \u2013 to the plight of America\u2019s Vietnam veterans.</p> <p>He believes in fairness, people being treated decently, the right to a job, medical treatment, education, decent housing, childcare, and open government. He once surprised an interviewer by observing: \u201cTo me, these are all conservative ideas\u2026 Economic stability. Health. That\u2019s not remotely radical.\u201d</p> <p>Arguably the biggest influence on his politics was his manager, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Landau\">Jon Landau</a>, the former music writer whom he met when he was studying a gig review pinned up outside a Boston club before his appearance in April 1974. Landau, the review\u2019s writer, sidled up and asked the young musician what he thought. Thus began a friendship that transformed into a professional relationship, and something more: in <em>Born to Run</em>, Springsteen speaks of him being \u201cthe Clark to my Lewis\u201d. It\u2019s not so much that Landau told Springsteen what to think, more that he guided him to the books and films that might provoke him to think.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mother was decent, compassionate, strong, wilful. The best part of me picked up a lot of those characteristics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the binds of that, though, is the number of heartland American fans \u2013 the ones who are voting Trump \u2013 who believe Springsteen would think like them if only, as one contributor to the <a href=\"http://www.backstreets.com\">Backstreets fansite</a> recently suggested, he hadn\u2019t been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d into liberalism by Landau and others in his inner circle. On the other hand, there are those who think it outrageous that someone whose songs display an extraordinary empathy for ordinary people should dare to have homes in New Jersey, Florida and Los Angeles, and charge \u00a3100 per ticket to see him (the guarantee he demands from promoters for live shows is reputed to be among the largest in music; certainly, I received no reply from Landau last year when I wrote offering a guaranteed \u00a3700 and a lift down from London in my Ford Focus if Springsteen fancied playing a solo set at Ramsgate Music Hall).</p> <p>For Springsteen, politics seems to be about the way you live your life as much as anything. It\u2019s about being decent. About being fair to others. Being a good man. So what does being a good man entail?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big question,\u201d</p> <p>It is.</p> <p>\u201cI guess, really\u2026 I probably learned the best answers to that from my mother. My mother was basically decent, compassionate, strong, wilful. She insisted on creating a world where she could make her children feel as safe as possible, even though she certainly had her faults in that area. But she was consistent. You could count on her. Day after day after day. And she was very strong. The best part of me picked up a lot of those characteristics and I struggle to live up to them today.

He spent a chunk of it in the early 1950s living in Freehold with a paternal grandmother who loved him too much, compensating for the death of her daughter in 1927 (\u201cIt was very emotionally incestuous and a lot of parental roles got crossed,\u201d he told the writer Peter Ames Carlin); school was cruel, his father Doug \u2013 consumed by an often silent rage against the world, and against the son who mystified him \u2013 crueller still, emotionally at least.</p> <p><em>Born to Run</em> paints a picture of a childhood that is semi-feral, where Springsteen might refuse to go to school, and his grandmother would back him up. \u201cI think I was a little unusual in that I went into rock\u2019n\u2019roll music to create order out of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cMy younger life felt rather chaotic, so I was in search of some stability, actually, some order.\u201d</p> <p>As a kid, he felt invisible. That stopped when he started playing guitar. \u201cSuddenly I was able to make a very loud noise, and a noise that was not so easy to ignore,\u201d he says. \u201cI had my little rock\u2019n\u2019roll band and we were playing to a small gym full of dancers and their friends, and they immediately looked at you as a presence in their lives.\u201d</p> <p>When he was 19 his parents moved to California, and he was free to pursue music, to become \u2013 as he would say on stage years later \u2013 a \u201cprisoner\u2026 a prisoner of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d.</p> <p>Politics started entering Springsteen\u2019s music, though far from explicitly, with his fourth album, <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, in 1978. That was when his music ceased to be the myth-making epics of his first three albums, and he started writing instead about ordinary people and their struggles. He wasn\u2019t informed by reading political tracts. \u201cI just referred to my experiences growing up \u2013 my parents\u2019 lives, my sister\u2019s life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQUeCi9V0s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HVQUeCi9V0s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQUeCi9V0s\">Watch a trailer for the documentary Springsteen &amp; I</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His parents had struggled to make ends meet, his mother working as a legal secretary, his father in a succession of blue-collar jobs. His sister had married in her teens, and she and her husband\u2019s travails inspired his masterly song <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-bruce-springsteen-songs-of-all-time-20140116/the-river-19691231\">The River</a>, about a couple trying to face up to the wedge that joblessness drives into relationships. \u201cI was surrounded by people who were youthful but living very complicated adult lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were having kids at young ages and trying to build a work life and a home life that was very adult. It was very easy to draw upon. It wasn\u2019t a stretch or a strain.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The songs about ordinary lives \u2013 combined with Springsteen\u2019s revelatory, ecstatic live performances \u2013 built the bond with his audience that has lasted more than 40 years, and itself became the subject of an extraordinarily moving film in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQUeCi9V0s\"><em>Springsteen &amp; I</em></a>. I don\u2019t think he takes that relationship for granted. He understands that people want a piece of him for themselves: at that BFI Southbank event in 2010, Springsteen came to the bar afterwards; while his entourage sat in the corner, talking to one another, he perched on the back of a sofa facing the room. A receiving line of people queueing for a photo and autograph formed, and he stayed until everyone had their moment (my photo was out of focus; I got the autograph for my sister).</p> <p>People think they know Springsteen. They have an image of Bob Dylan (inscrutable), Neil Young (irascible), Paul McCartney (wearingly cheerful; Springsteen laughs when I use the old <em>Smash Hits</em> name of Fab Wacky Macca Thumbs Aloft). But they can imagine watching sports in a bar with Springsteen, which perhaps accounts for why people get a bit overexcited \u2013 I do not excuse myself from this \u2013 at the prospect of meeting him (fan accounts of encounters almost always dwell, approvingly, on what an ordinary guy he is. Even if he is shorter than expected).</p> <p>They think they know Springsteen because, these days, he\u2019s as much an idea, an ideal, as a person.</p> <p>\u201cSure, that\u2019s true,\u201d he says, of that notion. \u201cYou bring with you an entire philosophy, a certain code of living, I suppose. It\u2019s something you pursue. My heroes were people like Frank Sinatra, Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan. These were all people who brought their entire philosophy along with them, created a world that would engulf you and give you you, assist you in different ways of living, different ways of presenting yourself. Those were the artists that always interested me. They always seemed to carry a realisation of what being a musician might mean, could mean, the possibilities of what being a musician could be. That was something I was at least semiconscious of trying to create.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e630be2f6f38efbccde3f958ea494014bd92523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e630be2f6f38efbccde3f958ea494014bd92523/0_0_3000_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Springsteen performing with his wife, Patti Scialfa, in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Springsteen performing with his wife, Patti Scialfa, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KMazur/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And when did he realise he had become an idea in the minds of his public?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. If you\u2019re doing it right, it\u2019s a byproduct of all your actions and all your choices and what you\u2019ve created.\u201d</p> <p>It should be noted at this point that Springsteen appears to know exactly what he thinks about every aspect of his life and art and how they interact. I guess that\u2019s inevitable. First, he\u2019s just written a 500-page book about those subjects; second, he\u2019s been in therapy for decades; third, he and Landau based their entire relationship on talking at exhaustive length about all this stuff. But, for an interviewer, it\u2019s a bit odd. The most fascinating moments in interviews usually come when you catch a subject by surprise and you can see them deciding what they think about something. With Springsteen, it feels more like he\u2019s searching through his mental hard drive for the relevant file.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My life was changed in an instant by something that people thought was  junk \u2013 pop music records</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say his answers are not fascinating (they are) or cursory (they very much are not). When asked what he means when he says his covenant with his audience depends on honesty, he replies without pause, without any errs or urrms, in a single perfect paragraph, that requires not one piece of tidying in the transcription: \u201cI guess we come out and deliver the straight dope to our crowd as best we can. It\u2019s coming on stage with the idea: OK, well the stakes that are involved this evening are quite high. I don\u2019t know exactly who\u2019s in the crowd. But I know that my life was changed in an instant by something that people thought was purely junk \u2013 pop music records. And you can change someone\u2019s life in three minutes with the right song. I still believe that to this day. You can bend the course of their development, what they think is important, of how vital and alive they feel. You can contextualise very, very difficult experiences. Songs are pretty good at that. So all these are the stakes that are laid out on the table when you come out at night. And I still take those stakes seriously after all that time, if not more so now, as the light grows slightly dimmer. I come out believing there\u2019s no tomorrow night, there wasn\u2019t last night, there\u2019s just tonight. And I have built up the skills to be able to provide, under the right conditions, a certain transcendent evening, hopefully an evening you\u2019ll remember when you go home. Not that you\u2019ll just remember it was a good concert, but you\u2019ll remember the possibilities the evening laid out in front of you, as far as where you could take your life, or how you\u2019re thinking about your friends, or your wife or your girlfriend, or your best pal, or your job, your work, what you want to do with your life. These are all things, I believe, that music can accommodate and can provide service in. That\u2019s what we try to deliver.\u201d</p> <p>I email that paragraph to a Springsteen obsessive friend, who <a href=\"https://www.burgersandbruce.com\">blogs</a> about both Springsteen and burgers. She writes back: \u201cIt sounds silly, and I try to explain to people, but going to Springsteen shows has shaped a lot of changes in my life. I went to South Africa for a week on my own for four concerts, felt revived, like I could achieve anything. So I left my job and tried to get into journalism, something I\u2019d wanted to do since I was 10. And that\u2019s why I feel like I have to go to Australia [to see Springsteen next year], too, because I need to find that direction again. It\u2019s a funny way to live your life, seeking these highs, living the lows, but ultimately I think I\u2019m better off for it. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without his music in my life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_91hNV6vuBY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_91hNV6vuBY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_91hNV6vuBY\">Watch the video for Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Tougher Than the Rest</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I ask Springsteen if he ever looks at fansites and messageboards.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d (I bet he does.

They should be grateful!</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t reply. He just laughs long and hard, his head back, his eyes creasing.</p> <p>***</p> <p>On 5 June this year, as the sun set over Wembley Stadium, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band struck up the sombre opening chords of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_91hNV6vuBY\">Tougher Than the Rest</a>, the 1987 single about the difficulties of adult love that marked his return after <em>Born in the USA</em> had made him the world\u2019s biggest rock star. Stepping up to the front of the stage to duet with him was Patti Scialfa, a member of the E Street Band since 1984, and his second wife \u2013 his first marriage, to Julianne Phillips, ended quickly (in <em>Born to Run</em>, Springsteen admits he was wholly unready for it). Three days after performing what might as well be their theme song, Scialfa and Springsteen marked their 25th wedding anniversary.</p> <p>Her presence changed not just Springsteen\u2019s life but his work, too. The E Street Band stopped being an all-male preserve, a gang, forcing a change in their behaviour and attitudes. \u201cI think women are in general a good influence on growing up, on growing into your manhood,\u201d he says, delicately.</p> <p>And then when they had children \u2013 two sons, Evan and Sam, born in 1990 and 1994, and a daughter, Jessica, in 1991 \u2013 his life was altered even more profoundly. \u201cIf I was going to chop my life into sections,\u201d he says, \u201cit would be before the children and after the children, certainly. Just changed my entire worldview. Changed the way I looked at myself. Changed the way I looked at my job. Gave me an entirely separate identity away from my music, which I found to be very fulfilling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d26f822bbbee5d56059c7351a96d50cba028a296\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26f822bbbee5d56059c7351a96d50cba028a296/0_0_689_1024/673.jpg\" alt=\"Springsteen in concert in 1984\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Springsteen performing in 1984, the year Born in the USA took him to new commercial heights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Images Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before he had children, Springsteen had assumed that whatever he was working on was what everyone around him should be concentrating on. He recalls his bafflement when Jon Landau had his first child, and would suddenly start leaving recording sessions at 6pm, to go and bathe his baby daughter. \u201cI remember thinking\u2026\u201d he adopts a puzzled tone, \u201cYou gotta go home and bathe your daughter? We\u2019re doing A, B, C or D, which I happen to think is the most important thing in the world right now. But of course it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Having children made Springsteen realise that his work wasn\u2019t his life, it was a substitute for life. \u201cI realised that previously I\u2019d expanded my work life so that I\u2019d have something to do during the day, and into the evening. Without it, what am I gonna do? Go home, sit in a chair and watch TV? So I\u2019d expanded the time it took me to do my job. Once the kids came along, I realised, I could squeeze my previous 18 hours of work day into six or eight, without any problems whatsoever. I realised the song is always going to be there \u2013 there\u2019s always going to be a song in your heart or in your head \u2013 but kids, they\u2019re there and then they\u2019re gone. And when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re <em>gone</em>. Once I realised that, I found a tremendous freedom from the tyranny of my own mind.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I still have pride in what I do. I still believe in its power. I believe in my ability to transfer its power to you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You couldn\u2019t say that Springsteen has slowed down, though, especially now the kids are gone. This summer\u2019s tour of European and US stadiums saw him playing some of his longest ever shows, breaking the four-hour barrier \u2013 with no intermissions, unlike his late-70s marathons \u2013 on occasion. Springsteen says he has no problems finding the energy to play them, but it\u2019s not so easy for some of his bandmates. Before Springsteen arrives, his co-manager <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6406640/barbara-carr-interview-bruce-springsteen-landau-management\">Barbara Carr</a> mentions that <a href=\"http://maxweinberg.com\">Max Weinberg</a>, the 65-year-old drummer, spends all his time between shows sequestered in his hotel room, the windows blacked out, the gaps between door and frame filled to block out all noise, simply recuperating from the previous gig.</p> <p>That\u2019s the price the band must pay in order to deliver what Springsteen wants: \u201cI come out on stage to deliver to you the greatest band in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have great pride in what I do. I still believe in its power. I believe in my ability to transfer its power to you. That\u2019s never changed. One of the things our band was very good at communicating was that sense of joy, which I think makes us somewhat unique. Rock bands try to project a lot of different things: intensity, mystery, sexuality, cool. Not a lot of rock bands concentrate on joy, and I got that from my relatives on the Italian side \u2013 they lived it and they passed it down to me.\u201d</p> <p>The ambition that drove him to chase perfection 40 years ago \u2013 when he would spend hours shouting \u201cStick!\u201d at Weinberg in the studio, insisting he somehow find a way to play his snare without the sound of stick hitting the skin being audible \u2013 is still present.</p> <p>I ask if, for all his testimonies to the simple power of playing rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and how he says he\u2019s happy pitching up for an impromptu set at a local bar with a pick-up band, whether he would have been content if he\u2019d ended up precisely as popular as his friends and contemporaries Southside Johnny and Joe Grushecky, blue-collar rockers who never transcended the clubs. \u201cI would probably be an old, disgruntled entertainer,\u201d he says, then chuckles at the very notion that he might not have conquered the world. \u201cI was shooting for the whole show. But I certainly would have made my peace with it. Any time you make your living as a musician, you\u2019re way ahead of the game. You\u2019re <em>way</em> ahead of the game. I always thought: Gee, I\u2019m making a living scratching on a piece of wood. I can\u2019t complain too much.\u201d</p> <p>In 1975, when he was promoting the <em>Born to Run</em> album, there was a story Springsteen used to tell interviewers. While he was recording the album in New York, he was staying in a grotty outpost of Holiday Inn, in one of Manhattan\u2019s less salubrious districts. In his room was a mirror, which hung crooked. Every morning he would dutifully straighten the mirror. And when he returned to his room, the mirror would be askew again. And so, once more, he\u2019d correct it. And again it would slip off centre.</p> <p>It is, I suggest, a perfect metaphor for a man driven, even when the reasons for his drive, his desperation, might seem unclear to those around him. He smiles. And, rather unexpectedly, quotes Immanuel Kant back at me: \u201cOut of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.\u201d</p> <p>And then the door opens, and he glides away, no obstacles in his path.</p> <p><em>Born to Run is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/born-to-run-464799.html\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/guardianmusic/playlist/0tUxgJGl8R45UCt9EH4xDL\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:0tUxgJGl8R45UCt9EH4xDL\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Bruce\u2019s backpages: the songs that define Springsteen</h2> <p><strong>Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)</strong><br><strong>1973</strong><br>A showstopping, Van Morrisonesque epic that\u2019s still a highlight of Springsteen\u2019s live shows, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYHGh6lmSbo\">Rosalita</a> sprawls and swerves and swings, irresistibly.

Play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxuThNgl3YA\">Born to Run</a> and it just allows more people in. I\u2019ll see a 15-year-old kid singing every word, and I\u2019ll see a grandma too! A good song keeps its arms open and welcomes those who come to it over the years.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Darkness on the Edge of Town</strong><br><strong>1978</strong><br>The album Darkness on the Edge of Town saw Springsteen ditching mythologising and writing about adult dilemmas. \u201cI was very concerned about writing music that I felt an adult voice could sing,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt that was a trap some bands fell into. I never wanted to have to come out on stage and pretend. Of course, it\u2019s all pretending, I suppose. But I wanted to feel comfortable in my own skin.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The River</strong><br><strong>1980</strong><br>In growing up, Springsteen says, \u201cyou have to come face to face with a lot of your weaknesses and the things you do poorly, so that you\u2019re able to assess the landscape and find out what are the righteous paths you can travel down, and what are the roads that are just going to lead you to a dead end. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utVR3EgQkHs\">The River</a>, of course, is the song I wrote about that specific idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Born in the USA</strong><br><strong>1982</strong><br>The acoustic version recorded at the time of the Nebraska album allows none of the ambiguity of the stadium-crushing version released two years later.

I\u2019ve always wanted to keep Mars in our sights, even if we do choose to go back to the moon.</p> <p><strong>Would you go to Mars?</strong><br>I would, but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their mother first! I am not an early adopter of stuff that has never been done before, but I am glad we have bold people who live and walk among us who do take those risks. We would never have left the cave were it not for folks such as that.</p> <p><strong>Who is going to get to Mars first: Musk? Bezos? Nasa? Boeing? China?</strong><br>By my read of history, the only thing that will get to Mars first is a government-driven space programme, such as Nasa. And why? Because it has never been done before, not with people \u2013 it is expensive and it has unquantified risks. When all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish. I think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to Mars, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-space-exploration-the-final-frontier\" title=\"\">SpaceX </a>and other companies want to build the spaceship and Nasa pays them for it. Their business model is selling to the government.</p> <p><strong>There is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the universe; there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial intelligence or microbes. What\u2019s your bet?</strong><br>I like it all. If Earth is any kind of example at all, then most life you\u2019ll find would be microbial. But consider also that if you can make a robot that knows how to make a robot from natural resources and you sent this robot off to a planet and it lands and makes three more of itself and they want to go to three other planets, you could populate the entire galaxy in a relatively short amount of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b42a601cc15fa0897255f5b828f28e972a43b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b42a601cc15fa0897255f5b828f28e972a43b2c/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SpaceX chief Elon Musk unveils his plans to colonise Mars during the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SpaceX chief Elon Musk unveils his plans to colonise Mars during the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elon Musk and </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/19/stephen-hawking-ai-best-or-worst-thing-for-humanity-cambridge\" title=\"\"><strong>Stephen Hawking</strong></a><strong> have voiced concerns about AI. How about you?</strong><br>I am completely relaxed. I would claim that AI will rise up, solving bits of challenges that we have put in our way and those bits in total would be a sort of stunning application of computers in the service of human need. Is a self-driving car going to stand up, wield a weapon and shoot you? No!</p> <p><strong>Given how we have managed to damage the Earth, should we be looking for other places to live?</strong><br>If you want to ship a billion people to Mars and have them live there as they are living on Earth, you\u2019ll have to terraform Mars \u2013 and that means turning Mars into an oasis of some kind. If you had the power of geoengineering to terraform Mars into Earth, then you have the power of geoengineering to turn Earth back into Earth. So the argument that if we trash Earth we need another planet doesn\u2019t work. I am not convinced that escaping Earth and leaving others behind to die is the most sensible solution out there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn't, is to vote them out of office</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>With the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/24/new-era-of-climate-change-reality-as-emissions-hit-symbolic-threshold\" title=\"\"><strong>Paris agreement</strong></a><strong>, have climate change sceptics finally been overcome?
