  "<p>Unconscious bias towards \u201cpeople like us\u201d is something we\u2019re all guilty of. We feel more comfortable among those whose race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, accent, even sense of humour, mirror our own. It explains why, with the best intentions in the world, even governments and companies aware of inclusion have, for example, far fewer women than men in management.</p> <p>This is something Jeffrey Siminoff, the vice-president for inclusion and diversity at Twitter, is trying to change \u2013 within his company and on the company\u2019s platform in a sort of symbiosis. </p> <p>Twitter has 3,860 employees worldwide and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/26/twitter-quarterly-report-slow-growth\">313m active users a month</a>, according to its corporate website. \u201cTwitter is the place where inclusion lives,\u201d Siminoff says, with a rhythmic familiarity that suggests he\u2019s said it once or twice before. \u201cWhat I mean by that is a democratisation of voices. We have a platform where people come together with no barriers to entry, to feel included and to feel a sense of belonging. The platform is designed to form communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/24/steve-wozniak-the-status-quo-doesnt-have-to-exist-we-can-come-up-with-solutions\">Steve Wozniak: The status quo doesn't have to exist. We can come up with solutions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s inherent in the business, it\u2019s imperative for this company to live up to the promise of inclusion in its own workplace, too. When those two things meet and fuse, when your employees are marching lockstep with the mission of the platform itself, you create something rich.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not talking about positive discrimination, which is a form of discrimination in itself. \u201cWe don\u2019t favour one group over another,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople spend a lot of time at work and we\u2019re focused on creating an environment where people thrive, not despite their differences but because<em> </em>of their differences.\u201d </p> <p>At Twitter, this means thinking carefully about who is approached to join the company or to be promoted. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to mandate a specific result,\u201d he says of the positive discrimination his company doesn\u2019t practice, \u201cit\u2019s another thing to mandate a diverse pool of candidates.\u201d</p> <p>The global program Twitter is implementing is a form of mindfulness training for all employees: teaching them to reflect on the unconscious stereotypes we all have because of the way we\u2019ve been brought up, or because of external influences such as culture and media. The idea is to run a \u201csystem check\u201d in real time against those inborn tribal biases when creating and then surveying the pool of applicants, as well as when making an appointment.</p> <p>It\u2019s ironic that when Siminoff was appointed to the diversity role, critics in the media were ferocious about a middle-aged white male getting the job. But he has long been intensely and personally aware of the issues. When he was younger, he struggled with his identity as a gay man. As an employment lawyer at Morgan Stanley, he saw many cases of discrimination on all sorts of grounds, and jumped at the chance to organise an LGBTIQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and questioning] resource within the company as an extracurricular role.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a transformative experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt much more present, much more connected and much more alive in my work.\u201d When he was asked to step out of his lawyer role to lead the company\u2019s diversity program, he embraced it, he says. He later took those skills to Apple and then to Twitter, where his job includes helping the platform enable equality and diversity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/the-grattan-institute-is-wrong-we-need-more-science-students-not-fewer\">The Grattan Institute is wrong.

Similarly partnerships with business clients have emphasised equality and inclusion. For instance, Twitter worked with ANZ to create a rainbow-coloured \u201chashflag\u201d to accompany the company\u2019s tweets supporting Mardi Gras and LGBTI rights in general. </p> <p>Yet Siminoff insists the platform itself remains politically neutral. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are active on it, for example, and,<strong> </strong>given the extent of trolling of women, particularly women in tech, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not fudging when he says the company doesn\u2019t practise censorship. Some might say it doesn\u2019t practise enough of it.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the most powerful hashtags often arise organically. He uses the hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter, as an example: it has spread from the US to the UK and Australia, among other countries, and has created a powerful field of solidarity, despite the backlash hashtags such as All, or White, Lives Matter.</p> <p>His formula for his own job could be a formula for how he\u2019d like users to approach Twitter, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s critical for success in a role like this is an ability to listen and to learn, assume [something] because your own life experiences have walked you down a certain road and not presume that your good intentions are necessarily going to carry the day.\u201d</p>",

In short order, the exhibitions turn to the transatlantic trade that brought more than 12 million Africans to the western hemisphere in shackles, displaying a genuine pair of 17th- or 18th-century iron wrist locks. </p> <p>They are probably one of the most poignant objects we have in our collection,\u201d said Kinshasha Holman, deputy director of the museum. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t ever allow us to forget that we as African Americans were born of a county built on the enslavement and the ownership of human beings.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf these shackles could speak, they would say it took the resources of an entire society to create slave ships,\u201d Charles Johnson, scholar and author of the historical novel Middle Passage told Smithsonian magazine about the artifact. \u201cEveryone in slave-trading societies, even those who never owned a slave, was implicated.\u201d </p> <p>The original ambrotype portrait \u2013 an early form of photography captured on glass \u2013 of Frederick Douglass is on display marking the nation\u2019s fight for abolition and subsequent civil war. The abolitionist, speaker, writer and freedman was also the most photographed American of the 19th century. Deborah Willis, a scholar of African American photography at New York University, told Smithsonian Magazine that Douglass believed the emerging technology of photography \u201cwas a powerful instrument of racial uplift\u201d.</p> <p>According to Willis, \u201cDouglass believed photos \u2018could challenge the racist caricatures of black people that pervaded the United States and beyond with images that communicated black humanity, self-worth and achievement\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1940s, in the pre-dawn of the civil rights era, Dr Kenneth Clark and his wife Mamie conducted what may be one of the most far-reaching social science studies of the 20th century. Clark\u2019s \u201cdoll tests\u201d demonstrated the way white supremacist ideology infects black people at miraculously young ages, asking black schoolchildren from segregated and unsegregated schools to pick whether they preferred a white or a black doll. The Clarks\u2019 findings, that black children from segregated schools were more likely to prefer white dolls, played a part in the landmark supreme court decision in Brown v Board of Education that made segregation illegal in the US.

  "<p>It is being described as the political equivalent of the Super Bowl, World Cup final and Rumble in the Jungle rolled into one \u2013 or the smartest person in the room versus the class clown.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton faces Donald Trump in the first presidential debate on 26 September, a record TV audience of tens of millions is expected to watch a fascinating clash of styles that could go a long way to determining who wins the White House.</p> <p>Clinton, the Democratic candidate, is said to be deep in books and painstaking rehearsal, mastering every policy detail and leaving nothing to chance. Republican rival Trump, characteristically, is understood to be taking a more freewheeling approach, hoping that his experience as a reality TV celebrity will carry the day. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really different this time because Trump is such a wild card,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanheechen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lanhee Chen</a>, who helped prepare Senator Marco Rubio for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/10/republican-debate-trump-rubio-cruz-kasich-policy-us-election\">Republican primary debates</a> against Trump. \u201cThe most important thing as someone facing him is to have your own strategy and not get thrown off. The danger is to chase ever shiny objects that he throws out there. She should ignore the shiny objects and stay disciplined.\u201d</p> <p>The first contest, at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, will take place 56 years to the day after the first ever televised debate between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon; the more telegenic Kennedy went on to win a narrow election. The setpiece duels have not always been so consequential, but there is a sense that, in this most extraordinary of election years, Clinton v Trump could be a game changer.</p> <p>Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, who also prepared Mitt Romney for his 2012 debates with Barack Obama, said: \u201cPeople have an impression of these candidates from TV ads, but the debate is the first opportunity people have to see them in their own words one-on-one. They are going to be crucial to the arc of the campaign. If Donald Trump is not able to perform in these debates then the election\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">consistently trailing in opinion polls</a>, the three upcoming debates now represent the best chance to shift the narrative, perhaps a last throw of the dice. Chen said he <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/29/opinions/five-debate-prep-tips-trump-chen/index.html\">needs to make the case</a> against Clinton without exaggeration, demonstrate that he has the right temperament and judgment, and show a grasp of policy.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very experienced with TV,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should underestimate Donald Trump\u2019s ability to have a good debate. I\u2019m not convinced that, as some people are saying, he\u2019s going to be a disaster of a debater.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rallies and tweets reflect a tension between scripted material and the improvised, shoot-from-the-hip approach that he favours. The bombastic businessman has reportedly held informal meetings about the debates but is eschewing methodical homework, trying to make his political inexperience a virtue. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times last week</a>: \u201cI believe you can prep too much for those things. It can be dangerous. You can sound scripted or phony \u2013 like you\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>He boasted: \u201cI know how to handle Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>His advisers reportedly include Roger Ailes, who was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/business/media/roger-ailes-fox-news.html\">ousted</a> as Fox News chairman last month over allegations of sexual harassment.

Schwartz, who has expressed regret over the book, tweeted: <strong>\u201c</strong>Trump isn\u2019t preparing for debates because he can\u2019t. No attention span = deep ignorance about issues. He will be all bluster, no substance.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton team are also studying Trump\u2019s performances in 11 Republican primary debates, when he was the dominant figure on stage, and memorably once even made reference to the size of his manhood. Her press secretary Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter: \u201cFor all his lack of substance, Trump\u2019s showmanship, as ex-TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates.\u201d</p> <p>Joel Benenson, chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, told CNN on Tuesday: \u201cWhat Donald Trump had in the primaries was a different ball of wax entirely. He had a free-for-all with eight people on the stage. In 90 minutes, he spoke for about 12 minutes. I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll be very aggressive. I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her on policy; I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her on substance. I think we\u2019ll see a lot of the same kind of hyper-over-the-top rhetoric from him that we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s who he is. I don\u2019t think he can control himself.\u201d</p> <p>One big, unresolved question for the Clinton camp is who to cast in the role of Trump during mock debates, a vital part of the preparation process. That person faces the unenviable duty of attacking her over her husband Bill\u2019s sexual indiscretions and bringing up other humiliating talking points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd3d2fd4e8ffa58234a12cdd86014342f3027e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3d2fd4e8ffa58234a12cdd86014342f3027e46/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate in April during the Democratic primaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kennedy v Nixon pulled in 66 million viewers and the four debates between the two drew 60% of US households on average.

This means not only getting a grasp of the substance but doing lots of practice. You can figure out predictable things he\u2019s going to say and ways to come back at him.\u201d</p> <p>Shrum added: \u201cCandidates under pressure in these debates tend to say things they\u2019ve said on the road. We knew in 2004 that Bush would probably say we invaded Iraq because of 9/11. Kerry had a mantra in his head and said: \u2018<a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=september-30-2004-debate-transcript\">Saddam Hussein didn\u2019t attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us</a>.\u2019 Bush looked like he\u2019d been hit by a wet fish. Kerry won all three debates but, unfortunately, didn\u2019t win the election.\u201d</p> <p>This time, however, he believes the debate is critical to Trump\u2019s chances. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. Trump has one chance and one chance only to pass the commander-in-chief test. He needs people to say this man can be president of the United States, he\u2019s got the temperament and we can trust him with the nuclear codes.\u201d</p> <p>Some analysts suggest that Trump is thin-skinned and could easily be tempted to lash out against Clinton, an experienced and skilled debater. But Roger Stone, a political consultant and friend of Trump\u2019s for more than three decades, said: \u201cI have a lot of confidence in his instincts. He\u2019s going to do fine. It\u2019s a great opportunity: the debates benefit the candidate who\u2019s behind. Within the political realm, she\u2019s better known and has more experience.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he\u2019s entirely unpredictable. She\u2019s never going to know which way he\u2019s going to come at her.\u201d</p> <p>This, along with the constant hum and hype of 24-hour cable news, will make for a very American spectacle. \u201cI\u2019m going to open some popcorn and watch them all,\u201d Chen said.</p>",

The Nobel Prize-winning economist sits on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s council of economic advisers and he said that Scotland should consider having its own currency if it opts for independence. Before the 2014 referendum the Scottish government\u2019s fiscal commission working group (part of the council of economic advisers) proposed an independent Scotland having a currency union with the rest of the UK. But this may have been a mistake, Stiglitz said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They wanted the smoothest transition possible. They wanted to say that we could move from the current economic arrangement to another one while keeping our currency and keeping other forms of institutions. I think, in hindsight, that may have been a mistake. </p> <p>It would be a mistake to join the euro, by the way, so what they would have needed to do, perhaps, was resurrect the Scottish pound and let it float. </p> <p>Small countries can have their own currency. The reason that Iceland, which had one of the deepest downturns in 2008, had one of the strongest recoveries was because it had its own currency.</p> <p>If there was a Scottish pound floating, you could help stimulate the Scottish economy.

Building on existing fibre-optic roll-out schemes would reduce the total costs below this headline figure, and building on current practice we would look to schedule installations where the demand was urgent, such as to existing tech clusters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85fd3430d53300d5778df9c6b485b1fd058fb8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85fd3430d53300d5778df9c6b485b1fd058fb8ac/0_3_831_499/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c556d2e4b09fcabd06d2be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T09:52:59.307Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's digital democracy speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>He says 20 years ago this speech would have been prepared at a desktop, at best.

He said that, provided the EU were \u201crational\u201d about it, Britain could do \u201cvery well\u201d on its own.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you can negotiate a reasonable deal, and what that means is if Europe is rational and says \u2018Okay, the people of the UK have spoken, we believe in economic integration, political integration, let\u2019s do the best we can within the constraints of what has been reflected by the people in the UK\u2019 - that would mean close trade ties, closer than the WTO, other forms of economic arrangement - I think it could do very well. And that\u2019s a little bit reflected on where the markets are today. </p> </blockquote> <p>He said that the US and Canada enjoyed \u201creal shared prosperity\u201d even though they had different currencies and no shared migration.

Because it\u2019s time to take a sober look at a presidency bookended by the spectacular mass murder on 11 September 2001, and the spectacular financial meltdown of 2008.</p> <p>From the rise of Isis to mass surveillance; from tax cuts for the wealthy to immigration reform; from the excesses of Wall Street to the struggles of Main Street; this election is taking place in a country that is still torn apart by the Bush years.</p> <p>Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s hyperkinetic first chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Revival-Struggle-Survival-Inside-Obama/dp/0307717429\">liked to say</a> that President Bush had left them a ribbon-wrapped gift of a shit sandwich: two wars, the worst recession in living memory and a disastrous international reputation.</p> <p>But Bush also left them a path out from his own colossal disasters: the massive government bailout of the financial sector, and a Federal Reserve prepared to take unprecedented measures to bankroll the global economy. A drone war to kill terrorist targets without boots on the ground, and a more stable Iraq that could allow for a US withdrawal.</p> <p>While Obama got to work on his special sandwich, Bush\u2019s Republican party is still stuck in the middle of it all. For the GOP can no more find its way out of the Bush debates than Britain\u2019s Labour party can decide how to deal with the legacy of Tony Blair.</p> <p>The single most contentious issue riling the Republican party is immigration: an issue that derailed Bush\u2019s presidency. After winning a second term, President Bush declared he enjoyed a considerable amount of political capital and would spend it on a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>He failed, mostly thanks to the vocal, nativist opposition of far-right talk radio hosts and their equivalent in the House of Representatives. It was the revival of those reform efforts that Donald Trump skewered so effectively in the GOP primaries, as he demolished his three biggest foes: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and, yes, Bush\u2019s brother, Jeb.</p> <p>George W<strong> </strong>Bush \u2013 along with every other sane Republican \u2013 realized long ago that the Republican party had no future as a nativist rump, hostile to the fastest-growing demographic bloc of voters in the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s new management team can move their candidate into this space. Despite their half-hearted spin, Trump left the indelible impression that he would deploy a deportation force against all undocumented immigrants, especially the \u201cmurderers and rapists\u201d he claimed Mexico was exporting to the US.</p> <p>The second most contentious issue of this election: how to treat Muslims and Arabs, and particularly Muslim Americans. In this area, Bush\u2019s approach was vastly more enlightened than Trump\u2019s, although it\u2019s fair to say that Genghis Khan also crossed this low bar.</p> <p>Bush visited a mosque in Washington less than a week after the 9/11 attacks to declare that \u201cIslam is peace\u201d and that Muslim Americans \u201cneed to be treated with respect\u201d. He added: \u201cWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes.\u201d (In those days it was hard to imagine a European country banning a burkini.)</p> <p>But you could also make the case that Bush stoked the politics of fear \u2013 especially in the 2002 and 2004 elections \u2013 that led directly to this point of peak Islamophobia. It was under Bush\u2019s watch, just one year after his second inauguration, that the fever took over. </p> <p>And it\u2019s outlasted the war on terror, although Trump is doing his best to revive both. His party refuses to disown him for trashing a Muslim American family who lost a son in Iraq, or for wanting to close US borders to a billion Muslims. It cannot or will not condemn him for proposing to torture detainees, in direct breach of international laws of war.<br></p> <p>Republicans cannot say where they stand on the Bush spectrum of the war on terror. Trump naturally hates it, pretending to have opposed the war in Iraq, as well as Bush\u2019s hostile turn against Russia. And the Republican foreign policy establishment hates Trump for all that and more.</p> <p>Before the Democrats feel too smug about the Bush conundrum, they should consider their own internal struggles. Much of the Clinton-Sanders battle was defined by the singular question of how to treat Wall Street: whether the bailout was justified and whether bank regulation went far enough. Many Sanders supporters remain opposed to Clinton because of her hawkish views on the Middle East.</p> <p>And for all their hatred of all things Bush, Democrats in Congress voted overwhelmingly with Republicans to stop President Obama from closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>After eight years of an economic turnaround, we have yet to resolve the debate about rescuing Wall Street. After eight years of troop withdrawals, we are considering sending troops back to Iraq and maintain what looks like a lot like a permanent force in Afghanistan.</p> <p>After eight years of Obama, we have not escaped the legacy of George W Bush. And no matter who wins, we are unlikely to do so any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Apple has warned that future investment by multinationals in Europe could be hit after it was ordered to pay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest company was presented with the huge bill after the European commission ruled that a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid.</p> <p>The commission said the deal allowed Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at just 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%.</p> <p>\u201cMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules,\u201d said the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, whose investigation of Apple\u2019s complex tax dealings has taken three years.</p> <p>Vestager\u2019s ruling prompted an angry response from Apple and from Ireland and is likely to spark a political row between the US and the EU. The US Treasury said the ruling threatened to damage \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to customers, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, claimed the ruling could deal a blow to big companies investing in Europe: \u201cBeyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed.\u201d</p> <p>The commission said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements</a> with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. </p> <p>The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multi-billion euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\" data-alt=\"Corporation tax rates in Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\">Corporation tax rates in Europe</a> <figcaption>Corporation tax rates in Europe.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple and Ireland said they intend to appeal against the ruling. </p> <p>The figure of \u20ac13bn plus interest is 40 times the previous record for such a case and the equivalent of the annual budget for Ireland\u2019s health service.

He said Apple chose the Irish city of Cork as its European base 30 years ago and had expanded from 60 workers to almost 6,000 in Ireland. </p> <p>He said Apple would appeal and that he was confident of winning.</p> <p>Cook said: \u201cWe never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid.\u201d</p> <p>The commission\u2019s decision is a rebuff to US efforts to persuade it to drop the case after warnings of retaliation from Washington.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Apple, which changed its tax arrangements with Ireland in 2015, should easily be able to pay the huge tax bill because it has a cash mountain of more than $230bn (\u00a3176bn) of cash and securities, mostly held outside the US. The tech group keeps the money outside the US because it would be forced to pay US tax charges if it repatriated the money.</p> <p>The \u20ac13bn figure covers only the 10 years before the commission first requested information in 2013. The commission, which does not have the authority to go back any further, said it was up to Ireland to collect the tax from Apple.</p> <p>The Irish government, however,<strong> </strong>wants the ruling reversed because it wants to preserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/ireland-attracts-soaring-level-of-us-investment\">its status as a low-tax base for overseas companies</a>.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin would appeal against the ruling. He said: \u201cThe decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.\u201d</p> <p>A cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin on Wednesday to discuss the fallout from the ruling.<strong> </strong>At the heart of the Fine Gael-led administration\u2019s objections is that it would cause Ireland reputational damage in the eyes of other mainly US multinationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic.</p> <p>Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the low-tax regime for multinationals because it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/aug/30/nine-ways-ireland-could-spend-apple-13bn-payback\">A tunnel to Wales or a gallery full of Gauguins: how Ireland could spend Apple\u2019s money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner and a professor in international political economy at City University in London, said: \u201cThis is a great day for the sovereignty of the EU\u2019s nations when it comes to tax.

Even if we accept the job and wealth creation arguments put forward by multinationals as mitigation against tax liability, this has to be within reason.\u201d</p> <p>Toby Quantrill, Christian Aid\u2019s principal adviser on economic justice, said: \u201cThe staggering amount of money at stake here suggests that millions of citizens are paying a painfully high price for multinationals\u2019 cosy tax deals with certain governments.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a one-off situation \u2013 it is part of a damaging race to the bottom in which governments are competing on who can offer multinationals the lowest tax bill. It\u2019s time to get multinationals\u2019 tax affairs out in the open, so we can all see how much they are actually contributing to the rest of society.\u201d </p> <p>In the US Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, said it was not yet clear which side would ultimately prevail, but that the ruling was a watershed moment. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling whether the verdict will stand on appeal, but we know that the landscape is changing for US corporations in the EU.\u201d </p> <p>He described Vestager\u2019s ruling as \u201cjust the tip of the spear \u2013 an enormously important ruling\u201d because US-based companies \u201chave traditionally used the EU as a way of circumventing a higher US corporate tax code.\u201d</p> <p>Apple\u2019s share price, however, was largely unmoved. In a note to investors, Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said the \u20ac13bn potential bill was not a big deal for the huge company. <strong>\u201c</strong>While the penalty is large in absolute terms, it represents a small portion of AAPL\u2019s [Apple\u2019s] overall valuation.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet clear which side will be backed by either of the 2016 presidential candidates. Republican Donald Trump has said he would force US companies, Apple in particular, to <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/trump-wont-get-apple-make-iphones-shouldnt/\">move manufacturing jobs within the nation\u2019s own borders</a>, rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labour overseas.

  "<p>British and French interior ministers have ordered a fresh review of security in Calais and confirmed they will continue with the treaty under which British border checks are carried out on French soil.</p> <p>A joint statement issued by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, says they will work together to strengthen security around the \u201cshared border\u201d in Calais and \u201cstrongly diminish\u201d the migratory pressures that have attracted 7,000 migrants to the Channel tunnel port.</p> <p>The statement from the two ministers confirms their commitment to the 2003 Le Touquet treaty but makes no reference to calls from some French politicians for an asylum \u201chotspot\u201d processing centre to be set up in Calais to consider claims for asylum in Britain.</p> <p>French rightwing politicians, including Nicolas Sarkozy, have called for Le Touquet to be scrapped or changed, raising the prospect of the UK border returning from Calais to Dover.

They say that additional work, including by Britain, to protect the shared border will \u201creflect the outcome of the UK/France security reviews and the steps that need to be taken to continue to manage the common border effectively\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday the president of the region around Calais, Xavier Bertrand, had called for the Le Touquet agreement to end, telling the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to keep people here without a new agreement between the two governments.\u201d<br></p> <p>The issue was highlighted during the EU referendum campaign when both David Cameron and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande suggested the deal could be threatened by Brexit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/calais-asylum-hotspot-proposal-main-questions-answered-uk-refugees\">Calais asylum hotspot proposal: the main questions answered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bertrand suggested allowing migrants to apply for asylum in Britain from \u201chotspot\u201d application centres in France. Rudd was expected to reject the idea during her visit. Government officials have reportedly said Britain could threaten to review security cooperation with France if it tries to tear up Le Touquet and push the border from Calais into Kent.</p> <p>Earlier the prime minister\u2019s spokesman sought to play down tensions between the two governments. He said: \u201cThis meeting between the home secretary and her counterpart has been in the diary for some time. As we\u2019ve said, these discussions will focus on security and counter-terrorism issues. Our position on Le Touquet is pretty clear and we are not changing from that. France is one of our most important allies in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Saying he would not be drawn on reports about security cooperation, he added: \u201cWe will cooperate fully with France. It is one of our closest allies.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman said the French government continued to support the agreement with Britain as it stands, dismissing Bertrand\u2019s suggestions on both the treaty and the asylum centres.</p> <p>Former president Sarkozy, who hopes to make a comeback next year, has also said the \u201cJungle\u201d migrant camp should be shut down and moved to Britain, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said he wouldn\u2019t comment on a hypothetical situation that was a \u201clong way off\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/calais_locator-zip/giv-31075MSeZdE3QkZ5S\" data-alt=\"Calais migrant camp locator\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/calais_locator-zip/giv-31075MSeZdE3QkZ5S\">Calais migrant camp locator</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn terms of relationship with France it remains as strong as it ever has done, it remains absolutely critical.

Sarkozy said in a speech at the weekend: \u201cI\u2019m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them.

  "<h2>Apple hit by EU tax ruling</h2> <p>Apple is facing a $14.5bn fine from the European commission over unpaid back taxes, stemming from arrangements it made over nearly 25 years with the Irish government. The ruling found that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Dublin afforded Apple illegal state aid</a>, allowing the US tech company to pay as little as 1% corporate tax rate on two-thirds of its global earnings, and levies a heavier fine than expected.

  "<p>In Britain, rightwingers love to poke fun at the left for its myriad splits. In the United States, the major political splits are on the right.</p> <p>The latest manifestation is the so-called alt-right, a loose conglomeration of populist, nationalist, racist and conspiracist groupings that view themselves as an alternative to mainstream political conservatism.</p> <p>This fringe has replaced the tea party movement as the Republican party\u2019s major rightwing bugbear. It has emerged into the media spotlight courtesy of Donald Trump following his appointment of one of alt-right\u2019s supposed champions, Stephen Bannon, as chief executive of his campaign. </p> <p>Bannon - a former adviser to Sarah Palin - chairs <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/\">Breitbart News</a>, which has the dubious honour of challenging Fox News\u2019s status as America\u2019s most influential conservative media outlet.</p> <p>After Hillary Clinton<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/us/politics/alt-right-reaction.html?_r=0\"> denounced Trump last Thursday for cosying up to the alt-right</a> by engaging Bannon, the New York Times ran a piece saying \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/business/media/breitbart-news-presidential-race.html?_r=0\">Breitbart News has arrived</a>\u201d.</p> <p>According to the article, the website \u201cis now an increasingly powerful voice, and virtual rallying spot, for millions of disaffected conservatives\u201d and on Facebook, it rivals the audiences for the Washington Post and Yahoo.</p> <p>Known simply as Breitbart, the NY Times pointed to it being \u201can outsize source of controversy \u2014 for liberals and even many traditional conservatives \u2014 over material that has been called misogynist, xenophobic and racist.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/business/media/what-is-breitbart-news.html\">In a separate article</a>, the paper said the site \u201cgained prominence by breaking news about a series of scandals involving liberal politicians, bureaucrats and organisations, and by relentlessly pushing those stories.\u201d It continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe website is loathed by many liberals, moderates and establishment Republicans who say it stokes a partisan atmosphere and misleads readers in order to escalate what they see as non-issues.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It was among the first news outlets to disseminate unsubstantiated rumours that Clinton has health problems.</p> <p>Last month, Milo Yiannopoulos, the site\u2019s tech editor, was banned from Twitter after inspiring<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-twitter-milo-yiannopoulos-20160719-snap-story.html\"> a sustained online harassment campaign</a> against black actor Leslie Jones. </p> <p>But, as the New York Times has argued, it is willingness of the site\u2019s contributors to embrace viewpoints considered far outside the bounds of respectable political discourse that is the source of its success</p> <p>It is noticeable that various alt-right groups, such as white supremacist websites, link to Breitbart\u2019s coverage. </p> <p>But there have been splits within Breitbart. In March this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\">the Guardian reported</a> on one major internal revolt when some of its writers resigned in protest at the company\u2019s treatment of Michelle Fields.</p> <p>She was the Breitbart reporter who claimed to have been assaulted by Trump\u2019s then campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. She complained that the company had not stood behind her, prompting several resignations from sympathetic colleagues, including editor-at-large Ben Shapiro.</p> <p>Other staff members quit on the grounds that \u201cBannon had turned a website founded on anti-authoritarian grounds into a de facto propaganda outlet for Mr Trump.\u201d<br></p> <p>There is <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/\">a London division</a>, which<a href=\"http://n.com/media/greenslade/2014/feb/17/digital-media-dailytelegraph\"> was launched in February 2014</a>. At the time it was headed by James Delingpole. Now the editor is Raheem Kassam, a former executive editor of The Commentator, which is linked to the neo-conservative <a href=\"http://henryjacksonsociety.org/\">Henry Jackson Society</a>. </p> <p>Among the London-based contributors have been Nigel Farage, Mary Ellen Synon and Katie Hopkins.</p> <p>Clearly, Breitbart in Britain has yet to take centre stage as it has in the States. But the Brexit vote does suggest that its ideas have informed a constituency that, in so many ways, hold views similar to the legions who support Trump and, by extension, the alt-right.</p>",

This clarity can only be achieved by excluding a privileged trade agreement with the UK ... The century-old British strategy remains the same, ie to weaken the forces that can make Europe stronger. The UK can achieve this by insisting on a special deal whereby the UK maintains the benefits of the union while not sharing in the costs. Such a deal would signal to other member countries that by exiting, they can continue to enjoy the benefits of the union without the costs. Such a prospect would fatally weaken the European Union.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/08/top-10-reasons-brexit-isnt-working-according-brexiteers\">New Statesman, Ian Leslie has a light-hearted but actually fairly accurate sounding guide to the top 10 reasons why Brexit isn\u2019t working \u2013 according, of course, to Brexiters</a> (sabotage by Whitehall, remainers talking down the country, untrustworthy experts, EU bureaucrats, etc etc):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the next few years, it is likely that the economy will shrink, the entire government will be consumed by trade negotiations, and EU leaders will use their considerable negotiation advantages to theatrically screw us. As this unpretty story unfolds, those who argued confidently for Brexit, in parliament and in the press, will feel compelled to maintain that they were right, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for some other impossible-to-foresee factor everything would be going splendidly. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>The obvious silver lining?

Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, who is seeking his party\u2019s nomination to run in 2017, used a speech at the weekend to call for the main Calais camp to be relocated to the UK.</p> <p>Sarkozy said: \u201cI\u2019m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them. The Jungle should not be in Calais or anywhere else, because this is a republic and those with no rights to be here should return to their country.\u201d</p> <p>Sarkozy, who is running a hardline rightwing primary campaign, in effect called for a renegotiation of the Le Touquet agreement. Yet it was Sarkozy, when he was interior minister, who signed the agreement with Britain in 2003.</p> <p>Alain Jupp\u00e9, the mayor of Bordeaux who is favourite to become the right\u2019s candidate for the presidency next year, has also questioned the agreement, saying over the summer that \u201clogic dictates\u201d that border controls should happen on UK soil. </p> <p>Marine Le Pen, of the far-right Front National, who has strong support in Calais in northern France, is also campaigning on scrapping the current immigration deal. </p> <p>But at government level, the issue is complex as France battles to sort out its own asylum system issues. After the UK voted for Brexit in June, the Socialist government said there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">no renegotiation</a> of the British-French immigration deal because it would not be in French interests. </p> <p>Cazeneuve warned that a change to the deal would send a signal to traffickers and smugglers that they could legitimately leave people at the French border to cross to England and would lead to tens of thousands more migrants in northern France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said there would be \u201cno sense\u201d in changing the deal.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, declined to comment directly on the fate of the Le Touquet agreement when asked after a campaign event in London, instead saying the burden of taking refugees should be better spread across the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe point I always make about the refugee crisis across Europe is it has to be shared across the whole of the European union,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment Germany takes by far the largest proportion of Syrian asylum seekers and others. Some countries take none, and some take a very small number. The whole of Europe must recognise that we do have a moral duty to take a far greater number of asylum seekers all across Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said the UK should particularly be more ready to process asylum claims for people with family links to the country, adding: \u201cWhere there are family connections of people in the camps with family in Britain then clearly they can apply, and often do.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn condemned conditions in the main Calais camp, and similar ones along the coast in Dunkirk, both of which he has visited. \u201cI\u2019ve seldom seen anything so disgusting as those fetid camps in a land of plenty. It\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sir Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, warned on Monday that if a rightwing candidate won the presidential election next year, Britain \u201cis going to have to deal with a pretty serious conversation with France about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">the Le Touquet agreement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>He said the UK was unlikely to accept the hotspot idea \u2013 adopted by the EU to tackle the crisis of mass migration from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to Greece and Italy \u2013 warning that it would attract many more people to Calais. \u201cAs soon as you suggest that, it becomes a huge magnet,\u201d added Ricketts.</p>",

It is a fraught and pivotal moment for the UK\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results\">third-biggest political party by vote-count</a> in last year\u2019s general election, with a series of ideological and personal undercurrents threatening to send it off course.</p> <p>The more obvious faultline is the ideological future of an organisation which, as of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">EU referendum two months ago</a>, has seen its primary founding goal achieved. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-ukip-after-nigel-farage-a-grievance-in-search-of-a-leader\">The Guardian view on Ukip after Nigel Farage: a grievance in search of a leader | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While much of the talk is about expanding Ukip\u2019s base and reaching out to economically disenfranchised former Labour voters, some candidates are still discussing issues such as restrictions on Muslim women wearing veils in public, described disparagingly by one party insider as the \u201cGeert Wilders, BNP-light, anti-Islam line\u201d \u2013 a reference to the far-right Dutch political leader who is calling for the complete \u201cde-Islamification\u201d of the Netherlands.</p> <p>Perhaps more damaging is the lineup on offer \u2013 in which only one person, Diane James, the party\u2019s deputy chair, has anything resembling a national profile, mainly based on her confident performance in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/feb/28/eastleigh-byelection-results-live-blog\">2013 Eastleigh byelection</a>, where she came within 1,800 votes of becoming the first person to be elected on a Ukip ticket. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d6612770a6e2db6065c478df38449a64e3dc7de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6612770a6e2db6065c478df38449a64e3dc7de/0_128_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane James\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane James has insisted she is putting forward no policies as part of her Ukip leadership campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other candidates are Lisa Duffy, a local councillor in Cambridgeshire; West Midlands MEP Bill Etheridge; and former parliamentary candidates <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joneselizab?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Elizabeth Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phil_broughton\">Philip Broughton</a>.</p> <p>Among the absentees are three leading figures who decided not to stand: Paul Nuttall, Farage\u2019s media-friendly deputy; Douglas Carswell, the party\u2019s Tory-defecting sole MP; and Nathan Gill, the MEP who leads Ukip in Wales.</p> <p>On top of that are two forced absences. Suzanne Evans wrote the party\u2019s 2015 manifesto and was seen as a likely successor to Farage, but was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/23/ukip-suzanne-evans-suspended-disloyalty-nigel-farage\">suspended by the party</a> before the election for alleged disloyalty. In her absence the initial favourite was Steven Woolfe, a former barrister and City lawyer with a modernising agenda for Ukip, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\">controversially excluded from the ballot</a> after his application was submitted 17 minutes late.</p> <p>The Ukip insider said this had left the field somewhat thin. \u201cSuzanne Evans and Steven Woolfe can\u2019t run, and Paul Nuttall isn\u2019t running \u2013 they\u2019re basically the three faces, other than Nigel, that any normal person will know,\u201d the source said. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/forget-nigel-farage-people-ukip-exploits\">Farage is gone, but the people he spoke for can\u2019t be ignored</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adding further to the confusion is the fact that James, the bookies\u2019 clear favourite to become new leader at the Ukip conference on 15 September, has decided to boycott the <a href=\"http://www.myukip.com/leadership-hustings.html\">official leadership hustings</a>, instead running <a href=\"http://www.diane4ukip.uk/meet-diane.html\">her own series of events</a>.</p> <p>Interviewed by BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme last week, James argued there was \u201cno need to debate with my rivals\u201d. She said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is appealing direct to the members and activists.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen if this apparent attempt to rise above the fray will set her out from the rest or cost her votes. At the penultimate hustings on Wednesday night in the Ukip stronghold of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, several among the near-100 attending said they were baffled. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit disrespectful,\u201d said one man. \u201cWhy should we be forced to travel to two events?\u201d</p> <p>James has similarly declined to outline any policies beyond a plan to swiftly rejig the party\u2019s 2015 manifesto ahead of a possible early general election, arguing that policymaking \u201con the hoof\u201d was not a good idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a281f750ce6b386983ccdd1088e00930b0fdb11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a281f750ce6b386983ccdd1088e00930b0fdb11/0_310_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukip leadership candidates at the final hustings, from left: Lisa Duffy, Bill Etheridge, Phillip Broughton and Liz Jones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukip leadership candidates at the final hustings, from left: Lisa Duffy, Bill Etheridge, Phillip Broughton and Liz Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> While none of the other four candidates seem likely to win \u2013 Duffy is a distant second favourite \u2013 their stances highlight the choice faced by the party: how to expand its reach without upsetting the base.<br></p> <p>One of the centrepieces of Duffy\u2019s appeal to members at Clacton was what she called a \u201cpositive vision for British Islam\u201d, a slightly retro-Ukip programme including a restriction on wearing a veil in public places.</p> <p>Etheridge remains similarly in tune with such sentiments, calling at the hustings for the privatisation of the \u201cshoddy, leftwing\u201d BBC and for a low-tax, private sector-based economy.</p> <p>In contrast, Broughton, who at the 2015 election came within 3,000 votes of defeating Labour in Hartlepool, told the Clacton audience he wants Ukip to \u201cbroaden our message and change our tone\u201d. The self-styled \u201cyoung, passionate, northern, working class guy\u201d is unlikely to win but is a distinctive figure in the party, not least given his <a href=\"http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/former-stockton-councillor-takes-wrestling-3665225\">brief career in wrestling</a>, where he grappled under the title The One and Only Phillip Alexander alongside more snappily named opponents such as Disco Wes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74c42cc6f13819323a99e75f9056763bf14ab3b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c42cc6f13819323a99e75f9056763bf14ab3b9/0_351_1302_781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage said he would only return to lead Ukip if there was a long delay in triggering article 50 for EU departure.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage said he would only return to lead Ukip if there was a long delay in triggering article 50 for EU departure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James similarly raised some eyebrows by suggesting that heavily multicultural Newham in east London could prove a future Ukip stronghold, given its relatively high leave vote in the Brexit referendum.</p> <p>Amid all this there is inevitable, if so far private, talk that even a James leadership could be temporary, with either Woolfe or even Farage returning to the fray within a year or so. Farage, a man of several interrupted retirements, has so far <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/699809/nigel-farage-return-leader-ukip-brexit\">said he would only come back</a> if there was a long delay in triggering article 50, which sets in motion EU departure. Woolfe has remained silent since his exclusion, beyond accepting the party\u2019s ruling.<br></p> <p>The loss of Woolfe is seen by his allies as the product of a wider power struggle within the party, in which a national executive committee hostile to Farage is seeking to exclude his favourites.</p> <p>Carswell, who represents Clacton in parliament, dismissed this. \u201cWe\u2019re not big enough to have wings,\u201d he told the Guardian at the hustings. \u201cWe\u2019re an anti-establishment movement. We need to grow up and become a party that\u2019s bigger than one person. And I hope we manage it.\u201d</p> <p>He is not endorsing any of the candidates, saying this was in part to ensure he had a better relationship with the new leader than he did with Farage: \u201cI didn\u2019t always particularly get on with the previous leader, so I think it\u2019s all the more important that I make every effort to get on with the new leader.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Coalition has agreed to allow parliament\u2019s powerful privileges committee to determine whether material obtained by the Australian federal police in controversial raids during and after the election campaign will be protected by privilege.<br></p> <p>The government had looked to be positioning to avoid that outcome but in one of the first gestures of the new Senate, the leader of the government, George Brandis, said he would support the reference to privileges because it was the \u201cappropriate course of action.\u201d</p> <p>The action in the Senate has been triggered by raids following an embarrassing leak of confidential information from NBN Co.

During the second raid, which involved AFP officers accessing the parliamentary server, the AFP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/cory-bernardi-signals-he-may-back-labor-over-controversial-nbn-raids\">invoked national security grounds</a> to prevent opposition staff from recording the investigation that stretched into the night last Wednesday.</p> <p>The activity perturbed parliamentarians across party lines, given the precedents being set. Ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s deliberations in the Senate, the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi signalled he could side with Labor in sending the matter off to the privileges committee.</p> <p>Conroy invoked privilege during the first police raid, which means all the material taken by the AFP in relation to the NBN Co leaks has been locked in the safe of the clerk of the Senate until the chamber makes a determination about how to proceed.</p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s decision to back Labor\u2019s motion referring the case to privileges followed an offer by the Senate president, Stephen Parry, to broker talks between Brandis and the Labor Senate leader, Penny Wong, to determine a way forward.</p> <p>Parry later withdrew the offer after it became clear the Coalition would back the motion.</p> <p>Speaking to the motion, Conroy told the Senate all parliamentarians needed to stand up to defend their work with whistleblowers rather than serve short-term partisan interests, and he said journalists also needed to defend their professional imperative to publish material in the public interest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is at stake here is not simply a question of the prime minister\u2019s legacy as communications minister, much as that legacy deserves close scrutiny,\u201d Conroy said Tuesday night. \u201cWhat this is about is the proper functioning of the parliament and our democratic system.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is, at its core, about the constitutional right of the people of Australia, through their parliament, to hold the executive to account without fear or recrimination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere must be no place for politics when it comes to such fundamental democratic principles.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/27/federal-police-raids-over-nbn-leak-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-journalists\">Federal police raids over NBN leak should ring alarm bells for journalists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In accepting the referral Brandis told the chamber there were competing interests to balance and it would now be up to the privileges committee to determine how to proceed.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue raises not one, but two important principles. Senator Conroy has rightly said it raises the matter of privilege of the Senate. It is not the privilege of individual senators, it is the privilege of the Senate, as Senator Conroy has rightly said,\u201d Brandis said.</p> <p>He noted that interest was set in tension with another principle. \u201cThat is the due and proper administration of the criminal justice system by those officers charged with its administration, in this case officers of the AFP.\u201d</p>",

How great is it to have Politics Live back? To some breaking news. For the last week or so, I\u2019ve been watching developments inside the Coalition on the Racial Discrimination Act closely. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">In a story I published last night</a>, I noted the Liberal senator <strong>Cory Bernardi</strong> had been seen stalking the corridors yesterday collecting signatures for his private member\u2019s bill, which aims to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the RDA.<br><br>His effort seems to be progressing well. The bush mail inside the Coalition informs me <strong>he\u2019s signed up every backbencher in the upper house in the Liberal and National parties with the exception of Jane Hume, a new Liberal from Victoria</strong>. The bill now could have support from as many as 20 senators, if we throw in the crossbench. That\u2019s obviously a sizeable minority of senators, a minority that will be pretty hard for the prime minister to ignore, which is presumably why <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> has recently switched his line from no, we are not overhauling the RDA, to we are not overhauling the RDA \u201cyet.\u201d Bernardi won\u2019t confirm he has 20 but he\u2019s told me he\u2019s \u201cheartened by the level of support I\u2019ve received\u201d.</p> <p>Back to you Gabrielle Chan.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:49:07.251Z\">at 12.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4c4b4e4b0655f72768985\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:27:59.850Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> thanked <strong>Tina Brown</strong> and the <strong>Wedgetails</strong> for the welcome to country.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australians most certainly want this 45th parliament to be capable of rising above self-seeking, narrow sectional interests.

  "<p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is expected to tell her French counterpart on Tuesday that Britain is determined to retain the Le Touquet agreement that allows border checks to take place in Calais, despite growing controversy in France.</p> <p>Rudd is expected to travel to Paris to meet Bernard Cazeneuve face-to-face for the first time.

  "<p>The village headman, or <em>muhtar</em>, is the plankton in the food chain of Turkish politics. He \u2013 or, less often, she \u2013 is an elected local official who counts heads, settles feuds, and finds cats.</p> <p>On the night of 15 July, Can Cumurcu, the <em>muhtar</em> of the affluent neighbourhood of \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, on the Asian shore of Istanbul, led the defence of his manor against soldiers who had joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/military-coup-was-well-planned-and-very-nearly-succeeded-say-turkish-officials\">military coup</a> to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u00c7engelk\u00f6y was the scene of a thrilling people\u2019s defence against the rebels. Cumurcu was shot just above the hip; now he\u2019s reckoned a <em>gazi</em>, or holy warrior.</p> <p>When I met him a couple of weeks after the coup failed, Cumurcu was propped up on the sofa in his flat in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. His amiable face darkened when he mentioned his dead nephew, who had been cut down by army bullets during the coup \u2013 but the resolve in his voice, and his references to the \u201cesteemed\u201d president, the \u201csacred\u201d national flag, and God, made it clear that he felt that he had done his duty as a Turk and a Muslim.</p> <p>\u201cI got home at around 10pm that night,\u201d he remembered, wincing from his sore side, \u201cand my neighbours told me there were tanks on the Bosphorus Bridge.\u201d Cumurcu went down to the coastal road, where people were discussing the announcement on TV that the army had taken over the country. Then he saw an army captain entering \u00c7engelk\u00f6y on foot, firing his gun into the air.</p> <p>\u201cThe captain saw me and said, \u2018get these people inside!\u2019 I said sharply, \u2018Have you been drinking? Are you all right in the head?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The captain retreated but Cumurcu guessed he would come back with reinforcements to clear the road. The <em>muhtar</em> arranged for a barricade of vehicles to be formed, and more locals were roused using social media. Some were armed; so were the handful of pro-Erdo\u011fan duty officers at \u00c7engelk\u00f6y\u2019s small police station. Shortly after midnight, the soldiers stormed back into the neighbourhood with a burst of automatic fire. Cumurcu was flung into the air by a slug that passed through his side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/16/welcome-to-demokrasi-how-erdogan-got-more-popular-than-ever-podcast\">Welcome to demokrasi: how Erdo\u011fan got more popular than ever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stricken <em>muhtar</em> was rushed to a nearby hospital \u2013 which would receive 60 dead and wounded over the course of the night. Back in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, the putschists had seized the police station but were unable to advance further. They took hostages and forced them to their knees in the road. According to media reports, one officer shouted, \u201cYou dogs! Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s only one God? Your God is Erdo\u011fan. Let him come and save you now.\u201d</p> <p>All the accounts of the coup \u2013 even allowing for the fact that they have since been tidied into a seamless epic \u2013 agree that the president did indeed have a decisive effect on events. Erdo\u011fan had been holidaying in the southern resort of Marmaris; he was still there at 24 minutes past midnight, when he issued a televised appeal for Turks to come into the streets and defend the regime, for, as he put it, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a force stronger than the people.\u201d</p> <p>The number of civilians resisting the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y suddenly leaped from a few score to thousands, a pattern replicated outside the Istanbul mayoralty, the Ankara parliament, and other flashpoints across the country. When Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plane landed at Istanbul airport at around 3am, he was met by huge crowds of supporters; three hours later, when news arrived that the Bosphorus Bridge had been liberated, the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y turned tail. The coup was over.</p> <p>For the next few days, following the example of the loyalist media, the people of Turkey doused themselves in anger, pride, grief and exhilaration. The putschists had killed some 240 civilians, 18 of them in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. Parliament had been bombed by F-16s. But democracy had won.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live - at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What followed, however, looked less like a democratic victory than an authoritarian purge. In six weeks, more than 80,000 soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and private sector employees have been arrested, sacked or suspended. Not all of those who have been targeted appear to be connected to the movement led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen</a>, the influential US-based preacher and educationalist whom Erdo\u011fan has accused of masterminding the coup. Scores of journalists have been detained, and around 100 media outlets have been forcibly shut down. Amnesty International has raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ie/latest/stories/2016/07/28/turkey-taking-big-step-backwards-human-rights/\">\u201cmass repression, torture and arbitrary detention\u201d</a> under the cover of the state of emergency that Erdo\u011fan declared on 20 July.</p> <p>For onlookers in the west, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s clampdown confirms his well-established tendency to regard his own popularity as a mandate to crush opponents. The spontaneous civilian uprising against the military coup may have represented the ultimate affirmation of the popular will \u2013 but the events that followed have deepened the contradiction between Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestionable democratic legitimacy and his equally indisputable authoritarian rule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdogan\u2019s demokrasi may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The immediate reaction to the coup from American and European politicians provided evidence of their unease: both John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, issued warnings to the Turks demanding that Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/european-leaders-urge-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law-after-failed-coup\">respect democracy and the rule of law</a>. The clear implication, for listeners inside Turkey, was that Europe and America were more concerned for the thugs who had tried to seize the state than they were for its democratically elected leaders. In response, Erdo\u011fan excoriated the west for \u201csiding with the putchists\u201d.</p> <p>Words often change meaning when they change language. If Erdo\u011fan is correct to suspect that the US and EU would not have mourned his overthrow, this is because he now presides over a bespoke form of government that western leaders do not understand or appreciate. Erdogan\u2019s <em>demokrasi</em> may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will \u2013 a blunt majoritarian riposte to an imagined democratic gold standard that in reality no longer exists.</p> <p>Turkey under Erdo\u011fan may be compared with Putin\u2019s Russia, Modi\u2019s India and Netanyahu\u2019s Israel. In all these places the forms of democracy have been suborned by majoritarian nationalism, bolstered to varying degrees by the security state. In fact, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s programme does not look very different to the prospectus unveiled by France\u2019s would-be strongman, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose campaign for the presidency looks likely to be defined by his promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nicolas-sarkozy-declares-candidacy-french-presidential-election\">enforce majority prejudice over minority interests</a>. (His support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\">burkini ban</a> is a case in point.) Of course, Erdo\u011fan is an Islamist \u2013 while the others are anti-Islamists. But the new wave of elected authoritarians are nothing if not indulgent of many different varieties of nationalist phobia.</p> <p>From this perspective, Erdo\u011fan is less an aberration than the vanguard of a global trend: the dissolution of the supposedly universal democratic ideal into many indigenised \u201cversions\u201d of democracy. What makes Kerry and Mogherini\u2019s lectures even harder for Erdo\u011fan to stomach is that Europe and America are hardly exceptions to this tendency. Under the state of emergency that France\u2019s government introduced after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks, the rights of French citizens to freedom of movement and association have been formally suspended. (Turkey\u2019s government did the same following the coup.) Xenophobia has once more become a widely accepted electoral tool: consider the loud and deceitful warnings of leading Brexit campaigners that Britain would soon be swamped by millions of Turkish migrants if the UK remained inside the EU. As for the paternalistic American pluralism preached by John Kerry, this could soon be washed away by a demagogue whose conception of democracy consists of a soapbox and a baseball bat.</p> <p>It is unsurprising that Erdo\u011fan views the west\u2019s stated concern for democracy as nothing but a cynical tool of foreign policy: after all, these same countries mutely acquiesced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/egypt-revolution-coup-military-intervention-analysis\">military overthrow</a> of his friend Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, only three years ago.</p> <p>For all Erdo\u011fan\u2019s democratic shortcomings, furthermore, his country isn\u2019t a dictatorship and he isn\u2019t a fascist. Turkey\u2019s president has neither stolen elections nor launched pogroms against the country\u2019s minority Kurdish or Alevi communities. The awkward fact for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics is that his popularity has not been hurt by his authoritarianism; if anything, his legitimacy has been further enhanced.

The impetus for this transformation dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when Turkish Islamists of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s generation were a numerical majority, and yet in political and social terms a repressed minority. The country\u2019s ruling establishment was exclusively peopled by secular-minded Kemalists, named after the founder of the Turkish republic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/08/ataturk-turkey-photography-ersoy-emin\">Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk</a>; the Kemalist army repeatedly intervened to prevent governments from reflecting the wishes of a mostly devout, intermittently anti-western electorate.</p> <p>Such was the Turkey I came to know after 1996, when I went to live in Ankara as the Economist\u2019s correspondent. Atat\u00fcrk and his successors had designed their new capital in the 1920s and 1930s to be a secular, republican contrast to Istanbul, the old imperial capital and former seat of the caliphate. Three-quarters of a century later, the Kemalist regime remained militaristic and unliberalised: one constantly saw staff officers being driven from one gaunt military building to another in ancient Turkish-made Fiats. Looking back from the big hill in the south of the city, with the Sheraton blocking your view of the only major mosque, it was possible to survey the capital of one of the world\u2019s biggest Muslim countries without seeing a single minaret.</p> <p>I was struck by the hatred with which the secular elite regarded their devout compatriots. \u201cReactionary\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d were the kinder adjectives that bureaucrats, army officers and newspaper editors attached to members of banned Islamic brotherhoods or people who sent their children to religious schools. A physical revulsion seemed to come over my emancipated female friends at the rare sight of a woman wearing the long, black body covering known in Turkey as the <em>\u00e7ar\u015faf</em>; they called these women \u201ctwo-legged cockroaches\u201d. At night, the secularists drank raki toasts to their hero Atat\u00fcrk and chain-smoked Samsun cigarettes in a line of fish restaurants in the centre of town.</p> <p>Each day, in and out of the ministry buildings went clean-shaven men in ties and women in skirts. Beards or head coverings were banned for public servants, and the only scarf one saw was on the head of the tea lady. Even after Erdo\u011fan became prime minister, in 2003, the arch-Kemalist President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to invite the covered Mrs Erdo\u011fan to attend Republic Day celebrations; when a reporter asked what he felt about this, Erdo\u011fan replied, \u201cput yourselves in my wife\u2019s place and decide for yourself\u201d.</p> <p>The only time I had a strong impression of being in a Muslim city was while driving to Ankara airport, past slums that were home to migrants from rural Turkey. Here, the women were covered and the men bearded; spindly minarets rose like Anatolian poplars against the sky.</p> <p>Kemalism was a big institutional fantasy according to which Turkey was a kind of warm-water Sweden. In the troubled 1990s, the country\u2019s secular establishment was associated with economic instability (inflation averaged 70%), a pitiless war against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), and a spiteful policy that banned girls in headscarves from public universities. Turkey\u2019s allies in Nato and the EU were alive to these failures; in a country whose politicians constantly solicited the affirmation of the west, the eventual rejection of Kemalism could only take place with outside approval.</p> <p>The big winner from the west\u2019s growing disenchantment with Kemalism was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 a ferry captain\u2019s son with roots in the conservative Black Sea region, who had served as a popular mayor of Istanbul since 1994. Rather than impose Islamic law on Turkey\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, as the secularists had predicted he would, Erdo\u011fan had devoted himself to improving the city\u2019s transport system, water supply, and air quality.</p> <p>When I met Erdo\u011fan in the spring of 1997, he was quick to point to the many ways in which Istanbullus\u2019 lives had got better since he became mayor. His account was hard to fault; even his secularist critics concurred that this sclerotic, corrupt old wreck of a place finally had a competent, hard-working mayor who wasn\u2019t on the take. We met on the terrace of an imperial Ottoman house that he had had restored and then opened to the public. The house itself was a symbol of his departure from the ruling order; the secularists were so disdainful of the defunct empire that they had let most of these relics crumble.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan came out on to the terrace where I was sitting with one of his aides; he was athletic and youthful and looked good in a dark suit. We were brought superb early strawberries and ate them while admiring the Bosphorus view. He smiled often as we talked, without any of the glowering pompousness he now displays regularly \u2013 but even then, I sensed a wariness that was more than the usual politician\u2019s caution; he knew that the west was still making up its mind about him.</p> <p>He flashed one of his smiles when I reminded him of the Kemalists\u2019 criticism of his decision not to allow booze in this and other municipal establishments. \u201cWhen I became mayor they said I would ban alcohol in Istanbul, but anyone who wants to drink may do so.\u201d He seemed to be saying, \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>The doubts that many in Turkey felt towards him concerned his intentions; the previous year he had caused outrage by describing democracy as a \u201ctram ... it goes as far as we want it to go, and then we get off\u201d. That evening I upset my Turkish friends by defending too fervently a man they continued to regard as a theocrat in disguise.</p> <p>The following year, Erdo\u011fan was sentenced to 10 months in jail on risible charges of inciting a religious insurrection (he ended up serving four). He had recited some lines of martial poetry by an early Turkish nationalist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziya_G%C3%B6kalp\">Ziya G\u00f6kalp</a>. The US consul in Istanbul came to the mayoralty to commiserate; the case, she said, would \u201cweaken confidence in Turkish democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b/0_57_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer / Reuter/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Four years after he was released from prison, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rise to prime minister in 2003 was applauded not only by conservative Turks but also by western politicians and academics who hoped that his democratic Islamism would provide an alternative path to the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d that many regarded as inevitable in the wake of 9/11. Erdo\u011fan was praised for his commitment to something called \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam, although he bridled at the term, as most Muslims would; Islam is a God-given truth and in no need of improving qualifiers. His domestic opponents continued to accuse him of hiding his true beliefs until he had purged Kemalist institutions like the army and the judiciary.</p> <p>In its first few years in power, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP introduced a slew of liberalising and democratic reforms. The notorious state security courts were scrapped, torture was curtailed, and the government put out feelers aimed at a political settlement with the Kurds. Political stability and fiscal discipline helped to cut inflation, while in pious central Anatolia \u2013 the AKP\u2019s heartland \u2013 ambitious family-run firms invested in future growth. Between 2002 and 2013 the economy expanded by an average of 5% per annum: the government used the proceeds of that growth to invest in housing, health, and education. The slums I used to drive past on the road to Ankara airport in the 1990s were replaced with smart modern flats.</p> <p>The high water mark for Erdo\u011fan and the west was 2005, when the EU and Turkey opened accession negotiations. At the time, Erdo\u011fan expressed a worldview that was notably open and optimistic. \u201cCountries on their own,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not mean \u2026 much any more. They can achieve a lot more in solidarity with their friends.\u201d</p> <p>By making himself and Turkey indispensable to the west \u2013 there was, the veteran US diplomat Richard Holbrooke declared, \u201cno country in the world of more strategic importance\u201d \u2013 Erdo\u011fan was also protecting himself against his Kemalist foes. The wisdom of this approach was demonstrated in 2007, when the general staff threatened a coup if he went ahead with plans to elevate his AKP confrere Abdullah G\u00fcl to the presidency. Instead, the EU and the US weighed in with statements of support for the elected government, Erdo\u011fan called the generals\u2019 bluff by holding early elections which he resoundingly won, and G\u00fcl moved into the presidential palace \u2013 along with his covered wife.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan was now strong enough to accelerate a process that had begun years earlier, changing the ethos of the army, which had earlier toppled three governments. Kemalist officers were retired, and Islamists brought in. In this endeavour, Erdo\u011fan was assisted by the followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen \u2013 the secretive Islamist movement that was allied with the AKP against the secular establishment for a decade until a dramatic split in 2013.</p> <p>It is likely that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vulnerability in the early stages of his premiership made it easier for him to make friendly gestures to Kurds and liberals \u2013 constituencies well beyond the typical ambit of the Turkish Islamist. In 2004, a ban on teaching in the Kurdish language was lifted, and the prime minister repeatedly overruled plans by the military to attack PKK camps in northern Iraq; some Kurds, particularly the conscientious Muslim ones, rewarded him with their votes.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising, in the mid-2000s Turkey gained the most vocal feminist, environmentalist and LGBT movements in the Muslim Middle East. The organisers of Istanbul\u2019s annual gay pride march called it the biggest in the Muslim world. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/police-use-teargas-against-lgbt-activists-in-istanbul\">This year\u2019s march was banned</a> by the authorities in Istanbul, however, citing security concerns after nationalist groups warned they would not allow it to take place.) For a while \u2013 with the exception of Turkey\u2019s roughly 15 million Alevis, whom many in the Sunni mainstream regard as renegade Muslims \u2013 Erdo\u011fan could claim to be a leader for all Turkey.</p> <p>The tragedy of modern Turkey is that all of these relationships that had begun to blossom under Erdo\u011fan \u2013 with the Kurds, with Turkish liberals, with the EU and the US \u2013 have now fallen apart again under his leadership, which only becomes more authoritarian and isolated with the crumbling of each alliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444/0_30_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a proud man, sensitive to slights. He turned decisively against his old friend Bashar al-Assad when the latter rejected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s appeal for leniency towards the Syrians who began protesting against the dictator in the spring of 2011. (It has also been reported that Mrs Assad made rude remarks about the Erdo\u011fans after the two couples holidayed together, which were intercepted by Turkish intelligence.)</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s support for Syrian opposition fighters reflected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s one-time hope that a Sunni-dominated Syria would become a loyal Turkish client. Instead, the Turks have seen an influx of millions of Syrian refugees, and watched helplessly while the Syrian Kurdish allies of the PKK, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organisation, have set up autonomous cantons across the border. When Turkey bowed to American pressure and joined the coalition against Islamic State in 2014, the jihadis responded with a string of suicide attacks inside Turkey \u2013 the most recent of which, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/several-dead-in-suspected-terrorist-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey\">southern city of Gaziantep</a>, on 20 August, killed 50 people.</p> <p>In the summer of 2013, weeks of protests initially sparked by the government\u2019s plans to bulldoze an Istanbul park decisively snapped whatever understanding still remained between Erdo\u011fan and Turkish liberals, millions of whom came out to demonstrate against the AKP\u2019s growing authoritarianism. (As if to prove their point, the protests were harshly put down, injuring thousands.) Finally, last summer, amid the ruins of his Syria policy, Erdo\u011fan launched a new round of fighting against the PKK that has so far cost some 1,800 lives and devastated towns across Turkish Kurdistan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turkey\u2019s unresolved application for EU membership has arguably been the most painful reverse of all. Even back in 2005, it was clear that there was a strong chance that Austria, France or Germany would block Turkey\u2019s membership because the country is too big and too Muslim. Since then, various pretexts have been found to slow the accession process to a crawl. It is now clear that Turkey will not join, but formally ending negotiations would cause yet more ill-will and jeopardise what cooperation there is, particularly on Syrian refugees.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a bully who has insulted his political opponents and locked up critical journalists. His reflexive response to criticism is to demand, in public: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d (At the end of July, he directed this question at General Joseph Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, who suggested that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s purge of military officers would damage the ongoing campaign against Islamic State.) Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation, including one against a German comic who recited a poem about him copulating with a goat.</p> <p>Even now, after 13 years of uninterrupted power and the accumulation of untold wealth, Turkey\u2019s ruling Islamists seem still to be responding to humiliations that were meted out to them by the superior, snobby, Europeanised Kemalists. Erdo\u011fan has not got where he is by taking fancy degrees or showing off his restaurant French (he is defiantly monolingual) \u2013 but through straightforward piety and political nous. Just as the Kemalists used to disparage the \u201cprimitive\u201d ways of Turkey\u2019s Islamists, so too does Erdo\u011fan deplore liberal freedoms that he regards as obstacles to development and virtue. He has compared abortions to mass murder and derides all drinkers as alcoholics; environmentalists, he has said, should move to a forest.</p> <p>During Erdo\u011fan\u2019s honeymoon with the west, foreign journalists used to remark that his rough edges had been smoothed in office; his trips abroad as prime minister, it was implied, had been the making of him. But these pats on the head reflected their wishes rather than his: in the contemptuous words of a Turkish opposition leader, Erdo\u011fan still had the style of a <em>maganda</em> \u2013 a boorish lout. (Erdo\u011fan promptly sued.)</p> <p>The liberals protesting against Erdo\u011fan in the summer of 2013 enjoyed mocking the monstrous <em>maganda</em> palace he was building for himself in Ankara \u2013 which ended up costing more than $600m and was built in brazen violation of a court ruling that it was illegal. Last October Erdo\u011fan castigated opposition leaders who dared to criticise the palace for trying to weaken a \u201cdemocratically-elected president\u201d. For Erdo\u011fan, what justifies his contempt for both the opposition and the law is the fact that he wins elections. In this view, the defeat of the attempted coup was the biggest election of all, and his most decisive victory. It was a huge and spontaneous plebiscite, and Turkey will probably never hear the end of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626/426_922_4081_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For the past few years \u2013 but especially in the past six weeks \u2013 Erdo\u011fan has redefined Turkish democracy to give himself a mandate to interpret and even anticipate the will of the majority while absolving himself of the responsibility to protect minorities.</p> <p>In his obvious aspiration to personify the nation, there is only one man who can rival him: Atat\u00fcrk. Until the final defeat of the Kemalist establishment in the late-2000s, Atat\u00fcrk was everywhere: his handsome features on the TV screens, his aphorisms emblazoned in bus stations, his name intoned in every speech. Erdo\u011fan now is as visible as Atat\u00fcrk was then \u2013 and equally protected from criticism. \u201cWith your elevated permission,\u201d the TV interviewers tiptoe, as they nervously pose their questions.</p> <p>The events of this summer have taken his popularity to a new level: a poll taken several weeks after the coup found that 68% of Turks approve of his handling of the situation. This is a lot more than the 52% of voters who propelled him to the presidency in 2014, when it seemed that the blush might be coming off the Erdo\u011fan bloom. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ad hoc supporters include Kurds \u2013 Kurdish nationalists have been sorely mistreated by G\u00fclenist policemen and judiciary officials \u2013 as well as secularists who despise the G\u00fclen movement\u2019s secretive, cultish character.</p> <p>The president\u2019s standing was not harmed by the fact that he seems to have faced considerable personal danger on the night of the coup. He escaped capture in Marmaris by a matter of minutes and the presidential jet was buzzed mid-air by rebel F-16s on its way to Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport; it could only land once the control tower had been liberated from the putschists. Erdo\u011fan is a bruiser from a hardscrabble Istanbul neighbourhood, whose legendary stare of disapproval has been known to terrify grown men; few Turks would have been surprised to hear that his sang-froid did not falter even when it looked as if the coup might succeed.</p> <p>When Erdo\u011fan played semi-professional football as a young man \u2013 he declined to turn pro because his father disapproved \u2013 he was known for warning his teammates about the perils of drinking and looking at girls. Now, at 62, he is Turkey\u2019s own severe father, who refuses to let the country\u2019s honour be soiled.</p> <p>His brilliance as a communicator \u2013 an aspect that tends to be ignored by his critics \u2013 is shown to best effect when he addresses his supporters directly. But none of his speeches that I have seen can compare in intensity and sophistication to the address he delivered nine days after the coup, praising the \u201cmartyrs\u201d who lost their lives defending the nation against the coup.</p> <p>The setting was a vertiginous conference hall attached to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ostentatious new palace in Ankara. Among the crowd were the families of the martyrs, some holding framed photos of a husband or son. Some of the heroes of the resistance were also present \u2013 one on a stretcher. The president took to the stage in a dark suit and purple tie. Soon he was feeling expertly for the limits of his voice, alternating between hoarse denunciations of the coup, and low confiding riffs on the sanctity of death in the service of a holy cause.</p> <p>\u201cAfter prophethood,\u201d he said, \u201cmartyrdom is the next highest station\u201d; he confessed that he envied those who had fallen on the night of the coup. Then, he attacked the credulous G\u00fclenists, \u201cpoor fools\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d who had deluded themselves into believing that their leader was touched by divinity; for as Erdo\u011fan remonstrated sternly, \u201cwe are the slaves only of our God \u2026 only in prayer, in God\u2019s presence, do we genuflect.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely in Ankara \u2013 Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s citadel of secularism \u2013 can a speech by a politician have been so suffused with ideas of faith and infidelity. But for all his religiosity, Erdo\u011fan is arguably more of a nationalist than he is an Islamist: he is too much of a Turkish patriot to subscribe to a pan-Islamist ideology that would dissolve borders of land and ethnicity. His speech was as much about the pain and ecstasy of Turkishness as it was about God, and he quoted many stanzas of patriotic poetry \u2013 he has an excellent memory for verse and a fine delivery.</p> <p>\u201cThe martyrs\u2019 graveyard is not empty,\u201d the president declaimed, \u201cthe heroes await the earth, and the flag awaits the breeze to flutter.\u201d Returning the obvious adoration of his audience, he interrupted himself wonderingly: \u201cWhat a happy, what a blessed people we are \u2026 nowhere in the world can your equal be found.\u201d</p> <p>Of course a nation is nothing without enemies, and in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s depiction the failed coup exposed not one, but many. Referring to the mealy-mouthed reaction of Turkey\u2019s erstwhile western allies, he asked, \u201cAre we surprised?\u201d and then answered his own question with a no. \u201cAre we saddened? Yes, we are human.\u201d But what he called the \u201crebirth\u201d of 15 July had shown the Turks, he continued, that \u201cwe can expect neither justice, nor help, nor support, nor understanding from anyone \u2026 whatever we do, we\u2019ll do it ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, uniting the themes of faith, nation and death, the president piped his followers to a state of weeping, cheering helplessness. In their front rooms, at \u201cdemocracy vigils\u201d in main squares across the country, millions more watched him on screen. The following day, in conversations with ordinary Istanbullus, I heard many of them repeat phrases borrowed from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech \u2013 the sentiments of the leader, absorbed among the people as if by osmosis.</p> <p>The president\u2019s habit of referring to \u201cmy people\u201d; his promise to remake the Turkish state \u201croot and branch\u201d to undo the damage done by the G\u00fclenists; the economic objectives he has set for 2023, the centenary of the republic\u2019s founding \u2013 nothing here suggests a man who expects to become irrelevant. Erdo\u011fan has hollowed out the country\u2019s institutions \u2013 including the military, at long last \u2013 and has made himself even more indispensable. No problem is not of his making, and no solution possible without him.</p> <p>The constitution allows the president two five-year terms, which would take Erdo\u011fan to 2024 \u2013 21 years after he first became prime minister. But constitutions can change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872/0_84_1579_1721/917.jpg\" alt=\"The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows ioff his football skills to the Queen, in 2008\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows off his football skills to the Queen, in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Firat Yurdakul/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The world\u2019s growing ranks of elected authoritarians may be refashioning democracy in their own image, but they still face considerable obstacles to out-and-out despotism. These regimes are defined in part by their proud disregard for the views of the minority \u2013 but an unrelenting majoritarianism hardens the opposition of the excluded.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan still operates under significant political constraints. The country\u2019s Kurdish, Alevi, and secularist communities, who distrust him intensely, add up to roughly half of Turkey\u2019s population of 75 million. For all the AKP\u2019s status as Turkey\u2019s unrivalled party of government, under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestioned dominance, he has not been able to compel parliament to give him the enhanced powers of the executive presidency he covets.</p> <p>Nor does Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority as an embodiment of Turkish Sunni conservatism mean that he is about to turn on those who do not embrace this identity; it is doubtful that he would have the support of his base to do so. A recent privately commissioned poll to which I have had access shows that while a majority of Turkish voters want a ban on alcohol and almost half would support the use of illegal means in the fight against terrorism, there is also wide support for abstract notions such as liberty and freedom of expression.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan trumpets his adherence to the will of his people, but he does not blindly pursue its whims. Having oscillated between Europhilia and Islamic fervour, universalism and isolationism, war and peace, it is clear that his political trajectory is that of a pragmatist who likes to keep his options open. His failure to pursue a ban on alcohol, despite the fact that it would please the base, is another instance of his pragmatism. That he regards secularism as useful \u2013 perhaps as a means of averting sectarian conflict \u2013 was demonstrated when he urged Mohamed Morsi to build a secular state after coming to power in Egypt in 2011.</p> <p>Even amid the purges, Erdo\u011fan has withdrawn all the suits he brought for insulting him \u2013 with the exception of the German comic, that is. He has also suspended hostilities with the main opposition party, the Alevi- and secularist-dominated Republican People\u2019s party (CHP). The CHP leader, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, himself an Alevi, was Erdo\u011fan\u2019s guest at a huge rally in Istanbul on 7 August, which allowed the president to stress the broad nature of the coalition against the coup, including people \u201cfrom all roots and of all spirits\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey is now trying to back out of its Syrian dead-end, and softening its opposition to the idea that Assad might retain a role in the postwar transition. Last week, the Turkish army joined the United States in a major cross-border offensive against Islamic State \u2013 with the additional aim of preventing the Syrian Kurds from establishing their own state on Turkey\u2019s southern border. To the north, the PKK may be preparing for a possible return to negotiations with Erdo\u011fan, having denounced the coup and announcing its readiness to help \u201cbuild a democratic Turkey\u201d.</p> <p>What that might look like is anyone\u2019s guess. The reign of Erdo\u011fan and other leaders in his mould is a clear sign that there is no longer a single model of democracy, stamped with EU or US approval, to which all countries aspire. It has long been common to contrast the emphasis laid by emerging non-western democracies on the will of the majority with the care taken by \u201cmature\u201d democracies to protect minority rights. But this flattering distinction may no longer be valid. The picture from France, the United States, and to an extent Britain suggests that a brazen majoritarianism has emerged from the crises and upheavals of the past decade. Erdo\u011fan may not resemble our stated democratic ideals, but he may be their future.

So some of the things that we heard about the shortcomings of Nafta, that the president agrees with, were actually addressed in the negotiation of TPP.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think the logic of it is overwhelming. We\u2019d be cutting against our interests to walk away from TPP.
