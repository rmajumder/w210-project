  "<p>Donald Trump may be struggling to capture a majority of voters in the heartland of America, but there is one eastern European precinct he would likely carry in a landslide \u2013 if only they were allowed to vote in US elections. </p> <p>The town of Veles, Macedonia (population 44,000), is the unlikely home for dozens of avowedly pro-Trump political news sites, featuring headlines like Hillary\u2019s Illegal Email Just Killed Its First American Spy and This is How Liberals Destroyed America, This Is Why We Need Trump in the White House.</p> <p>The Guardian has identified more than 150 domains registered to people claiming addresses in Veles, though not all of those are associated with active websites. </p> <p>Some claim to garner millions of page views per month. Most others are relatively obscure. All of them exist primarily for one reason \u2013 to cash in on the seemingly endless appetite for news about Donald Trump. And they\u2019re getting a big boost from Facebook. </p> <h2><strong>Fake names and death threats</strong></h2> <p>The creator of a popular Macedonian site, \u201cAlex\u201d claims that he was one of the first of his countrymen to write about US politics. (Alex is not his real name, and he spoke on condition of anonymity.) He claims his neighbors copied his idea and have capitalized on the Trump wave. According to Alex, his site gets more than 1m visits a month, roughly half of them driven by his Facebook page. </p> <p>\u201cWe are an independent news magazine with [our] primary goal to influence American policy, especially politics,\u201d says Alex, who originally favored Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries. \u201cThen my city fellows saw what I was doing and started to copy my work. They are just looking to earn money from ad networks.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, these foreign sites probably wouldn\u2019t exist without their domestic counterparts, from whom they crib many of their stories. (Alex admits he started out by copying and pasting stories from conservative US news sites but says he\u2019s recently hired a half-dozen US-based writers to produce original content.)</p> <p>There are hundreds of relatively obscure political sites registered on this side of the Atlantic that grab news from mainstream outlets, rewrite the headlines to be click-friendly, and blast them out to their readers using Facebook. </p> <p>Many of these sites are registered privately, and the author names that appear on their pages are often fictitious or nonexistent. Using the search engines provided by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.domaintools.com/\">Domain Tools</a>, the Guardian was able to comb through historical domain name records and contact the owners of some of these sites. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Writing a clickbaity headline and dashing off 400 words in 15 minutes is not a skill they teach in journalism school</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At <a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/\">Bipartisan Report</a>, a left-leaning news site, about two-thirds of the authors use pseudonyms, says publisher Justin Brotman. The reason? Personal safety. </p> <p>\u201cMost of our authors start out saying, \u2018I\u2019ll use my real name, I don\u2019t care\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cOne week in, after they start getting death threats, they change their minds.\u201d </p> <p>Brotman won\u2019t reveal how much money his site makes, but it\u2019s enough to pay a staff of 15 freelance writers, who get compensated based on how much traffic their stories generate. Bipartisan Report\u2019s Facebook page, which has 825,000 likes, plays a large role in sending traffic his way.</p> <p> \u201cAll social media is of utmost importance,\u201d he says. \u201cIf your goal is straight page views then Facebook is the best investment of your time. It does drive more \u2018clicks\u2019 than posting on other platforms with an equal amount of followers. But I\u2019d put Twitter way ahead in lending credibility and enhancing our brand.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/02/facebook-ad-targeting-settings-preferences\">Race, politics, travel plans: things Facebook's algorithm can't get right</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>\u2018Share, share, share it all over Facebook\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Even smaller sites are making bank on the surge of interest in the Republican nominee. <a href=\"http://www.libertywritersnews.com/\">Liberty Writers News</a>, a two-person site operating out of a house in the San Francisco Bay Area, generates income of between $10,000 and $40,000 a month from banks of ads that run along the side and bottom of every story. </p> <p>Paris Wade and his partner Ben Goldman have mastered the art of getting traffic. The ability to write a clickbaity headline, toss in some user-generated video found on YouTube, and dash off a 400-word post in 15 to 30 minutes is a skill they don\u2019t teach in journalism school, says Wade, who graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in advertising. </p> <p>Three months after launching the site, Liberty Writers News gets up to 700,000 visitors a day, a number that has been doubling every month. Again, though, they owe nearly all of that growth to Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 95% of our traffic is coming from Facebook,\u201d Wade says. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LibertyWritersNews/\">Liberty Writers News page</a> has about 150,000 likes, but by sharing stories with other like-minded Facebook pages, they can extend their reach to as many as 7m or 8m viewers, he adds. </p> <p>They spend around $3,000 a month paying Facebook to promote the page. Once they started doing that, their traffic doubled, says Wade.</p> <p>They also end some stories with enthusiastic cries to \u201c*** Share this right now! Let\u2019s beat the liberal media to it. Share, share, share it all over Facebook.\u201d </p> <p>But what Facebook gives, it also takes away, Goldman adds. If one of their stories gets shared too quickly, Facebook assumes it is spam and throttles it for a period of time, which reduces the number of people who can see it in their news feed. That doesn\u2019t happen to mainstream sites such as the New York Times or Washington Post, he adds.</p> <p>Those sites feature a blue check mark on their Facebook pages, certifying they are authentic brands. That\u2019s one of the reasons the pair are talking to the press \u2013 to establish their credentials as a legitimate news organization so Facebook will stop throttling them. </p> <p>\u201cWe want that blue check mark,\u201d Wade says. </p> <p>The US presidential election will be over in less than three months. Regardless of the outcome, Trump fever is likely to subside, possibly leaving many of these sites without their biggest source of traffic. Goldman and Wade say they\u2019ll just transition to covering other news about politics or celebrities. \u201cPeople love stories about celebrities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even Alex the Macedonian publisher is not worried. \u201cI think my traffic will be fine if Trump doesn\u2019t win,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many haters on the net, and all of my audience hates Hillary.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Nigel Farage, the anti-EU British politician and former Ukip leader, will appear with Donald Trump at a rally on Wednesday, a week after the US presidential candidate branded himself \u201cMr Brexit\u201d and tapped one of the leading American supporters of Brexit to run his campaign.</p> <p>The Trump campaign confirmed that Farage would appear with Trump at an evening rally in Jackson, Mississippi, to tell US voters \u201cthe Brexit story\u201d of how he triumphed over the electoral odds.

Farage will describe the Republican\u2019s campaign as a similar crusade by grassroots activists against \u201cbig banks and global political insiders\u201d and how those who feel disaffected and disenfranchised can become involved in populist, rightwing politics. With Trump lagging in the polls, just as Brexit did prior to the vote on the referendum, Farage will also hearten supporters by insisting that they can prove pundits and oddsmakers wrong as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This message resonates with the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to reach out to blue collar voters who have become disillusioned with American politics, while also adding a unique flair to Trump\u2019s never staid campaign rallies.</p> <p>The event will mark the first meeting between Farage and Trump.</p> <p>Arron Banks, the businessman who backed Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign group associated with the UK Independence party (Ukip), tweeted that he would be meeting Trump over dinner and was looking forward to Farage\u2019s speech.</p> <p>The appointment last week of Stephen Bannon, former chairman of the Breitbart website, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/steve-bannon-profile-breitbart-trump-campaign-manager\">\u201cCEO\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign</a> has seen the example of the Brexit vote, which Breitbart enthusiastically advocated, rise to the fore in Trump\u2019s campaign narrative.</p> <p>Speaking to a local radio station before the joint rally, Farage urged Americans to \u201cgo out and fight\u201d against Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cI am going to say to people in this country that the circumstances, the similarities, the parallels between the people who voted Brexit and the people who could beat Clinton in a few weeks time here in America are uncanny,\u201d Farage told Super Talk Mississippi. \u201cIf they want things to change they have get up out of their chairs and go out and fight for it.

The remainder cover remote communities, most of which are dominated by Indigenous voters.</p> <p>The small population and large areas covered make these electorates unlike most seats contested in Australian elections. Incumbent MPs have traditionally benefited from a great deal of loyalty from their constituents, many of whom would have met the MP personally. A large proportion of the vote is cast in remote settlements and it can be difficult for parties to reach these voters.</p> <p>For most of the NT\u2019s political history Labor has dominated seats in remote areas, while the Country Liberal party dominated the cities. Marginal seats in Darwin have generally decided election results. The CLP held power from 1974 until 2001. Labor then held power for three terms until 2012.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s loss in 2012 was not a shock but it happened in a surprising way. It effectively held on in its Darwin marginal seats but suffered massive swings in remote electorates, losing a number of those seats to Indigenous CLP candidates.</p> <p>The new CLP government started the parliamentary term with a solid majority, holding 16 out of 25 seats, but has seen this margin steadily chipped away.</p> <p>Three Indigenous MPs left the CLP and formed a local branch of the Palmer United party. One of the three MPs later returned to the government, while the other two became independents. Two other MPs left the CLP in 2015, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/20/nt-government-loses-majority-speaker-kezia-purick-quits\">leaving the government short of a majority</a>.</p> <p>Some of these independents are retiring at the upcoming election but others are running for re-election, along with a large surge in other independent candidates.

Mills left the parliament in 2014 and the traditionally safe CLP seat was won easily in a byelection by Nathan Barrett.

Labor also performed particularly well in the NT at this year\u2019s federal election, gaining a swing of 7.4% after preferences.</p> <p>If these polls are accurate, we\u2019d expect to see the CLP lose numerous seats to Labor, and Labor would be likely to form government, ending four years of conservative rule in the territory.</p>",
  "<p>From my house overlooking Managua, the city at night looks like an amusement park \u2013 more Walt Disney fantasy than the capital of the poorest country in the American continent. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-nicaragua-trees-20150524-story.html\">Gigantic metal trees</a>, each studded with hundreds of colored lights have been installed all over town. A few might have been fine, but 130 of them in our small city are overwhelming and kitsch. </p> <p>This makeover is the work of our eccentric first lady and future vice-president, Rosario Murillo: her way of imprinting herself in our lives. </p> <p>Considering what is going on in Nicaragua, I often feel I am immersed in a twisted, magical-realist novel. Everything that was not supposed to happen again in my country is coming back. </p> <p>We are reliving all that I thought had been eradicated when we, the Sandinista rebels, entered Managua on 19 July 1979 and ended 45 years of Somoza dynasty. </p> <p>What hurts the most, is to see the past return in the figure of our old comrade-in-arms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-ortega\">Daniel Ortega</a>. He and his wife have carefully woven a sticky web to trap Nicaraguans in a net of illusory progress.</p> <p>Ortega ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990and in 2007, he ran for re-election. </p> <p>I campaigned against him, certain that if he was re-elected, he would stay in power at all costs. </p> <p>Friends tried to convince me Nicaragua was no longer the same. After experiencing 16 years of budding democracy, people would reject his authoritarian tendencies, they said. </p> <p>But Ortega \u2013 aided by his wife \u2013 managed to sell himself to the Nicaraguan people as a democratic revolutionary.</p> <p>Murillo designed a campaign that promised peace and love. She covered the John Lennon song Give Peace a Chance and used it with her own lyrics as a campaign theme. </p> <p>Ortega and Murillo made amends with the Catholic church, and \u2013 after 25 years of living together \u2013 they were married by Managua\u2019s cardinal and former nemesis, Miguel Obando y Bravo. </p> <p>Miraculously, the couple went from dangerous atheists to fervent Christians from one day to the next. The illusion worked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/08/1\">He got elected</a>. </p> <p>A hard-working, determined woman, with a quasi-superstitious belief in her mission as savior of the people, Murillo has been key in strengthening Ortega\u2019s hold on power. </p> <p>She defended her husband even when her daughter from her first marriage accused Ortega of sexually abusing her. Her loyalty paid off, and she obtained a great deal of power. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ortega set about exerting absolute control over state institutions such as the electoral council, the supreme court, the national assembly, the army and the police.</p> <p>Then he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-second-terms\">reformed the constitution</a> to allow for indefinite re-elections. Most recently, in a coup de grace to any semblance of democracy, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/nicaragua-opposition-daniel-ortega-presidential-election\">took away</a> the legal representation of the only opposition force capable of challenging him in the 2016 elections, which he then assigned to sycophants guaranteed to do his bidding. </p> <p> </p> <p>Ortega had already announced in a speech that he would not accept international observers for the 6 November elections. \u201cShameless,\u201d he called them, \u201cthey should observe their governments, not us.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Murillo began to appear more visibly in their political propaganda. While Ortega has not given one single press conference to the national media since 2007, every day at midday Murillo addresses the people on radio and TV, exalting the Christian, socialist and solidaristic nature of their political model.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/daniel-ortega-nicaraguan-sandinista-president-rosario-murillo\">Ortega named his running mate</a>: Rosario Murillo. </p> <p>The US and the European Union have expressed their concern, but Ortega has his anti-imperialist rhetoric at the ready and seems to relish the prospect of another round of defiance. For him, this is the second coming of the Sandinista revolution. </p> <p>So far, the Nicaraguan people have mostly been passive. Ortega and Murillo have used billions from Venezuela to give bonuses to state employees and farmers, to distribute roofing materials in poor neighborhoods and to finance a variety of social programs. </p> <p>Scared by the possibility of another bloody struggle, Nicaraguans have opted to take what they can and keep their opinions to themselves. </p> <p>Somoza had two sons to continue his dynasty, Ortega and Murillo have five sons and two daughters. </p> <p>Though they might feel very strong, we have seen this before. Nothing is for ever.</p>",

  "<p>Mainstream media companies have opened the door for digital upstarts because their obsession with ratings led them to fail their audiences by colluding with controversial politicians, according to the billionaire journalist behind the Vice website.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/24/top-gear-cast-change-perfect-storm-former-producer\">Top Gear cast change due to 'perfect storm', says former producer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shane Smith, the site\u2019s founder, said that traditional media companies have failed to connect with young audiences or cover the issues they were interested in, and even accused some of tacitly \u201ccolluding\u201d with notorious politicians to drive ratings.</p> <p>\u201cThe secret or our success can be traced to the day we changed our content. The business grew and the audience exploded and we made more money,\u201d he said, giving the annual MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh international TV festival. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>At an earlier press briefing, he had called out CNN\u2019s extensive coverage of Donald Trump as an example of the established media\u2019s failings. \u201cIf you look at Trump as an example: Trump gives you ratings. The whole collusion between CNN and Trump is a perfect example of what\u2019s wrong in media today.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Vice, founded by Smith as a \u201cpunk\u201d magazine in Montreal in 1994, has gradually become a global multimedia company after it expanded into edgy online video. Its success has attracted a string of blue-chip media investors, including Disney, which pumped $400m (\u00a3302m) into the company for an 18% stake, and it plans to launch a TV channel in the UK and 58 other countries later this year. </p> <p>But despite that success, Smith warned there would be an impending crisis in the media industry with consolidation among major players and an \u201cevisceration\u201d of digital businesses, who he said where struggling to make their business models work.</p> <p>\u201cNext year, you\u2019ve already seen huge consolidation this year, next year will be a fucking bloodbath,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are going to see a merger and acquisition frenzy of the last two or three big boys, buying the last two or three [digital] scale plays to say \u2018we\u2019ve got digital, we\u2019ve got mobile, we\u2019re smart.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Smith pointed to online rivals such as Buzzfeed and Vox, which have received $200m each in investment from NBC Universal, and Business Insider, which sold up to Axel Springer \u2013 owner of Europe\u2019s biggest-selling tabloid Bild, as examples of how many of the new breed of digital news media were finding it tough.</p> <p>He said Vice\u2019s success had come when the the website \u201cstopped being the hipster\u2019s bible\u201d and adopted a more mature journalistic approach with shows such as feminist writer Gloria Steinem\u2019s show Woman, the documentary series Gaycation and its Vice News operation.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is the growth of Vice, valuations and our traffic growth and everything, happened,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen we stopped talking about cocaine, supermodels and rare denim. When we started talking about the environment, women\u2019s issues, LGBT issues. Because our audience demanded it. </p> <p>\u201cBecause of that it changed everything. Everyone said young people don\u2019t care about news [and] they sure as hell don\u2019t care about international [news]. Bullshit. They care.

This is a huge white space.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s other backers include Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP, the MTV owner Viacom and Disney, whose $400m investment late last year provided Smith with a business valued at $4.5bn.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The move by Disney, which now owns an 18% stake directly and through its A+E Networks joint venture with Hearst, has heightened speculation that it will ultimately purchase the company.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point or another Time Warner tried to buy us, Fox tried to buy us, Viacom tried to buy us,\u201d Smith said. \u201cRecently we\u2019ve done a big deal with Disney. And besides Disney they\u2019ve all tried to give us haircuts on valuation, some have tried to censor us. They don\u2019t want to make Vice Disney, they want to give us autonomy. It makes sense for them and it makes sense for us.\u201d</p> <p>He warned that all media had a \u201cfear of Facebook\u201d which, along with Google, sucks up giant swaths of the digital advertising revenue that is the lifeblood of many media companies. There was also the spectre of Facebook \u201cchanging its algorithm\u201d, which would mean it effectively \u201cowned\u201d the media companies that had become too dependent on its giant global popularity to drive audiences to their content.</p> <p>\u201cI learned this two years ago which is why we moved into TV,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realised two years ago we had to get off the crack that is Facebook or at least somewhat mitigate it with some methadone [by expanding Vice on to multiple platforms].\u201d</p> <p>Smith has a penchant for happily fuelling speculation about the future of his company. He controls Vice holding super-voting shares, and says that the industry is at the peak level of valuations and could face a crash.</p> <p>\u201cI can stay independent. It is good for me, as a megalomaniac, I\u2019m set for life,\u201d he quipped. \u201cAs a chief executive I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders to do the best thing for the company. And it is something I wrestle with every day. Do I do something that is good for me and stay independent? Do I do something for the shareholders, and probably the company going forward, do I [continue to massively invest in the business] or do I take the risk of public markets?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The executive of the pharmaceutical company that hiked the prices of two dozen drugs, including EpiPen, received a 671% pay increase over the past nine years.</p> <p>Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, came under public scrutiny this week after reports that since acquiring rights to EpiPen in 2007, the company had implemented a series of gradual price increases inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in cost . During that same time, Bresch went from being Mylan\u2019s chief operating officer to president to chief executive and saw her pay rise $2,453,456 <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mylan-execs-gave-themselves-raises-they-hiked-epipen-prices-n636591?cid=sm_fb\">to $18,931,068</a>, a 671% increase. </p> <p>When Mylan first acquired Merck KGaA in 2007, Bresch oversaw the integration of its 400 products. Among those products was EpiPen, which is used to quickly deliver a proper dose of epinephrine to those suffering from anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is when an allergic reaction causes one\u2019s airways to swell and close. In <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/11/mylan-ceo-heather-bresch/\">a 2015 interview</a> with Fortune, Bresch described EpiPen as \u201cmy baby\u201d. Under her management, EpiPen went from bringing in $200m a year in sales to becoming Mylan\u2019s first billion-dollar product.</p> <p>Following the outcry over the increase in EpiPen\u2019s prices, Bresch, who is the daughter of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, could be called on to justify Mylan\u2019s pricing before the US Congress. Her father does not sit on the Senate judiciary committee, which would most likely hear her testimony. </p> <p>Mylan has hiked prices of other products as well, according to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/mylan-shares-slide-after-analysts-raise-concerns-over-pricing-strategies.html\">a June report</a> by a Wells Fargo senior analyst David Maris.</p> <p>\u201cMylan has raised the prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/epipen-maker-also-hiked-prices-slew-other-medications-n636981\">he wrote</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the products whose prices were hiked over the past six months were: </p> <ul> <li>Ursodiol, a drug used to treat gallstones, saw its price increase by 542%</li> <li>Dicyclomine, a drug used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, saw its price increase by 400%<br></li> <li>Tolterodine, a drug used to treat overactive bladders, saw its price increase by 56% <br></li> </ul> <p>The Guardian has reached out to Mylan to confirm these hikes. </p> <p>In his report, Maris noted that the price hikes could draw \u201cgreater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cMylan\u2019s business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes,\u201d Nina Devlin, Mylan\u2019s spokeswoman, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/mylan-shares-slide-after-analysts-raise-concerns-over-pricing-strategies.html\">said in June</a>. She described Maris\u2019s analysis as \u201cflawed\u201d and said it focused on a small selection of the company\u2019s 1,400-plus products. </p> <p>The fact that EpiPen is a household item for those suffering from severe allergies is perhaps why this price increase is drawing so much public ire.</p> <p>\u201cOne reason I think the EpiPen situation is getting so much attention compared to other cases is a lot of the high-cost drugs are used by patients who are very sick, cancer patients, multiple sclerosis. These are patients that actually don\u2019t end up paying a lot of these costs out of pocket because they hit their out of pocket maximums and deductibles pretty quickly,\u201d explained David H Howard, a health economist at the department of health policy and management at Emory University. </p> <p>\u201cBut for EpiPen, a lot of people who are using this, or might use it, are pretty healthy. They don\u2019t have a lot of other health conditions or health needs so this is their major expense and they end up paying for a lot of of it out their own pocket,\u201d Howard told the Guardian. </p> <p>Since the price hike was reported, a number of lawmakers have called on the company to make its products affordable.</p> <p>\u201cDue to Mylan\u2019s virtual monopoly of the epinephrine auto-injector market and its unique life-saving attribute, it is crucial that your product remains affordable for all Americans,\u201d Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal<a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-demands-mylan-lower-price-for-life-saving-epipen\">wrote in a letter</a> to Mylan. \u201cTherefore, I demand that Mylan take immediate action to lower the price of EpiPens for all Americans that rely on this product for their health and safety.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton put out a statement on Wednesday calling on Mylan to reduce the price of EpiPen, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2016/08/23/mylan-in-epipen-controversy-shades-of-valeant/\">According to Citigroup analysts</a> Liav Abraham and Eugene Kim, there is \u201clittle regulatory action that can be implemented to compel Mylan to lower the price of EpiPen\u201d. However, increased scrutiny and an appearance before the Senate judiciary committee could lead to \u201cself-regulation\u201d, they wrote in a note to investors.

  "<p>Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s health has been under scrutiny in recent weeks, not by medical professionals but by politicians and supposed pundits playing doctor on TV. Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>What is different is that Trump gushes conspiracy theories like a fire hose. He was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/donald-trump-birther-obama.html\">one of the most vocal birthers</a>, those who claimed Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim and thus ineligible to hold office (that was untrue). Trump later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/\">claimed</a> that Clinton started the birther movement, not he. He t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">weeted</a>: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3uAp2ep3w\">said</a> \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks, implying they were Muslims. He <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/\">tweeted an allegation</a> that 81% of white homicide victims are killed by blacks. And he <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/09/16/donald_trump_suggested_vaccines_cause_autism_during_the_cnn_gop_debate_he.html\">suggested</a> that vaccines cause autism. The list goes on. None of these assertions are true.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if Trump is reading from a textbook on how to invent and disseminate conspiracy theories. First, target those who feel most alienated and disempowered. Then, identify a complex social or political threat to control, which might include stagnant wages, demographic changes or terrorism. Next, identify an outsider group such as China, Latino immigrants, blacks or Muslims who you can blame. Then tell a simple, black-and-white story of conflict between good versus evil, us versus the other. Finally, say the system is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">rigged</a>\u201d by the mainstream media or the elite.</p> <p>Trump is riding a rising tide of alienation and disempowerment, most notably among working class white men. They\u2019re his strongest supporters because uncertainty, anxiety and powerlessness <a href=\"http://www.michaelshermer.com/the-believing-brain/\">drive the need to reassert control</a>. It\u2019s also perhaps why those with a more <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/01/27/donald-trump-is-attracting-authoritarian-primary-voters-and-it-may-help-him-to-gain-the-nomination/\">authoritarian</a> bent tend to favor Trump.</p> <p>Trump shares a certain worldview with his supporters, but he\u2019s also a brilliant psychologist. It should come as no surprise that he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0\">loves the poorly educated</a>\u201d. They\u2019re most likely to buy into his conspiracy theories, and not because they\u2019re stupid. Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12084/abstract\">having less education</a> \u2013 not sex, race, ideology or knowledge \u2013 is the most reliable predictor of whether someone will believe a conspiracy theory. Education not only arms us with facts but also teaches us how to think <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265608142_Analytic_thinking_reduces_belief_in_conspiracy_theories\">analytically</a> (methodically and scientifically) not just intuitively (from the gut).</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p>",

The stars and bars have shown up on supporters\u2019 T-shirts, on hats sold by vendors outside in the parking lot, or waved during the rallies. </p> <p>All of which is doubly problematic in Mississippi. It\u2019s the only state in the country that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/mississippi-state-flag-confederate-symbol\">reproduces the confederate flag on its official state flag</a>, still waving over the capitol on High Street despite numerous protests. All politics in Mississippi unfolds in the shadow of the state\u2019s fraught race relations; it\u2019s a fragile and poverty-stricken place, in recovery at best. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s support among black voters has polled <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-african-american-vote-227218\">as low as 0%</a>. The last time he visited Mississippi, a pastor stood on the statehouse steps and addressed a crowd of black protesters, calling Trump one of the \u201cDukes of Hazzard\u201d, a reference to the television characters who sported a confederate battle flag on their muscle car.</p> <p>Mississippi has a higher percentage of black residents than any other state, at almost 40%. Trump\u2019s audience will be almost entirely white, though. The reason may be as obvious as Trump\u2019s campaign slogan itself: \u201cmake America great again\u201d. For black people in Mississippi, the golden era that sentiment harkens to was a time of strife, oppression and violence.</p> <p>A better move for Trump, Barbour said, would be to meet with black small-business owners while he\u2019s in Mississippi. \u201cWe have lots of great opportunities here,\u201d Barbour said. That is, Trump\u2019s support has nowhere to go but up, if he\u2019s willing to reach out beyond his base.</p> <p>But Barbour\u2019s Democratic counterpart, Bobby Moak, chuckled at the thought. \u201cNo, no, no, there\u2019s been no talk of that,\u201d he said. Moak was the longtime chair of the House Democratic caucus until earlier this year. \u201cThe rally here is something of an afterthought.\u201d</p> <p>The true reason to visit Mississippi, Moak said, is funding. \u201cOur governor told Trump he could raise a lot of money,\u201d Moak said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p> <p>Mississippi is a small state, Moak said, but the population only has one candidate to give its money to: Trump. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s at least seven figures,\u201d Moak said. \u201cOtherwise he wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new about candidates dipping into friendly states to pick up campaign funds. This summer, Hillary Clinton has spent time in California and north-eastern states, raising money in places where she enjoys a comfortable lead. </p> <p>But unlike Clinton, Trump supports his campaign with a self-described <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280239-trump-claims-net-worth-of-more-than-10-billion-in-new\">$10bn fortune</a>, his campaign has been tumbling in polls for weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">he has</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-out\">reshuffled his staff</a> including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">his campaign chair</a>. More specifically, Clinton has used her blue-state visits to drum up money which she then spends in other states. But Trump is spending money as he goes: renting out the 10,000-seat <a href=\"https://www.mdac.ms.gov/bureaus-departments/state-fair-commission/mississippi-coliseum/\">Mississippi coliseum</a> for the rally, for instance.</p> <p>\u201cI think he got some pushback from Republicans here who can\u2019t afford the $1,000 dinner,\u201d Moak said. \u201cThey said: \u2018If he\u2019s coming here, we want to see the Donald.\u2019 So he\u2019s putting on the rally.\u201d</p> <p>There are other costs. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9 \">jet alone</a> burns through $10,000 an hour, adding up to nearly a half-million dollars just in July. All of which means that either Moak\u2019s estimate may be well below the mark, or Trump is managing his campaign funds in a way Barbour, the Republican, called \u201cunconventional\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him do the traditional, raise money in Texas then quickly turn around and use it at a rally in Colorado. Or raise money here in Mississippi then jump over to the Florida panhandle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not interested in the way Reagan did things, or Romney did things.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Environmental groups have turned on the Obama administration over offshore oil and gas extraction, warning it puts whales and dolphins in peril and risks undermining the president\u2019s commitment to putting the brakes on climate change.<br></p> <p>Barack Obama, who recently called global warming an \u201cgenuine existential threat\u201d, has enjoyed largely solid support from green groups that have praised his leadership on the issue. But Obama\u2019s environmentalist allies are increasingly frustrated over federally approved fossil fuel drilling, just as the US president attempts to put the finishing touches on his climate legacy. </p> <p>On Wednesday, leases for oil and gas exploration across 23.8m acres of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned off to fossil fuel companies. A total of 218.94m acres, about double the size of California, will have been offered up for leases in federal waters <a href=\"http://www.boem.gov/Five-Year-Program-2012-2017/\">by the end of next year</a>, with further leasing planned by the government in a new five-year program that <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-next-step-offshore-oil-and-gas-leasing-planning-process\">will extend this process</a>.</p> <p>In response, protesters stormed the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s office in New Orleans on Tuesday, demanding the cancellation of the lease sales because of the link between climate change and the kind of flooding that has devastated large parts of Louisiana. Several protesters were arrested. </p> <p>\u201cWhile climate change affects everyone, communities of color and low-income communities continue to be hit hardest by the lasting impacts of climate disasters,\u201d said Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.</p> <p>\u201cThousands of oil spills, sinking lands and extreme weather creating turmoil for countless people. What more will convince the Obama administration to stop treating the Gulf like a sacrifice zone to fossil fuel interests?\u201d</p> <p>Another green group, the Center for Biological Diversity, is also ramping up its opposition to offshore drilling, <a href=\"http://biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/CriticalGulf_08-2016.pdf\">releasing a report</a> that found that burning all of the fossil fuels in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico would release a staggering 32.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p> <p>The group claimed that expanding drilling in the gulf is contrary to America\u2019s pledge to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">keep global temperatures to 1.5C</a> above pre-industrial times and risks unleashing more extreme weather, drought and sea level rise upon swathes of the US. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t address climate change while expanding drilling the gulf. This report shows that new oil and gas leasing in the gulf would be a carbon bomb that will deepen our climate crisis,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, oceans attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cPresident Obama needs to align his energy and climate policies before leaving office, starting in the gulf.\u201d</p> <p>In March, activists <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/gulf-coast-residents-crash-oil-lease-auction-chanting-shut-it-down-14679758e1ad#.vlk9d8ab0\">disrupted a lease sale in New Orleans</a>, chanting \u201cshut it down\u201d and brandishing banners in front of bidding companies. The action didn\u2019t disrupt the process, however, with BOEM now overseeing around 4,400 active leases in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Conservationists are also fretting over the impact of oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. While the federal government has ruled out any drilling off the eastern seaboard in the immediate future, seismic airgun blasting is still being pursued by companies in waters stretching from Delaware to Florida.</p> <p>Research from Duke University\u2019s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab has been released as <a href=\"https://oceana.widencollective.com/c/zzdkabnk\">animated maps by green group Oceana</a>, showing that bottlenose dolphins, fin, humpback and sperm whales are all present in areas deemed suitable for the airgun testing.</p> <p><strong></strong>A number of <a href=\"http://usa.oceana.org/sites/default/files/75_marine_scientist_letter-_seismic.pdf\">leading marine scientists have warned</a> that airgun testing, where air is fired at the seabed to determine if oil or gas deposits reside there, can be extremely harmful to the ability of whales and dolphins to communicate with each other or find food. The Obama administration has been pressured to end the practice.</p> <p>\u201cThese maps confirm what we\u2019ve long feared, that dolphins and whales along the east coast are at risk from dangerous seismic airgun blasting for oil and gas,\u201d said Claire Douglass, campaign director at Oceana. </p> <p>\u201cHearing that whales and dolphins could be injured is one thing, but seeing the scale of the threat is another. President Obama should stop seismic airgun blasting and protect our coast.\u201d </p> <p>But fossil fuel companies have warned against any winding down of offshore drilling, claiming that it creates jobs and helps the US become less dependent on energy sources from other countries.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are going to continue to drive investment in America, create jobs, and provide affordable energy, we must look to the future,\u201d said said Louis Finkel, executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, which supports a US \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d by drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>This stance has been embraced by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has an <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/an-america-first-energy-plan\">\u201cAmerica first\u201d energy policy</a> that would drastically ramp up domestic coal, oil and gas production.

  "<p>As the polls stand, Owen Smith may have little prospect of becoming Labour leader, but in the unlikely event that he does, he has cast himself, as of today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/owen-smith-labour-should-continue-to-fight-brexit\" title=\"\">as the flag-carrier for a reconsideration of Brexit</a> in the form of a second referendum or a general election. The voters, he says, should have the final say.</p> <p>Smith is not, of course, the first to call for another referendum: such calls have been two-a-penny since 23 June, and a second referendum is a favourite mechanism among those who regret the result.

But his call for another vote muddies a lot of waters. The decision to invoke that famous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court\" title=\"\">article 50</a> and start the clock on the UK\u2019s departure is receding ever further away.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s central argument is that people did not know what they were voting for when they supported leave, and should have the final say when the terms of the divorce are clear. That is as patronising as it is self-serving. Some Brexiters may have regretted their vote \u2013 as perhaps did some of their shocked leaders. But the people have voted. The majority, if small, was clear. We ridiculed the Irish for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/04/ireland-votes-yes-lisbon-treaty\" title=\"\">holding a second referendum</a> to \u201cget it right\u201d the second time around. UK voters knew exactly what they were voting for. If our democracy is worth anything, that vote must stand.</p> <p>The delay in invoking article 50 already threatens damaging uncertainty, both in UK politics and in our relations with the rest of the EU. Angela Merkel has been more indulgent than most of the prime minister\u2019s desire not to act with haste. But even her patience has its limits, not least because both she and the French president face elections next year. If Brexit is indeed to mean Brexit, then the date needs to be fixed with some dispatch. The precise terms may indeed be subject to negotiation, but the fact of departure is not among them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Brexit means Brexit \u2026 but the big question is when?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second referendum proposal is no more than wishful thinking on the part of thwarted remainers.

When Donald Trump was mostly self-financing his campaign, the office space cost one thing. When Trump began accepting more donations from the public, the price quintupled, the Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-rent_us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March. </p> <p>The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March \u2015 the same amount it had been paying since last summer \u2015 and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/768049003841871872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like Trump U, Trump campaign is a scam.

(Manning also writes for the Guardian.)</p> <p>The leak included a video of an American Apache helicopter gunning down a group of Iraqis, including several journalists, which became known as the \u201ccollateral murder\u201d video. But the site, and its founder Julian Assange, have long faced scrutiny for their own collateral damage.</p> <p>In 2010, Amnesty International, along with the Open Society Institute and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2010309,00.html\">signed an open letter</a> criticizing the organization for its decision not to redact the names of Afghan civilians in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/10/afghanistan-war-logs-wikileaks-human-rights-groups\">Manning leaks</a> \u2013 a decision which showed what the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders described as \u201cincredible irresponsibility\u201d.</p> <p>More recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/dnc-emails-wikileaks-hillary-bernie-sanders\">leaked material from the Democratic National Committee</a> published in July carried more than two dozen social security and credit card numbers, according to an Associated Press analysis that was assisted by New Hampshire-based compliance firm DataGravity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38502cb32e01c4cbab4b59f5ffae724348f3ddef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38502cb32e01c4cbab4b59f5ffae724348f3ddef/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange addresses the media in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange addresses the media in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two of the people named in the files told the Associated Press they were targeted by identity thieves following the leak.

The Saudi diplomatic cables alone hold at least 124 medical files, according to a sample analyzed by the Associated Press. Some described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with politics or corruption,\u201d said Dr Nayef al-Fayez, a consultant in the Jordanian capital of Amman who confirmed that a brain cancer patient of his was among those whose details were published to the web. </p> <p>Dr Adnan Salhab, a retired practitioner in Jordan who also had a patient named in the files, expressed anger when shown the document. \u201cThis is illegal what has happened,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt is illegal!\u201d</p> <p>The Associated Press, which is withholding identifying details of most of those affected, reached 23 people, most in Saudi Arabia, whose personal information was exposed. Some were unaware their data had been published because WikiLeaks is censored in the country. Others shrugged at the news, and some were horrified.</p> <p>A partially disabled Saudi woman who\u2019d secretly gone into debt to support a sick relative said she was devastated. She\u2019d kept her plight from members of her own family. \u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d she said in a phone call. \u201cWhat if my brothers, neighbors, people I know or even don\u2019t know have seen it?
