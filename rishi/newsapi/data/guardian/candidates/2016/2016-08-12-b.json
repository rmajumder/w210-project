  "<p>On Friday afternoon, American shooter Kim Rhode held her bronze. It was her sixth medal won across six Olympics on four continents, and she could feel the tears stinging her eyes. In front of her fluttered the US flag, confirmation she is now the first woman to win medals in six straight summer Olympics - her first was a gold back in 1996. Behind her fluttered an Olympic flag at half-mast to honor a Brazilian soldier killed in another spate of Rio gun violence. And those two worlds are forever complicating one of the US\u2019s most-accomplished athletes.</p> <p>She is a star shooter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio2016-top-american-olympic-shooter-kim-rhode-attacks-gun-control-laws\">a devoted gun advocate</a>. These facets have become an inseparable part of her identity. Once, her medal celebrations were about her performance on the mat. But in a post-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\">Newtown</a>, post-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting\">Aurora</a> America, her Olympics are about the gun she fears is being pulled from her hand</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio2016-top-american-olympic-shooter-kim-rhode-attacks-gun-control-laws\">Rio 2016: top American Olympic shooter Kim Rhode attacks gun control laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so on the day she made history she was talking politics in a tent 6,000 miles away from her Southern California home.</p> <p>\u201cWell I think it kind of says it for itself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely Trump! He\u2019s very much for the Second Amendment.\u201d</p> <p>Soon there came more questions ...</p> <p><em>Do you support Trump solely because of guns?</em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a list of things yes, it\u2019s not just one thing but you have to take a candidate in all. But definitely Second Amendment is a big one for me, being that\u2019s how I make my livelihood and something that is so passionate and important for me and my family for generations. Heck, I had family that was one of the 25 hand-picked men that was picked to go in and <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/indians-defeat-custer-at-little-big-horn\">save Custer and Custer\u2019s battlefield</a>.\u201d</p> <p><em>But as a female athlete who just made Olympic history wouldn\u2019t you want a woman president?</em></p> <p>\u201cYou know I mean definitely having a [female] president would be incredible just not Hillary,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Then Rhode laughed. Somehow the afternoon had gotten so far from the medal that she still wore around her neck. She speaks about guns with such calm and conviction, inviting questions with a hearty welcoming smile, she almost lures outsiders into a friendly debate. She does not complain that her Olympic press conferences have turned into discussions on gun control; she seems to like to use them as a way of <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/11/kim-rhode-olympic-shooter-takes-aim-us-gun-laws/\">advocating against laws she finds intrusive</a>.</p> <p>She also startled a French reporter when she told him that she has her three-year-old son in a youth programs with the National Rifle Association. \u201cI\u2019m covering all the bases,\u201d she said in terms of introducing him to guns.</p> <p>Getting to that press conference was not a certainty, however. Her medal was not assured. Unlike some Olympic sports, shooting can be an unpredictable event where factors like sun, wind and temperature can affect competitors. Her field was filled with talented shooters, and there was little room for imperfection. The shooting centre is located in a barren, hilly region on Rio\u2019s west side. On Friday a steady breeze taunted the shooters who also struggled to spot the discs against the distant hills. As the sun moved in and out of clouds, some of the shooters changed the filters in their glasses hoping to better see the targets.</p> <p>Rhode told herself to \u201ckeep aiming for the front\u201d of the discs, and she hit enough to find herself in a tie for third with Wei Meng of China. Personal Jesus and Smooth Criminal played softly on the loudspeakers as the two women battled. Rhode said she did not hear the songs: she was too locked in on her task. Throughout the afternoon she said she constantly thought about the sixth Olympic medal that she desperately wanted. Her history is such a part of her identity that her personal email even has a \u201c5x\u201d in it \u2013 a reference to her five straight medals before Friday.</p> <p>For a while Rhode and Wei were locked in a tight battle, neither woman giving in. She said she tried to listen to the crowd in the stands behind her cheering every hit and going \u201cooooohhhhhhh,\u201d when she missed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they are helping you to pull the trigger every time out there,\u201d she said. Finally she pulled away by one hit. When it was over and history had been made she smiled. She waved to the crowd, found her son and tears formed in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cStanding up there on that podium it\u2019s addicting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has me coming back again and again. Every emotion hits you at once. You want to run, scream, cry and you just don\u2019t know which one to do first and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a gold, silver, bronze it\u2019s the journey. My journey was a long one this time and I got a little emotional. I\u2019m still emotional and it\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Then soldiers from both the US and Italy brought the flags and they were raised and the medal became official. And the woman who made history for America walked toward an interview tent where she would wade once more into the gun debate, and endorse for president a man who has made her homeland a very divided place.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton added yet another first to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on Friday, becoming the first presidential candidate to have a campaign <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/page/podcast/\">podcast</a>.</p> <p>The first episode of the free audio broadcast, titled With Her, is a conversation between Clinton and <a href=\"https://longform.org/about\">Longform cofounder</a> Max Linsky, though it won\u2019t always feature the candidate herself. Future episodes will include interviews with other higher-ups in the campaign and, the podcasters hope, some staffers and even volunteers out in the states. The next episode, with a \u201cvery important\u201d campaign staffer, is tentatively scheduled to tape next week.</p> <p>Don\u2019t look for that next episode next Friday, though. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of bucking one of the traditional rules of podcasting, which is that you come out at the same time every week,\u201d said Linsky. \u201cBut with a presidential campaign, that\u2019s not always possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-tax-returns\">Hillary Clinton releases 2015 tax return and Tim Kaine unveils 10 years' worth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s is the first podcast launched by startup Pineapple Street Media, a collaboration between Linsky and longtime public radio producer and recent BuzzFeed podcaster Jenna Weiss-Berman that only opened in May 2016. </p> <p>Linsky and Weiss-Berman are both supporters of Clinton \u2013 Linsky told the Guardian she was \u201ca big fan\u201d and Weiss-Berman said: \u201cI really like Hillary Clinton and want her to win\u201d \u2013 but the podcast isn\u2019t a labor of love. It\u2019s produced for and with the campaign, which had been considering doing a podcast for nearly a year before Weiss-Berman approached them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not journalism, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true,\u201d said Linsky \u2013 possibly in response to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/hillary_clinton_s_podcast_with_her_is_charming_gutless_propaganda.html\">criticisms</a> that the podcast was more like an advertisement for Clinton\u2019s candidacy than a more critical exploration of it. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get a sense of what it really feels like to run for president, in every sense.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Olin, who consults with the Clinton digital team and was the social media director for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, says that using social media is an important way for candidates not just to connect with potential voters but to activate supporters to donate money \u2013 especially in small dollar donations \u2013 and eventually make phone calls and knock on doors.</p> <p>\u201cThe way to get people engaged and interested and then take small actions on behalf of the campaign is to build relationships with people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you have to go to where they are, and connect with them on that level.\u201d</p> <p>For the 2012 campaign, which pioneered the use of Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and even Spotify to connect directly with voters, Olin said organizers had to be very strategic in which social media they chose to use, because there were only 14 staffers involved in the effort. \u201cIt was looking at the demographics of each platform, and how it would reach the target audiences for the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPodcasts have huge young audiences, and it\u2019s pretty important to the campaign, I think, for young people to hear from her as much as possible, so we\u2019re psyched that we can help with that,\u201d Weiss-Berman said.</p> <p>Still, only 21% of Americans 12 and over have listened to a podcast in the last year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/podcasting-fact-sheet/\">according</a> to Edison Research, and only about half of Americans of those ages have even heard of podcasting. Weiss-Berman is right about her audience, though: 35% of Americans aged 18-34 are podcast consumers, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Podcast-Consumer-2015-Final.pdf\">according to 2015 Edison data</a>. And, like likely <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/2-voter-general-election-preferences/\">Clinton</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-12/education-level-sharply-divides-clinton-trump-race\">voters</a>, podcast consumers tend to be wealthy compared to the population at large and are more likely to have college or graduate degrees.</p> <p>Clinton is frequently criticized for failing to connect emotionally with large audiences \u2013 despite the fact that friends and staffers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality\">describe her</a> as warm and a great listener. Supporters hope the podcast can help bridge the gap between the woman that people find so personable one-on-one and the politician who manages to rub a lot of people the wrong way onstage.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I was so excited about with this show, I feel like podcasts are such an intimate medium,\u201d said Weiss-Berman. \u201cIt was a great way to let people in on this intimate conversation [between Clinton and Linsky].\u201d<br></p> <p>Olin said: \u201cPart of the digital team\u2019s job is to show that [personal] side of her ... It\u2019s a bit of a longitudinal look at what it really takes to run for the most difficult job in the world.\u201d</p>",

But look at the woman next to him, apparently his wife. She smiles and then she laughs, a kind of \u201cOoh, you are awful\u201d chuckle.</p> <p>It helps Trump, this reaction. It enables him to step back from the brink,&#xa0;to say he was only joking. So last&#xa0;month he&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\" title=\"\">urged Vladimir Putin to&#xa0;hack Clinton\u2019s emails</a>, before insisting&#xa0;that he was just&#xa0;kidding.</p> <p>Often he blames the media \u2013 for reporting what he said and for being stupid enough to presume he meant it.

But that relies&#xa0;on the politician implicitly accepting the usual rules of the game, which Trump does not. As Britons know&#xa0;well from bitter and recent experience \u2013 after the pro-Brexit camp cut through with the utterly bogus claim&#xa0;that Britain sent \u00a3350m a week to the EU \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\" title=\"\">willingness to lie</a> can be a powerful asset. Trump enjoys a kind of freedom that his more conventional opponents lack. They have at least one hand tied behind their back, feeling an obligation to stick as closely as possible to the truth. Trump is&#xa0;unbound.</p> <p>Which brings us to a sensitive point. Tony Schwartz, who as Trump\u2019s ghostwriter had intimate and daily access to Trump over 18 months in the&#xa0;1980s, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\" title=\"\">witnessed the constant lies</a>, the tiny attention span and inability to&#xa0;concentrate, the intense egotism \u2013 and concluded that Trump was \u201cpathologically impulsive and self-centred\u201d. In short, a&#xa0;\u201csociopath\u201d.</p> <p>The dean of Harvard Medical School has said Trump does not just have narcissistic personality disorder, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jflier/status/759466280504193026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" title=\"\">he defines it</a>\u201d. Indeed this view has become&#xa0;so widespread that the American Psychiatric Association felt compelled to remind its members this week&#xa0;of the Goldwater rule \u2013 named after an earlier Republican presidential nominee routinely branded as unhinged&#xa0;\u2013 which urges practitioners <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/07/the-american-psychiatric-association-reminds-its-doctors-no-psychoanalyzing-donald-trump/?postshare=7811470690296455&amp;tid=ss_tw\" title=\"\">not to offer a&#xa0;diagnosis of an individual they have not treated</a>.</p> <p>The point is, someone who fits what we might politely call Trump\u2019s psychological profile \u2013 someone as disinhibited, as willing to disregard social norms \u2013 is perilously difficult to confront. But there might just be a way.</p> <p>For why was it that not just the liberal&#xa0;usual suspects, but almost all his&#xa0;fellow Republicans denounced Trump for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\" title=\"\">attacking Khizr and Ghazala Khan</a>, the Gold Star parents of Capt Humayun Khan, the Muslim-American killed while fighting for his country in 2004? The answer is the same one that explains the bipartisan outrage that greeted Trump\u2019s suggestion that Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be objective in deciding a case involving Trump because of his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\" title=\"\">Mexican heritage</a>\u201d \u2013 even though Curiel was born in Indiana.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a time when a single deception could ruin a politician. But Trump doesn't play by the usual rules</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Trump had done was violate a core American ideal: the notion \u2013 not always honoured, admittedly \u2013 that no matter where your family came from, if you were born in the US or had come there and subscribed to its founding principles, then you were as American as a direct descendant of those who landed on Plymouth Rock. This was what set the US apart, the belief that national identity did not reside in blood or soil, but in loyalty to the nation\u2019s constitution and its bill of rights.</p> <p>Or consider Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US; it was again attacked by Republicans as well as Democrats because it contradicts America\u2019s founding purpose, to be a haven from religious persecution, a purpose encapsulated in the constitution\u2019s first amendment guaranteeing the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of religion. Or reflect on Trump\u2019s little joke this week, suggesting the way to deal with Clinton might be a bullet \u2013 at odds with America\u2019s professed determination to resolve its differences through a constitution, the law and elections.</p> <p>The common thread is that all these moves by Trump are not just reactionary or bigoted or dangerous. They contradict the ideals that all Americans are meant to regard as sacred. Perhaps this is the way to attack Trump: as truly un-American. He says he wants to make America great again.

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019.

Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We suspect that at least some of this hesitancy, and possibly some of the prior weakness too, was due to fears over a \u2018leave\u2019 vote in the referendum on 23 June. The forthcoming figures are for June, early estimates of which were published by the ONS at the time of last week\u2019s GDP data. These suggested that the sector shrank by 1.0% over the month following a (revised) decline of 1.5% in May. </p> <p>Of course the main interest will be in the economic data for all sectors for July onwards, following the result of the referendum. In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July. This would tend to suggest that output in the sector declined at a faster pace than before the referendum, with a possibility that the economy as a whole has begun to contract as well. </p> </blockquote> <p>In China, industrial production rose by 6% in July, down from 6.2% growth in June, but markets seem less concerned about the slowdown in China than they were at the beginning of the year.

Clearly it was a story that needed to be told, plus she had funding to go to the DRC, which obviously helped.</p> <p>We spoke and emailed frequently over the following months as she visited the DRC to do the main part of her reporting, talking to the little girls and their families, to doctors, and to investigators about the corruption they were up against.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/kavumu-village-39-young-girls-raped-justice-drc\">The village where dozens of girls have been raped is still waiting for justice | Lauren Wolfe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Traumatic as the story was to report, it became even more stressful for Lauren once she was back in the US, as she tried to establish what she could make public without endangering her sources.

The following morning, at 3am New York time, she received an email, saying the suspects were under arrest.</p> <p>The challenge in editing a piece like this is to pull together a mass of reporting and try to hammer a confusing set of events into a coherent, chronological narrative that reads like a detective story but brings out the humanity of the victims, and gives the reader a powerful sense of what it is like to be on the ground, trying to stop these horrendous crimes against a wall of indifference.</p> <p>The piece we finally produced was a harrowing read, but the heartfelt response on Twitter immediately reinforced our view that it was a story that had to be told.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ada0fae4b0f231200da2ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T14:45:02.113Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weird internet throwback of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You\u2019ll see lots of people complaining on social media about restrictions around covering the Olympics this year.

It's time for a blockbuster face-lift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I feel a certain misunderstanding here. Con Air is a perfectly fun film, but it\u2019s not high art. What separates it from a film like Suicide Squad is that it is an unabashed B-movie. Outside of the work of Vin Diesel, Hollywood doesn\u2019t make low-brow, silly action fare any more. Nicolas Cage is partly to blame for this, as his turn in The Rock started the trend of celebrated actors taking on schlock parts to class up a genre film. Now, Michael Fassbender can star in a video game adaptation. The blurring of the line between high and low art has rendered everything an amorphous mass of bland mush.

And thus it is that just as his enemies are busy cheming and plotting to bring him down by fair means or foul as I type, Corbyn himself, Milne, McDonnell and his other allies are resorting to the same kind of dirty politics to stymie them.</p> <p>Politics at that level is a cruel and dangerous shark-infested environment (seeing as we're on the subject), and one would have to be naive to think that Corbyn is somehow managing to keep his nose clean and play fair.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/aug/12/guardian-social-a-live-look-at-the-weeks-news-from-trotsky-to-grilled-cheese#comment-81045343\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15229804\" title=\"View Tim Atkinson\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/15229804\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Tim Atkinson\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15229804\" title=\"View Tim Atkinson\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Tim Atkinson</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81045343\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">12 August 2016 1:46pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Say what you want, I haven't seen him raise an insult against anyone since he became leader. That's kinder and gentler than most other MPs. Whether that means he shouldn't be bitter towards certain people, I don't know; kindness and grudges are not necessarily a disagreement, and I think we all know kind people who have their reasons for not wishing to be around certain other people.</p> <p>Honestly, ask yourself, would you give time to certain members of your Cabinet if you were him. Knowing that they had briefed against you, deliberately undermined you and were half-openly planning to replace you.

Last week writer Kyle Chayka explored this phenomenon in an essay in <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification\">the Verge</a>, describing the way tech-led travel is homogenising what we consider to be the desirable hallmarks of any given destination. \u201cEverywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of looking the same, whether it\u2019s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up piece for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world\">the Guardian</a>, describing its key features as \u201creclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting\u201d.</p> <p>Chayka dubs this style \u201cAirspace\u201d. Its function? Making a particularly elite demographic of global travellers feel comfortable and at home as they skip from city to city booking apartments on Airbnb, checking into the local co-working hub and meeting up with fellow \u201cdigital nomads\u201d for an ideas jam (or whatever) at the nearest coffee joint. </p> <p>It\u2019s a subject I\u2019ve thought about a lot in the past, travelling to different cities for Guardian Travel. While Chayka focuses on the aesthetic of Airspace and the way it has been driven by a group of people who \u201cmove through spaces linked by technology\u201d, I\u2019ve always thought more about how the people themselves could be defined. \u201cHipsters\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to cut it, nor are these simply the \u201cupper classes\u201d. I think it goes beyond the Silicon Valley kids too. A particular class is emerging in the world who aren\u2019t bound by location, and places \u2013 particularly cities \u2013 are evolving rapidly to accommodate them and their collective tastes. Airspace is a good first step in opening up a critical discussion about who these people are.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9aede4b0fe7550975118\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T11:40:52.380Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are Corbyn supporters delusional?

They really need to sit down and reflect on why they are losing voters, and not just since Corbyn. Scotland and the north are abandoning Labour in droves, not because of Corbyn but because of how Labour has acted prior to this. Pretty much the entirety of Labour in Scotland being wiped out was because of his predecessors, not him.</p> <p>This coup has done nothing positive.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Robin Wilde</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know a couple of decent Corbynites.

Now I don\u2019t know if the two cooks know each other, but assuming they don\u2019t, the comparison is instructive. Reichl and Oglethorpe both plump for sourdough, cheddar and alliums, all in large quantities (thick slices of bread, mountains of grated cheese, and a medley of different coloured onions, garlic and leek, very finely chopped). And the recipes don\u2019t so much differ as compete. Oglethorpe combines his cheddar with a washed rind and some comt\u00e9, while Reichl adds both green onion and shallots to her veg. She also really pushes the boat out, adding butter on the inside of the bread, and mayo and extra cheese on the outside, because, as Food52 puts it, \u201cat this point, why not?\u201d Stella McCartney did an interview in October 2009, sitting in a west London cafe eating scrambled eggs on rye.

Liar!\u201d \u2013 told the Guardian they believed that he would only lose the election if it were rigged. Should that happen, some said they intended to remain engaged in politics, but more likely with a third party than with the Republicans \u2013 especially if that party were to revert to establishment figures such as Jeb Bush. That would pose a dilemma for Republican elders seeking to rebuild from the ruins of a potential landslide defeat.</p> <p>\u201cThe liberal media are trying to skewer the vote so we won\u2019t go out and vote,\u201d said Flora Reece, 47, a commercial analyst. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to win. We know he\u2019s going to be the next president of the United States.\u201d</p> <p>And if he doesn\u2019t? Reece replied firmly: \u201cThere will be dead people who voted, non-registered people who voted. They bring immigrants here to vote for the Democratic party. The system is rigged.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s followers, who include many newcomers to politics, are not prepared to fade quietly into the background, added Reece, who is African American and a member of her local Republican party. \u201cPeople are too mad and too angry. They used to be lackadaisical but they got involved and found out that if you become part of a movement, you can change things.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The GOP establishment is bought and paid off.

Right now you can\u2019t tell the difference between Democrat and Republican. We\u2019ve already planned to start a new party to bring independents, Democrats and Republicans together and take the White House back in four years.\u201d</p> <p>Melanie Parkham, 56, agreed: \u201cDonald Trump has totally exposed how corrupt DC is. I\u2019m sick of the Republicans too. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say they\u2019re going to leave the Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what would happen if Trump lost, Parkham replied: \u201cHell, we\u2019ll know Hillary Clinton had it rigged. I\u2019ll switch to independent. I have friends in their 40s and 60s who have registered to vote for the first time in their lives so they can vote for Trump. I\u2019ll make sure they stay interested.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s post-convention tribulations just prompted Time magazine to publish a stylised image of his head dribbling like hot wax beside a single word headline: \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">Meltdown</a>\u201d. After his unwinnable fight with gold star family Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son died serving in Iraq, the candidate attempted to restore discipline last Monday with a major economic speech in Detroit.</p> <p> Yet by Wednesday, he had touched off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">another furore with an off-the-cuff comment</a> widely seen as inciting supporters of the second amendment to assassinate Clinton. A day later, he began repeatedly describing Barack Obama as \u201cthe founder\u201d of Islamic State. He finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\">walked that back</a> in the early hours of Friday morning.</p> <p>As several polls showed the Democrat leading by double digits and beginning to threaten in red states such as Arizona, South Carolina and Utah \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-hillary-clinton-contesting-texas-not-really-but-she-is-trying-to-expand-democratic-influence-into-deep-red-territory/2016/08/10/9bf38ad8-5eb7-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">her campaign is even prodding Texas</a> \u2013 more and more Republicans scrambled for the last lifeboats on the Titanic. Yet in Trump World, the prevailing narratives do not apply. Some supporters, for example, opined that Khizr Khan had been paid $375,000 to denounce Trump \u2013 an unproven claim perpetrated by rightwing websites \u2013 and was therefore fair game.</p> <p>Capt Terry Shields, 66, a war veteran who served in Vietnam in 1969-70, said: \u201cIt was a shame it was brought up by the father in the first place. I think it was a fixed deal. The biggest thing that worries me is the Muslims taking over. It\u2019s obvious that Obama is pushing them.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, Trump\u2019s comment about the second amendment was \u201call twisted\u201d by the media, he added, a view echoed by many at the rally in Florida, a critical swing state. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bccd74d669103ac12b7f378bf549f843bd0b944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bccd74d669103ac12b7f378bf549f843bd0b944/0_230_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters cheer before a campaign rally at the Silver Spurs arena in Kissimmee, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters cheer before a campaign rally at the Silver Spurs arena in Kissimmee, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s support base is, of course, no more a monolithic bloc than any other section of the electorate. Generalisations are perilous and pose a headache for post-election Republican strategists. Another military veteran, Brett Puffenbarger, 29, said: \u201cI jumped on Trump train fairly early on. He was the only GOP candidate who wasn\u2019t outright against gay marriage and legalisation of marijuana. He was socially liberal and fiscally conservative and that was a big draw for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sabrina Motes, 36, said: \u201cI\u2019m a Jewish American, I used to be a Democrat and I\u2019m college educated. I hate the stereotype that if you\u2019re college educated or Jewish you don\u2019t support Trump. I\u2019ve followed him in his business career and I believe he\u2019s what the country needs right now.\u201d</p> <p>But looking to the future, Motes, a pharmaceutical sales rep, added: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is the perfect candidate. There are things that can be learned from and things that could be done differently. Republicans were supposed to learn from Mitt Romney but I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d</p> <p>Allegations of rigging were widespread, even though a vote has not yet been cast, but few were willing to predict what kind of backlash there would be. Bob Kunst, 74, a registered but disaffected Democrat sitting behind a cardboard \u201cTrump v Tramp\u201d sign, said: \u201cRight now the anger is intense and if, God forbid, Trump loses, you\u2019re talking revolution. You\u2019ve just had a revolution in Britain with Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>But Charlie van Esler, 60, an investment products seller who supported Marco Rubio in the primaries, said: \u201cI have no reason to believe it would be a rigged election. I respect the democratic process. The idea that Trump supporters are rednecks and yahoos is disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the arena, where Trump addressed thousands of (nearly all white) supporters, badges, hats, T-shirts and other merchandise were on sale. The Confederate flag was flying outside a stall run by Ariel Robb, a 26-year-old nurse, who insisted that its message \u201cis more heritage than hate\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s the only candidate who says if he makes a mess, he\u2019ll clean it up.

He\u2019s a really intelligent man \u2013 and anything\u2019s better than Hillary.

I\u2019m trusting in God.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas Trump has a luxury home in Florida and beat local senator Rubio in the primaries, he fared less well in states such as Wisconsin. Earlier this week in Janesville, where post-industrial melancholy is evident in a closed car plant and eerily quiet downtown, House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/paul-ryan-beats-mini-donald-trump-challenger-in-wisconsin-primary\">Paul Ryan crushed a Trump-style challenger </a>in a congressional primary. It was an important victory for the party\u2019s establishment wing, which continues to battle far-right conservatives for Republican seats across the country, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/10/ryan-wins-big-for-establishment-but-alt-conservatives-can-still-cause-massive-headaches/?wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1\">with mixed results</a>.</p> <p>Analysts dismiss the idea that, should Trump lose, a new wave of candidates will seek to emulate him in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. <a href=\"http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/history/people/faculty/alphabetical/richardson_heather.html\">Heather Cox Richardson</a>, an academic at Boston College and historian of the Republican party, said: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s racist and xenophobic supporters are going to break off and do low-level violence. The Republican party is going to go into a far more progressive direction, back to the party of Nelson Rockefeller, Dwight Eisenhower and Teddy Roosevelt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f8fdec380298145e6c37702dfaa47bec5834eba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f8fdec380298145e6c37702dfaa47bec5834eba/0_46_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump (and anti-Clinton) flair on a supporter\u2019s hat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump (and anti-Clinton) flair on a supporter\u2019s hat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reinvention they\u2019ve done before. The Trump supporters who are motivated by economic factors will gravitate back in a heartbeat. The idea that a party is going to win again by tying itself to voters over 65 is suicidal. Hanging on to this man is suicidal. What surprises me is how many people in the Republican party think their fortunes would be worse if they renounced him. I think people who haven\u2019t, like Paul Ryan, are done.\u201d</p> <p>The Republicans could become the first party to lose the White House for three consecutive elections since the Democrats in 1988. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">A leading architect of the Democratic revival</a> was Al From, who said on Thursday: \u201cFirst the Republicans have got to develop an agenda that people want to vote for, not just a small sliver of the electorate.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to become more libertarian on cultural issues to appeal to young voters. You have to express views in ways that convey you\u2019re open to other points of views, too. We weren\u2019t going to win pro-life voters in 1992 but they saw Bill Clinton and said: \u2018He\u2019s not a radical on this, let\u2019s look at what he says about other issues.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>From warned: \u201cIf the governors and party leaders don\u2019t take a stronger hand in shaping the party, it\u2019s possible there will be some sort of replacement party. There could be a realignment of the parties over the next two or three elections. With the Republicans it\u2019s more extreme because Trump has hijacked the party from the leadership. The leaders could take it back but it\u2019s possible a third party could emerge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified quickly</p> <footer> <cite>Frank Luntz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That argument echoes the recommendations of a <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/\">Republican autopsy report</a>, conducted after the 2012 election defeat, which called for wider appeal to young people and racial minorities and an end to the party\u2019s anti-immigration stance. First the party could not bring itself to make that journey by passing a law in Congress \u2013 then Trump came along with his signature plan to build a wall.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.focuswithfrank.com/\">Frank Luntz</a>, a Republican consultant and pollster, also doubts that the maverick tycoon will have a long-term political legacy. He said: \u201cTrump has little formal statewide organisation \u2013 even now. He has loyalists, but they are disorganised. His campaign is being out-raised and outspent by ratios we have never seen in modern politics \u2013 and that\u2019s with just 90 days to go. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this movement will continue beyond its leader. He has become the most unpopular political figure in America today.\u201d</p> <p>It would be foolish to write the Republican party off, Luntz added. \u201cThe GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified much more quickly than prognosticators ever expected. The Goldwater debacle in 1964 led to Nixon\u2019s resurgence in 1968 and a 60% landslide in 1972.</p> <p>\u201cWatergate may have destroyed the GOP in 1974, but Reagan won by nine [percentage points] just six years later and by 20 [points] four years after that. The loss of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992 was supposed to be the end of the GOP, but they won the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years just two years later. Republicans are a very resilient party, and it doesn\u2019t take long for them to recover.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Barbra Streisand stands as the only star to land No 1 albums in every one of the last six decades \u2013 a fact she made sure to point out near the start of her latest tour, which came to her home borough of Brooklyn on Thursday. <br></p> <p>Even so, she added, many people still can\u2019t accurately pronounce her name. \u201cIt\u2019s Strei-<em>sand -</em> soft like sand,\u201d the star schooled us from stage of the Barclays Center. \u201cYou\u2019d think after 50 years, people would pronounce it correctly.\u201d</p> <p>It was a deeply Strei-<em>sand</em>-ian moment, a sly rebuke that underscored the singer\u2019s enduring view of herself as a misunderstood outsider, despite more than half a century of acclaim. While that attitude could seem off-putting, it has bonded Streisand to her fans with uncommon depth. She\u2019s their ideal underdog, someone to herald specifically for having beaten the system with an uncompromising style and an unconventional character. The importance of Streisand as a symbol of staying power, tenacity and rebellion makes crucial the structure of her latest show. Like its recent predecessors, this two-act, 120-minute event involves nearly as much kibitzing, pontificating and icon-buffing as actual singing. As always, Streisand\u2019s persona shares the stage with her art, with each positioned to burnish the other.</p> <p>It\u2019s been four years since the star last launched a tour, a rhythm maybe-not-so-coincidentally timed with the presidential election cycle. The result gave her a nice excuse to offer a fish-in-a-barrel shot at guess which candidate. After noting, during an intro to People, that the genetic makeup of everyone on the planet is 99% identical, she added \u201cthe other 1% is Donald Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Streisand also had a lot to say about climate change, war, Hillary Clinton (whom she adores) and feminism. That last bit offered more chances for the star to highlight her underdog status. More crucially, these segments provided resting time for her voice, whose condition must be measured, and amended, with each tour. (Her latest tour represents Streisand\u2019s fifth since she returned to the stage in 1994 after a three-decade hiatus). Now 74, the singer can\u2019t be fairly compared with her herculean, younger self, or even to the surprisingly undiminished one from a decade ago. Yet, in some measure she has to be. On Streisand\u2019s previous tour, in 2012, a new huskiness crept into her voice, dimming some of the glisten in her tone, while shedding gradations of her once unending wind power. In addition, more of the old high notes had to be rerouted. </p> <p>Even with those qualifications, Streisand remains a rich and powerful singer. Song after song in Brooklyn showed her vibrato to be as resonant as ever, her phrasing as smart, and her essential timbre as deep in character. Her limits, such as they are, have redoubled her focus as an actress, allowing her to inhabit the characters in some songs more fully than ever. Chunks of the set emphasized that. Key segments came from her latest album, <a href=\"http://encore.barbrastreisand.com/\">Encore</a>, which features songs from Broadway, sung in duets with movie stars. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ab6469ed1022b7f2c0a47eef264a8c24fb5e1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ab6469ed1022b7f2c0a47eef264a8c24fb5e1c/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Foxx performed The Sound of Music\u2019s Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain with Streisand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Foxx performed The Sound of Music\u2019s Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain with Streisand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage for BSB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two guests from the album showed up. Patrick Wilson abetted her ably in Loving You, a song plucked from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/10/stephen-sondheim-james-lapine-interview-writing-musicals-into-the-woods\">Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Passion</a>. Later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamie-foxx\">Jamie Foxx</a> joined her for Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain, adding a soulful twist to the classic melody while still matching the star at the song\u2019s bravura peaks. For a modern turn, she performed one duet with the departed. Streisand traded verses with the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/nov/16/musicals-anthony-newley\">Anthony Newley</a>, via a video of his original take on Who Can I Turn To. His florid vibrato made a fine mate for Streisand\u2019s most fluttering tones. </p> <p>The star offered a clutch of other Sondheim songs, including Children Will Listen (from Into the Woods) and Being Alive (from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/06/company-review\">Company</a>). But a stronger motif had to do with the decade that dominated the song selection. Six of the first eight songs came from the 70s, many of which she has never performed before this tour. Dedicated fans had to be thrilled by the inclusion of <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-star-is-born-mw0000196532\">Carole King\u2019s Being at War With Each Other</a> and Everything (from the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-star-is-born-mw0000196532\">A Star is Born soundtrack</a>). Later, Streisand offered two pieces from her 1975 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073026/\">Funny Lady</a>, including Isn\u2019t This Better, about a love of resignation, and How Lucky Can You Get? Since Streisand didn\u2019t tour between the 60s and 1994, the current show might be seen as the 70s performance she never gave. Mirroring that decade\u2019s emphasis on pop over standards, the show featured a smaller backup band than usual \u2013 just 11 musicians rather than her more common orchestral support. </p> <p>The night also featured a psychic who, for 10 unfathomable minutes, read the minds of a crowd that clearly were clearly thinking one thing \u2013 love for their hero. Streisand herself wasn\u2019t always so dewy-eyed. She aired out several old battles with her record company. They tried to nix her cover idea for the People album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fvN%2BA1ZtL.jpg\">where she famously turned her back to the camera</a>. The cover went on to win a Grammy. The company also airbrushed out the bump, and tightened the width, of her nose on the cover of The Way We Were, which irked her. \u201cMe and that bump have been through a lot together,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Despite the speeches and schtick, Streisand seemed to sing more often than usual. Along the way, she proved she can still belt when she needs to. But her greatest moment came during a quieter section, when she brought her full acting skills to bear. Her take on Sondheim\u2019s Losing My Mind could double as a master class in character singing. Streisand moved through the song slowly, ruminating on the longing in the lyrics with notes that captured exasperation, pity, obsession and, probably, more understanding of a ruined love than any singer who has ever sung that song before.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Richard Ford</strong></h2> <p>My old mentor and friend Shelby Foote used to say that a person couldn\u2019t understand the United States without understanding the American civil war. As a Mississippi kid who was glad the south had lost the war (100 years before!) and who felt that slavery was a blight on American history we would do well to try to \u201clive beyond\u201d, I thought Shelby\u2019s insistence was a lot of hooey intended to prove the south\u2019s undeserved centrality to all things American. In my naive view, the south and \u201csouthern values\u201d were a garish anomaly, not typical of what America stood for \u2013 those values expressed in the Declaration of Independence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d/0_946_3378_4219/801.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ford.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I maintained this view until I unexpectedly experienced the American right wing\u2019s irrationally hostile opposition to the Obama presidency. From questioning \u2013 completely without justification \u2013 Obama\u2019s birth and religion, to opposing virtually all Obama\u2019s policy initiatives, to slandering the president personally, to denying his actual right to hold office, the right wing formally and informally waged a campaign not only to discredit our legally elected head of state but, in essence, to erase him.</p> <p>Okay, I said I was naive; but this shocked me. And it puzzled me. What was it about Barack Obama that incensed the right to such bizarre extremes? Here is a superbly intelligent man, dignified and persuasively presidential, a good communicator, an exemplary \u201cfamily man\u201d, remarkably scandal free; he knows the US constitution, he was and is strongly supported by the other party. He in every demonstrable way has had the country\u2019s best interests clearly in his sight. One could disagree with him policy to policy. But the right\u2019s reaction was outsized and\u2026 well\u2026 mindless. And all these views \u2013 to get around to the point \u2013 are the views put forward by Trump, both today and for the past nearly eight years.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t just be his race \u2013 could it? \u2013 that set the right so against the president? Though, in America, one cannot \u2013 must not \u2013 ever discount the lowest sort of political urgings, and must never overlook race prejudice as a motive for most anything. If it quacks like a duck, etc.</p> <p>All of what I heard in the rightwing contumely, then and now \u2013 including Trump\u2019s stump speeches in the past week \u2013 certainly reminded me troublingly of the anti-integrationist, anti-black, so-called states rights \u2013 now hygienically rebranded as \u201cnativist\u201d or \u201cpopulist\u201d \u2013 calumny from my apartheid youth in Mississippi: the unrelenting attempt not just to disempower African Americans as political actors, but to extirpate them. How might I inform myself better about this growing sense of unease regarding the president\u2019s race being a primary consideration \u2013 acknowledged or unacknowledged \u2013 in the right wing\u2019s intransigence?</p> <p>Well, first, I thought, read about the civil war, the vast crucible of American race politics, the \u201cproving ground\u201d where vitriolic, mindless anti-black rhetoric found its full voice and first prominent advocates. And what was the best history of the American civil war? Everyone knew that \u2013 probably even Shelby Foote, who wrote two volumes of his own. James McPherson\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning civil war history, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/battle-cry-of-freedom.html\"><em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em></a>.</p> <p>Read it.

The eponymous antihero is a hypocrite and a conman. He has a patchy sexual past and a history of heavy drinking, yet sells himself as a convert to evangelical religion, teaming up with Sister Sharon Falconer, who leads impassioned revivals throughout the midwest. Manipulative and cunning, Gantry is driven to accrue wealth through religious hucksterism, but also power; he feeds off the roar of the crowd. He\u2019s a narcissist and a fraud who has left multiple ruined lives in his wake.</p> <p>The main difference between Gantry and Trump is that Gantry is portrayed as genuinely charismatic. Lewis\u2019s preacher gets his leg over figuratively and literally because, as a performer, he\u2019s mesmerising. Trump is not charismatic. He is artless and politically clumsy, and wears his egotism on his sleeve. Nor is Trump mesmerising, except in the sense that a train wreck is mesmerising. Gantry\u2019s success in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes is understandable: he has a silver tongue, and on stage he\u2019s larger than life. Trump can\u2019t string a single grammatical sentence together, and at the podium he is lumpen and awkward. As a fictional character, Gantry works, and Trump doesn\u2019t. As Mark Schorer, an American academic, observed: \u201cThe forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in <em>Elmer Gantry </em>are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\u201d Some things never change.</p> <p>\u2022 Lionel Shriver\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047.html\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a> (Borough).</p> <h2><strong>David Hare</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372/842_541_3967_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hare - photographed in his writing studio in North London Photograph by DAVID LEVENE For SATURDAY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last December, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/08/trumps-repeated-claim-that-obama-is-accepting-200000-syrian-refugees/?tid=a_inl\">Donald Trump claimed </a>that President Obama planned to let 200,000 Syrian refugees into the US in 2016.

People on the internet like to claim that everything is a matter of opinion and all opinions are equally valid. But they\u2019re not. It\u2019s pseudo-democratic bullshit. As Lipstadt says in our film, \u201cThe icecaps are melting. And Elvis is dead.\u201d Opinions backed up by fact have more value than those that aren\u2019t.

Woodard explores the US as a cluster of 11 different cultures, some of which we share with our neighbours, Canada and Mexico. In order to understand Trump and his appeal, I think we can focus on Appalachian culture, which was exported from the Scottish borders in the 18th century, and was marked by an affinity for conflict and evangelical protestantism. These people had been trained to do battle in the Scottish wars, were later put to work in the coal mines, and are now out of work (the most evocative portrait of the lives these immigrants left behind and what they did when they got to America is in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/albion-s-seed.html\">David Hackett Fischer\u2019s <em>Albion\u2019s Seed</em></a>). Another intransigent American culture is that of the deep south, slaveholders who came to the US from the sugar plantations of Barbados and were much more hierarchical and ruthless than the slaveholders in Virginia.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting and relevant nation, though, is New Netherland, founded in 1624, a partly Dutch nation, very diverse, not religious, but authoritarian and corporate (run by the Dutch West Indies Corporation). Now New York City, it is the extreme capitalist nation, which has never minded making a buck from no matter what, including the slave trade. Woodard writes, \u201cIndeed, full on slavery was introduced to what is now the United States not by the gentlemen planters of Virginia or South Carolina but by the merchants of Manhattan.\u201d</p> <p>Three hundred slaves were imported by the Dutch West Indies corporation in 1655 and auctioned \u2013 \u201cIn the last decade before the [1685] English conquest, New Amsterdam was rapidly evolving into North America\u2019s greatest slave market.\u201d Woodard says that our 11 nations are only partly integrated with one another and have always been that way. I would say that the resistance to having a black man as president, which laid the groundwork for the current fix we are in, comes from the deep southern and Appalachian nations; but the mercenary and ruthless lack of conscience (hello, Donald Trump!) comes from the Manhattan nation.</p> <p>\u2022 Jane Smiley\u2019s most recent novel is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/early-warning-322607.html\"><em>Early Warning</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Rich Benjamin</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6db368bb75aa186b13c2a108a6f80e66fc270925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6db368bb75aa186b13c2a108a6f80e66fc270925/0_93_2848_3558/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Rich Benjamin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich Benjamin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Schuster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year I witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/apr/14/bernie-sanders-rally-washington-square-park-pictures\">Bernie Sanders supporters</a> occupy Washington Square Park to hear him speak and saw Black Lives Matter protesters<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/19/black-lives-matter-protesters-block-san-franciscos-bay-bridge\"> shut down city streets</a>, declaring, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d And, travelling to America\u2019s whitest communities in recent years, I\u2019ve seen protests against immigration and taxes, a precursor to Trump supporters who denounce our \u201crigged\u201d economy and elections.</p> <p>Christopher Lasch\u2019s ornery 1994 book <em>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</em> illuminates this election. An increasingly global, mobile and craven class, Lasch contended, isolates itself in its social networks and physical cocoons, a flight not only from daily experience in public spaces but a political abandonment of the working and middle class that also betrays basic democratic practices and values. Though they differ in temperament and outlook, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton personify versions of Lasch\u2019s self-protecting privileged class, whose careers and lives contribute to the breakdown of an inclusive, national democratic culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A man who made a fortune from golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Were he alive, Lasch might eviscerate these two very different elites, beholden to different privileged interests yet nonetheless falling over themselves to champion the \u201ccommon\u201d person. His book offers an implicit explanation of the elite\u2019s cynical exploitation of \u201cordinary\u201d people and the popular cynicism toward the elite. Lasch\u2019s book presciently exposes the hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s candidacy. A property developer who made a fortune from luxury condos and golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses. A onetime Democrat whose primary political allegiance is to himself, Trump precisely embodies the selfish elite Lasch dissected in the 80s and 90s.</p> <p>The physical segregation of Americans into economically or racially homogenous communities has its counterpart in the subdivision of our discussions and opinions. Roughly $7.5bn (\u00a35.7bn) will be spent on this election, the vast majority raised from the corporatised donor class. \u201cThe unreal artificial character of our politics reflects elites\u2019 insulation from common life,\u201d Lasch wrote, \u201ctogether with a secret conviction that the real problems are insoluble.\u201d Campaign chatter inundates us on social media, but dumb memes are no substitute for incisive information, rigorous analysis, or meaningful debate. Effectively excluded from public debate, most Americans no longer have any use for the information inflicted on them in such large amounts. Wealth, false choices and Trump himself devour the coverage.

Jesus,<em> </em>Barton explained, was not only \u201cthe most popular dinner guest in Jerusalem\u201d, and \u201can outdoor man\u201d, but a \u201cstartling example of executive success\u201d. \u201cHe picked up 12 men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organisation that conquered the world.\u201d This may sound ludicrous, but it is also the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of America\u2019s long conflation of business with religion, and it speaks to the equally absurd rise of Donald Trump as a politician that somehow millions of Americans believe \u2013 in the face of astounding evidence to the contrary \u2013 will save them. It is a triumph of faith, indeed.</p> <p>Trump is fond of claiming in messianic terms that he alone can save America, and restore the American Dream. The historian who coined the phrase \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d in a book called <em>The Epic of America</em>, would, I suspect, disagree. In 1931 James Truslow Adams argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">chasing the spectre of wealth</a> is what got America into the mess of the Depression; he carefully traced that ideology back to the 19th century, when there developed a \u201cnew conception of business as somehow a social and patriotic duty\u201d. This is the ideology into which Trump has tapped so powerfully: the idea that business success is itself a virtue to be ranked above all others, to be worshipped. (We must put aside, evidently, concerns over what kind of \u201csuccess\u201d Trump is precisely held to have achieved, and by what means.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world Fitzgerald envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 Trump\u2019s world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Faith in business was an idea much on the minds of Americans in the 20s, during the so-called boom presided over by three successive \u201cbusinessmen\u201d presidents, including Calvin Coolidge, who declared in 1925 that \u201cthe chief business of America is business\u201d. This idea was so widespread that it was itself the target of the bestselling American novel of 1922, Sinclair Lewis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/11/100-best-novels-babbitt-sinclair-lewis-robert-mccrum\"><em>Babbitt</em></a>. In its opening pages, George Babbitt gazes upon a bank tower and Lewis tells us: \u201cHe beheld the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men.\u201d In 1926 Lewis\u2019s <em>Elmer Gantry</em> satirised the hypocrisy of selling religion, while a year earlier Scott Fitzgerald skewered the same attitudes when he said that Jay Gatsby was a son of God and must about \u201cHis Father\u2019s Business: the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty\u201d. The idea that someone in service to the American worship of wealth could through sheer force of will drive himself near to the top is at the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s morality play. The world that he envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 and that is the world that Trump embodies, and which he would like to rule.</p> <p>A decade after Barton said that Jesus was the best businessman of all, Lewis wrote <em>It Can\u2019t Happen Here</em>, a dystopian satire responding to the rise of fascism in Europe by imagining a populist demagogue who becomes a totalitarian president of the United States.

By that standard the world has never had a democracy. Political scientists such as Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, authors of <em>Democracy for Realists</em>, who study how democracies really work are repeatedly astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people\u2019s political beliefs and the tenuous connection of those beliefs to their votes. Most voters are ignorant not just of current policy alternatives but of the most elementary facts about politics and history, such as the major branches of government or which countries have used nuclear weapons. Their opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: they say that the government spends too much on \u201cwelfare\u201d but too little on \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d, and that it should use \u201cmilitary force\u201d but not \u201cgo to war\u201d. When they do formulate a preference, they commonly vote for a candidate with the opposite one. Nor does voting provide a feedback signal on a government\u2019s overall performance. Voters punish incumbents for recent events over which they have dubious control, such as macroeconomic swings and terrorist strikes, or no control at all, such as droughts, floods or even shark attacks.</p> <p>Achen and Bartels suggest that most people correctly recognise that their votes are astronomically unlikely to affect the outcome of an election and so they prioritise work and family over educating themselves about politics. They use the franchise as a form of self-expression: they vote for candidates who they think speak up for their kind of people.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/a-sense-of-style.html\"><em>The Sense of Style</em></a> (Penguin).</p> <h2><strong>Mark Lawson </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a/0_551_2945_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Lawson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Lawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abigail Zoe Martin/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the horror of the Washington establishment, a gabby maverick with no record of political office uses his celebrity, in a depressed and paranoid America, to fuel a furious movement that threatens the hegemonies of politics, corporations and the media. Considering the insurgent unthinkable, they plot to stop him.</p> <p>The year is 1934, and Upton Sinclair, a well-known journalist and author, has sensationally won the Democratic nomination to be governor of California. Sinclair is now most remembered as the writer of industrial documentary novels such as <em>The Jungle</em>, set in the Chicago meat yards, and <em>Oil!,</em> which was adapted as the Oscar-winning movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a>. His most enduring legacy, though, has proved to be a quixotic bid for public office, which introduced two perversions \u2013 subsequently recurrent \u2013 of the political process. Sinclair\u2019s gubernatorial race was the beneficiary of one campaign innovation \u2013 the power of an anti-political candidate in times of crisis \u2013 and the victim of another: the use of negative media \u201cattack ads\u201d against an opponent. These tropes seem to have reached their apotheosis in the 2016 US presidential election.</p> <p>Ideologically, Sinclair most resembles Bernie Sanders. Both men were socialists who became Democrats for specific electoral purpose. However, in his takeover of a major party in a key campaign, Sinclair most spookily previews Donald Trump. Like Trump, he terrified the elders of his adopted affiliation and the media by being widely viewed as too peculiar to rule. Smeared as politically reckless (in his case, for \u201ccommunist\u201d views), Sinclair was attacked for his evangelical vegetarianism and tendency to speak from candour rather than calculation. The outsider\u2019s rise was seen as so threatening to the status quo that the incumbent Republican governor, Frank F Merriam, responded with a campaign that included the first recorded use of a hostile screen commercial, funded by Hollywood and screened in cinemas.</p> <p>Greg Mitchell\u2019s 1992 book about these events, <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, although historical, has tended to find topical resonance. It was first published in the election year in which an independent presidential candidate, Texas oilman H Ross Perot, became the most successful non-politician presidential candidate until Trump. In 2011, it was released for the first time as an ebook, because, as Mitchell acknowledged in a preface, he saw, in the Occupy Wall Street grassroots movement, parallels with EPIC, and wanted to offer Sinclair as both a warming and warning example to the new wave of progressive protestors.</p> <p>As it turned out, the 1934 template had less relevance to the 2012 presidential election, when an incumbent president received a handsome re-endorsement, than had seemed likely in the febrile atmosphere leading up to the vote. <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, though, proves a useful handbook to the present political convulsions in America, although liberals will read it now looking for clues to how a feisty outsider can be stopped.</p> <p>What ultimately finished Sinclair was that the intervention of a strong third party candidate, Raymond L Haigh of the Progressive party, split the anti-establishment vote and allowed Merriam to be re-elected, helped by the media touting him as the sensible or at least safer option.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that, in November, either the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the ex-CIA agent Even McMullin, a last-minute anti-Trump runner, can do a Haigh for Hillary, spreading the resentment. The larger question, though, is which candidate will be left standing after the Trump and Clinton campaigns and their proxies have engaged Merriam-like negative tactics against each other.</p> <p>The American decision in 2016 sees the polarities of California 34 reversed \u2013 the maverick a regressive rightwinger, a Democrat running as the defender of sanity and capitalism \u2013 but the parallels are otherwise uncanny. Upton Sinclair, an unfairly neglected writer of political fiction, is a more lasting presence as a ghost in the political machine.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/allegations.html\"><em>The Allegations</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430/0_1482_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burkeman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burkeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long before Donald Trump started<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\"> dropping hints about political assassination</a>s, death was a looming presence in his speeches.

The book\u2019s trio of authors \u2013 Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski \u2013 have spent many years running experiments in which participants are reminded of their inevitable fate (\u201cPlease briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d, goes one typical mortality-reminder exercise) to see how it changes them. Their results endorse the hunch set forth with brilliance, but little scientific rigour, by Ernest Becker in his masterpiece <em>The Denial of Death</em>. Unable to accept the fact that our lives are finite, we seek symbolic immortality \u2013 often through child-rearing or creative work or devotion to great causes, but sometimes to demagogues instead.</p> <p>\u201cSensing a way to feel significant again,\u201d they write, \u201cpeople join the cause of the seemingly larger-than-life leader as a revitalised basis for self-worth and meaning in life.\u201d Whether he\u2019s conscious of it or not, Trump triggers the fear of death in his audiences, then presents them both with various specific \u201csolutions\u201d (a wall to keep out Mexicans, a ban to keep out Muslims) and one big implicit promise: merge symbolically with the wealthy, domineering Trump himself, and feel powerful again.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s popularity has been variously attributed to racism, misogyny and economic insecurity; but the authors show how all these only get their urgency from the unspoken, underlying fear of literal demise. And perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope in this. There\u2019s been a regrettable tendency among liberals to write off Trump supporters as utterly irredeemable \u2013 bigots we can never hope to understand, much less change.

All-American Dorothy and her charming sidekicks trip off to the dazzling Emerald City to seek help from the mighty wizard of Oz. The awesome eminence promises to give them everything they desire if they kill off his biggest (female) rival first. But when they return to claim their rewards, they discover that \u201cOz, the Great and Terrible\u201d is a cowering little ventriloquist from Omaha. \u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\u201d Dorothy exclaims.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Not a bit of it, my dear; I\u2019m just a common man.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re more than that,\u2019 said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \u2018you\u2019re a humbug.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since the 1960s it has been fashionable to read Oz as an allegory of turn of the century populism: the yellow brick road represents the gold standard, the Emerald City stands in for paper dollars, and so on.

But no issue has been more important to Trump\u2019s success than race. Trump has given vent to many white voters\u2019 fears and anxieties about the loss of racial privilege and status, and run the most avowedly ethnonationalist presidential campaign since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George Wallace</a>. And while many have argued that the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s racially coded appeals is tied to rising inequality and the economic woes of the working class voters who constitute Trump\u2019s base, it would be more accurate to say that Trump is tapping into a vein of working class racism that has been a part of American politics for a long time.</p> <p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stan-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>\u2019s <em>Middle Class Dreams </em>helps explain so much about Trump\u2019s rise. It was published in 1995, but much of it is based on Greenberg\u2019s work in Macomb County, Michigan, following the 1984 presidential election. Macomb was a nearly all white suburban county just outside of Detroit. It had been a solidly Democratic county in the 60s, giving sizeable majorities to both JFK and Lyndon Johnson. But in 1972 66% of Democratic voters in Macomb supported George Wallace in the Democratic primary, and in the general election Richard Nixon carried the county easily. In 1980 Macomb voted for Ronald Reagan, and in 1984 he took two-thirds of the vote. In other words, these working-class voters, who had once supported progressive candidates, had shifted decisively to the right.</p> <p>What Greenberg discovered in his many interviews with Macomb voters was that they felt that the Democratic party had abandoned them, that it had stopped paying attention to the concerns of working people and the striving middle class, and started paying too much attention to the concerns of black people and other minorities. The fundamental problem Macomb voters had with the Democrats was the party\u2019s embrace of civil rights in the 60s.</p> <p>What <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> demonstrates is just how important race, and racism, was in shaping many voters\u2019 political attitudes. As Greenberg puts it, \u201cthese white defectors from the Democratic party expressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics\u201d. More than that, \u201cnot being black was what constituted being middle class; not living with blacks was what made a neighbourhood a decent place to live\u201d. When the Democratic party started to take civil rights seriously and to embrace (however tepidly) antiracism, many white working class voters saw it as a betrayal.</p> <p>More than 40 years after Wallace, Trump is tapping into these same currents. The list of outsiders that many white voters fear the encroachment of is longer now: it includes Muslim and Latino immigrants as well as African Americans. But what <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> shows is that the conviction of Trump supporters that white Americans have been forgotten, and that the country is going to hell as a result, is not new. It\u2019s all too old.</p> <p>\u2022 James Surowiecki is author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wisdom-of-crowds.html\"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a> (Anchor).</p>",

The sentence is conditional and is followed by a clear future-tense sentence, suggesting Trump was not talking about the power of a present-day, pre-election voting bloc, but about a possible future. But Trump often ignores the basics of English grammar and speaks in tangled tenses, mountains of interrupting clauses, and without sensible syntax or even subject-verb agreements, all of which can render his speech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/763471550850830336\">opaque at best.</a></p> <p>In the speech itself Trump leapt from talking about \u201clower electric bills\u201d and energy policy to the supreme court and gun rights.

The FBI has said there is no evidence that Clinton\u2019s private email servers were hacked, though director James Comey has said they were susceptible to attack. The Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign were targeted in a hack that has been largely blamed on Russian security services, and that took place years after Amiri\u2019s disappearance in Iran. </p> <p></p> <p></p>",

  "<p>Most people lose money at the Trump Taj Mahal \u2013 that\u2019s the way casinos work. But if you\u2019re investor Carl Icahn, billionaire owner of Atlantic City\u2019s decaying but still opulent, elephant-fronted Taj, you have some odds in your favor.<br></p> <p>Icahn bought Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump\u2019s troubled New Jersey casino operations out of bankruptcy in March. Now he says striking workers have made it impossible to turn around a property that has lost him $100m and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-taj-mahal-casino-closing-atlantic-city\">he will close the casino after the Labor Day holiday</a> on 5 September. Regulatory filings show he is unlikely to leave the casino out of pocket.</p> <p>Icahn has made most of his money fighting battles with management as an activist shareholder. This time, as the owner of Trump Entertainment, he is fighting its employees, mainly members of the local branch of hotels and casino union UniteHere. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"155df63799d1d13a6aa276c62592ffa3fe5720e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/155df63799d1d13a6aa276c62592ffa3fe5720e6/0_0_3480_2092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carl Icahn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carl Icahn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Icahn, who did not respond to calls or messages for this article, accuses the union of forcing management into expensive healthcare and retirement plans that pad the union\u2019s coffers. The union says Icahn is a raider who used expensive loans to squeeze the Trump Taj Mahal into bankruptcy and then used the legal proceeding to shaft the workers. The union also points to another Icahn casino \u2013 the Tropicana \u2013 which earlier this summer agreed to the union\u2019s full benefits package, as did three other Atlantic City casinos that are controlled by rival Caesars Entertainment.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel real, real disrespected that you would give to one part of your company and not give to the other,\u201d said Chuck Baker, a 56-year-old cook who has put in 26 years at the Trump Taj Mahal. Baker is one of about 1,000 workers who walked out on 1 July, after refusing an offer from Icahn that was less than half that agreed by Icahn\u2019s Tropicana and other casinos. Most of the workers earn less than $12 an hour.</p> <p>\u201cIcahn Enterprises is a business with shareholders and legal duties to those shareholders,\u201d Icahn wrote to workers in a letter posted on his website, a day after the announcement the property would close after Labor Day. \u201cIt is one thing to fund losses when a path to profitability exists; but, to burn tens of millions of dollars when there is no hope is just foolish.\u201d</p> <p>But the same day as he wrote that letter, Icahn\u2019s holding conglomerate Icahn Enterprises told the Securities and Exchange Commission that its interest in Trump Entertainment Resorts \u2013 which is the Trump Taj Mahal and the former Trump Plaza, a casino that has been \u201cidled\u201d since 2014 \u2013 was worth $126m, \u201cresulting in a $16m gain on investment activities\u201d. In a separate statement to shareholders, the company said its interest in Trump could be worth as much as $200m, under a different valuation method. Still, conceded the SEC filing, \u201cthe Trump acquisition is not material\u201d to Icahn Enterprises\u2019 financial statements. That is because, even at $200m, it is less than 5% of the conglomerate\u2019s investment portfolio, net of debt.</p> <p>Icahn is right that the Taj Mahal itself has been losing money this year \u2013 although it eked out a small operating profit amid bankruptcy last year \u2013 but workers including server Marc Scittina said that is in part because it has been operating with an overworked skeleton crew for its size and number of hotel rooms. Scittina, 54, has been skipping doctors\u2019 appointments now that he has an Affordable Care Act plan that has high deductibles. Some of his colleagues are uninsured. \u201cIcahn needs to do the right thing, be fair,\u201d Scittina said, sweating on the hot boardwalk.</p> <p>The cost of providing the full healthcare package for Trump Taj Mahal employees for a year would be several million, the union says. It would be about the same amount as the $4m Tropicana paid to buy back its own stock in the last quarter, union reps point out. For the workers, it is the difference between a $12-an-hour job with a $3 benefits package that leaves them on the hook for their family\u2019s healthcare and their own hospital visits, or a $6.65 benefits package that they say would give them a decent, middle-class life. Currently, workers say, the Taj is paying $20 an hour to scabs to staff the hotel, restaurants and gaming services.</p> <p>The fight has become political, in large part because it tangentially involves Donald Trump, who Ichan is championing for president. Trump Entertainment is a black spot on Trump\u2019s business record and has filed for bankruptcy four times. Trump himself has had nothing to do with the Atlantic City enterprise for the better part of a decade. But the striking Taj workers were used as poster boys and girls forHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign when she passed through Atlantic City last month. This week Icahn argued Trump\u2019s economic policies could still secure him the White House.</p> <p>Ichan could flip the Taj Mahal now for a profit but for Atlantic City, the loss of more than 2,000 full- and part-time jobs would be another big blow. The city is struggling to meet its debt payments, in large part because casino owners like Icahn have fought a long, successful campaign to reduce their property taxes and stymie other business development in the city that might threaten their dominance. The Sands casino \u2013 which, like the Taj, was bought by Icahn from bankruptcy and then sold for a profit in 2006 \u2013 is now a vacant boardwalk-fronting eyesore of a lot. The local development agency, which is supposed to use casino taxes for the greater good of the city, recently heard a plan to convert the former Sands lot into parking. The same agency has spent millions in the last five years on the casinos themselves, including $7m for the oversized gold lettering that announces the Trump Taj Mahal\u2019s boardwalk entrance.</p> <p>Outside that entrance, a dozen workers filed back and forth on Tuesday chanting \u201cStronger together!\u201d and other upbeat rallying calls. \u201cThese people here outside? They worked so hard,\u201d says Maritza Luna, 58, a Trump Taj Mahal housekeeper since it opened in 1990. Luna, whose job involves maneuvering a 300lb cart laden with cleaning chemicals, guest toiletries and linen up to six days a week, misses many of her colleagues who earlier this year took part-time jobs at other casinos, where they are required to clean just 14 rooms a day compared with the Taj\u2019s mandated 16 rooms. Luna needs back surgery as a result of an injury she sustained last year at work. After she hired a lawyer, the casino management agreed this week to pay for her surgery. \u201cWhy\u2019s he doing this to us?\u201d she asks. \u201cHe\u2019s a rich guy!\u201d</p>",

I believe it would be safe to assume he will grow the American police and surveillance states, which are already spiraling out of control. HRC isn\u2019t any better though.

  "<p>Donald Trump insinuated that Hillary Clinton lacks mental stamina at a rally where he twice couldn\u2019t tell what day of the week it was.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Hillary Clinton, commonly referred to as \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019,\u201d he told a crowd in Kissimmee, Florida. \u201cHillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-infrastructure-economy-jobs-trade-deals\">gave a speech today having to do with economic development</a>, having to do with a lot of different things. Short speech, always very short. You know?</p> <p>\u201cShe makes the speech, she turns off the teleprompter. Look, what happens, she gives a short speech then she goes home, goes to sleep, she shows up two days later. Remember, short circuit. Remember that, right? Short circuit.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the Democratic nominee said that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/hillary-clinton-short-circuited-statements-classified-emails\">\u201cmay have short-circuited\u201d</a> her answer in a TV interview about the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Trump has pounced on the comment. Previously on the campaign trail he has also raised questions over Clinton\u2019s mental and physical condition.</p> <p>Addressing a rambunctious crowd in Florida, a crucial swing state, he added: \u201cI watched Hillary today, which was really boring. It\u2019s hard to watch. I have an obligation to watch. Fortunately she never goes on very long because she wants to go home.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump himself, locked in a grueling campaign, twice made a slip of the tongue. \u201cBy the way, is there any place to be that\u2019s better than a Friday night in Florida at a Trump rally? No place.\u201d</p> <p>A few supporters shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s Thursday!\u201d</p> <p>Later he said: \u201cWe joke. It\u2019s Friday night and we\u2019re having fun.\u201d More supporters yelled: \u201cIt\u2019s Thursday!\u201d but he appeared to assume it was more cheering.</p> <p>In another, perhaps more deliberate lapse, Trump claimed: \u201cThis place is incredible. We\u2019ve got 2,000 people outside trying to get in.\u201d In fact there were still hundreds of empty places in the 8,000-seat arena in Kissimmee, near Orlando.</p> <p>During the event he launched a series of attacks on Clinton and Barack Obama that were greeted with rowdy cheers and whistles by fans, many wearing Trump regalia and \u201cmake America great again\u201d hats.</p> <p>He held up a series of placards, including one claiming Clinton has received $48.5m in hedge fund contributions. \u201cI received $19,000,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who it is!\u201d He argued that Clinton would do the bidding of Wall Street.</p> <p>At another point, he made reference to the US national debt. Trump, whose companies have declared bankruptcy six times <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/\">according to research by the Politifact website</a>, said: \u201cI\u2019ve always loved debt. I must be honest with you. I don\u2019t love it for countries but I\u2019ve loved it individually. OK? Things work out good, that\u2019s great. If it don\u2019t, you go renegotiate.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeated yet again his claim that Obama is the \u201cfounder\u201d of Isis, explaining that if the president had maintained a small force in Iraq, he could have prevented the militant group\u2019s rise. He also reiterated his promise to build a wall on the Mexican border, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall and, when someone tries to fight us, that wall gets 10ft higher.\u201d</p> <p>Unfazed by recent poll numbers and negative headlines, Trump described his support as a movement without precedent and insisted: \u201cI\u2019m a messenger for common sense.\u201d</p> <p>The rally featured crowd chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d and the ejection of two protesters. One fan held up a Confederate flag labelled \u201cTrump 2016\u201d but was ordered to remove it before the businessman\u2019s entrance.</p>",
  "<p>With Theresa May donning her walking boots and heading for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/theresa-may-picks-neutral-switzerland-for-summer-holiday\" title=\"\">Switzerland</a>, we have reached the breathing space that British politics has craved ever since the EU referendum. But we should enjoy it while we can, because it will be short. As soon as May returns from the Alps, speculation about an early general election, already widespread, will accelerate.</p> <p>This chatter will be irrepressible. But in my opinion it will all be wasted energy. It is absolutely not May\u2019s style to&#xa0;be looking for an early general election so soon after taking office. Her&#xa0;instincts, on this as on other matters&#xa0;of governance, are impeccably traditional. She believes the Conservative party won a mandate in May 2015, which she has inherited from David Cameron. She is personally untroubled by tabloid talk of needing to win her own mandate. Purists will say she is absolutely right about&#xa0;that.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, May is on the record as having said there would be no snap election under her leadership anyway. She said it on 30 June at the Royal United Service Institute <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\" title=\"\">in the speech that launched her bid to succeed Cameron</a>. It\u2019s there in black and white. She said it because she meant it, and in part because the markets needed to hear her say it so soon after the Brexit vote. Anyone who thinks that May is the kind of politician who says something so important without meaning it underestimates her, as many do.</p> <p>Nevertheless, May cannot wholly ignore the political and journalistic culture that she currently commands. Already, in the early weeks, there has been plenty of speculation about an early election, including yesterday in the Times by the no longer quite as influential as he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timmontgomerie\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie</a>. Labour\u2019s leadership contest has partly been triggered by the fear of just such a&#xa0;snap poll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f7c616108748942d44a11957953191e8bc7ecf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7c616108748942d44a11957953191e8bc7ecf7/702_33_1061_637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold Wilson in 1970, the year he called an early general election \u2013 and lost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold Wilson in 1970, the year he called an early general election \u2013 and lost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That talk is going to grow louder this autumn. Unless May utterly quashes the speculation, it will be the rumbling descant to the Tory conference in Birmingham in October.</p> <p>True, that speculation will mainly come from the press, many of whom still don\u2019t get it about May. The idea that&#xa0;a prime minister who takes over in mid-term is somehow illegitimate without a fresh mandate is a recent media conceit. It exemplifies a culture in which the media force politicians to jump through hoops. May, who is attractively disdainful about the media, will not be too troubled by that.</p> <p>Her backbenchers are another matter. Politicians rarely go for long without thinking about re-election. And a lot of&#xa0;Tory backbenchers are excited by the prospect of increasing the majority. The idea of hitting Labour while they are down, of seeing off Ukip before they&#xa0;can regroup, and of giving themselves more Brexit breathing space before having to go back to the voters is&#xa0;inevitably&#xa0;attractive.</p> <p>If the Tory opinion poll lead over Labour holds up at its recent double-digit level into the autumn \u2013 and this week\u2019s polls offer <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9746\" title=\"\">conflicting evidence on that</a> \u2013 election fever will increase. Pollsters will start asking about an early&#xa0;poll, Tory politicians will start being quizzed about one, and despairing Labour MPs may even start pleading for one, in the hope that Jeremy Corbyn would finally have to quit in the&#xa0;aftermath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\">Theresa May launches Tory leadership bid with pledge to unite country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, though, three immensely powerful reasons, in addition to May\u2019s own instincts, for caution. The first is that an early election is unnecessary. Prime ministers call elections either because they lack a majority, or because they have used up their legislative energy, or because they face a defining crisis. None of these conditions applies today; <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/\" title=\"\">May has a majority of 17</a>, there are more than three full parliamentary sessions still to run, and the Tories could not currently face less of a challenge than they do from Labour.</p> <p>The second is that the public dislike early elections. Voters take their responsibility seriously. They also seem to have a collective inner sense of whether an election is appropriate or not. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwAhWeb3-RY\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson in 1970</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-general-election-february-1974\" title=\"\">Ted Heath in 1974</a> both fell foul of that instinct, defeated in part because voters thought they were being called to the ballot boxes prematurely and for opportunistic reasons. Gordon Brown, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7031749.stm\" title=\"\">if he had called an election in 2007</a>, might well have discovered the same thing. An election this autumn or next spring would be even more premature and opportunistic.</p> <p>Which leaves the final, and most insurmountable objection of all: that the law effectively prevents it. Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act</a> 2011, the prime minister no longer has the power to call a general election off his or her own bat. If May wanted to call an early election she would therefore face daunting parliamentary and political hurdles before she could do so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Voters know when an election is appropriate. Harold Wilson and Ted Heath both fell foul of that instinct</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To comply with the act, she would have to ensure&#xa0;that two-thirds of MPs, 433 of the current 650, supported her. Even supposing that all 330 Tories did so, she would still need Labour votes. Yet why should Labour MPs become willing martyrs in an election that by definition the Tories thought they would win&#xa0;handsomely?</p> <p>The only alternative allowed by the act is for the government to contrive to lose a vote of confidence, confident in the knowledge that 330 Tories could then prevent another party forming an administration. That sort of Westminster game would be a hard sell to an electorate that already heartily disdains&#xa0;the political class.</p> <p>That leaves two options: first, simply repealing the 2011 act, which some constitutional specialists think would not restore the power to call an election to the prime minister anyway; or, second, passing a bill specifying that the next election will take place on such-and-such a date, in spite of the provisions of the 2011 act. Ideally, the act should indeed be repealed. But May\u2019s current honeymoon would struggle to survive the legislative shenanigans that such an effort would inevitably involve.</p> <p>So it could hardly be plainer. There&#xa0;isn\u2019t going to be an early election. Theresa May should say again, categorically, that there will not be. She would have been wise to say this before she headed for the hills. But she should say&#xa0;it as soon as she comes back to London at the end of the month.</p>"
