  "<p><br>In the wake of the spectacular Democratic convention it seems unreasonable even to hint at the possibility that Donald Trump might win. Such speeches! Such enthusiasm! Such ideals! Such drama and emotion! Such a pseudo-event!</p> <p>But a woman nominee \u2013 such a moment. And one to make Trumpland look ridiculous. Even that old lizard Bill Clinton was poignant in his way.<br></p> <p> But Bill Clinton is the author of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the president who ended Glass\u2013Steagall, the 1933 act that prohibited banks from engaging in the investment business. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton is going to the fight with Trump on a promise to at least look again at Nafta and reintroduce an equivalent to Glass\u2013Steagall to keep the banks in line. Thanks to Bernie Sanders, that\u2019s in the platform. So is a resolution to break up the banks that Congress bailed out \u2013 and didn\u2019t punish for their sins. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/emotion-watching-hillary-clinton-woman-candidate-for-president\">Hillary Clinton's speech was a powerful, primal first \u2013 and it blew me away | Xeni Jardin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hillary is also now committed to scuttling the Trans Pacific Partnership, which her new pal President Obama badly wants because it\u2019s a big part of his geopolitics. Hillary Clinton has a platform that really isn\u2019t hers. The Democrats are proceeding as one party, but in truth there are now two \u2013 one subscribes to neoliberalism and the other foreshadows its demise \u2013 and she has to represent both of them. Philadelphia was a beautiful and moving thing, and Democrats can only hope that all those tears of joy and love were enough to wash away the contradictions.</p> <p> This might be unfair. Whether she was driven there by Bernie Sanders or has chosen to renew her old Methodist vows to the poor and meek, Clinton is running on a progressive ticket now, and she might decide to make that the colour of her presidency. She promises to invest heavily in the cities to lift people out of poverty; to invest in infrastructure, create jobs, revive manufacturing and raise the minimum wage. The platform promises comprehensive immigration reform, an end to student debt, paid family leave and much else. It <em>is</em><em> </em>very likely what Sanders said it was \u2013 the most progressive platform in the party\u2019s history.</p> <p> Listening to her now, you might think that after years as a member of the supply-side economics church, Hillary Clinton\u2019s joined the revived and steadily expanding demand-side one. Could she in eight years reverse the engines of inequality and corruption, bridge the divides and enliven the democracy? Could she desegregate the cities? </p> <p>Could she get her country leading the world by example to save the planet from global warming? Could she do something about the lobbyists, the power of money in Washington that is destroying American democracy from within? Take on Wall Street? Make the effort on behalf of public decency and ordinary justice that was not made after the financial collapse? Could she get the public interest represented in Washington again? </p> <p>Could she do something about guns? In Chicago on the Memorial Day weekend, sixty-nine people were shot. Six died. As of 1 August, 401 people had been murdered in that one city in 2016, 90% of them with guns.</p> <p> Are <em>any</em><em> </em>of these things open to remedy? Probably not: the problems run too deep, but the effort would be uplifting and a more productive way to prove her country is exceptional than anything she might have in mind for bloodying foreign noses.</p> <p> Could she get American troops out of Afghanistan, the fifteen-year war she mentioned not once in her acceptance speech in Philadelphia? That might be the most unlikely of all.</p> <p> Nothing she says, old or new, will much impress voters who don\u2019t trust the Clintons, or think they reek of entitlement, lies and money. The hole she\u2019s punched in the glass ceiling won\u2019t impress them. But the prospect of Hillary and Bill back in the White House might lift their loathing into realms of mania. It will feel like the ultimate corruption, the ultimate insult, the ultimate proof that the system stinks.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to share this point of view to understand it. At the very least, her supporters could ask themselves what <em>they</em><em> </em>would be making of the $153m in speaking fees or the $1.8m she collected from speeches to the banks, if they were pinned to Donald Trump \u2013 or to Mitt Romney or John McCain. Ditto the emails. The reasonable fear is that Hillary Clinton will be tempted to pacify the haters by the military expression of exceptionalism.</p> <p> Clinton just <em>has</em><em> </em>to win. If she loses, not only does the world get Donald Trump (and the US Supreme Court his appointments): the Democrats will have to live forever with their decision to make their nominee the most qualified presidential candidate in history, but also the person most disliked by the American public and possibly the only one that Trump could beat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson\">This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p> We can hope that from her example great numbers of American women will draw inspiration, and believe that both wisdom and opportunity will deepen with their influence on public life. It should have been a moment of pure celebration, seeing Elizabeth Warren on the hustings with Clinton early in June. But you could feel the hackles rising on every neck in every bar in every swing state across the country. Warren mocking Trump, trading insults \u2013 and the guys in the bar think she\u2019s mocking <em>them</em><em> </em>and make a little resolution and write it inside their hats \u2013 \u201cVote this time.\u201d The triumph of one identity is the violation of another.</p> <p> Trump says, Hand your fear over to me. Hand your loathing over too. I will deal with your enemies as I have dealt with mine. I will give you back your freedom, and your country. Your old lives will be yours to live again. I will halt the terminal decline. American exceptionalism, in which you all hold shares, will be underwritten by an exceptional American.</p> <p> The Democrats scoff at Trump for wanting to take the country back to the past. But for many of the people whose votes will count in November, Trump\u2019s imaginary past is a more concrete thing to contemplate than the Democrats\u2019 imaginary present. Trump\u2019s also contains more hope, and it serves as a more believable American tomorrow. If, as seems likely, Clinton wins, it will not be out of love, or even hope, but rather out of fear. She can win by simply letting her deplorable opponent lose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f0255fd56edd51768f47b90182ee42e4ed20442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f0255fd56edd51768f47b90182ee42e4ed20442/0_0_1972_2764/713.jpg\" alt=\"Quarterly Essay Enemy Within by Don Watson\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quarterly Essay Enemy Within by Don Watson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quarterly Essay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, she\u2019s nothing if not adaptable, and she could yet see in these very favourable circumstances (the Republicans falling apart, negligible interest rates, a public appetite for radical reform) the chance to lead the nation\u2019s social and economic regeneration through, for a start, massive investment in education, renewable energy and infrastructure, and an equally massive legislative attack on inequality and political corruption. </p> <p>Call it a New Great Awakening or a New New Deal; it would owe something to both, and to Bernie Sanders as well, but also to her need to be more than the first woman president.

  "<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, told western foreign ministers that he hoped to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva over the next 48 hours, to try to agree a new cessation of hostilities in Syria.</p> <p>The two men had been hoping to announce a deal at the G20 in China on Monday, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/syria-peace-talks-us-and-russia-stall-g20\">the agreement collapsed in acrimony</a> after the US accused Russia of reneging on its previous commitments.</p> <p>Explaining the decision to schedule a new meeting, the Russian foreign ministry said: \u201cThe ministers worked through the remaining details of the agreement on the establishment of a Russian-American cooperation in the fight against terrorist groups operating in Syria, the expansion of access for humanitarian aid and the launch of an intra-Syrian political process.\u201d</p> <p>But a state department spokesman, Mark Toner, said although Kerry had a 45-minute conversation with Lavrov on Wednesday, there was not yet an agreement to meet again.</p> <p>\u201cThey talked about some of the remaining challenges they need to overcome on this arrangement. We\u2019re not there yet, but as the president said in China the other day, the expectation is that they will meet again in order to continue discussions on how we get to an arrangement or an agreement,\u201d Toner said.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThese technical issues are complex and we have not been able to reach a clear understanding between us and Russia on the way forward. Until we get there, we are not able to say one way or another whether we are going to get there \u2026 If we get there, it does provide a way to bring an end to the conflict, and that\u2019s worth pursuing at this point. But our patience isn\u2019t infinite.\u201d</p> <p>A US official echoed Toner\u2019s caution, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not fully confident we can reach an agreement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the sticking points focus around Aleppo, around al-Nusra, around delineating between where Nusra is and the opposition is, and around the next steps and how we get to a nationwide cessation of hostilities.\u201d</p> <p> Kerry spoke of the decision on a video link to London, where foreign ministers gathered for a conference with the Syrian High Negotiations Committee (HNC), the chief opposition negotiating body.</p> <p>Russia and the US have been discussing for months the terms of a comprehensive deal in which the air force of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, is brought under the effective control of Russia, and the US and Russia jointly coordinate legitimate targets for the Syrians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/syrian-government-chlorine-gas-aleppo\">Syrian government 'drops chlorine gas' on rebel-held part of Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US wants fresh assurances that Russia will sanction Syria if it breaks the terms of the ceasefire, but the Syrian air force has said it cannot tolerate being effectively grounded in its own sovereign territory. </p> <p>The proposed deal would include Jabhat al-Nusra \u2013 the powerful jihadi group that announced in July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">it had split with al-Qaida</a> \u2013 among the opposition groups the Syrians could target. </p> <p>The potential breakthrough gives a new relevance to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/syrian-opposition-coalition-to-announce-democratic-transition-plan\">blueprint for peaceful transition released on Wednesday</a> by the HNC.</p> <p>The document, the most comprehensive transition programme ever released by the body, allows for a six-month negotiation leading to the formation of a transitional governing body, responsible for running Syria for 18 months prior to UN-sponsored local, parliamentary and presidential elections. </p> <p>The HNC insists that Assad and his ruling clique would have to stand aside after six months, something the Syrian government dismisses as not credible. Disputes over Assad\u2019s future status prevented the Geneva peace talks process in the spring from making any serious progress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"261b0f373f323c4f2fb0af9a80027e663bd977d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/261b0f373f323c4f2fb0af9a80027e663bd977d9/0_136_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian boy is treated in hospital for breathing difficulties after an alleged chlorine gas attack in Aleppo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian boy is treated in hospital for breathing difficulties after an alleged chlorine gas attack in Aleppo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thaer Mohammed/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The HNC hopes its transitional timetable, with an emphasis on the role of women, the release of detainees, non-sectarian politics and pluralism, is a riposte to those that say there is no unified credible alternative to the Russia-supported Assad regime. The blueprint is also designed to persuade Hillary Clinton, the US Democratic presidential nominee, that a credible non-sectarian plan for a post-Assad Syria is available.</p> <p>The document proposes a decentralised state in which Kurds are offered a degree of autonomy, but not the full independence sought by many Syrian Kurds inside the YPG militia. The HNC stresses it is not seeking vengeance against the entire Assad apparatus, but will allow many of his clique either to remain in post or avoid justice at the international criminal court.</p> <p>But in a warning that Russia and the US alone cannot seal the fate of Syria, the chief opposition negotiator, Riyad Hijab, who defected from Assad\u2019s government in 2012 after serving as prime minister, said the HNC would reject any agreement struck by Russia and the US if it differed significantly from the HNC\u2019s terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/losing-ground-fighter-morale-is-it-all-over-for-isis-syria-turkey\">Losing ground, fighters and morale \u2013 is it all over for Isis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf what the Russians and the Americans agree upon is very much different from what the Syrians aspire to, then we shall not accept it,\u201d Hijab said. There is concern in parts of the heterodox HNC that Barack Obama, in search of a legacy in Syria, will scramble to secure a deal with Russia that many Syrians oppose.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, endorsed the HNC blueprint, saying that, if peace talks were to get back on track, \u201cit is obviously critical that the world and all the interlocutors in Geneva should be able to see that there is a future for Syria that goes beyond the Assad regime\u201d.</p> <p>Following talks with the HNC, he said: \u201cListening to everybody here, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that with common sense and flexibility and energy, this vision and this plan that Dr Hijab and his colleagues have put forward can be put into effect.\u201d</p> <p>The occasion allowed Johnson to recant discreetly on a previous claim that the west might need to ally with Assad in order to crush its primary enemy inside Syria, Islamic State.</p> <p>Fighting inside Syria continued this week, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/syrian-government-chlorine-gas-aleppo\">claims that a chlorine gas attack</a> had been mounted on Tuesday, hospitalising 100 in the city of Aleppo, the site of a brutal siege by the Syrian army. On Wednesday an airstrike in the same neighbourhood killed 10 civilians, activists said. </p> <p>There were also reports that Iraqi Shia militias had entered the city to support rebels in the fight to prevent Aleppo from being encircled by the Syrian army. </p>",
  "<p>Last week, Donald Trump spoke directly to a black Republican group in Philadelphia and at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/donald-trump-protest-black-detroit-church\">televangelist\u2019s church</a> in Detroit; his smallest crowds of the campaign compared to those where we\u2019ve seen black women and men among others physically attacked. This recent effort was made after failing miserably at what sounded at times like an attempt to become a black spokesperson, chiding and speaking bluntly on issues of concern to black voters in a manner traditionally reserved for ministers, comedians or motivational speakers with credibility and rapport \u2013 and an actual black audience.</p> <p>Just how convincing are these overtures to black voters? Are his attacks concerning the Clintons\u2019 \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies reaching their intended targets? Who indeed is the audience of Trump\u2019s black talk?</p> <p>The 12% support among black voters he once briefly enjoyed, according to a <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2324\">February 2016 Quinnipiac poll</a>, has been completely squandered during a run of offensive incidents too numerous list in this small column. Over the summer it <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-voters-trump_us_57a4a2a1e4b021fd98784a42\">fell</a> to 1%. So he projects.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton is a bigot!\u201d He now roars.</p> <p>Some of his remarks seemed aimed at the unabashed bigotry to which the Clintons appealed as the cornerstone of their centrist Democrat ideology in the 1990s.</p> <p>Bill Clinton was the most powerful of the law-and-order Democrats, and actually more punishing than the law-and-order Republicans. Many of us at the time called this out, wrote, talked, and rose against it.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to do nothing for African Americans, she\u2019s going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She\u2019s only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>But is Donald Trump really a righteous messenger, given his mob-leading role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">tumultuous racial politics</a> of 1980s New York City? Given his lack of apology or remorse over the five lives devastated by his one man campaign against \u201ccrazed misfits\u201d in New York in 1989? Given his \u201csouthern strategy\u201d and apparent embrace of the white identity movement, including his new campaign team led by <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/\">Lee Atwater</a> prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Roger Ailes and alt-right tribune Stephen Bannon of Brietbart News?</p> <p>\u201cThe Democrats have taken you for granted!\u201d Trump trumpets.</p> <p>This is everyday talk in any barber shop, parlor or sports bar, about most politicians. It has been for a good part of Donald Trump\u2019s 70 years.</p> <p>Minus her name, what part of the words, \u201cHillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future\u201d, didn\u2019t Malcolm X himself utter a time or two in messages like The Ballot or the Bullet?</p> <p>Regarding Trump, there is a saying about broken clocks being right on time twice a day. But Trump\u2019s not on time in his message to African Americans. He\u2019s simply restating a known known.</p> <p>People also know Trump intends to promote a \u201cnew civil rights agenda\u201d for our times in the same way they trust Clinton plans to follow through on the \u201cnew \u2018New Deal\u2019 for minorities in the United States!\u201d mentioned once so far only in an early Democratic debate.</p> <p>Did anyone else hear that?</p> <p> What these aspirations have in common is that either would be \u201cnew\u201d, coming from them.</p> <p>A politics of limited options leaves Black America (and all of the country) between the rock of Hillary \u201csuper-predator\u201d Clinton and a hard place called Donald Trumps\u2019 America: hostile, white-ruled, chauvinist and unreconstructed. Likely African American voters, from both parties, not just Democrats, are almost unanimous, in critical Ohio and Pennsylvania, in rejecting the message and campaign of Donald Trump. Never has a Republican nominee been so soundly rejected by a key segment of the electorate. His attempt to prosecute the undeniably devastating impact of the Clintons falls on deaf ears because he lacks all credibility.</p>",

  "<p>A former supreme court law clerk turned US senator warned on Wednesday that Republicans are \u201caiding and abetting in the destruction of the United States supreme court and the rule of law\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/\">Richard Blumenthal</a> delivered an impassioned plea at the steps to the court where a vacancy on the bench remains unfilled. Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, has now been waiting 175 days for a Senate hearing, longer than any other supreme court nominee in US history. </p> <p>For Blumenthal, an ex-federal prosecutor and state attorney who has argued cases before the supreme court, the battle is personal. Describing how he passes the court on Capitol Hill every day, the Democratic senator for Connecticut said: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that its power is based on a very thin thread of credibility. It has no army, it commands no police force, it\u2019s unelected, its members serve for life. What more undemocratic institution could you imagine?</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet the American people are willing to obey its every order because they have that same respect for it, that it is above politics. The Republicans are dragging this institution into the muck and mire of gridlock and partisan paralysis. They are not only diminishing but greatly endangering this court and that is unforgivable.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal added: \u201cThe Republican majority in the United States Senate is aiding and abetting in the destruction of the United States supreme court and the rule of law. It\u2019s really that simple and that grave.\u201d</p> <p>The nine-seat court has been one justice short since the death in February of long-serving conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/antonin-scalia-dead-us-supreme-court-justice-obituary\">Antonin Scalia</a>. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, several cases have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/16/us-supreme-court-merrick-garland-president-obama-contraception-mandate\">deadlocked or delayed</a>.</p> <p>As senators return to work after a seven-week summer recess, Blumenthal and some Democratic colleagues, along with former judicial clerks to Garland and legal scholars, lined up on Wednesday to urge Republicans to act on the nomination before the presidential election on 8 November. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/mock-confirmation-hearing-merrick-garland-senate-supreme-court\">insists that Obama\u2019s successor</a> must make the pick.</p> <p>Praising Garland, whom he has known for many years, Blumenthal added: \u201cThe irony here is that a completely non-political public servant also has been dragged into the muck and mire of political partisanship.\u201d</p> <p>The standoff comes in an election year in which many voters have expressed frustration at congressional inaction and intransigence, allowing candidates such as Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to thrive.<br></p> <p>Senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/\">Cory Booker</a> of New Jersey said: \u201cSo many people now are surrendering to cynicism about Washington. So many people are dismissing what goes on in this town often as \u2018politics as usual\u2019, but I want to make it very clear that this is not usual. This is not ordinary. This is not the regular course of events.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this is is an assault on the very foundations and ideals of our country. It is a betrayal of the ideals of both parties represented here in Washington. What we are seeing now is folks who claim to be in line with conservative values betraying those very ideals. Those who say they are in allegiance with the rule of law betraying those very ideals.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented moment in American history. We should sound the alarm because the pathway we are heading down now is dark and destructive.\u201d</p> <p>Senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.durbin.senate.gov/\">Dick Durbin</a> of Illinois warned that, with the court due to begin a new session in a few weeks, major legal questions are being left in limbo by the Republican agenda. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an agenda that has really been pushed forward by corporate interests, by Wall Street banks and by the Koch brothers. Let\u2019s call it for what it is. Look at the advertising in the Senate races across the United States. Who\u2019s paying for it? Who is trying to stop the new voices who want to come to the Senate and make a difference and fill the vacancy on the supreme court?\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, has said she supports the Garland nomination but has declined to commit herself to renominating him if she is elected president. Her rival Donald Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-releases-list-of-names-of-potential-united-states-supreme-c\">has issued a list</a> of conservatives he would consider, encouraging some Republicans to shrug off other concerns about him.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s press conference, organised by <a href=\"http://weneednine.org/\">We Need Nine</a>, a White House-allied group, was also addressed by former judicial clerks to Garland including Craig Green, 43, from Philadelphia. He said: \u201cI believe failure to hold those hearings is disgraceful and dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cIn partisan times more than ever, we need to believe that the supreme court and American law are more than political footballs. We need to believe that supreme court nominees are more than \u2018hooray for our team\u2019. It is not a partisan issue to demand hearings for a supreme court nominee after 175 days. Only the worst kinds of partisans and cynics would say something like that.\u201d</p> <p>There is little sign of movement, however. McConnell \u201chas been crystal clear for the last seven months\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-garland-idUSKCN11C2HM\">an aide to the senator told Reuters</a> on Tuesday. \u201cThe next president will select the nominee.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Labour MPs this week voted overwhelmingly to restore their power to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37281441\" title=\"\">elect the shadow cabinet</a>, a right they held from the party\u2019s early days until Ed Miliband abolished it in 2011. The motion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/jeremy-corbyn-call-bring-back-shadow-cabinet-elections\" title=\"\">proposed by Clive Betts</a>, was passed by 169 votes to 34 on Tuesday night. It requires Labour\u2019s national executive, which meets next week, to put a rule change to the party conference this month. If that happens, the parliamentary Labour party would elect a new shadow cabinet in the autumn. Labour would be wise to adopt Mr&#xa0;Betts\u2019 proposal. The issue may seem arcane. But its implications are profound.</p> <p>Harold Wilson often described Labour as a broad church. He was right. The party has always been a formal and informal coalition of interests and views. In the old industrial Britain in which the Labour representation committee was created in 1900, Labour\u2019s formal coalition was based on trade unions and socialist societies. Over the years, reflecting social and economic changes of many kinds, individual membership took on greater significance. In the last two decades, much of that institutional and cultural texture has been scrapped in favour of the centralisation of power around the party leader. That was a mistake on many grounds. It should now be carefully undone.</p> <p>Labour badly needs to re-energise its own traditions of coalition and pluralism. The surge of support for Jeremy Corbyn is a powerful part of that process. Even Mr Corbyn\u2019s strongest critics need to recognise that. But it is not the only thing that matters. The party needs, as a whole and as a matter of urgency, to live better with inevitable differences of interest and view. It should do that for reasons of liberal principle and of self-interest. No one who remembers or knows about past divisions, notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/the-fight-for-labours-soul-what-the-partys-brutal-1981-split-means-today\" title=\"\">the breakaway of the Social Democratic party in 1981</a>, should want a return to that. Both the 1981 split itself and the culture of internal bitterness that went with it deprived 1980s Britain of an effective opposition. The need to prevent a repetition is very pressing indeed.</p> <p>Labour will not survive as a coherent potential party of government if one group seeks to obliterate the others. The past 12 months have proved that, as the New Labour era also did. Things cannot and must not go on this way. Labour cannot afford a repetition, whatever the result of the leadership contest. Voters who wish the party well or who rely on the prospect of an alternative government deserve better. For Labour to descend into internal wars about candidate selection \u2013 a live danger when new constituency boundary proposals are published next week \u2013 would be a betrayal.</p> <p>The reintroduction of shadow cabinet elections within the PLP will not solve all these problems at a stroke. But it would be a recognition that one of Labour\u2019s priorities must be to live with itself, so that it can begin the process of becoming an effective opposition and a potential party of government again. That, after all, is what the Conservative party factions are trying to do after the referendum. Labour meanwhile is in denial. Mr Betts, who is not a partisan figure, proposed his motion on the basis that it would be part of a process of coming together after the leadership election. Mr Corbyn should now embrace that approach too.</p> <p>There are many reasons why. First, shadow cabinet elections would enable the leader to put together a better team than he has now. Second, it would be a much needed sign that both sides are prepared to do things differently. Third, the leader would still be able to add some shadow picks of his own choice and would retain control of the distribution of briefs. Fourth, it would make Labour a much more convincing force in parliament and beyond. Fifth, it would respond to the desperate wish for unity and effectiveness among Labour\u2019s members. Sixth, it would send a signal to the non-Labour parts of Britain that Labour wishes to be a party of government, not merely an oppositional movement.</p> <p>Many will view the PLP\u2019s proposal as a power grab. Yet all sides need to move away from seeing everything as a zero-sum game. The change might actually help Mr Corbyn as well as calm his MPs. If&#xa0;he is re-elected, the last thing Mr Corbyn should want is to continue battling with a recalcitrant internal opposition. An elected shadow cabinet might mean he had to work with MPs he has clashed with. But it would also be a sign that they were readier to work with him. Labour needs to move on from a destructive struggle for control. This might at&#xa0;least help to give the party a chance.</p>",
  "<p>The fight for democracy in Africa is, these days, centred on the tiny, oil-rich country of&#xa0;Gabon. It is not a new fight, by any means. In 2009, after the death of longtime leader Omar Bongo \u2013 who had ruled the former French colony for more than 40 years \u2013 riots broke out in several cities when it was announced that his son, Ali Bongo, was slated to become the next president. Opposition leaders called foul after presidential election results were announced, and they attempted to organise a nationwide strike. Now, seven years on, Ali Bongo has run up against a new, wider wave of protests, after he claimed he had won re-election, on 27 August, with a lead of just over 5,000 votes in a nation of 1.8&#xa0;million. Street clashes with police led to several deaths. Opposition supporters set fire to the parliament building. Yet Mr Bongo remains defiant. He has accused his critics of attempting a coup and he has rejected calls for a recount of votes and even for election results to be published in detail. At one point he had his main opponent, Jean Ping, who says the election is being stolen, placed under house arrest. There were also government efforts to impose a media blackout, including by cutting off the internet. The situation on the streets has since eased, but tensions still run high in this central African country.</p> <p>Gabon\u2019s crisis is watched closely by France and neighbouring African states. France has a key military base as well as important economic interests in the region and has called for a recount, but it wants to be careful not to appear to meddle directly for fear of being accused of neocolonial reflexes. Whether outside mediation can help resolve a situation where two men, Mr Bongo and Mr Ping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/both-sides-in-gabon-presidential-election-claim-victory-ahead-of-count\" title=\"\">both claim to be the legally elected president</a> will now be put to the test: the African Union announced this week that it would send a delegation to Gabon.</p> <p>None of this is made easier by the complex web of family ties that have long stood at the heart of Gabonese politics. Mr Ping, 73 years old, a former president of the African Union commission, was one of Omar Bongo\u2019s closest and longest-serving ministers and married one of his daughters. He now describes Gabon as \u201ca dictatorship pure and simple, run by a clan\u201d \u2013 a \u201cdynastic regime\u201d that must be ended. But there is hardly any doubt that he has solid reasons to complain about vote manipulation. A mission of European Union observers <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gabon-election-election-idUSKCN11C112?il=0\" title=\"\">said there were \u201cobvious anomalies\u201d</a>. Mr Ping hopes international pressure will bear down on Mr Bongo, who clearly believes time is on his side because no external player is ready to consider anything like outright intervention.</p> <p>Many of Gabon\u2019s citizens certainly want its political course to change. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/16/gabon-yawning-poverty-gap-end-dependency-oil\" title=\"\">population is poor</a> and the economy has slumped with the fall of global oil prices. Families struggle for food day to day. Mr Bongo\u2019s rule has been tainted by many allegations of corruption, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/06/france-africa-autocrats-corruption-inquiry\" title=\"\">not least the ownership of luxury cars and apartments in Paris</a>. Gabon has only had three presidents since its independence in 1960. Mr Bongo, 57, may have tried to project the image of a younger leader, but his repressive methods are fast placing him in the same category as other strongmen who hang on to power as if mandates were for life. The unrest that has broken out reflects deep-seated popular anger. Gabon\u2019s civil society, like those elsewhere in Africa, wants its voice to be heard, and democratic procedures to be respected.

That is how to approach it.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not be right for me or this government to give a running commentary on negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately after prime minister\u2019s questions, May made a statement to the Commons on this week\u2019s G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, beginning with an update on the Brexit process.</p> <p>While giving no more details, she promised a specific British variant on non-membership association with the EU, one that would be \u201cambitious and bold\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt is not about the Norway model or the Swiss model or any other country\u2019s model \u2013 it is about developing our own British model.</p> <p>\u201cSo we will not take decisions until we are ready. We will not reveal our hand prematurely and we will not provide a running commentary on every twist and turn of the negotiation. And I say that because that is not the best way to conduct a strong and mature negotiation that will deliver the best deal for the people of this country.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Corbyn said it was clear there had been a lack of planning for a Brexit vote. \u201cThe prime minister said she wouldn\u2019t reveal her hand on this subject. Nobody would blame her because she hasn\u2019t revealed her hand or indeed any of the government\u2019s many hands. They\u2019re unclear on what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe accept the decision taken by the majority of our people but we cannot ignore the fact that the outcome has left this country divided, with rising levels of hate crime, huge uncertainty about what comes next for our country, the extraordinary lack of planning and preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn said negotiations \u201cmust focus on expanding trade jobs and investments and defending social and environmental protection\u201d.</p> <p>During prime minister\u2019s questions, Corbyn chose not to take the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/jeremy-corbyn-challenge-brexit-plans-pmqs-owen-smith\">advice from his leadership challenger</a>, Owen Smith, to press May on the Brexit deal, instead asking a series of questions on housing, some again submitted by voters.</p> <p>May dealt with the specific queries neutrally, but interspersed her answers with a series of scripted jibes at Corbyn and Labour.</p> <p>After Corbyn mentioned a question put by one voter, May quoted one Twitter response the Labour leader had received to a request for possible subjects, saying that \u201cin a recent poll on who would make a better prime minister, \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 scored higher than Jeremy Corbyn\u201d.</p> <p>May added: \u201cWhat we do know is that whoever wins the Labour party leadership, we\u2019re not going to let them anywhere near power again.\u201d</p> <p>It later emerged that the Twitter user she was quoting \u2013 Lewis Collins \u2013 had made a series of unpleasant remarks on Twitter, including apparently racist comments about recent attacks on Polish people in Essex.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign said: \u201cJeremy was raising a very serious question about the housing crisis and Theresa May chose to respond with a pre-written joke quoting someone who has used racist language on Twitter. If this is the level of research she does for PMQs, it\u2019s no wonder the Tories had no plan for Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Following another question, May made reference to Corbyn\u2019s much-publicised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-virgin-trains-disputes-claim-over-lack-of-seats\">disagreement with Virgin Trains</a> over whether or not a service he took to Newcastle was full.</p> <p>\u201cEverything he says just tells us all we need to know about modern Labour,\u201d May said. \u201cThe train has left the station, the seats are all empty, the leader\u2019s on the floor. Even on rolling stock they\u2019re a laughing stock.\u201d</p>",

Trump only called for an end to the defense cuts, arguing that deep cuts in the military \u201cinvite more aggression\u201d and, without increased spending, \u201cwe will have aggression like you\u2019ve never seen before\u201d.</p> <p>At the time the sequester went into effect, the Republican nominee dismissed its impact. He <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/2013/02/24/trump-looming-sequester-its-being-overexaggerated\">told Fox News</a> in 2013 that concern about it was \u201cover-exaggerated\u201d and dismissed naysayers, saying \u201ca lot of things are not going to happen that people are thinking are going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton called for an end to the sequester at a speech to the American Legion in Cincinnati on 31 August. \u201cWe cannot impose arbitrary limits on something as important as our military,\u201d the Democratic nominee said. \u201cThat makes no sense at all. The sequester makes our country less secure. Let\u2019s end it and get a budget deal that supports America\u2019s military, our families, and our country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump proposed to use the increased defense budget to expand the army to 540,000 people, the navy to 350 ships, and the air force to at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, as well as to develop a missile defense system. A number of the recommendations were based on a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank based in Washington that Republicans have long relied on for policy recommendations.</p> <p>The size of the armed forces has been reduced in recent years, with the army <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/07/09/army-outlines-40000-cuts/29923339/\">moving towards a long-term goal</a> of reducing its force to 450,00 active duty soldiers.

Every state in the union will be able to take part rebuilding our military and developing the technologies for tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee provided few details about how this massive increase in spending would be funded. Trump talked vaguely of \u201ccommonsense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks\u201d as well as \u201creducing the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition\u201d. One specific measure Trump suggested was \u201crespectfully asking Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them\u201d.

Trump admitted to reporters on Monday that the setting may have led to his more strident than expected tone.</p> <p>\u201cYou had 15,000 people and 10,000 outside and they were going wild,\u201d Trump told reporters on his aircraft. \u201cA lot of that the noise was unbelievable, it\u2019s possible when you make a speech like that you\u2019re better off doing it for 150 people in front of the Washington Press Club.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/06/will-the-us-elections-be-hacked\">Will the US elections be hacked?

The PM was relatively weak on detail, but she did try to turn the argument into a wider one about values, and about home ownership, and on these points Corbyn\u2019s responses were thin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-pokes-fun-at-jeremy-corbyn-during-pmqs-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/522mv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2698623\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May pokes fun at Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d00586e4b042bbfb32432d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-pokes-fun-at-jeremy-corbyn-during-pmqs-video\">Theresa May pokes fun at Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T13:27:21.874Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cff659e4b042bbfb3242da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:18:18.445Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says only a year ago May voted against a Labour amendment to the housing bill saying all homes in the rented sector should be fit for habitation. The Treasury is losing \u00a3500m a year from unpaid tax from landlords in the housing sector. Unpaid tax, poor quality homes - doesn\u2019t this require government intervention.</p> <p>May says the government has intervened. Thousands of landlords face further action. Corbyn may have a model of society where he does not want to see private landlords. But that is not what she wants. She wants people to have opportunities.</p> <p>Corbyn says he recognises the case for a mixed housing economy, but he does not want to see people pay excessive rent. Women\u2019s Aid has raised concern about the cuts to housing benefit. Does May accept that very vulnerable women could be affected by the closure of these refuges. Will May ensure the cap on housing benefit does not apply to refuges.</p> <p>May says the government is working on exempting women\u2019s refuges from the housing benefit cap. But the government has a very good record on domestic violence, she says. </p> <p>It is 50 days since she and Corbyn last met at the despatch box. It is good to see him sitting there. The Conservative government has been working tirelessly, she says. She mentions the public sector audit, and work on new trade deals. What a contrast with the party opposite, divided amongst themselves, and incapable of uniting the country.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGP078eWFWI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gGP078eWFWI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:53:26.202Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cff590e4b0b2ee83375e5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:13:24.542Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says there is a housing crisis in Britain. Some \u00a39.3bn is paid from housing benefit into the pockets of private landlords. Is that money well spent?</p> <p>May says Corbyn asked about home ownership, but than objects to a measure that helps people have homes. Corbyn may have an ideological objection to the private rented sector. Everything Corbyn tells us everything we need to know about Labour. The train has left the station, the leader is on the floor, even on rolling stock, they are a laughing stock.</p> <p>Corbyn says David Cameron said every penny spent on housing subsidies was money that could not be spent on new housing. He quotes someone saying landlords should be fined for renting homes in poor condition. Does the PM think this is satisfactory?</p> <p>May says, if housing benefit is such a bad thing, why did Labour oppose cuts to housing benefit. The rules for landlords have been changed, she says. New rules are being introduced for houses in multiple occupation. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cff498e4b0b2ee83375e57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:09:56.736Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> starts off also congratulating Team GB.

But the government wants to do more, she says.</p> <p>Corbyn says house building is 45,000 a year less than under the last Labour government. He quotes from a note from Jenny. She and her partner work in a supermarket. They have been told they can borrow \u00a373,000. So there is not much hope for them. George Osborne said there would be one to one replacement for homes sold under right to buy. But only one home gets build for every five homes sold. When will one to one replacement come in?</p> <p>May says Corbyn is wrong. The government has delivered on one to one replacement. Corbyn has asked his followers on Twitter for questions. May says she looked at them. He got on from Lewis saying don\u2019t know scored higher than Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister.

Perhaps the same reticence about standing up for Britain\u2019s place in the EU which led you to campaign so ineffectively for Remain also puts you off exposing the weaknesses and contradictions in the Government\u2019s position \u2013 but continuing to fail to take Theresa May on over Brexit would be a dereliction of duty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are the specific questions that Smith proposes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following her experience at the G20 summit this weekend, does the PM regret not campaigning harder for Britain to remain in the EU?</p> <p>The PM has said on a number of occasions that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d.

They want the UK to stay within the single market. But the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union says this is \u201cimprobable\u201d. Does the PM agree with the Japanese Government or her own Secretary of State?</p> <p>President Obama said at the G20 that the USA\u2019s priority would be to pursue trade deals with the EU and with Pacific countries \u2013 not to do a deal with the UK. Does the PM plan to persuade the United States to change its diplomatic priorities, and if so how?</p> <p>Over the last few months a points-based immigration system has been proposed by the Foreign Secretary, the International Trade Secretary, the International Development Secretary, the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary. Can the PM confirm that she disagrees with all of them?</p> <p>A points-based immigration system was one of the Leave campaign\u2019s key promises.

Indeed it was one of the issues that marked him out against the Manila oligarchy\u2019s continuity candidates. It is difficult to understand the extent and level of resentment there is to diplomatic, economic and cultural American dependency among the general public, but any leader bold enough to call for \u201ca <a href=\"http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/philippine-president-elect-duterte-names-cabinet-members\" title=\"\">foreign policy reset</a>\u201d was an obvious, and much-demanded opportunity for change.</p> <p>The terms of this foreign policy reset have not been stated, or the reset process even thought through. This has been a chaotic couple of months for the nation, and the administration is without any short-term direction, other than the mass of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/kill-list-phillipines-duterte-mass-murder-china-united-states-rivalry-war-on-drugs\" title=\"\">extra-judicial killings</a> in the war on drugs. As a former US colony, the Philippines is unlikely to dilute US influence quickly, and Duterte\u2019s overt anti-colonial tone is, thus far, mere words. Words that are only causing the country embarrassment and not redressing the unbalanced US-Filipino relationship. Duterte\u2019s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dutertes-obama-insult-was-shameful-but-the-west-has-turned-a-blind-eye-to-much-much-worse-64037\" title=\"\">sensitivity to condemnation</a> of his murderous crusade against drugs and his <a href=\"http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/09/05/1620717/duterte-obama-asean-summit-laos-extrajudicial-killings\" title=\"\">assertion of sovereignty</a> is yet to be backed up with any actual shift in foreign policy.</p> <p>The most obvious change would be to deny or limit US access to military bases \u2013 on this Duterte has so far been quiet.

Relics of previous eras of cosy US-Filpino relations in the shape of Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base (the two largest overseas US military bases) were <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-bases-idUSKCN0UR17K20160113\" title=\"\">back on the table</a> and US aircraft were quickly relocated from Korea to Clark. <a href=\"http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/04/26/japan-and-australia-ramp-up-defence-engagement-in-the-south-china-sea/\" title=\"\">Further deals with Japan and Australia</a> have also locked in regional alliances against China.

His brand of anti-American populism is certainly a few notches below that which helped Hugo Chavez to power in Venezuela, but it is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/the-guardian-view-on-venezuela-chavismo-fights-for-survival\" title=\"\">dangerously isolationist path</a> to take, as most Venezuelans would now attest.</p> <p>Many in the state department should also welcome a different relationship with the Philippines that could be good for Filipinos \u2013 rooting out corruption rather than furthering it, aiding economic stability for investment and economic development.

  "<p>On 15 August 1975, the Indian government hosted a lavish party. It had good reason to celebrate: not only was it marking 28 years of independence from British rule, but the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1984/nov/01/india.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Indira Gandhi</a>, had declared the date \u201cIndependence from Smallpox Day\u201d. For decades, India was considered the endemic home of the disease, accounting for some 60% of globally reported cases. Yet in the space of just one year, infections had fallen from 188,000 to zero, thanks to a combination of disease surveillance, vaccination and publicity.</p> <p>Yet as <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/12/08-041208/en/\" title=\"\">Donald Henderson</a>, head of the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) global smallpox eradication programme, who has died aged 87, left the celebrations in order to catch a flight to Bangladesh, he received word that the borders were closed. The Bangladeshi military had staged a coup; the president and his family were dead.</p> <p>It was a pivotal moment in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, a disease that had until recently killed some 2 million people each year. To get this far, Henderson and his team had overcome political resistance, ineffective vaccine stocks, floods, famine and civil war. They had stopped cars in the streets of the former Yugoslavia to vaccinate people, and gone house to house in remote regions of India to nip outbreaks in the bud. Now, eight years into the campaign, Bangladesh was the final refuge for <em>Variola major</em>, the most infectious form of the virus, and the country was threatening to fall apart.</p> <p>Fearing that a tide of refugees might trigger fresh outbreaks, or even reimport the disease to India, Henderson deployed large numbers of health workers to the border to step up surveillance, and vaccinate as required. Fortunately, the predicted influx never arrived. A few weeks later, the borders reopened and WHO\u2019s teams went back to work. In November 1975, Bangladesh reported its final case of smallpox and, two years later, the world\u2019s last case was identified in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/07/31/206947581/last-person-to-get-smallpox-dedicated-his-life-to-ending-polio\" title=\"\">Ali Maow Maalin</a> \u2013 a Somali cook from the port city of Merca. The world was finally declared smallpox-free in 1979.</p> <p>Despite our best efforts, smallpox remains the only human disease to have been completely eradicated from the planet. \u201cIf the Nobel prize in medicine was not so focused on basic science, Henderson and the smallpox team would surely have shared it,\u201d said Chris Beyrer, Desmond Tutu professor of public health and human rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \u201cThe eradication of that ancient, disfiguring and often fatal viral scourge is surely one of the single greatest triumphs of public health in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Known as \u201cDA\u201d to many, Donald Ainslie Henderson was born in Lakewood, Ohio, the son of David, an engineer, and Eleanor (nee McMillan), a nurse. He graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio in 1950, which is where he met his future wife, Nana Bragg, whom he married the following year. After obtaining a medical degree from the University of Rochester in 1954, Henderson started a residency at a hospital in Cooperstown, New York, but was then required to do two years of military service. Fearing that as a newly qualified physician he would spend his time conducting relatively mundane assessments of new recruits, he instead opted to join the US Epidemic Intelligence Service \u2013 a boots-on-the-ground disease detective unit at the then Center for Communicable Diseases (CDC), responsible for identifying the source of outbreaks and clearing them up.</p> <p>In 1961, Henderson became chief of the surveillance section at the CDC, and established a smallpox surveillance unit in 1962. It was the beginning of a relationship with smallpox that would come to dominate his life.</p> <p>In 1966, the World Health Assembly narrowly voted in favour of undertaking a global eradication campaign for smallpox. When Henderson was approached about leading it, he was initially reluctant: he had only recently been given the green light for a smallpox eradication and measles control programme in west and central Africa which he would lead, and the $2.7m allocated for global eradication was not even enough to buy the required vaccine. The prospects of success seemed doubtful, and many \u2013 including the director general of the World Health Assembly \u2013 expected it to fail.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Henderson accepted the challenge, and moved his family to Geneva to work at WHO headquarters. Having already worked on plans to eradicate smallpox from parts of Africa, Henderson believed that trying to vaccinate everyone against the disease was futile; there wasn\u2019t enough funding nor, as he soon discovered, enough effective vaccine \u2013 quality control tests revealed that just 10% of available vaccine actually protected against smallpox.</p> <p>Instead Henderson focused on surveillance and containment. Understanding that smallpox spreads like wildfire, he asked every health centre and hospital to produce a weekly report; as soon as a case of smallpox was identified, a team was dispatched to identify and vaccinate everyone that that person had been in contact with, and their contacts. He also insisted that everyone regularly rotated through the field, regardless of their seniority. \u201cNo one was allowed to dictate policy from Geneva or Washington who was not out regularly in the field and engaged in the actual work of the effort,\u201d Beyrer recalled.</p> <p>Henderson himself regularly visited smallpox-affected countries and filed detailed progress reports, although he primarily viewed his role as a catalyst: it was the countries themselves that defeated smallpox.</p> <p>Even then, as Henderson often pointed out, they barely succeeded \u2013 and he was sceptical about the potential for ridding the world of other diseases. Three months after the world was declared smallpox-free, Henderson was asked to address a meeting convened to decide which disease should be eradicated next. He said he didn\u2019t think there was any candidate disease.

  "<p>A detailed transition plan for Syria, committing the country to democratic and religious pluralism, has been unveiled by an alliance of moderate opposition groups.</p> <p>The move comes as the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urges Russia to end its support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>The High Negotiation Committee (HNC), an umbrella body representing more than 30 political and military forces seeking to wrest power from Assad, unveiled its 25-page plan at a meeting in London. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Johnson and his counterparts from the EU, Turkey, the US and Gulf states, were in attendance. </p> <p>Prior to becoming foreign secretary, Johnson had been sceptical about the value of supporting the Syrian opposition, saying there was a case for making common cause with Assad to defeat Islamic State. </p> <p>But Johnson has now embraced the HNC statement.

  "<h2>Why is a $25,000 campaign donation Donald Trump made in September 2013 to Pam Bondi, a Republican running for re-election as Florida\u2019s attorney general, now such a big deal?</h2> <p>Trump circumvented Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules by routing the money through a charitable entity, the Donald J Trump Foundation, which is prohibited by law from making political donations. More controversially, however, Bondi\u2019s office was at the time mulling whether to join a New York state probe into allegations that customers who paid thousands of dollars to Trump University, Trump\u2019s for-profit education company, for a real estate investment course were ripped off. Just days after Trump\u2019s donation arrived, Bondi dropped her investigation into the alleged fraud, citing \u201cinsufficient grounds\u201d to proceed. </p> <h2>The donation was three years ago. Why is the case back in the news now?</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">Donald Trump fires up crowd with attack on Clinton's 'disqualifying conduct'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story gained some traction in June when the <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e16a8223c24048d290883370dc6abe5b/florida-ag-asked-trump-donation-nixing-fraud-case\">Associated Press reported</a> that Bondi had personally solicited the donation from Trump to a political group supporting her re-election campaign. But last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">Washington Post report</a> that Trump had paid the IRS a $2,500 penalty for the \u201cimproper\u201d contribution sparked renewed scrutiny, quickly followed by a <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/pam-bondi-trump-never-spoke-clarification\">\u201che-said, she-said\u201d disagreement</a> this week over whether Trump and Bondi had ever actually discussed the affair. </p> <h2>So if Trump paid the IRS a penalty, does he admit he did wrong?</h2> <p>Not at all. The fact that Trump\u2019s charity made the unlawful donation instead of Trump himself was \u201cjust an honest mistake\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">according to Jeffrey McConney</a>, senior vice-president of the Trump Organization. So, apparently, was the fact that the Trump Foundation\u2019s tax filing for that year did not record the donation to Bondi\u2019s group, but did claim that a $25,000 gift was made to a charity in Kansas with a similar-sounding name, even though no such donation appears to have been made. In the words of the Washington Post, \u201cthe prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent sounding but non-existent donation\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s nonsense, insists McConney, who said Trump immediately reimbursed his foundation and filed corrected paperwork with the IRS as soon as the \u201cerrors\u201d were brought to his attention in March by the Post and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.</p> <h2>And what of Bondi? Is she also contrite?</h2> <p>Despite flak from several Florida newspapers and the suggestion from the Miami Herald that she was <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article82634527.html\">\u201cbought and paid for\u201d</a>, the state\u2019s abrasive attorney general \u2013 who has publicly endorsed Trump for president \u2013 remains defiant. Having always insisted her office never formally investigated Trump University, and found no basis to do so, Bondi was forced on to the defensive on Tuesday after Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-pam-bondi-donald-trump-2016-9\">spoke to reporters about the controversy</a>. \u201cI will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign, nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton,\u201d Bondi <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/09/06/florida-ag-bondi-wont-be-bullied-by-hillary-clinton.html\">told Fox Business Network</a>.</p> <h2>So has the scandal run its course?</h2> <p>Unlikely. Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-pam-bondi-trump-university_us_57cf2c6ce4b0a48094a64854\">disclosed late Tuesday</a> that Trump subsequently allowed Bondi to use his sumptuous Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach for a $3,000-a-head re-election fundraiser in March 2014, just months after she dropped the fraud probe. The new revelation raises further questions over whether Trump was thanking Bondi, and could weaken his own line of attack against Clinton over the sourcing of her own campaign donations.</p>",

Video by Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger</em></li> </ul> <p>In recent years the US has begun to reckon with its role as the world\u2019s biggest jailer, home to a manifestly unequal justice system that disproportionately punishes poor people of color. In diagnosing the causes of this problem much of the focus has centered on sentencing reform, but in a country where <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/devils-bargain-how-plea-agreements-never-contemplated-framers-undermine-justice\">95% of criminal cases are settled by plea deal</a>, little attention has been given to the critical state of indigent defense. Around the US, defenders routinely report an increase in overburdening and underfunding, caused by a variety of structural, political and economic drivers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Up-to-date figures are scant, but <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_aid_indigent_defendants/ls_sclaid_def_expenditures_fy08.authcheckdam.pdf\">according to a 2008 estimate by the American Bar Association</a>, state and county governments spent a total of $5.3bn on indigent defense systems a year, just 2.5% of the roughly $200bn spent on criminal justice by states and local government every year. The depth of crisis varies in each state, indicative of the complex patchwork of defense systems that are funded and administered differently dependent on jurisdiction. </p> <p>In Missouri, for example, where the defender office is funded entirely at the state level, Governor Jay Nixon has <a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/legislature-gives-governor-takes-away-public-defender-system-increase/article_319f5927-f50b-52a8-ab64-b5e607d84667.html\">repeatedly blocked</a> the passage of state legislation to cap defenders\u2019 workloads and increase their funding. Most recently, <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/less-new-money-for-public-defenders-in-missouri-as-governor/article_3962607e-b4cf-586b-b491-f18d7c6f96a7.html\">in July</a>, Nixon withheld $3.5m of a relief fund approved by the state legislature to hire additional staff. As a result, the Missouri system is chronically overburdened, <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/events/legal_aid_indigent_defendants/2014/ls_sclaid_5c_the_missouri_project_report.authcheckdam.pdf\">according to a 2014 study</a>, which found the office was in need of 270 more staff to meet increasing caseloads. </p> <p>Instead, said the director of the state\u2019s defender program, Michael Barrett, the office has lost 30 staff members since 2014 due to funding cuts, and is taking on 12% more cases \u2013 now 82,000 a year. Barrett said this meant defenders were often juggling upwards of 150 cases at a time, with an average of $350 available for each client, ranging from minor misdemeanor cases to non-capital murders. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In Cole County, Missouri, defenders work more than 225% above the recommended caseload limits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLet\u2019s put that in context: if you or I were to hire counsel for a simple DUI, it would cost thousands of dollars,\u201d Barrett said. </p> <p>Last month, Barrett took a novel approach to mitigate the crisis. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/missouri-public-defender-jay-nixon-governor\">attempted to compel Nixon</a>, a former<strong> </strong>attorney general and private-practice lawyer, to represent a 50-year-old illiterate white man in Cole County \u2013 a right Barrett claimed he has under state law.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the extraordinary circumstances that compel me to entertain any and all avenues for relief, it strikes me that I should begin with the one attorney in the state who not only created this problem, but is in a unique position to address it,\u201d Barrett wrote. </p> <p>The case itself was not extraordinary, Barrett said, but the defender\u2019s office in Cole County is one of the most overburdened in the state, where defenders work more than 225% above the recommended caseload limits. </p> <p>At a preliminary hearing weeks later, a judge handed down a single-page ruling which found that Barrett did not have the authority to compel the governor. \u201cI was disappointed but not surprised,\u201d said Barrett, adding that the case has now been assigned to one of his own overloaded attorneys. </p> <p>The situation in Kentucky, another state-funded system, is a little different; funding difficulties are tied to the legislature rather than the governor\u2019s office. Although the defender program was spared from <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/kentuckys-governor-dramatically-cut-education-funding-now-he-s-getting-sued-22c46d80f48#.do3rqljga\">sweeping budget cuts across the state</a>, earlier this year the state senate rejected a <a href=\"http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Ky-Court-Concerns--600-jobs-in-jeopardy-while-millions-in-additional-resources-cut-from-budget-373765891.html\">$6.2m budget increase</a> handed down by a sympathetic Republican governor, Matt Bevin, which would have created 44 new positions in the defender\u2019s office.</p> <p>Kentucky defenders took on average <a href=\"http://dpa.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/601051E3-4025-4452-B205-3A69B0612B58/0/AnnualReportFY2015optimized.pdf\">448 cases in the past year</a>, 54% above recommended national standards. Attorneys take on 11% more cases than they did a decade ago, and in areas such as Louisville now take close to double the national standard. The department received $49m last year \u2013 less than 0.5% of the overall state budget. </p> <p>Even in Colorado, a state-funded system where the defender\u2019s office is subject to a number of legislative safeguards that makes it one the most well funded in the country, agency executive Doug Wilson said his department was operating at a 10% staffing deficit. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you we\u2019re fully funded and everything is peachy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you, we\u2019re in better shape than most agencies across the country.\u201d</p> <p>In Utah, an estimated 62% of all misdemeanor defendants had no access to counsel at all, and at the very least 35% of public defense attorneys are overloaded with cases. Again, the root causes are different. Indigent defense is funded entirely at the county level, and in all but two counties indigent defense is provided by contracted attorneys \u2013 rather than defender\u2019s offices \u2013 who are subjected to no state oversight and are paid a fixed fee per case. As such, concluded <a href=\"http://sixthamendment.org/6ac/6AC_utahreport.pdf\">a recent study by the Sixth Amendment Center</a>, defense providers in most of Utah are essentially incentivized to work their cases quickly instead of effectively, and are thereby systematically subjected to a conflict of interest. </p> <p>But perhaps nowhere in the US is this crisis felt more acutely than in Louisiana, where Americans are incarcerated at a higher rate than any other state, and where the defender system is already on the brink of meltdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Unlike any other state, Louisiana pays for its defense system primarily through speeding tickets and other local revenue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/idsus0812.pdf\">Unlike any other state</a>, Louisiana pays for its indigent defense system primarily through speeding tickets and other locally generated revenue, rather than guaranteeing funds through the budgeting process. As a result, the finances of each defender\u2019s office are subject to an extraordinarily high level of uncertainty, especially in districts without major highways \u2013 and during floods and other emergencies, when the police and courts are doling out fewer tickets.</p> <p>Earlier this year, that unstable system was thrown into further disarray by Louisiana\u2019s worst budget crisis in decades, which came in the wake of a steep drop in oil prices and years of tax-slashing by former governor Bobby Jindal. Around the state, defenders went into triage, putting thousands of their clients on waitlists for a lawyer.<br></p> <p>But national attention on the crisis has waned, in part because conditions have improved in the city that receives no shortage of media coverage, New Orleans. After receiving a small influx of funds, the public defender\u2019s office there ended its hiring freeze while reducing its waitlist to fewer than 40 defendants.<br></p> <p>Out in Louisiana\u2019s 63 other parishes, however, much of this summer\u2019s improvement in the indigent defense system is shallower than it appears. In Caddo Parish, the courts have addressed the public defender\u2019s funding problems by appointing all the lawyers in town \u2013 including tax, real estate and adoption attorneys \u2013 to the cases that were being neglected, which has superficially resolved the waitlist. In Winn Parish, a prosecutor is now working part-time as a defender, another makeshift and constitutionally questionable way of making do in the absence of funding.<br></p> <p>In the 16th judicial district, up to 50 poor defendants are convicted and sentenced \u2013 at once \u2013 for major felonies carrying up to decades in prison, while the single public defender representing all of them struggles to present any of the facts and arguments in their separate cases. And in the 20th district, exactly one lawyer is now employed to run a defender\u2019s office that covers two parishes and more than 900 cases.</p> <p>Over the next two days, the Marshall Project, in collaboration with the Guardian, will focus on the dire state of public defense in Louisiana and the often bizarre coping strategies some parishes have been forced to take.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b05f26fae394d34b37bdde19c720e677732734ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05f26fae394d34b37bdde19c720e677732734ef/129_0_1898_1139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"piles of legal paperwork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louisiana\u2019s funding of public defenders \u2013 primarily through local court fees and traffic tickets \u2013 has left the system on the brink of meltdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How bad is the picture around the country? Frustratingly, the scale of the problem remains unknown as dozens of states and jurisdictions produce no reliable data at all on the condition of their public defense systems. </p> <p>The last nationwide survey of public defender offices was carried out almost 10 years ago by the Department of Justice\u2019s bureau of justice statistics (BJS). The findings were stark: <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/clpdo07.pdf\">73% of county-operated defender systems</a>, utilized in 27 states, were functioning above the maximum recommended caseload level. </p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/spdp07.pdf\">22 state centralized defender programs</a>, 15 ran on caseload levels that exceeded the recommended case limit. In a world of meagre measurement and inadequate oversight, many argue the findings were a significant underestimate of the nationwide strain on the system.</p> <p>In 2013, the BJS embarked on a follow-up survey, aiming to examine all forms of indigent defense systems \u2013 not just the defender\u2019s offices examined in 2013. But the process has been arduous. Although the department has had a full response rate among state-administered offices, only 70% of county-based programs have responded, meaning publication of this side of the research may be delayed until spring of next year. </p> <p>Suzanne Strong, the statistician leading the research, described many of the county-based systems as a \u201ccompletely unknown universe\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the urgency of the crisis, recognized by both the US attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-delivers-remarks-white-house-convening-incarceration-and\">Loretta Lynch</a>, and her predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eric-holder-defendants-legal-rights-undermined-by-budget-cuts/2013/08/22/efccbec8-06bc-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html?utm_term=.774ebf342613\">Eric Holder</a>, the issue remains intractable. Congressional bills offering defender\u2019s offices easier access to federal grant money have gone nowhere. </p> <p>And in an election year during which Hillary Clinton has explicitly promised to \u201creform our criminal justice system from end to end\u201d, dealing with the crisis in funding defense of the poorest people coming before the courts does not feature on her platform for change. Donald Trump, who has promised to be \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d, has a vision for reform that goes no further than a vow to appoint \u201cthe best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country\u201d.</p> <p>In Washington, Democratic congressman Ted Deutch introduced in 2013 the <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3407\">National Center for the Right to Counsel Act</a>, legislation that would create a private, non-profit centre to provide training, research initiatives and grant funding to defender\u2019s offices around the country. Although the legislation was endorsed by a spectrum of legal groups, including the American Bar Association, it got nowhere in the House and was subsequently reintroduced last year.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of bipartisan conversation here about criminal justice reforms, but most of that is focused on sentencing reform,\u201d Deutch said. \u201cWe will continue to struggle with mass incarceration if we don\u2019t do something to stop the system from feeding people into our prisons.</p> <p>\u201cIn Washington, it sometimes takes a long time to help people recognize the problem that exists and that we have to grapple with.\u201d</p> <p>A few days spent in the courtrooms of rural Louisiana might be a start.</p> <ul> <li><em>Tomorrow, the ruinous effects of Louisiana\u2019s inadequate public defense funding, leaving real estate and adoption attorneys \u2013 and even prosecutors \u2013 to fill the gaps</em></li> </ul>",

He proudly wears a Trump hat, as do many other morning members, and when the talk turns to politics, he is clear about why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f765b6d7cc7302695fd00cb9ad4ba622a13f1026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f765b6d7cc7302695fd00cb9ad4ba622a13f1026/0_23_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darvin Burchet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darvin Burchet: \u2018My father was a coalminer.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSociety has fallen apart and the economy has gone to hell.

Why am I busting my ass while he isn\u2019t and doing just as good?\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the table nods as he speaks. \u201cMy father was a coalminer. Almost everyone here\u2019s father was a coalminer. We all grew up poor, but had what we needed. It was a community. When someone\u2019s house burned to the ground, we all helped out to rebuild it.

Orbin was a teacher and a bluegrass musician, and Benny worked in the factories up north before returning home.<br><br>When I ask them about the town\u2019s changes, they take turns speaking, weaving their voices into one. \u201cWe used to be self-sufficient here.

It is a change that is clear in the statistics. While coal jobs in the region having dropped <a href=\"http://www.kentuckycoal.org/documents/Kentucky%20Coal%20Facts%20-%2014th%20Edition.pdf\">40% in last decade</a>, and coal production 60%, <a href=\"http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Floyd-County-Leads-Ky-in-Overdose-Deaths-315420251.html\">deaths from overdoses have surged.</a> Unlike in other towns struggling with drugs, there are few visible signs. The streets are clean, without discarded needles, and homes well kept. There are no clusters of people milling about on corners.</p> <p>The impact is clear, though, above the city, on a mountaintop that once was mined for coal but is now home to a rehab center, run by Mountain Comprehensive Care, one of the town\u2019s largest employers. The center is the temporary home to dozens of men and women drawn from all across eastern Kentucky; all are intent on ridding drugs from their lives, or following a mandate that they do so.</p> <p>One of them is Jerri Baird, 27, raised in a small home four miles from the closest town. Her dad was a nurse, and her grandfather mined coal. She started using drugs at 14. Her stresses came from many directions, including growing up gay in a Pentecostal church. \u201cI was bad in school. Didn\u2019t ever feel I fit in. Grandfather smacked me in the face when he found out I liked women. Strong coalminer slap. Right across the face.\u201d</p> <p>Like many others, she notes the drugs offered relief from the boredom. \u201cThere was nobody doing nothing where I come from. Nobody working. Nothing.\u201d When I asked her what she planned to do when back in town, she looked quizzical. \u201cLike for work? I mean, there are no good jobs around. I done a few things. Clerked at restaurants, gas stations. Those sort of things. But that isn\u2019t much of work to brag about.\u201d</p> <p>The loss of coal and the increase in drug use is felt in the heart of the community, in churches similar to the House of Worship. The city has more than two dozen that fill every Sunday. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc34e84dc1023e076d0cc74b46a2bff44750ca68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc34e84dc1023e076d0cc74b46a2bff44750ca68/0_389_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"man washes another man's feet in church\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foot-washing: the ritual takes place every year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Highland Free Will Baptist church David Garrett, 66, has been preaching for decades.

  "<p>Alex Salmond, Scotland\u2019s former first minister, has warned US voters that Donald Trump is an emotionally stunted \u201cmanchild\u201d who presents \u201ca real and present danger to the security of the American republic\u201d.</p> <p>Salmond said his many dealings with Trump over the property tycoon\u2019s controversial golf course near Aberdeen and a nearby windfarm had persuaded him that Trump was so unstable that the prospect of him becoming US president \u201cshould give us all the heebie-jeebies\u201d.</p> <p>Salmond said he was still unclear whether the Republican candidate\u2019s attacks on Mexican immigrants and Muslims were political calculation or genuinely held racist views. </p> <p>\u201cIt is a matter of debate as to whether it is more comforting to believe that a candidate says disgusting things not because he believes them but because he thinks they might benefit him in a campaign,\u201d Salmond said in <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/alex-salmond-says-dealings-donald-8778906#ICID=ios_DailyRecordNewsApp_AppShare_Click_Twitter\">an article for the Daily Record</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an open question whether a demagogue is preferable to a genuine racist.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/20/alex-salmond-donald-trump-scotland\">Why did Alex Salmond take so long to turn on Donald Trump? | Anthony Baxter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Salmond then linked Trump\u2019s candidacy to the famous attack ads used by the US Democrats in 1964 against the then Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, which stated: \u201cIn your guts you know he\u2019s nuts.\u201d</p> <p>As head of the Scottish government and the MSP for Gordon, the constituency around Trump\u2019s estate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/03/scotland-donaldtrump\">Salmond played a key role in the developer\u2019s successful quest to build \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d</a> in Aberdeenshire against heavy opposition from Trump\u2019s neighbours and Scotland\u2019s major environment organisations. </p> <p>Salmond had endorsed Trump\u2019s claims that he was justified in bulldozing a legally protected dunes system, designated as a site of special scientific interest under the UK\u2019s environment laws, because the resort would create thousands of jobs and involve a \u00a3750m sports, hotel and housing development of national importance.<br></p> <p>In fact, eight years after winning approval for the resort, Trump now only employs 95 people, many of whom are seasonal or part-time, and has only invested about \u00a330m in the course, a single-storey club house, and a small boutique hotel. </p> <p>The two men fell out after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/donald-trump-loses-windfarm-scottish-golf-resort\">Trump furiously attacked a small experimental offshore windfarm being planned several miles from his course</a>, which was backed by Salmond and many of Trump\u2019s other local allies, including the Robert Gordon University and Sir Ian Wood, an influential industrialist.</p> <p>That dispute made him \u201ca target for bizarre Trump ravings\u201d, Salmond wrote, adding: \u201cTrump swings from public support to extreme opposition with no intervening period whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed in the course of a single phone call he would veer alarmingly from bonhomie, to bullying, to pleading and then back to a jocular mood. Emotionally he is a Peter Pan \u2013 the boy who never grew up.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this disagreement between us was just about wind turbines! Imagine the consequences if similar phone calls were taking place from the oval office, not Trump tower, and the subject matter was not wind power but hard power \u2013 the use or deployment of military force and nuclear weaponry.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond urged the Democrats to repeat their \u201cDaisy\u201d attack advert used against Goldwater. \u201cIt shows a lovely young girl counting daisy petals from one to 10, which then morphs into a countdown to a nuclear strike from 10 to one. Its purpose was to highlight the danger of a Goldwater presidency,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cAs this presidential campaign now reaches its climax, they should consider using such an approach again.</p> <p>\u201cBecause while many disgruntled Americans are still attracted to the Trump anti-establishment, anti-Washington, anti-big government rhetoric there are only a few who want to risk a manchild in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is indeed out there because: \u2018In your guts you know he\u2019s nuts\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s distaste for Trump\u2019s Islamophobic and anti-migrant rhetoric is not new.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> held his first comeback rally, he sweated profusely on a small stage in a stuffy and spartan gymnasium in the south of France.</p> <p>The rightwinger\u2019s modest choice of venue last month to launch his campaign to become his party\u2019s 2017 presidential nominee contrasted strikingly with the glitzy, US-style stadium gigs that became a trademark of the man once known as President Bling Bling. </p> <p>In 2012, when Sarkozy ran for re-election and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/francois-hollande-becomes-french-president\">lost to the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>, his rallies were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/fraud-claims-nicolas-sarkozy-2012-campaign\">theatrical mega-productions</a>, slickly coordinated by dedicated film directors, with specially laid carpet for his luxury dressing rooms and tens of thousands of euros spent on French flags to be waved by a sea of adoring fans.</p> <p>Those mega-rallies came back to haunt him this week when the French state prosecutor recommended Sarkozy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/nicolas-sarkozy-may-face-trial-alleged-illegal-campaign-funding-france\">should face a criminal trial</a> over alleged illegal campaign funding. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">Le comeback kid?

The limit on presidential campaign spending in France is \u20ac22.5m (\u00a319m), and investigators suspect Sarkozy\u2019s campaign spent \u20ac23m on top of that. Sarkozy has always denied any wrongdoing in the case, or even any knowledge of Bygmalion, an events company that allegedly concealed the overspend.</p> <p>The prosecutor\u2019s recommendation that Sarkozy face trial is a serious knock to his attempt to win back power next year on a platform of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">hardline identity politics and a security crackdown</a>. The man presenting himself as a model of \u201cFrench authority\u201d is suddenly facing the possibility of standing in the dock.</p> <p>But Sarkozy is defiant. He has hit back with the same argument he has used about a string of legal investigations that have dogged him since 2012: that he is innocent of any wrongdoing and that he is the victim of a plot against him by political enemies in cahoots with the justice system. </p> <p>\u201cNo controversy, no manoeuvring, no manipulation \u2013 however shameful it may be \u2013 will deter me from my absolute determination to bring about a change in power,\u201d Sarkozy told a rally west of Paris on Tuesday night. \u201cI love France!\u201d he thundered. \u201cTrying to discourage me from my passion is inhuman \u2013 it\u2019s not possible!\u201d The crowd cheered and applauded. \u201cI like people who have their ups and downs, who don\u2019t complain, who grit their teeth,\u201d he told supporters.</p> <p>Sarkozy\u2019s strategy of presenting himself as a victim is likely to comfort his unfailing support base inside his own Les R\u00e9publicains party. The news that the state prosecutor wanted Sarkozy to stand trial came on the same day as a major fraud trial opened against Hollande\u2019s onetime senior lieutenant and budget minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/03/french-tax-fraud-hollande\">J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac</a>, who is accused of tax evasion and money-laundering \u2013 raising eyebrows on the right about the timing of the announcement. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b33e77082d0636a678a40564b9d016a56f86932\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b33e77082d0636a678a40564b9d016a56f86932/0_95_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sarkozy election rally in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Sarkozy election rally in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But outside this devoted, narrow support base, Sarkozy\u2019s legal woes could prove a slow poison that permeates the right\u2019s primary campaign. Voters on the broader right and centre who will nominate their presidential candidate in November might decide that the spectre of a court case is too damaging to Sarkozy\u2019s chances of winning back the presidency. <a href=\"https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/060916/corruption-les-yeux-grand-fermes\">Fabrice Arfi</a>, the investigative journalist for Mediapart, described Sarkozy\u2019s claims he was being victimised by the justice system as a \u201cBerlusconian gesture\u201d. It will be difficult to have to keep answering questions on this during the primary race TV debates.</p> <p>And yet, as has often been shown, legal investigations are not necessarily a mortal blow in French politics. Other political figures have happily skipped up the French ladder of power unburdened by hefty legal baggage that might have pulled them down in other countries \u2013 not least the former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/jacques-chirac-guilty-corruption\">Jacques Chirac</a>.</p> <p>Nothing prevents Sarkozy from continuing to run to be his party\u2019s presidential candidate. He is innocent until proven guilty. It is now up to an investigating magistrate to decide whether to put Sarkozy on trial. This decision may or may not come before the right\u2019s primary vote. Any trial is unlikely to happen before the presidential race next spring. In any case, if Sarkozy were to be chosen as the right\u2019s candidate, then ran for president and won, he would have presidential immunity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fc934f5ad58b588e120d196716ce4af39eebb0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fc934f5ad58b588e120d196716ce4af39eebb0a/0_127_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarkozy supporters wave flags at 2012 campaign event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarkozy supporters wave flags at 2012 campaign event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Parrot/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarkozy\u2019s name has been cited in such a bewildering array of legal investigations \u2013 from allegations of illicit campaign funding from the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/19/french-inquiry-gaddafi-sarkozy-2007-campaign\">Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/18/sarkozy-kickbacks-pakistan-arms-sales\">alleged kickbacks from arms sales to Pakistan</a> used to fund an earlier campaign \u2013 that voters have almost lost count. Sarkozy is under investigation for corruption and influence-peddling in a case based on phone-taps about an alleged bid by him to get information from a judge ahead of a legal decision. Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing in all the cases. Some other key investigations against him have been dropped, including allegations he accepted campaign donations from the L\u2019Or\u00e9al shampoo heiress <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/loreal-nicolas-sarkozy-bettencourt\">Liliane Bettencourt</a> when she was too frail to know what she was doing. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how much political capital will be made out of Sarkozy\u2019s legal difficulties by his opponents. Alain Jupp\u00e9, the former prime minister and mayor of Bordeaux, who remains favourite to win the right\u2019s nomination, has vowed to avoid the issue and \u201crefrain from making personal attacks\u201d. For good reason. In 2004, he himself <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/04/france.jonhenley\">received a 14-month suspended sentence</a> and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt 1980s scheme that illegally put workers for Chirac\u2019s political party on the payroll of Paris\u2019s town hall. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/14/france.jonhenley\">The conviction</a>, however, has not damaged him. It is accepted that he did not profit personally and instead he is seen as having selflessly taken the flak for Chirac.</p> <p>But another opponent, Sarkozy\u2019s former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, shows no sign of letting up. Even before the state prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, he warned in a scathing speech: \u201cThose who don\u2019t respect the laws of the Republic should not be allowed to run. There\u2019s no point in talking about authority when one is not beyond reproach. Who can imagine for a moment General de Gaulle being under criminal investigation?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a proxy war going on in the New South Wales Liberal party right now. It is about the party rules: who can join, how they join and what they get when they join.</p> <p>It is factional, in that the people generally who support \u201cdemocratisation\u201d of the rules tend to be on the right. The hotbed for this movement is in the Liberal heartland on the north shore and northern beaches of Sydney. </p> <p>Supporters of reform are generally more likely to support Tony Abbott than Malcolm Turnbull. The moderates, closer to the centre and more likely to support the current prime minister, are against the changes given the moderates already control the party\u2019s state executive. </p> <p>The right want to open up branch structures, establish plebiscites to give all members a say in the preselection of the local member and have even considered primary elections.

With hindsight, it has become clear to Abbott what might have been. </p> <p>Enter the assistant minister for cities and digital transformation, Angus Taylor, at the beginning of his political career rather than at the end. On Tuesday, he chose to speak to the Sydney Institute on this topic \u2013 not in a cursory, veiled way but in a strap-on-the-vest kind of way. (As if it had been neatly choreographed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/john-howard-urges-turnbull-and-baird-to-change-rules-of-nsw-liberal-party\">Howard backed in Taylor</a> in his National Press Club speech on Wednesday.) </p> <p>Taylor\u2019s charges against the NSW party include:</p> <ul> <li>people are regularly stopped from joining branches in order for powerbrokers to maintain control;<br></li> <li>people are regularly stopped from establishing branches for the same reason;<br></li> <li>as a result, the Liberal party is in danger of losing future elections and losing a valuable engagement with the community.</li> </ul> <p>He gave a concrete example of trying to establish a Cowra Liberal party branch \u2013 a site he chose because it was far from the \u201cbrutal\u201d internal factional battles of inner city Sydney. The state executive rejected the application, saying there was too much risk of another faction (centre right) coming in to stack the branch, take control of the numbers and thereby increase its power in state council. </p> <p>\u201cWhether you agree with party reform or not, I don\u2019t think anyone can seriously contest the proposition that the effect of all this is discourage some good Liberal supporters from joining the party,\u201d Taylor said.</p> <p>The moderates say that they need to control the party so they can get the best talent up, given ordinary party members tend to be more rightwing than the parliamentary party. This reflects the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/23/bill-shorten-optimistic-labor-will-overhaul-longstanding-party-rules\">Labor reform</a> struggle, where the ordinary party membership tends to be more leftwing than the parliamentary party. </p> <p>But if that is the party \u2013 too left or too right \u2013 why not reflect it?

In a passage that was remarkable for a Republican less than eight years after George W Bush left office, Trump condemned democracy promotion overseas. \u201cI believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability instead of using our military to create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldn\u2019t care less about democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to force democracy down their throats and they don\u2019t even want it.\u201d</p> <p>At a town hall earlier on Tuesday, Trump criticized the US intervention in Libya as part of Nato in 2011.

We could have had a minor attack.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did\">supported the intervention</a> at the time.</p> <p>The attack on Clinton\u2019s interventionist foreign policy came the night before Trump will hold a major address on defense policy in Philadelphia. He is expected to call for the end of the sequester and a significant increase in military spending. He is also expected to condemn Clinton\u2019s foreign policy of regime change and democracy promotion.</p> <p>In addition to policy, Trump used much of his speech to give a fervent indictment of the ongoing controversy of Clinton\u2019s emails, which he said was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d. In his view, \u201cWe can\u2019t have someone in Oval Office who doesn\u2019t know meaning of words \u2018confidential\u2019 or \u2018classified\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Trump condemned Clinton\u2019s use of the software BleachBit to wipe her servers \u2013 \u201cshe bleached her emails\u201d \u2013 and raised questions about a Clinton aide destroying her discarded phones with a hammer. \u201cWho uses 13 different iPhones in four years?,\u201d Trump asked. \u201cThe only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very \u2013 I mean very \u2013 shady activity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fe30b402afb42c89ca12c0d47da02a20fd6c948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fe30b402afb42c89ca12c0d47da02a20fd6c948/0_17_2837_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump gestures to supporters at the campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump gestures to supporters at the campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump also suggested that something ominous had happened to Bryan Pagliano, the IT worker who maintained Clinton\u2019s server and invoked the fifth amendment in lieu of testifying to Congress on the matter. \u201cHe pleaded the fifth and where is he? We never heard about him again,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>As Trump summed it up: \u201cIn history there has never been a situation like what\u2019s going on with Justice and Hillary Clinton. There has never been a situation like what\u2019s going with the media and Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also continued to compare Clinton to German chancellor Angela Merkel, calling her \u201cAmerica\u2019s Merkel\u201d and saw potential parallels in Merkel\u2019s party losing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">regional elections in Germany on Sunday</a>. \u201cSee what happened to Angela Merkel? They had a massive defeat recently in the elections.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did outline one new policy detail at the rally. The Republican nominee pledged that, if elected, \u201cI am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants that they will lose access to our visa programs and many more little goodies.\u201d Losing access to US visa program would effectively mean that residents of those countries would not be able to visit the US for any reason.</p> <p>He tied the issue to risk from immigrants committing crimes, in particular Syrian refugees whom he once again called \u201ca Trojan horse\u201d. Unusually, Trump thought about history in expressing his concern about a potential threat from those fleeing the Syrian civil war. \u201cIn 200 years, 400 years, I don\u2019t want people to be reading about it or talking about it,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>Trump also pledged that he would have the US military submit a plan to defeat Isis within 30 days of taking office. This marked a shift from <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/donald-trump-i-know-how-to-defeat-isis-but-im-not-gonna-tell-yet/\">his statement</a> in May 2015, before he formally announced his candidacy, that he already had a plan to defeat Isis but that he wanted to keep it secret because: \u201cI don\u2019t want the enemy to know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to his speech on defense policy on Wednesday, Trump is also scheduled to address the presidential convention of the Conservative party in New York City and participate in a televised forum with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer.</p>",

Icac commissioner David Ipp made no finding of corrupt conduct against Roozendaal.</p> <p>Roozendaal went to Yuhu after he decided to leave politics in 2013 with six years to run of his parliamentary term. This allowed Ernest Wong, a prodigious Labor fundraiser, networker and former deputy mayor of Burwood, to be parachuted into his seat in the NSW upper house. </p> <p>At the time, Dastyari, then the general secretary of NSW Labor, said it was a mistake not to have a voice representing the Chinese community in parliament, given the former Chinese member Henry Tsang had resigned in 2009. (I would be the last person to argue there should be even fewer Asian representatives in the parliament.)</p> <p>Wong is a master of joining Chinese community and politics.

Huang also gave $3.5m to the University of Western Sydney to establish the Australia-China Institute of Arts and Culture. </p> <p>Late last year, Fairfax reported that Andrew Stoner, the former deputy premier, leader of the NSW Nationals and state trade minister, had been hired by Yuhu to provide advice on the agribusiness sector. <a href=\"http://www.andrewstoner.net.au/\">Stoner has a consultancy</a>. Cameron Hill, former press secretary to trade minister Andrew Robb and now a media consultant, took over Yuhu\u2019s media relations after his boss retired last year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/06/sam-dastyaris-labor-party-liberal-party-donations\">Sam Dastyari's dire straits show parties must abandon the myth of money for nothing | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his negotiations for the Chinese, South Korean and Japanese free-trade agreements, Robb built important bridges with the Chinese community, which took a long time to forgive John Howard after he suggested the pace of Asian immigration should be slowed in the late 80s.

Last year he attended his \u201cgiving day\u201d, a function Huang held as<a href=\"http://www.acpprc.org.au/english/events/givingday2015.asp\"> president of the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China</a>. On that day $743,000 was given to eight Australian charities including the Children\u2019s Medical Research Institute at Sydney\u2019s Westmead hospital. </p> <p>Huang also looked west to spread his generosity. A week before the Dastyari story broke, Fairfax reported the West Australian Liberal branch had benefited through contacts with Julie Bishop from <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/foreign-minister-julie-bishops-links-to-chinese-political-donors-20160823-gqzauy.html\">$500,000 worth of donations in the past two years</a> from Chinese businessmen, including Huang.</p> <p>All of the above is on the public record. And none of it is to suggest Huang Xiangmo, Minshen Zhu or any other Chinese donor has done anything wrong or illegal. Everyone seeks workers with skills and contacts, in government and outside. The other point to make is Anglo businesses also have networks and links into government that are potentially beneficial. But, without full disclosure, we will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/06/sam-dastyaris-labor-party-liberal-party-donations\">never know whether benefit is real or imagined</a>.</p> <p>Either way, the whole affair has again sparked a debate which should make everyone with an interest in politics question whether any donation is given to buy influence. In the rush to smack Labor, the Coalition has argued that the $1,670 Dastyari payment is different because it was request for a debt. If money buys influence, it buys influence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a8e9380ffcbb822d5b2a7e1031bdc0f2e682d82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a8e9380ffcbb822d5b2a7e1031bdc0f2e682d82/156_54_4577_2746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Dastyari\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the rush to smack Labor, the Coalition has argued that the $1,670 Dastyari payment is different because it was request for a debt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Australian Chinese community is inexperienced in using political donations to satisfy political requests,\u201d Huang wrote for the Global Times. \u201cWe need to learn \u2026 how to have a more efficient combination between political requests and political donations.\u201d</p> <p>It was an explosive entry for a man who rarely talks to the media, notwithstanding this enlightening interview with <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/chinas-local-emperor-huang-xiangmo-says-politics-just-like-sport-20160901-gr66xc\">Primrose Riordan for the Australian Financial Review</a>.

He was criticized by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who called his speech \u201cconfusing\u201d and said it was unrealistic to remove the estimated 11 million people living in the US without documents. </p> <p>In the interview, McCain appeared to disagree with that assessment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2019 not doable is rounding up 11 million people and putting them across the southern border,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat\u2019s not doable and, of course, not to mention what it would do in many other aspects.
