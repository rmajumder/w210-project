  "<p>If this were any other weekend, the US intelligence community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">formally accusing</a> Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee and meddling in the presidential race would be the dominant story. But before anyone had time to process the implications on Friday, another story broke, and the immolation of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign became the only subject anyone wanted to discuss. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, this new low point in US-Russian relations will be a major challenge for Hillary Clinton in the increasingly likely event that she is inaugurated in January.</p> <p>In the past few weeks, the already poor US-Russia relationship has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. In Syria, Russia has helped launched a brutal assault on the opposition stronghold in eastern Aleppo, shocking the world and prompting the secretary of state, John Kerry, to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/us-suspends-talks-with-russia-over-syria/index.html\">suspend</a> bilateral ceasefire efforts with Moscow. </p> <p>Russia, in turn, has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-nuclear-idUSKCN1230YN\">suspended participation</a> in a nuclear arms treaty. Its government also lodged a complaint against a UN official who <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/161afebf5804419b93f7c6306d438cc1/apnewsbreak-un-criticism-trump-prompts-russian-response\">condemned alleged Kremlin ties</a> with the Trump campaign, which have been frequently suspected though never proven.</p> <p>All of this forms a backdrop for Friday\u2019s unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement\">joint statement</a> by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, which stated that the US intelligence community \u201cis confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations\u201d.</p> <p>The real news here is the announcement, since its underlying substance has been suspected for months. Ever since WikiLeaks released hacked DNC emails on the eve of last summer\u2019s Democratic convention in Philadelphia, revealing the party\u2019s apparent bias against Bernie Sanders, US officials have pointed to Russia as the likely culprit. The Clinton campaign has encouraged this by implying that Trump is a Kremlin agent and that Vladimir Putin is trying to install him in the White House.</p> <p>But as I wrote for the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/russia-hack-america-not-help-donald-trump-win-election\">last month</a>, this isn\u2019t necessarily Putin\u2019s plan. There are plenty of reasons for Russia to interfere with the US political process short of attempting to select a president, especially one as erratic as Trump. At the very least, such tactics are consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/09/kremlin-hall-of-mirrors-military-information-psychology\">disinformation campaigns</a> Russia has launched in neighboring countries such as Ukraine and Estonia, spreading confusion and undermining faith in the legitimacy of democratic institutions. And if Clinton becomes president, Russia, if it is WikiLeaks\u2019 source, has already demonstrated an ability to cause her headaches by releasing damaging information about her at inopportune moments. </p> <p>Clinton is often accused of being a hawk on Russia, and certainly Putin seems to perceive her that way. When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Clinton did not mince words, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/hillary-clinton-says-vladimir-putins-crimea-occupation-echoes-hitler\">comparing Putin\u2019s actions</a> to \u201cwhat Hitler did back in the 30s\u201d, a comment that was not received well in a country that sacrificed millions of people to defeat the Nazis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/russia-putin-trump-us-politics-sanders-supporters-response\">Russia may be meddling in US politics. Where is the left-wing outrage? | David Klion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Clinton\u2019s history with Russia is more complicated than that. As Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Clinton spearheaded a good-faith attempt to reset relations with Russia, which was taking a four-year break from Putin\u2019s presidency under the seemingly more liberal Dmitri Medvedev. As Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xxBvEXrG3_A?t=3472\">told me last year</a>, the reset broke down in part because of the 2011 US intervention in Libya, for which Clinton was a leading advocate and which Medvedev declined to veto in the UN security council. The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8958475/Vladimir-Putin-lashes-out-at-America-for-killing-Gaddafi-and-backing-protests.html\">infuriated</a> Putin, who returned to the presidency in 2012 and has clashed with the Obama administration on foreign policy ever since.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is mostly consistent with Obama\u2019s. A notable exception is Syria; <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/\">as she told the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg</a> in 2014, she advocated for more US support for the Syrian opposition as secretary of state, and there is reason to think she will be more confrontational in Syria than Obama has been. Regardless of one\u2019s feelings about the Syrian conflict itself, this approach will inevitably face pushback from Russia, which is deeply invested in preserving Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Clinton will take office facing an already hostile Russia, and it\u2019s very possible things will get worse from there.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cyberwarfare between the US and Russia could become the new normal. Both countries have plenty of officials with potentially damaging secrets just waiting to be exposed. Absent any pretense of cooperation, the hacks could quickly escalate, and neither Clinton nor Putin may be prepared for the fallout.</p>",

It puts Trump in the realm of the irredeemable. Until now, he occupied that particular spot as the pre-redemption character in a feelgood movie. Maybe he was racist because his jet-set lifestyle had never supplied him any Mexican or Muslim friends; he was sheltered, but one day, like Clint Eastwood in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/20/gran-torino-film-review-clint-eastwood\" title=\"\">the movie Gran Torino</a>, he would move in next door to a family of immigrants, and realise they were just as hard-working as he was. Or his daughter would have an unwanted pregnancy, and he would realise that life was complicated.

There is no story arc for this man, no journey; he can get no better, and we already knew that he could get no worse. So his narrative is broken. He can no longer be the anti-hero of his own film; he can only be the villain in somebody else\u2019s.</p> <p>If this is the end of Trump, that will be boon enough. But there are wider lessons here, for we\u2019ve now seen what happens to politics when its agents excise, despise or for any other reason fail to recognise the female point of view. This is apparent not just in Trump\u2019s excesses, but in the idiocy of the Brexit debate, its lunkheaded machismo studded with the fictions that become necessary when your authority has no basis.</p> <p>Our own Nigel Farage is, of course, a link between this kind of politics on both sides of the Atlantic and as chief British cheerleader for Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\" title=\"\">he mounted a spirited defence</a> of his soulmate this weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s not running for pope, he\u2019s running for president,\u201d he said and that revealed much, not least that to Farage, treating women as something other than meat is piety sufficient for sainthood. There was another message too, that those roles are men\u2019s by definition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\">Nigel Farage defends Donald Trump over 'alpha-male boasting'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have always rejected the idea that a female point of view even exists in politics, for three reasons. First, just because we\u2019re women doesn\u2019t mean we all agree; and the suggestion that we should is a textbook and profound political sexism of its own, rendering us less by denying us the freedom to individuate. Second, a conception of \u201cwomen\u2019s politics\u201d always takes as its starting point a demand for equality, and it makes no rational sense to limit that demand to equality between genders. There is no inequality between genders that isn\u2019t interlaced with inequalities of wealth, race and power, or if there is, it\u2019s not the most pressing. Third, the debating terms, when you talk about \u201cfemale issues\u201d often carry underlying prescriptions about how women should behave, which are themselves regressive and uninspiring. You can make the argument, forcefully, and on very solid turf, that any contraction of the state \u2013 be that in social care or services or public sector pay \u2013 will always fall disproportionately upon women, as they take up the burdens of care that the state once shouldered. While it may be true, that narrative isn\u2019t galvanising; I don\u2019t want to build a generous state on feminist grounds because I, by my nature, would otherwise spend my life mopping, tending and wiping. I reject care as a gendered activity.</p> <p>Nevertheless, everywhere, I see the potential for unleashing a female solidarity that could cut through turgid certainties and redraw ideological fault lines. Freedom from violence and reproductive autonomy are good muster points but don\u2019t go far enough. A constant eye on the future, a calm insistence that not everything of value can be counted, a love of international cooperation and respect for the institutions it has created, a knowledge that some things are too important to be left to the market, an empathy with the dispossessed: there is nothing essentially female about these ideas, yet where no women are, you never hear them. In the vacuum, you hear Trump and others like him.

But you asked me about her position on trade and her position on trade is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, similarly struggled to answer questions about the purported excerpts, including a 2013 speech to Goldman Sachs bankers which discussed Clinton having a separate \u201cpublic and a private position\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf everybody\u2019s watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least,\u201d Clinton told the bankers, according to the excerpt. \u201cSo you need a public and a private position.\u201d </p> <p>Mook told CBS: \u201cI think there\u2019s a distinction between what goes on in negotiations and what her positions are on the issues and have been on the issues.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to argue that Clinton had fought for financial regulation before the crisis and recession. </p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton went to the floor of the Nasdaq in 2008 and said that these swaps and derivatives, and what was going on with the mortgage lending market, was wrong and was going to crash the economy,\u201d Mook said. \u201cShe\u2019s called for closing the interest loophole for some time now.</p> <p>\u201cHer public position and what she\u2019s going to fight for as president for are one and the same.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton did deliver a speech in <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=77069\">March 2007</a>, in the early weeks of the financial crisis, blaming mortgage industry practices and recommending a few reforms. She mentioned derivatives and further reform in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/21/clinton.trans.economy/\">November</a> that year and on the campaign trail <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=96569\">in 2008</a>, well into the crisis.</p> <p>Years later, however, Clinton told her Goldman Sachs audience it was \u201can oversimplification\u201d to blame \u201cour banking system causing this everywhere\u201d, the email excerpts show. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened,\u201d she said in a 2013 speech, according to the leaked excerpts, \u201cwith greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? </p> <p>\u201cYou guys help us figure it out and let\u2019s make sure we do it right this time.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the Democratic primary, Clinton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-platform-negotiations\">accused of an overly comfortable relationship with Wall Street</a> by her rival on the left, Bernie Sanders. He also mocked her for her refusal to release the text of the private speeches, saying: \u201cI kind of think if you\u2019re going to be paid $225,000 for a speech, it must be a fantastic speech.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Sanders reaffirmed his support for Clinton, saying: \u201cWhatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic party platform, which was agreed to by her campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, insisted that the excerpts had been taken out of context. \u201cThere is nothing that she has said in private that she doesn\u2019t say in public,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cShe has said all throughout this campaign that she will crack down on Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has put forward the most aggressive Wall Street plan of any candidate, really.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to legislation passed in 2010 that took measures to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/19/two-cheers-dodd-frank-act-wall-street-culture-radical-change\">re-regulate</a> Wall Street after the 2008 financial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">collapse</a> and recession, he added: \u201cShe stands behind Dodd-Frank, while [Donald] Trump wants to rip it away.</p> <p>\u201cPeople on Wall Street know how to game the system. What she wants to do is crack down on the system, make sure that there is no institution too big to fail and no person that\u2019s too big to jail. That\u2019s why Bernie Sanders yesterday, after looking at those scripts, says that he stands behind her.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">divided by their own candidate</a>, some Republicans seized on the speeches as evidence of Clinton\u2019s penchant for secrecy, in line with her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of the top advisers in Trump\u2019s embattled campaign, said the excerpts would have been a deathblow to Clinton had they come out during the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cHad those come out, Bernie Sanders would be the candidate now that we\u2019d be running against, not her. She fought so hard to keep those secret \u2013 we now know why,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cShe pointed out in one of them that she is a different person to them [the bankers] than she has to be politically,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we have two Hillary Clintons, which says we have a person who is a liar. Because that\u2019s what she is. I mean, over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani then tried to draw an equivalence between the recently leaked video of Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-groping-remarks-sexual-assault-tim-kaine-debate\">bragging about groping women</a> and the hacked emails.

There was lots of yell-singing Footloose and Danger Zone on the stage, and probably lots of channel surfing in the television audience.<br></p> <p>Up next was a pre-taped sketch of the cast party after a high school production of The Crucible, a musical number featuring the line \u201c25 virgins and a lot of Sprite\u201d and a little too much truth for non-drama-club geeks to be privy to, during which Manuel, of course, rapped.</p> <p>It was only then that Leslie Jones made her first appearance as a high school principal, introducing substitute teacher Miranda to his class of inner-city students, as the \u201ccool\u201d high school teacher trying to teach William Shakespeare through hip-hop music. But, surprise! It was an AP English class sick of having \u201ccool\u201d substitute teachers use hip-hop music to teach them. (Jones got the funny line about the proliferation of Axe body spray among the high-school set, which perhaps is less funny if one spends a lot of time around American high school boys.)</p> <p>McKinnon then starred in a laugh-out-loud parody of Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway\u2019s supposed day off, which was set today, though obviously pre-taped earlier in the week. In between breakfast with the family, yoga, painting, roller skating, grocery shopping and a bath with her husband, Conway is constantly getting called into CNN by Jake Tapper to defend whatever insanity Trump has been tweeting, from claiming that Hillary Clinton cheated on her husband to suggesting that black people can\u2019t read. Again, possibly a little too real.</p> <p>Finally, viewers got to the segment this week\u2019s news was made for: Weekend Update, which opened up with \u201cThe week we almost heard Wolf Blitzer say \u2018pussy\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>It was all the Trump jokes you wish you\u2019d made yourself, from \u201cWhich locker room? Penn State?\u201d to, in reference to Trump\u2019s use of Tic Tacs to freshen his breath before going in for a non-consensual kiss: \u201cI don\u2019t think the problem women have with sexual assault is bad breath. It\u2019s like Bill Cosby using a coaster for one of his love potions.\u201d</p> <p>They also offered the candy a new slogan, if its makers decided to lean into their new reputation: \u201cTic Tacs \u2013 grab bad breath by the pussy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Then, after a few jokes about Propecia, Kim Kardashian, defecating in an Apple store and the forthcoming \u201cclown lives matter\u201d rally, hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che introduced two undecided voters from outside of Philadelphia, played by Tina Fey (with a spot-on accent) and Jimmy Fallon (with what eventually morphed into a southern accent). Yes, Fey did crack a joke about Fallon petting Trump\u2019s hair; it was the best line of the skit.</p> <p>The back half of the show \u2013 the usual wasteland for sketches like the incestuous campfire singalong \u2013 instead featured a Miranda-fronted take-off on The Music Man, in which the con man Professor Harold Hill hawked banking products from Wells Fargo instead of band instruments and music lessons, as well as a pre-taped, mostly Spanish sketch of Miranda as a Latino dishwasher in North Dakota in a Brokeback Mountain sort of situation.</p> <p>Saturday Night Live also attempted to solve the problem of Lucas\u2019s missing parents in Stranger Things, with a \u201cseason two preview\u201d in which Leslie Jones and Kenan Thompson tell their son: \u201cPeople who look like us already live in the upside down\u201d and then hold their hands up, unprompted, when the sheriff arrives. (It probably helps if you\u2019ve seen the show.)</p> <p>Next up, the second Melania Moments (numbered 78), in which Cecily Strong\u2019s Melania Trump awakens from a dream and the narrator says: \u201cShe could sense that her replacement had just been born in rural Latvia.\u201d Like an evil queen, Melania ponders finding her and eliminating her rival \u2013 \u201cnot for my sake, but for hers\u201d \u2013 as the camera pans to a portrait of Donald Trump over her bed.</p> <p>The episode ended with a sketch about a soldier\u2019s dying wish that his commanding officer go to his house, tell his wife he loved her ... and remove his extra-large butt plug from the garage. It was mostly just an excuse for everyone in the skit to say the word \u201cbutt plug\u201d over and over again but, hey, it aired at 1.25am on a Sunday morning. Who doesn\u2019t want to say \u201cbutt plug\u201d repeatedly at that hour for no reason?</p>",

With every blow Clinton delivered (discussing Trump\u2019s tax returns, his \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d comments, and so on), and with every one of Trump\u2019s own missed opportunities, the value of those S&amp;P 500 futures contracts rose. Investors clearly decided they would prefer to own US stocks under a President Clinton than a President Trump.</p> <p>In fact, Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, calculated that based on the magnitude of the market movements during that first debate, if Trump wins the election next month, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/upshot/debate-night-message-the-markets-are-afraid-of-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">it could trigger a stock market selloff of between 10% and 12%</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s not that investors care whether Trump did or didn\u2019t pay taxes, or that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">brags about groping women</a> without their consent. The markets just don\u2019t worry about that kind of stuff.</p> <p>What does matter is whether investors believe Trump will create a stable, predictable, business-friendly environment. For all his claims to be friendly toward business, and despite a platform that offers favorable tax treatment to corporations and the wealthy, clearly investors are bothered about the \u201cstable and predictable\u201d part of the conundrum. </p> <p>Trump has threatened to embark on trade wars \u2013 that\u2019s enough to strike terror into the heart of any investor. Then there are <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/citi-says-donald-trumps-odds-of-winning-in-november-are-increasing-2016-09-19\">some \u201cblack swan\u201d risks</a> to which analysts have begun alerting their clients, such as the potential fallout for financial markets if Trump pulls the US out of multilateral trade and security arrangements, from Nafta to Nato. </p> <p>What happens when Trump insults a foreign leader, or orders a US warship to fire on an Iranian vessel, triggering a war? Or \u2013 God forbid \u2013 decides to use some of the nuclear arsenal to \u201ctake out\u201d Isis? We can all forget about our retirement funds at that point; they\u2019ll vanish in the mushroom cloud. It doesn\u2019t help the market\u2019s confidence that Trump\u2019s team of economic and foreign policy advisers <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-starts-to-raise-alarm-bells-over-the-possibility-of-a-trump-presidency-2016-09-26\">don\u2019t seem to have extensive credentials or expertise</a>.</p> <p>Clinton is more of a known quantity. Despite her increasingly populist rhetoric against the financial institutions, the apparent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37595047\">transcripts of speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs</a> and other banks before casting her hat into the ring suggest that as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had insisted, she was actually much more supportive than she now makes herself out to be. </p> <p>The speeches reveal a candidate who is pro-free trade and who suggested she would be amenable to maintaining the much-criticized \u201crevolving door\u201d between Wall Street and its regulators. \u201cThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\u201d she said, according to the transcripts.</p> <p>That\u2019s the pragmatic Clinton of before the election, and it suggests that, if anything, her victory next month would at least be good news for those Americans with an interest in a stable economy and stable markets.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re hoping for a \u201cClinton rally\u201d, don\u2019t hold your breath.</p> <p>Especially in the wake of the first debate \u2013 and in light of the bombshell revelations about Trump\u2019s taxes and open mic comments about groping women \u2013 the markets now have largely priced in a Clinton victory. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, we won\u2019t see big changes in economic policies \u2013 she is, more or less, familiar, which is something that markets love, because it gives them something that they adore: \u201ctransparency\u201d or \u201cvisibility\u201d. If traders and big institutional investors, like the mutual fund managers at Fidelity, can look forward and predict, more or less, what is going to happen (or if they think they can), they\u2019ll be more comfortable with the valuations that they\u2019re paying for stocks today. If there are too many wild cards, they\u2019ll take their money off the table.</p> <p>But a Clinton victory, heading toward the eighth anniversary of the start of the current bull market in stocks, wouldn\u2019t give anyone any encouragement to think that this was the start of something dramatically positive either. Should she be elected, stock valuations would still be in nosebleed territory. Interest rates would still be too low, and would be heading upward, putting downward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds simultaneously. </p> <p>There\u2019s a phenomenon known as the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presidentialelectioncycle.asp\">presidential election cycle theory</a>. In brief, it argues that the first year following a presidential election is always bad for markets, regardless of who wins \u2013 Republican or Democrat. Then, stock markets do better in the second year following the election and best of all in the third year, before turning in a lackluster year in the fourth year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/women-share-sexual-assault-stories-on-twitter-after-donald-trump-comments\">Trump's groping boasts inspire millions of women to share sexual assault stories on Twitter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suspect we\u2019ll see a variant of that this year, if Clinton wins. We might experience a brief \u201cpop\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the election itself, in the form of a kind of relief rally. But once that is over, the grim work of unwinding a big asset bubble built up in the attempt to contain and resolve the financial crisis will have to start, beginning with the Fed raising interest rates. That is going to hurt the already sluggish economy, which has been <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-second-quarter-gdp-revised-up-to-1-4-gain-1475152328\">struggling to turn in an average annual growth rate of 2.1%</a> since the current expansion began. That\u2019s the lowest of any growth period since 1949. </p> <p>Those challenges will all remain in place in the unlikely event that either of the two third-party candidates triumphs on election day. They would be magnified by the fact that neither would have natural allies from their own party in Congress, making it infinitely more difficult to implement even basic economic policy. The predictability and stability factors that are an issue with Trump would exist with Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, albeit for different reasons. </p> <p>There are plenty of compelling reasons to cast a ballot on 8 November, heaven knows, without thinking about which result will be best for your investment portfolio. But if that\u2019s the one that is going to which lever you pull or box you check, well, there\u2019s no perfect solution, only a least worst option. </p> <p>Many of the issues that have the potential to wreak havoc on stocks are out there on the horizon, like an ominous dark cloud. Our choice of president won\u2019t banish them. It can only add to them.</p>",

  "<p>If the US presidential campaign conveys a flavour of unreality, that may be because it is rooted in fiction. In 1935, Sinclair Lewis sat down to write a novel about political radicalisation and social upheaval in the depression-ravaged US. What emerged after four months of feverish work was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here\">It Can\u2019t Happen Here</a>, a runaway bestseller that quickly sold more than 300,000 copies.</p> <p>Lewis was alarmed by what was taking shape in the country. The New Deal had delivered a false sense of optimism to the Federal Reserve, if not to the millions queueing at the soup kitchens. The money supply was tightened in anticipation of a sustained rally, government spending was cut and taxes were raised. As a result, the US was pushed to the cusp of a double-dip depression, with manufacturing back to its 1934 level and unemployment up by 5%.</p> <p>This created fertile ground for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin\">Father Charles Coughlin</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long\">Huey Long</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst\">William Randolph Hearst</a> and other fanatics to spread the gospel of bigotry. It was no fleeting backlash: on the eve of the second world war, the German American Bund <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gU9op16rjQ\">packed more than 20,000 militants into Madison Square Garden in New York for a pro-Hitler rally</a>.

We want Buzz!\u201d</p> <p>Windrip could count on a number of real-life champions who appear in the novel, such as the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. In 1935, the man widely regarded as responsible for goading the US into the Spanish-American war proclaimed: \u201cWhenever you hear a prominent American called a fascist, you can usually make up your mind that the man is simply a loyal citizen who stands up for Americanism.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s hero, the New England journalist Doremus Jessup, attends a Windrip rally in Madison Square Garden. Jessup reports that Windrip\u2019s rhetoric was irresistible to his thousands of downtrodden admirers. He later can\u2019t remember a word Windrip said. But it doesn\u2019t matter: if Windrip contradicts himself, backtracks on policy or simply spews out a torrent of lies, he tells them what they want to hear. Every American will be guaranteed a minimum income of $5,000 ($88,000 in today\u2019s money), US-hating Mexico will be severely dealt with and Jewish bankers will be punished for landing the country in this mess.</p> <p>Windrip unveils his 15-point manifesto, which includes \u201cprison or the death penalty\u201d for anyone advocating communism and the recognition of Jews as \u201cfully Americanised\u201d, so long as they continue to support \u201cour ideals\u201d.

  "<p>Russia has become much more aggressive in the war in Syria and has chosen to be a \u201ccompetitor not a partner\u201d to the west, the UK defence secretary has said.</p> <p>As fears of a return to cold war politics grow, Michael Fallon told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Russian interference in Europe was \u201cextremely concerning\u201d. He supported the view of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who accused Russia of committing war crimes and said the country should be held accountable for allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/un-aid-convoy-attack-syria-us-russia\">bombing aid convoys</a> in Syria.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning. We are seeing a much more aggressive Russia,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cWe hoped Russia would become a partner to us in the west, but clearly Russia has decided to be a competitor.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been flexing their muscles in the Black Sea, they\u2019ve been militarising the Crimea, we\u2019ve seen this pressure on the Baltic states. And they\u2019ve tried to interfere in elections, they even tried to interfere in the Dutch referendum on the Ukraine association agreement.\u201d</p> <p>Russian aggression was a factor in preventing the UK from helping the trapped citizens of Aleppo, the eastern side of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/aleppo-could-be-destroyed-by-christmas-warns-un-envoy-for-syria\" draggable=\"true\">could be destroyed by Christmas</a> if the \u201ccruel, constant\u201d Russia-backed bombing of the Syrian city continues, the UN special envoy for Syria said this week.</p> <p>\u201c[Russia] said right at the beginning they were going to help fight Daesh [Islamic State]. They haven\u2019t done that. They\u2019ve been helping Assad bomb his own people,\u201d said Fallon.</p> <p>He added that Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/russia-vetoes-un-resolution-syria-bombing-aleppo\" draggable=\"true\">vetoed a UN resolution</a> on Saturday which called for an end to the bombing of the city by Syrian and Russian jets. Russia argued that the \u201cdistorted\u201d resolution would provide cover to terrorists. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, who is currently presiding over the security council, cast the veto against the Franco-Spanish resolution.</p> <p>During heated exchanges in the security council meeting on Saturday, Matthew Rycroft, the UK ambassador to the UN, said: \u201cThis council cannot stand by while such misery is meted out on the people of Aleppo. And yet, thanks to you, Mr President, that is exactly what we are doing. Thanks to your actions today, Syrians will continue to lose their lives in Aleppo and beyond to Russian and Syrian bombing.

We will continue to work on that, but it\u2019s impossible to have safe zones if we can\u2019t be sure that our planes won\u2019t be attacked by Russia in the air for example.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the claims by the recently retired commander of joint forces command, Gen Sir Richard Barrons, that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/17/uk-armed-forces-could-not-withstand-attack-by-major-power-like-russia\">UK\u2019s armed forces would not be able to protect the country from a full-scale attack</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/russian-army-can-outgun-british-according-to-leaked-report\">Russia</a> or another major military power, Fallon said the government was increasing numbers and investing in equipment. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be defending ourselves against Russia on our own, that\u2019s the whole point of being in the Nato alliance and having collective defence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe cuts that were imposed necessarily in 2010 because the budget was in a mess have stopped now, and in fact we are increasing the numbers in the navy and in the air force and our defence review last year committed us to a huge programme of investment in our armed forces.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cWe are building aircraft carriers, we are adding more planes, we\u2019re adding more equipment for special forces. We are building our defences up again and crucially we are meeting the 2% target. The real answer to Putin is that we should stay strong and be strong.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>In the midnight hours leading up to the first US presidential debate, I sat up watching a rough cut of Adam Curtis\u2019s new BBC documentary, <em>HyperNormalisation</em>, on my laptop. I thought \u2013 rightly \u2013 that the film would provide a suitable preface to Trump\u2019s global horror show.</p> <p>Like all Curtis\u2019s documentary work, <em>HyperNormalisation</em> exists in a twilight between disturbing truth and restless dream. It charts an eccentric course through the choppier ideological currents of our times: the origins of Syrian apocalypse; the collapse of political middle grounds and the rise of nationalism; the meaning of Putin and Assad and the Donald himself.</p> <p>The film is the most ambitious statement of Curtis\u2019s methods and his message since his 2004 series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTg4qnyUGxg\" title=\"\"><em>The Power of Nightmares</em></a>, which prophetically examined the ways that western governments exploit fears of terrorism to exert control. It is based on the premise that as a culture, perhaps as a species, \u201cwe have become lost in a fake world and cannot see the reality outside\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/22/adam-curtis-edinburgh-tv-festival\">Adam Curtis argues TV needs 'new tools' to tell its stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Curtis suggests that the trending opposites of our times \u2013 the chatter of social media and the stricture of Islamic fundamentalism \u2013 represent a retreat from complexity into an existence that constantly reflects our desires and anxieties back to us. Meanwhile, genuine power to change lives becomes more opaque and distant, leaving large parts of the world helpless and desperate. Along the way, this being Curtis, his film offers tragicomic asides on Patti Smith and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\" title=\"\">Occupy,</a> BlackRock investments and <em>The X-Files</em>.</p> <p>Critics of Curtis\u2019s films say that his jump-cut techniques and abrupt mood changes in some ways cheat on the dogged legwork of documentary journalism. As ever here, shifts in geopolitics are routinely represented by a couple of seconds of arresting footage \u2013 the banality of puppet dictators is illustrated by Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair off camera; the emergence of me-culture becomes Jane Fonda giving up on activism and donning a leotard; to explain the collapse of communism there is a punch-up in a Soviet breadline. Arguments become impressionistic, the criticism goes, an atmosphere of conspiracy is not the same as the exposure of truth.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKUN1a2AHE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bvKUN1a2AHE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKUN1a2AHE\">Watch an excerpt from HyperNormalisation.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This criticism misses the point. Curtis\u2019s films do not pretend to be definitive histories; rather they cast doubt on the possibility of that idea. They announce themselves clearly as subjective essays: \u201cThis is a story about&#xa0;\u2026\u201d is his opening mantra. His method is not only to attempt to understand the world, but to dramatise the ways we might go about understanding it. The films take the attention-deficit patterns of our 24-hour news cycle and try to impose some kind of persuasive narrative order on them \u2013 just as we try to do all the time. It is Curtis\u2019s contention that in the constant distraction of our digital lives, we miss the larger play of ideas that shape them. His aim is to give us some clues about what those forces might look like.</p> <p>The day after I watched the film, still groggy from Trump and his tax returns and Miss Universe, I had lunch with Curtis to talk about <em>HyperNormalisation</em>. As with his most recent documentary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02gyz6b/adam-curtis-bitter-lake\" title=\"\"><em>Bitter Lake</em></a>, about the postwar history of the west in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, this will be launched exclusively on BBC iPlayer. He insists that this apparent demotion is wholly by choice \u2013 the open-ended format gives him licence to experiment and not be constrained by hour-long episodes (the current film is nearly three hours long).</p> <p>\u201cMy editor says theoretically I can have a video that lasts up to 10 hours,\u201d he says, with some boyish excitement about the possibility. \u201cI\u2019ve done this one with chapter headings. What was lurking in the back of my brain was that it is like a novel with lots of characters and you can jump from that part to that part and trust that it is all going to come together at the end.\u201d</p> <p>The model that Curtis\u2019s films have always aspired to, he says, is that of the archetypal great American novelist, John Dos Passos, whose books he describes as \u201cthe most satisfying thing I have ever read\u201d. The novelist pioneered a technique called \u201ccamera eye\u201d which was, as it sounds, a rush of raw experience, and then spliced it with montage from newspapers and the lives of fictional characters.</p> <p>\u201cWhy I love Dos Passos is he tells political stories but at the same time he also lets you know what it feels like to live through them,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cMost journalism does not acknowledge that people live at least as much in their heads as they do in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb3326276e182cebde893bbe5abc61d792ae8a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb3326276e182cebde893bbe5abc61d792ae8a9/12_53_695_417/500.jpg\" alt=\"Footage of Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair is used as an explanation of the banality of dictators in HyperNormalisation.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Footage of Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair is used as an explanation of the banality of dictators in HyperNormalisation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is Curtis\u2019s contention that it doesn\u2019t matter if viewers get disoriented by what they see as long as they remain curious. \u201cPeople are used to spending their lives searching for meaning in a completely chaotic way,\u201d he says. \u201cInformation becomes a mosaic of questions on the internet. You search for something about whatever, Goldman Sachs, and five minutes later you are reading about a murder in Florida in the 1950s or something. You are quite happy with that.\u201d</p> <p>His films mirror that digressive quest, but loop continually back to his argument. One part of that argument is that Islamism was the unintended consequence of cold war power struggles. In this case, he traces the conflict in Syria back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/24/derekbrown\" title=\"\">\u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d of Henry Kissinger</a> in 1974-75.</p> <p>\u201cKissinger\u2019s theory was that instead of having a comprehensive peace for Palestinians, which would cause specific problems, you split the Middle Eastern world and made everyone dissatisfied,\u201d he argues. In the fallout from that policy no one, his film suggests, was more dissatisfied than Hafez al-Assad of Syria.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to try to explain Syria,\u201d Curtis says. His impression is that when we watch the footage from Aleppo the forces that have created that carnage seem all but unknown to us. This, he suggests, was deliberate. \u201cThe idea was that you couldn\u2019t deal with Assad so you created an alternative reality in which Syria had no place. As a consequence, for example, it was hardly mentioned in the books about the rise of Islamism \u2013 so to our eyes the war seems to come from nowhere.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politics has become a pantomime in that it creates anger rather than argument\u2026 People like Trump fuel that anger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You could argue that all historians and journalists are conspiracy theorists of one sort or another, collecting their collages of facts and imposing some narrative sense on them. Curtis\u2019s style makes this process abundantly clear \u2013 but he still invites you to be seduced by the brilliant visual craft of his argument. In his netherworld of shifting certainties, characters \u2013 like, as he says, villains in a novel \u2013 come and go. Putin\u2019s close adviser Vladislav Surkov takes on a kind of Rasputin role in this&#xa0;respect.</p> <p>Surkov, whose previous career was as a director in avant-garde theatre, emerges, like Kissinger, as an arch manipulator of reality. \u201cSurkov will invent dissident groups and fund them,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cHe will fuel conspiracy theories, but that\u2019s not new. His particular genius has been to let people know that is what he is doing. So whatever you see in the news: you just don\u2019t know if it is \u2018true\u2019 or not. I noticed a headline in the <em>Financial Times</em> recently which said \u2018no one understands Russia\u2019s policy in Syria\u2019. I thought: Mr Surkov.\u201d</p> <p>The goal of this manipulation, Curtis suggests, is to spread a state of bewilderment and powerlessness across the globe. A sense that nothing quite makes sense. Technology, in particular social media, becomes the ally of those forces. The global technology companies not only feed a mirror of our obsessions back to us, but increasingly try to normalise our behaviour \u2013 collecting data about our health and our habits and selling us a fixed idea of who we should be and what we should like (\u201cif you liked that, you will like this\u201d). The irony of this feedback is that it is fuels prejudice and is fuelled by anger. The more angry users are, the more extreme their emotional states, the more they click, and the more money rolls into Twitter and Facebook and the rest.</p> <p>Trump is presented in the film as emblematic of this culture, certainly, but how exactly?</p> <p>\u201cMy take on Trump is that he is an inevitable creation of this unreal normal world,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cPolitics has become a pantomime or vaudeville in that it creates waves of anger rather than argument. Maybe people like Trump are successful simply because they fuel that anger, in the echo chambers of the internet.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary Clinton gets elected next month, Curtis suggests, then the vaudeville will have played its role \u2013 the anger will have been expressed and changed nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db13d0feb456115b98abfc6a23277aaf82907f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db13d0feb456115b98abfc6a23277aaf82907f1a/180_88_1069_641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump in footage from HyperNormalisation: fuelling anger in the echo chamber of the internet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what if Trump wins? \u201cIt means the pantomime has become reality and starts rampaging around. And then we are fucked.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s the answer to ending or changing that pantomime?</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be a new political vision that takes account of these forces,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that idea is and I don\u2019t see it as my job to provide it. My job description is to make people aware of power. To let them see the forces around them. The things they don\u2019t see.\u201d</p> <p>To this end Curtis has become a kind of heroic one-man depository of BBC memory. For the past few years he has been funding a former BBC cameraman, Phil Goodwin, to travel the world digitising all the unedited material in BBC cupboards and storerooms worldwide, the hours of rushes that got boiled down to a 20-second news report.</p> <p>Goodwin spends weeks with a bank of six laptops and six tape machines collecting it all \u2013 and then brings it back and gives it to Curtis in plastic lunch boxes full of small computer drives. \u201cSo for example I have everything the BBC has ever shot for 60 years in Russia sitting on 58 terabytes of drives,\u201d he says. \u201cPhil is doing China next. Then Egypt. Vietnam. And then we are doing Africa. I aim eventually to have the last 50 years of unedited material. I could do an emotional history of the world.\u201d</p> <p>How does he avoid just being overwhelmed by the material?</p> <p>\u201cSome of it is indexed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to do a bit of detective work. You just suddenly spot something. You have to intuit what people want.

Experts, however, seem to agree the language of the RNC rules only allows the party to \u201cfill\u201d a vacancy, not \u201ccreate\u201d one.</p> <p>If Republicans tried to change the rules now, Bopp said, it would probably incite \u201cchaos\u201d and further inflame Trump supporters, many of whom wholeheartedly believe the political system is \u201crigged\u201d against them and their candidate. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no authority in the RNC rules to remove a candidate for president or his vice-president,\u201d Bopp said. \u201cThere is only the authority if a vacancy arose \u2013 then they have the authority to fill that vacancy.\u201d</p> <p>Vikram Amar, dean and Iwan Foundation professor of law at the University of Illinois College of Law, discussed a largely fantastical scenario in which Trump could remain at the top of the ticket but pledge to declare himself incapacitated and allow Pence to take over as president if their ticket prevails. </p> <p>\u201cUnder the 25th amendment, the president can declare [him or herself] disabled,\u201d Amar said. \u201cIn that case, technically Trump would be president and Pence would be acting president with the full authority to exercise all of the powers and duties of the president.\u201d</p> <p>Amar said this would be the least disruptive option for the RNC to pursue, because it would not require attempts to change the nominee after ballots in many states have been printed. Trump, he added, would be bound by his word if he promised Republicans he would step down and allow Pence to take over after winning the White House. </p> <p>Regardless of whether Trump withdraws, Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine professor who runs the Election Law Blog, said Republicans had one <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=87310\">\u201cHail Mary</a>\u201d pass left: the electoral college. </p> <p>Writing on the blog, Hasen said: \u201cWhen we cast our votes for president they are actually cast for electors from each state (based roughly on population size) who then cast ballots for president. If Trump is chosen in some states, those electors could vote for Pence, or Romney, or Kasich, or whoever.\u201d </p> <p>There are laws that bar \u201cfaithless\u201d electors from voting for a candidate who did not win the popular vote in their state, but Hasen argues that in the event of a Trump victory, neither the Republican-controlled Senate nor the courts would be likely to object.</p> <p>That scenario, however, would also require an extraordinary confluence of events that look increasingly hard to pull off, including Trump withdrawing or the party abandoning him, electors placing faithless votes and Hillary Clinton earning fewer electoral college votes than Trump. </p> <p>\u201cAll of this is possible, but not bloody likely,\u201d Hasen wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">The growing list of Republicans abandoning Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, RNC officials appear reluctant to engage with any suggestion that Trump be removed from the ticket.

It is disappointing, especially for Americans who are looking for real leadership and integrity in their presidential candidate, that Trump has not been able to clear that bar.

  "<p>On 27 September, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced up to one another in the first of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/presidential-debate-preparation-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">televised presidential debates</a>. Most observers concluded that Clinton had come off best. She was better prepared, they thought, and towards the end Trump seemed rattled and&#xa0;rambling.</p> <p>Needless to say, this didn\u2019t stop the Trump campaign team from using the phrase \u201cTrump Won\u201d in ads <em>even before the debate ended</em>. Aha, you say, that\u2019s American politics for you: you get what you pay for. And in these circumstances, every candidate says that she or he has won anyway, no matter what happened in the debate.</p> <p>But then something interesting happened. The hashtag #TrumpWon went viral on Twitter and in a few hours had reached the top of the global trending list. Trump was on to it like a shot. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/780758306239512577\" title=\"\">\u201cThe #1 trend on Twitter right now,\u201d he tweeted</a>, \u201cis #TrumpWon \u2013 thank you!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Trump declares debate victory.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The #1 trend on Twitter right now is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpWon?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TrumpWon&lt;/a&gt; - thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/780758306239512577&quot;&gt;September 27, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The plot then began to thicken. A Twitter user called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DustinGiebel/status/780814613021548544/photo/1\" title=\"\">@DustinGiebel posted a tweet</a> showing a map of Russia centred on St Petersburg under the heading \u201cThe #TrumpWon hashtag starting location, that\u2019s interesting\u201d. The clear implication was that the hashtag began in St Petersburg and so \u2013 nudge, nudge, wink, wink \u2013 constituted yet another confirmation that Trump has supporters in Russia, possibly even linked to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The person who tweeted the map said he\u2019d spotted it on TrendsMap.com, a service that tracks trending topics on Twitter. So I went to the site but couldn\u2019t find the hashtag anywhere near St Petersburg. Neither could <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/27/that-viral-image-showing-trumpwon-starting-in-russia-is-probably-fake/\" title=\"\">Philip Bump of the <em>Washington Post</em></a>; he checked with Trendsmap, which confirmed that the map in the original tweet wasn\u2019t theirs. They also said that, according to their data, the hashtag had originated in the US.</p> <p>At this point, Gilad Lotan, a data scientist who works at <a href=\"https://betaworks.com/\" title=\"\">Betaworks</a>, took up the trail. He researches ways in which people are hacking social networks in order to gain more of what has become the scarcest resource of all in our networked world \u2013 attention. He started by looking for the geographical areas where the hashtag #TrumpWon began trending. He found <a href=\"https://medium.com/i-data/trumpwon-trend-vs-reality-16cec3badd60#.lu50stvo8\" title=\"\">that it never showed up in any Russian location</a>; instead, the growth began in Baltimore and Detroit, after which it very quickly jumped to \u201cworldwide\u201d status and stayed there for a few hours as it spread to Australia and the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Giebel's response to Trump after the debate.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpWon?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TrumpWon&lt;/a&gt; hashtag starting location, that&amp;#39;s interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/V7SFhvEurX&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/V7SFhvEurX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dusty (@DustinGiebel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DustinGiebel/status/780814613021548544&quot;&gt;September 27, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Normally, Lotan says, when a hashtag goes viral you see the trend jump from city to city before reaching countrywide or global status. But this didn\u2019t happen with #TrumpWon. Instead, he reports, \u201cthere was a group of highly organised users who all posted the exact same message at around the same time, from (seemingly) different geographic locations. The exact same message was published by thousands of accounts, likely all over the world, a few hours after the debate had ended (between 3-5am UTC time).\u201d</p> <p>The tweet that did the trick read: \u201c#TrumpWon the debate tonight! Let\u2019s make America Great again. Add your name: bit.ly/2dfF4E4\u201d. The link went straight to the Trump campaign website. Lotan then built a network graph of the Twitter users who were first to post to the hashtag. They clustered into four groups \u2013 #MAGA (for Make America Great Again), #Trump2016 1, #Trump2016 2 and #TGDN (a tag used by conservatives to identify each other).</p> <p>This neat piece of network analysis is interesting for several reasons. The first is that it shows that you can never take anything that happens on social media at face value. So when mainstream journalists regard the fact that something is trending on Twitter or Facebook as being significant, one should take the reports with a large handful of salt.</p> <p>The second is that social media of all kinds are now being \u201cgamed\u201d for political, commercial and other purposes. One of the interesting things about the #TrumpWon story, for example, is not only that it was gamed by Trump supporters, but that someone also attempted a counter-strike, seeking to undermine it by faking a Russian connection.</p> <p>But perhaps the most important lesson to draw from the saga is that it highlights the skills one needs to unearth the truth about anything that happens online. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin\" title=\"\">Nick Tomalin</a>, the great <em>Sunday Times </em>journalist who was killed in the Yom Kippur war, used to say: \u201cThe only qualities essential for real success in journalism are ratlike cunning, a plausible manner and a little literary ability.\u201d To these we now need to add: a knack for network&#xa0;analysis.</p>",
  "<p>Hours after a leaked video emerged in which Donald Trump bragged about groping women without their consent, Florida senator Marco Rubio condemned the Republican nominee\u2019s comments as \u201cvulgar, egregious [and] impossible to justify\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Donald Trump forced to apologise as sex boast tape horrifies Republicans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Republicans fled from Trump</a> en masse on Saturday and in many cases called on him to step aside, Rubio did not rescind his endorsement of the former reality TV star. Rubio has avoided campaigning alongside the nominee, a notable absence from Trump\u2019s multiple appearances in Florida in recent months, and has no plans to campaign with him before election day.</p> <p>To Patrick Murphy, the Democratic congressman challenging Rubio for his Senate seat, the senator\u2019s silence raises questions about his character.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t such a coward he would stand up immediately and withdraw his endorsement,\u201d Murphy said in an interview with the Guardian late Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cIt speaks, unfortunately, to who he is as a person. For Marco Rubio to continue putting his own political ambitions in front of what he knows is best \u2026 I don\u2019t know how he can look himself in the mirror after these comments and think it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>In the video from 2005, which emerged on Friday, Trump boasted that when approaching beautiful women he could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">\u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d and kiss and grope them because he is a star</a>.</p> <p>For Rubio, who endorsed Trump despite the two sparring bitterly in the Republican presidential primary, the routine of distancing himself from the real estate mogul\u2019s controversial rhetoric is nothing new. </p> <p>The senator constantly found himself rebuking Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 whether on immigrants, Muslims or women \u2013 during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination. Rubio similarly denounced Trump\u2019s attacks on an American judge of Hispanic descent and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero; but while seeking re-election to the Senate, Rubio has also openly advocated for electing Trump to the presidency even as he maintained prior criticisms that included not trusting his former rival with the nuclear codes.</p> <p>And as other Republicans have struggled to walk the fine line between supporting Trump and fully embracing him, for Rubio the balancing act has appeared to pay dividends. He overwhelmingly defeated a challenge from the right in the Florida Senate race \u2013 critical to Republicans\u2019 chances of holding on to an already precarious majority \u2013 and has run ahead of Murphy in most polls even as Trump has trailed Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>A new NBC/WSJ/Marist survey released on Sunday showed a potentially tighter race, with Rubio holding just a two-point lead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ffv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2786643\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump's sex boasts: 'When you are a star they let you do anything' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f87665e4b0e4aaeaa8d24b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s sex boasts: \u2018When you are a star they let you do anything\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s latest comments could open a new front for Democrats in a race they recently signalled was no longer competitive by pulling back resources such as ad spending. The progressive group MoveOn.org released a new spot on Sunday, in which it played Trump\u2019s comments about women against a side-by-side photo of him and Rubio.<br></p> <p>\u201cRubio stood by Trump after months of indefensible behavior like this,\u201d the ad read.<br></p> <p>As other Republican Senate candidates, such as Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Joe Heck of Nevada, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">withdrew their support</a> for Trump, Murphy pounced with <a href=\"http://%20http//thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/300034-patrick-murphy-to-marco-rubio-unendorse-trump-or-withdraw-from\">an op-ed calling on Rubio to either rescind his endorsement of Trump or withdraw from the race</a>.<br></p> <p>Reached for comment, a spokeswoman for Rubio\u2019s campaign said the senator was focused on recovery efforts following Hurricane Matthew and pointed back to his initial statement on Twitter. \u201cNo one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/784566254271094788\">Rubio wrote</a> late Friday.</p> <p>On Saturday, the senator took an aerial tour of the damage caused by the storm but did not wade into the political fallout surrounding Trump.</p> <p>Murphy told the Guardian he, too, had been occupied with the hurricane. But it was not a sufficient excuse, in his view, for Rubio to decline to weigh in further on Trump when dozens of Republicans in Congress had launched a mass exodus away from the nominee. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s only going to tweet on this speaks volumes,\u201d Murphy said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are waiting for some strong actions or some strong words on this. I think he\u2019s making a calculated decision about his political career and that having Donald Trump\u2019s support will help him long term.\u201d</p> <p>Complicating matters for Rubio was the growing list of Republicans dropping Trump by the hour. Among them was Rob Portman, a senator from the battleground state of Ohio, who like Rubio has succeeded thus far in running a parallel race to Trump\u2019s, absent the damage associated with the nominee\u2019s toxic brand of politics.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him,\u201d Portman said in a statement late Saturday, while stating his intention to write in Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, for president.</p> <p>\u201cI continue to believe our country cannot afford a Hillary Clinton presidency\u201d.</p> <p>Senator John McCain, facing a tough re-election battle in Arizona, also pulled his endorsement of Trump. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who reluctantly backed Trump last month after declining to endorse him at the Republican National Convention in July, was reportedly reconsidering his decision.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom holds that Cruz and Rubio will seek the presidency once more. Murphy, who has hammered Rubio for refusing to commit to serving a six-year term if re-elected to the Senate, told the Guardian his opponent\u2019s calculus with respect to Trump had only to do with a second presidential bid as early as 2020.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who the real Marco Rubio is anymore,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s going regret it\u201d.</p>"
