  "<p>Theresa May is not the first politician to have been caught out saying one thing to an audience of bankers and another to voters. Earlier this month Hillary Clinton, the US presidential candidate, was revealed to have taken $675,000 to speak at Goldman Sachs where she adopted a friendlier, more pro-business persona than that offered to the American public. On this side of the Atlantic the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\" title=\"\">unearthed an audio recording</a> of a previously undisclosed private question-and-answer session the prime minister had with Goldman Sachs bankers this May on the defining issue of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. In a wide-ranging discussion the PM went beyond her current gnomic utterance to voters that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. The then home secretary showed in private that she was more committed to staying in the European Union than the tepid support she gave to the remain campaign. Her most revealing exchange is her stark warning that corporate outlays in the UK would be at risk if the country left Europe. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\" title=\"\">Yet a month earlier in her only major speech she blamed \u201cdiscrimatory EU policies\u201d</a> for the threat to investment in a post-Brexit Britain.</p> <p>It is an irony that in the cloistered preserve of Goldman Sachs, a temple of power and privilege, normally guarded politicans lift the veil of caution. We must be thankful for small mercies. In private to bankers Mrs May said if we voted to leave, European business would make rational decisions about the size of the EU trading bloc, and leave Britain. In public she blamed such decisions on Brussels for discriminating against Britain. Jeremy Corbyn, who missed a trick to hammer home this point at prime minister\u2019s questions, later correctly identified Mrs May\u2019s Janus-like pronouncements. The questions raised by the Goldman Sachs tape are clear: Does she believe now what she said then? If not, why not? The evidence is mounting that she was right to point to stormy times for a Brexit economy in the years ahead. A new <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/pressing-the-reset-button-the-public-finance-options-facing-the-new-chancellor-at-the-autumn-statement/\" title=\"\">analysis by the Resolution Foundation</a> finds that the economy is likely to shrink by \u00a360bn, most of this down to leaving Europe.</p> <p>This smaller Brexit nation would be characterised by lower average earnings, higher inflation and 600,000 fewer jobs in 2020. No wonder the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is fighting a rearguard action to maintain access to the single market. The study says he will be staring at an \u00a384bn hole in the public finances. Mr Hammond knows his room for manoeuvre is tight \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36864099\" title=\"\">that he will have to fudge or break George Osborne\u2019s rules</a> on spending and debt as a proportion of GDP to ensure the motor of the economy does not stall. No doubt leading Brexiters will drop their ideological objections to a looser fiscal position so that extra taxpayers\u2019 cash can be spent to keep the engine ticking over as the gears shift to a post-European economy.</p> <p>The wider macroeconomic picture is criss-crossed by unpromising circumstances. The politics turns <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37710786\" title=\"\">towards a harder Brexit</a>: outside the single market, with maximum control over immigration. The economics would be costly: raising questions over whether London can maintain its position as a major hub for financial services across the EU. The UK\u2019s position as <a href=\"http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/\" title=\"\">the ninth-largest exporter in the world</a> is threatened. Curbs on EU migrants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study\" title=\"\">who pay more in tax than they take out in benefits</a>, may strain public finances. How to resolve such contradictions remains a puzzle even to those involved at the highest level of government, as the leaders of the devolved assemblies found on Monday.</p> <p>Unlike other remainers, as home secretary Mrs May failed to vigorously defend Britain\u2019s EU membership. Her one speech was a Eurosceptic explanation of why, after considering the pros and cons, she thought it was best to vote remain. In that speech on the crucial question of the British economy she played up her Euroscepticism. This has helped to set a direction of travel for Britain\u2019s economy that she herself condemned to Goldman\u2019s bankers. Why did Mrs May say one thing in private and another in public?</p>",

  "<p>It was once a brand synonymous with gold and marble; a sign of guaranteed opulence if not necessarily good taste.

During a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">soft launch</a> in September, Trump ensured wall-to-wall media coverage by using the occasion to finally admit he had been wrong to doubt Barack Obama\u2019s right to American citizenship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2015/jul/22/donald-trump-net-worth-political-brand\">Donald Trump: a brand in danger or a daring re-invention?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But weeks of political scandal appear to have taken their toll on the brand.

Overnight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-damaged\">Trump\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> was destroyed by a vandal with a sledgehammer and pickaxe.</p> <p>The candidate sounded wistful and unusually subdued as he took a break from the campaign trail to attend the launch. \u201cWith the notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted location in DC. The best location,\u201d said Trump. </p> <p>Even the struggling campaign\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, was watered down, perhaps succumbing to criticism that it implies the country is no longer at its best. \u2018The United States is great.

There have been attempts to remove his name from hotel projects from the Middle East to Canada. </p> <p>But the combination of weeks of sexual assault allegations \u2013 all vigorously denied by Trump \u2013 and plummeting poll numbers mean the hotel launch comes at a particularly bad time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall against racism and bigotry,\u201d read a banner on display outside the main entrance as an army of political reporters descended beforehand. \u201cThis is not really a hotel; this is a symbol of Trump\u2019s political ambition,\u201d claimed Eugene Puryear, a protester with the <a href=\"http://www.answercoalition.org/\">Answer Coalition</a>. \u201cThis is another opportunity for Trump to create this myth about his so-called business prowess.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95071dba3172b7f022f69e7b2c7fb818c08f9846\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95071dba3172b7f022f69e7b2c7fb818c08f9846/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington is not a Republican city. Trump received just 391 votes in the DC primary convention and could come third in the city in November\u2019s general election. The hotel launch was boycotted by the city\u2019s Democratic mayor and local restaurateurs.</p> <p>But hotels are aimed at visitors. A characterful building on a national thoroughfare neglected by commercial developers, the Old Post Office could have provided a bit of harmless glitz to a city where opulence typically tends toward understatement. Instead, the acres of marble, chintzy carpet and gleaming gold taps on the inside feel like any other US luxury hotel, while the giant Trump sign on the outside simply invites uncomfortable associations.</p> <p>How many reporters would have been here for any other hotel launch is hard to tell, but the press pack easily exceeded the 225 seats laid out for invited guests. Several of these were filled by family members: Melania, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka. </p> <p>Officially, it was not a campaign event, but two of the handful of prominent Republicans still prepared to be associated with the candidacy were there as well, in the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. Gingrich rejected criticism that the event was a distraction from the campaign: \u201cThat\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand the message,\u201d he said, before echoing Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s under budget and ahead of schedule \u2026 it tells you what a Trump administration would be like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWashington will never be the same\u201d is the defiant slogan of the hotel\u2019s management, which seems determined to milk the waning political connections.

  "<p>I get it. Sheryl Crow\u2019s call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year. Who isn\u2019t counting down the days until this is over? Even Hillary Clinton has been winding the months in balls.</p> <p>As Crow points out <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/democratic-national-committee-shorten-the-us-presidential-election-cycle\">in a petition</a> on Change.org, which, as of Wednesday, had more than 40,000 signatures, this extended political circus is a singularly American phenomenon. \u201cThe 2016 election will have lasted nearly 600 days by the time polls close on Nov. 8. By comparison, Canada had its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/canadas-election-cycle-has-taken-less-than-three-months-and-canadians-are-tired-of-it/2015/10/18/b57ce852-7419-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html\">longest campaign season</a> in recent history last year, and it lasted just 11 weeks,\u201d she writes. \u201cCountries across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as 6 weeks. With an organized system, a successful, informative, professional campaign could be run.\u201d</p> <p>Her suggestion for how we reform our electoral process \u2013 that we ask the DNC and RNC to reform the process \u2013 is less compelling. In a segment on Morning Joe on Wednesday, she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time (was she joking?). And she\u2019s previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the District of Columbia should hold their primaries on the same day, a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by short-circuiting grassroots campaigns.</p> <p>The opening clip for <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/sheryl-crow-on-why-she-wants-shorter-elections-793881155772\">Crow\u2019s morning segment</a> certainly felt ironic. In it, former British prime minister David Cameron is seen ribbing President Obama about the stupidly long length of American elections. \u201cYou always look on at the American elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPW-wD74Bng\">Cameron says to Obama</a> in a news conference from April of 2016, adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it. Obama joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and \u201clook in awe\u201d at the process.</p> <p>In retrospect, of course, Cameron might have wanted something different. Two months later he\u2019d be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which \u2013 Brexit \u2013 almost nobody saw coming.</p> <p>Crow moved on to how toxic media discourse has become. \u201cThis petition is simply an appeal from a midwestern mom, a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the TV on and see something I\u2019m going to have to explain.\u201d</p> <p>Again the sentiment is relatable but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our Republican nominee for president actively brags about \u201cgrabbing\u201d women by the \u201cpussy\u201d; a fact which, it\u2019s worth noting, didn\u2019t come out until more than 500 days into the cycle.</p> <p>What Crow deems the \u201cstart\u201d of the election \u2013 Ted Cruz choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign \u2013 is not something the DNC or RNC can actually control. Nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends. Party committees do set the timetable for primaries, but even there they are in a constant tug-of-war with state governments, which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more attention.</p> <p>As for entreaties to focus more on policy, we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the environment, but we have furthered the national conversation around racism, xenophobia and, particularly, sexual assault, and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics. Since audio leaked of Trump bragging about it on 7 October, a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual misbehavior.</p> <p>That\u2019s not something I want America\u2019s kids watching either. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve loved covering \u2013 it\u2019s been emotionally and physically exhausting. But it\u2019s more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their ears.</p> <p>With all due respect, I don\u2019t think Crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle. Muting the television won\u2019t protect our kids from our reality. And reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the world, particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is disinformation, won\u2019t make it harder to fool the American public: it will make it infinitely easier.</p>",

According to Goldman\u2019s website, the \u201cTalks at GS\u201d involve the bank inviting \u201cleading thinkers from a broad range of backgrounds to share their views and expertise\u201d.</p> <p>As well as May, who spoke at Goldman on 26 May, other speakers have included Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, Eddie Jones, the England rugby union coach, and Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury.</p> <p>The investment bank is not the biggest in the world (that title belongs to JP Morgan Chase based on their respective stock market values) but Goldman consistently tops the global league table for the number of mergers and acquisitions it has worked on, and its alumni have ended up in some of the most powerful jobs in the world. It was infamously described by Rolling Stone magazine in 2010 as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405\">great vampire squid</a> wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\u201d.<br></p> <p>Former Goldman employees who have moved on to high-profile positions in public life include Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, Hank Paulson, the former US treasury secretary, and Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister. </p> <p>In the UK, Jim O\u2019Neill, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs, had been a Treasury minister in the Conservative government until his resignation last month, while Paul Deighton, the former chief operating officer in Europe, was commercial secretary to the Treasury under George Osborne and has just been named chairman of Heathrow airport.</p> <p>Howard Wheeldon, a veteran analyst in the City, claimed Goldman was perceived as a \u201ccut above the rest\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is informed and always one step ahead of its peers, quiet and yet super efficient, influential because it creates knowledge required, always up with events and yet, by the same token, invisible to its peers. There simply is no one better \u2013 the Rolls-Royce of global investment banking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fbf71f2a9af057b384845679e717e9d7d99e47d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fbf71f2a9af057b384845679e717e9d7d99e47d/0_164_4922_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton was paid $675,000 for speeches to Goldman employees and clients.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another City source said there was a business adage that \u201cno one ever got fired for hiring Goldman Sachs\u201d.</p> <p>Goldman is renowned for its discretion and secrecy, appreciated by wealthy clients looking for someone to manage their money or a company working on a big acquisition. So the bank will have been disappointed to find its name in the news in relation to the British prime minister, particularly because the story was leaked from within the bank and involved a secret event held behind closed doors. </p> <p>A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment when asked if the company was investigating the source of the leak.</p> <p>The bank was involved in a similar controversy with Hillary Clinton this year after it emerged the US Democratic presidential candidate was paid $675,000 for speeches to Goldman employees and clients. Clinton did not reveal the details of her speeches, but<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\"> WikiLeaks released transcripts </a>in October that showed she had avoided directly criticising Wall Street.</p> <p>Two of Goldman\u2019s most senior employees in Europe \u2013 Michael Sherwood and Anthony Gutman \u2013 were also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/29/bhs-committee-goldman-sachs-michael-sherwood-apologises-not-disclosing-talks\">summoned before MPs in June</a> as part of a parliamentary investigation into the demise of the retailer BHS. Goldman had offered informal advice to Sir Philip Green before he sold BHS to Dominic Chappell. It warned that Chappell, a billionaire tycoon, had been declared bankrupt in the past and that the deal could be risky \u2013 a warning that came true when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-heading-for-administration-as-rescue-deal-fails\">BHS folded this year</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edc7b5e278b49ef45f1c44c64c76874c22b6ff1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edc7b5e278b49ef45f1c44c64c76874c22b6ff1a/0_33_1339_803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Sherwood,  vice-chair at Goldman Sachs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Sherwood, vice-chair at Goldman Sachs, appeared before MPs in June as part of a parliamentary investigation into the BHS collapse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sherwood and Gutman found the public hearing and inquiries into Goldman\u2019s business practices awkward. At one stage, Michelle Thomson, the SNP MP, even said: \u201cMr Sherwood, I have been keeping quiet to this point, but I have been sitting watching everyone\u2019s faces and, if you don\u2019t mind my saying, you look somewhat uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>But the parliamentary appearance of two senior Goldman figures also provided a unique insight into how the investment bank does business, including its determination to stay close to leading clients.</p> <p>\u201cGoldman Sachs is slightly different from other firms,\u201d Sherwood told MPs. \u201cOur starting account size is larger and we are really in the high net worth business and that is all. We are in the business where we cover large corporations, high net worth individuals, governments. They may not do things for a very long period of time, but, at particular times in their lifecycle, they might do significant transactions and we want to be in the goalmouth when those things happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Vladislav Surkov was the mysterious Kremlin puppet master who wrote rock lyrics and loved Tupac Shakur yet was simultaneously the chief architect of Vladimir Putin\u2019s system of \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d. </p> <p>Now, after some time on the sidelines, Surkov is well and truly back in the thick of Kremlin intrigue after a cache of emails purporting to show his office coordinating affairs in separatist east Ukraine was leaked online.<br></p> <p>Sanctioned and thus banned from travel to the EU for his role in the Kremlin\u2019s Ukraine policy, the 52-year-old Surkov nevertheless popped up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/ukraine-peace-process-leaders-agree-roadmap-to-revive-talks\">recent four-way negotiations</a> in Berlin over Ukraine, sitting at the round table next to Putin, and just one seat across from Angela Merkel. It was a very visible signal of Surkov\u2019s importance to the Kremlin\u2019s controversial Ukraine policy.</p> <p>Several sources have told the Guardian that Surkov has on occasion made secret trips to Donetsk, technically still part of Ukraine, to bring local separatist politicians into line and tell them what is expected of them if they are to continue to receive Russian funding and support. More regularly, emissaries from east Ukraine come to Moscow to meet with Surkov. <br></p> <p>On Tuesday, a giant cache of emails purporting to be from Surkov\u2019s office, some of which allude to his role in managing Russia\u2019s relations with the separatist entities in east Ukraine, was leaked by a Ukrainian outfit calling themselves the CyberJunta. The Kremlin has suggested the leak is a fake, though at least part of it appears to be real. It is possible that going after Surkov is the first salvo in what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/russian-hacking-us-retaliation-cyberwar-international-treaty\">the CIA promised</a> would be \u201cunprecedented cyber covert action against Russia\u201d in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">alleged Russian hacking</a> of the Democratic party\u2019s computer networks.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d4331e8c3048804170b3f4be9babdd575239ca9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4331e8c3048804170b3f4be9babdd575239ca9/0_0_2999_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin and Vladislav Surkov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin and Vladislav Surkov.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the email account as a fake, saying Surkov never used email. The hacked emails, however, do not purport to be from Surkov\u2019s personal account, but from an account run by an aide. It received messages for Surkov which were presumably then passed on. While there is no guarantee some of the mails have not been doctored in some way before release, much of it appears to be genuine. The hackers released photographs of the passports of Surkov and his children, apparently as further proof the hack was real.<br></p> <p>Mark Galeotti, senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but unlikely that Ukrainian hackers would be able to break into Surkov\u2019s government email account and download a huge collection of files from 2014. Given that the Americans have been hinting at a response, I cannot help but wonder if this was a US government shot across Putin\u2019s bows, a warning that it also has the capability to intrude and embarrass and a willingness to use it if Russia persists.\u201d<br></p> <p>Galeotti said it was possible Ukrainian proxies had been used to cover the tracks. This could explain why the 2014 emails were released alongside what looked like a crude forgery, supposedly a current Kremlin plan to destabilise Ukraine.</p> <p>Surkov is a unique character in Putin\u2019s Kremlin. Unlike many of the yes men and former security officials who surround the Russian president, he first came to prominence as a marketing man for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who would later be jailed for a decade. In 1999, he moved to the Kremlin. He almost never gives interviews, and has been shrouded in mystery over the years.</p> <p>During Putin\u2019s first decade, Surkov was known for coordinating the \u201cmatrix\u201d of Russian politics, cultivating fake opposition parties and funding pro-Kremlin youth groups. He personally curated what was allowed on to Russia\u2019s television screens, and was seen as the architect of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d where facts are relative, a version of which some have suggested has now taken hold in the west.</p> <p>In 2011, a Russian photographer released an <a href=\"http://varlamov.ru/347515.html\">extraordinary photo essay</a> from Surkov\u2019s Kremlin office, revealing that he had portraits of, among others, Che Guevara, Barack Obama and Tupac Shakur. He also had a bank of old-school white telephones with dozens of buttons bearing the surnames of the most powerful people in Russia.</p> <p>He usually wears a faint, knowing smile and there is just a hint of Mr Bean about his appearance. While he wears sharp suits in the Kremlin, he will occasionally appear on his wife\u2019s Instagram feed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_L0XQAKbg/?taken-by=natan_d\">wearing edgy outfits</a> that say \u201ccontemporary artist\u201d more than \u201cKremlin apparatchik\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe likes writing and poetry; he thinks in a non-standard way. He has a rounded personality that despite his abstract modes of thinking is very capable of tackling serious state tasks,\u201d said one source who has worked closely with Surkov. </p> <p>Surkov is widely believed to be the real author behind the pen name Natan Dubovitsky, who has written a postmodern novel and a number of short stories. In March 2014, a short story attributed to Dubovitsky called Without Sky was published, set in an imaginary future where the planet was engulfed in \u201cworld war five; the first non-linear war\u201d. </p> <p>One passage read: \u201cThe simple-hearted commanders of the past strove for victory; now, they were not so stupid. Of course, some of them acted like before and tried to retrieve the old worn-out slogans, like \u2018Victory will be ours\u2019. Sometimes it worked. But mostly, they understood war as a process; part of a process, its most acute phase, but maybe not its most important phase.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a week after the story was published, the annexation of Crimea was completed. </p> <p>Surkov\u2019s initial fall from grace came back in 2011, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/01/medvedev-stay-russian-president\">Russian elite was split</a> between those who wanted to see the relatively liberal Dmitry Medvedev stay in the Kremlin for a second term, and those who wanted Putin to return. In an uncharacteristic misstep, Surkov backed the wrong horse, and let it be known in elite circles that he was firmly in the camp that wanted to see Medvedev given the chance for another term. </p> <p>When Putin came back, Surkov was edged out, and after a period as deputy prime minister, seemed to be a spent force. He later returned, but was put in charge of relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Russian protectorates essentially annexed from Georgia. It was hardly a glamour job, and was a spectacular step down from directing the entire Russian domestic political scene. </p> <p>But as Russia was drawn into a clandestine war in east Ukraine, Surkov has gradually risen to a position of prominence again; both his experience in managing relations with the Georgian protectorates and his talent for intrigue and subterfuge made him the perfect person to run the Kremlin\u2019s relations with the \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d that sprang up in east Ukraine and were essentially coordinated from Moscow.</p> <p>Surkov has not yet commented on this week\u2019s hack. When he was put on the US sanctions list for his role in the Ukraine events back in 2014, he likened it to \u201cgetting an Oscar for best supporting actor\u201d and said it made him happy. \u201cThe only things that interest me in the US are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg and Jackson Pollock. I don\u2019t need a visa to access their work. I lose nothing,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>He was also placed on the EU sanctions list, although Time magazine <a href=\"http://time.com/4476005/vladislav-surkov-putin-athos-greece-sanctions/\">reported</a> he was spotted at an Orthodox monastery in Greece earlier this year, and he then popped up very publicly alongside Putin in Berlin.</p> <p>\u201cI am too odious a person for this brave new world,\u201d said Surkov, with characteristic irony and ambiguity, back in 2011 when he was removed from his post in the presidential administration. <br></p> <p>Now, it seems he fits right in again.</p>",

This would allow him to borrow for investment and to provide support for the \u201cjust managing\u201d families (as Theresa May calls them) who will be squeezed by the continuing benefits freeze.</p> <p>Alternatively, should Hammond merely delay Osborne\u2019s surplus target by a year (to 2020-21), he would be forced to impose an additional \u00a39bn of tax rises or spending cuts. Were he to reject any further fiscal tightening, a surplus would not be achieved until 2023-24 - too late to be politically relevant. </p> <p>The most logical option, as the Resolution Foundation concludes, is for Hammond to target a current surplus. But since entering office, both he and May have emphasised their continuing commitment to fiscal conservatism (\u201cHe talks about austerity \u2013 I call it living within our means,\u201d the latter told Jeremy Corbyn at her first PMQs). For Hammond to abandon the goal of the UK\u2019s first budget surplus since 2001-02 would be a defining moment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/791214137846140928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Will Hammond embrace Balls&#39;s stance or just soften Osborne&#39;s?

  "<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more Americans have health insurance today than ever before \u2013 <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf\">20 million</a> more than in 2010. The news this week that Obamacare insurance premiums are going up an average 25% may seem worrisome, but many insurers had initially underestimated costs and set rates <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/perspective/how-aca-marketplace-premiums-measure-up-to-expectations/\">lower</a> than the Congressional Budget Office had projected. We\u2019re now seeing a correction. </p> <p>That said, the ACA hasn\u2019t been an unqualified success. Many poor and middle-class Americans still don\u2019t have access to affordable health insurance. The Obamacare experiment may finally prove that there\u2019s only so much market-based solutions can do.<br></p> <p>One of the most popular measures under the ACA was to bar insurance companies from denying someone coverage due to a pre-existing health condition, such as pregnancy, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer or depression. <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/perspective/september-kaiser-health-tracking-poll-pre-existing-conditions/\">More than half of Americans</a> say that they or someone in their household has a pre-existing condition. Some of these folks get insurance coverage through their job. Others are poor or disabled or old enough to qualify for Medicaid or Medicare. But before the ACA, the rest faced sky-high premiums if they could get insurance at all. </p> <p>Because insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, they could sell insurance to the rest of us relatively cheaply. That\u2019s because they were selling insurance to healthy people who wouldn\u2019t use a lot of health services. Insurers underestimated just how sick those signing up for the Obamacare plans would be, and that\u2019s a key reason costs and premiums are going up now. And even though premiums on Obamacare plans are going up, it\u2019s not as much as you\u2019d think. Employer-sponsored health insurance is still <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2000931-are-nongroup-marketplace-premiums-really-high-not-in-comparison-with-employer-insurance.pdf\">more expensive</a>.</p> <p>But just because Obamacare insurance premiums are going up doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll pay more. <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/212721/2017MarketplaceLandscapeBrief25.pdf\">Eight out of 10</a> Americans buying insurance on <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov\">Healthcare.gov</a> will still be able to get coverage for under $100 per month. That\u2019s because Americans who make between 100% and 400% of the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/01/25/2016-01450/annual-update-of-the-hhs-poverty-guidelines\">Federal Poverty Level</a> (between $24,300 and $97,200 for a family of four in 2016) \u2013 <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/212721/2017MarketplaceLandscapeBrief25.pdf\">85%</a> of those buying an Obamacare plan \u2013 are eligible for a tax credit. These tax credits go up if insurance premiums go up, so your out-of-pocket costs stay about the same.</p> <p>But there are some clear losers under Obamacare. You will face a big premium hike if you buy your own insurance and make too much to be eligible for a tax credit (mostly small business owners and their employees) or if you\u2019re eligible for a tax credit but choose to shop for insurance outside the Obamacare marketplace (an estimated 2.5 million people). And if you\u2019re one of the 4 million poor Americans living in the 19 states opting against Medicaid expansion, you\u2019re out of luck.</p> <p>Most concede Hillary Clinton will probably win the election next month. She\u2019ll have a narrow window to make changes to the ACA before gridlock returns. While Democrats may take control of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-if-democrats-win-the-senate-in-2016-their-majority-is-unlikely-to-endure/2016/10/23/443b9bec-9930-11e6-b4c9-391055ea9259_story.html\">Senate</a>, the scales will probably tip back the other way in the 2018 midterm elections. Democratic control of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/24/499082622/house-top-40-flipping-control-still-a-tough-task-for-democrats\">House</a> remains a long shot. This is the time to think and act big.</p> <p>Clinton has come out in favor of a public option: a Medicare-like plan that would compete with private plans on the health insurance marketplace. With lower <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41746\">administrative costs</a> and greater <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140993\">bargaining power</a> to negotiate more favorable rates with healthcare providers, a public option would have a competitive advantage over private Obamacare plans and would probably prove cheaper. Meanwhile, premiums for private plans will probably keep going up as big insurance companies get bigger by acquiring smaller ones and there\u2019s less competition and fewer choices.</p> <p>If Clinton wants to close the gap and help the Obamacare losers, she\u2019ll have to think more boldly. She might consider expanding tax credits up the economic ladder and offering vouchers to the poor living in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid so they too can buy Obamacare plans.

  "<p>Throughout her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton has said that she supports the second amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners.<br></p> <p>But many gun rights advocates say they fear she will reopen the door for cities and states to <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/constitution-and-second-amendment/\">ban private ownership </a>of handguns, pointing to her repeated comments questioning a key US supreme court decision on gun ownership. Even liberal second amendment experts have called some of Clinton\u2019s explanations of her position \u201codd\u201d.</p> <p>As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she opposes Roe v Wade. </p> <p>At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which overturned Washington DC\u2019s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a law that required other guns in homes to be \u201ckept nonfunctional\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/docs-4\u00d73-card/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Gun Nation\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/docs-4\u00d73-card/embed.html\">Gun Nation</a> </figure>  <p>In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense. </p> <p>Clinton had <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&amp;page=1\">dodged giving a clear answer</a> about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional. But in 2015, the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/leaked-audio-clinton-says-supreme-court-is-wrong-on-second-amendment/\">Washington Free Beacon reported</a>, Clinton told an audience at a private event that \u201cthe supreme court is wrong on the second amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.\u201d<br></p> <p>That\u2019s an opinion that is shared by many people \u2013 including some of the liberal justices on the supreme court, who <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf\">argued</a> in their dissent that the second amendment was intended to protect the right of people in each state to form militias, not to limit lawmakers\u2019 ability to regulate civilian gun ownership. </p> <p>But that particular view is not one that is popular with the general public. A Gallup poll from 2008 found that <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/105721/public-believes-americans-right-own-guns.aspx\">73% of Americans</a> believed the second amendment \u201cguarantees the rights of Americans to own guns\u201d.</p> <p>Publicly, Clinton has stopped short of calling for the supreme court to reverse itself \u2013 she told Fox News in July that she <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/31/hillary-clinton-on-tight-race-accusations-against-trump/\">did not want</a> to see the Heller decision overturned. During last week\u2019s debate, she said that she supports \u201can individual right to bear arms\u201d.</p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s comments questioning Heller have given the National Rifle Association and Donald Trump continuing fuel for their argument that what she really wants to do is overturn Heller and re-open the door for cities and states to \u201cban private gun ownership\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/05/gun-control-reform-maine-hillary-clinton-nra\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56863\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2781300\"            data-video-name=\"How firearm-loving Maine could defeat the gun lobby \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f5e6b8e4b024298f91dd7e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/06/161005Maine_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/06/161005Maine.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/06/161005Maine_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/05/gun-control-reform-maine-hillary-clinton-nra\">How firearm-loving Maine could defeat the gun lobby</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The argument Clinton has made repeatedly \u2013 including at last week\u2019s debate \u2013 is that she disagrees with the supreme court ruling because of her concern that it might undermine the ability of states and cities to pass safe storage laws to keep guns away from children, as well as other \u201creasonable regulation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s an explanation that fits Clinton\u2019s narrative of being a champion of children\u2019s safety. But several attempts to challenge safe storage laws in court after the Heller decision have failed, most recently in California in 2015,according to Adam Skaggs, the litigation director at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. </p> <p>That San Francisco safe storage law was very similar to DC\u2019s previous storage requirements, but it included an explicit exemption for self-defense, Skaggs said.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s other stated gun control priorities \u2013 including expanded background checks on gun sales, a federal ban on assault weapons, and tightening restrictions on gun ownership by domestic abusers \u2013 are not currently threatened by the Heller decision. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/nra-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-gun-control\">NRA to spend $15m on ads to defeat Hillary Clinton in key states</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign has not responded to repeated requests over the past six months to clarify whether or not she believes that cities and states should be allowed to ban handguns.</p> <p>Her campaign has accused her rival, Donald Trump, of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">conspiracy theories</a>\u201d and \u201cpeddling falsehoods\u201d when he claimed that she wanted \u201cabolish\u201d the second amendment and \u201ctake your guns away\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2008, the country\u2019s largest gun control groups have moved on from the fight over the controversial Heller decision, arguing that the \u201ccommonsense\u201d gun laws they support are fully consistent with the supreme court\u2019s ruling that Americans have the right to have guns in the home for self-defense.</p> <p>Two of the largest national gun control groups, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Michael Bloomberg-backed Everytown for Gun Safety, both said in July that the Heller decision was completely compatible with the gun legislation they support. </p> <p>\u201cEverytown supports the right of law-abiding gun owners to have a gun in the home for self-defense, as articulated in Heller,\u201d Everytown\u2019s legal director, Elizabeth Avore, said in a statement in July. \u201cNothing in the decision is inconsistent with commonsense laws to prevent gun violence.\u201d</p> <p>While Heller was a crucial symbolic victory for gun rights advocates in terms of constitutional interpretation, it has had little impact on the country\u2019s broader landscape of gun laws. Lower courts have upheld the vast majority of gun control laws challenged under Heller. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear why Clinton has taken a more aggressive line in questioning Heller than mainstream gun control groups have done. </p> <p>In May, one of Clinton\u2019s senior policy advisers <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">told Bloomberg Politics</a>: \u201cIn overturning Washington DC\u2019s safe storage law, Clinton worries that Heller may open the door to overturning thoughtful, common sense safety measures in the future,\u201d Maya Harris said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg Politics.</p> <p>Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor and prominent gun rights supporter, said Clinton may be \u201cboxed in\u201d by her previous statements about Heller. </p> <p>\u201cI think the arguments she\u2019s making sound like ways to try to minimize the damage to her from past statements,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Volokh and Alan Gura, the attorney who successfully argued the Heller case in front of the supreme court, both said they doubted Clinton\u2019s claim that she truly supports an individual right to gun ownership. </p> <p>\u201cIf you were to say, \u2018I support abortion rights, but I\u2019m for overturning Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey, then what kind of abortion rights are you supporting?\u201d Volokh said. </p> <p>Gura called Clinton\u2019s endorsement of an individual right \u201cmeaningless\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou can regulate things out of existence and can still pretend that you support the underlying right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e046135a20b69696f185fc6f172e1afc843083ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e046135a20b69696f185fc6f172e1afc843083ce/0_180_3578_2148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Remington gun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The constitutional right of Americans to bear arms has become a flashpoint in the presidential contest between Clinton and Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saul Cornell, a legal historian and second amendment expert at Fordham University, said it was fair for gun rights advocates to question if Clinton wanted to ban handguns, but doubted that she would actually take such an extreme position. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf that was, in fact, what she wanted, she is way out of line with the mainstream thinking on this question, both jurisprudentially and public policy-wise, which would be very odd for her,\u201d Cornell said. Clinton tended to hew to mainstream liberal policy positions, not stake out bold stances, he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe more likely explanation is there\u2019s some confusion here.\u201d </p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s debate-night description of the Heller case as being about trying \u201cto protect toddlers from guns\u201d<strong> </strong>did not help her, Cornell said.</p> <p>The candidate could have made plenty of valid critiques of Heller. </p> <p>Instead, Cornell said, \u201cshe went for what was the most focus-grouped, simplistic analysis, and that played right into the hands of people who were saying she was being disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Fact-checkers have largely given Clinton the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-hillary-clinton-wants-/\">benefit</a> <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/trump-distorts-clintons-gun-stance/\">of the doubt</a> on her <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/05/hillary-clinton-wavers-on-second-amendment-right-to-bear-arms/\">sometimes dodgy</a> statements about the second amendment \u2013 a choice that may have helped fuel conservative perceptions that the media has been biased against Trump and for Clinton. </p> <p>At the same time, the NRA has given the candidate no benefit of the doubt. </p> <p>\u201cThe gun rights community always needs somebody to vilify, and Hillary Clinton is the obvious candidate. In that respect, it doesn\u2019t really matter what she says on the issue,\u201d said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist who has written extensively on America\u2019s gun debate.</p> <p>The NRA has agued that the second amendment is on the ballot in 2016, since the next president will get to nominate a supreme court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, a gun rights champion and the author of the Heller decision, who died in February.  </p> <p>Asked about Clinton\u2019s assertion that she believes in an individual right to own guns, an NRA spokeswoman said that \u201cthose words ring hollow\u201d and that Clinton \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe believes that the supreme court got it wrong on Heller, which means she does not believe you have an individual right to own a firearm in your home for self-protection,\u201d Jennifer Baker said after last week\u2019s debate. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s opinion on the second amendment may ultimately be less consequential than gun rights advocates fear, or than liberals might hope. Among second amendment scholars, the most common opinion is that even a supreme court with several Clinton appointees is unlikely to overturn the Heller decision completely, though it might try to water down the full implications of the ruling. </p> <p>Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who wrote a book on the Heller case, said earlier this year that it was lack of political support in Congress and in statehouses, not the supreme court\u2019s Heller decision, that was standing in the way of progress on new gun laws. </p> <p>\u201cOverturning Heller would be a huge mistake. There\u2019s a real possibility of a backlash,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gun rights movement is very well organized in all 50 states. If the court were to overturn Heller there would a very rapid response by the National Rifle Association for a constitutional amendment strengthening gun rights.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><em>The following is an edited version of a speech made by Guardian writer Jessica Valenti to <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-southern-finger-lakes\">Planned Parenthood of the Southern Finger Lakes</a> last week.</em></p> <p>How is everyone doing? Ready for November 8 yet?<br></p> <p> Tonight, I was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice. It\u2019s such a wonderful frame \u2013 to think about what a feminist future might look like. But I bet like a lot of you, it\u2019s hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that, for women especially, will depend on what happens in just 18 days.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There is no overstating how important this election is. It\u2019s not just about the next four or eight years. This decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country, and setting a very particular course for the women who live here. We\u2019ll look back on this time as a watershed moment: a moment that could, in fact, shape the next hundred years of women\u2019s rights.</p> <p>But first I want to share a personal story. </p> <p>A little over six years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter, Layla. And when I was 28 weeks pregnant, I got incredibly ill. I developed pre-eclampsia, which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy.</p> <p>I was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days, I developed another complication called <a href=\"http://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/hellp-syndrome\">HELLP syndrome</a>, the short version being my liver was in danger of failing, and I was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born.</p> <p>I had an emergency C-section and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/18/baby-pregnancy-premature-birth\">Layla was born</a> weighing 2lb 2oz. She stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life, undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day I try to avoid thinking about. </p> <p>But I was lucky, and she was lucky, and today she\u2019s a wonderful healthy six-year-old. And I feel grateful for that every day.</p> <p>I share this story often, because this was something in my life that changed me forever, that shaped who I am today.</p> <p>And when I think about this moment, what I think about most often is how fortunate I was that I got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that I wasn\u2019t faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life.</p> <p>And when I think about those days in the hospital \u2013 the fear, the urgency, the confusion, the stress \u2013 the idea that the government could ever become involved in my life\u2019s most pivotal moment? It horrifies me.</p> <p>So one thing I want for the next hundred years? I want for no person, ever, to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else.</p> <p>I want for no woman, ever, to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference.</p> <p>In the next hundred years, I want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why I want to talk about this election tonight. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.</p> <p>Never before in American politics have women\u2019s bodies been so front and center in the national conversation. And so at risk.</p> <p>We are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights, and a candidate who says that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-punishment-abortion-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders\">women who have abortions need to be punished</a>. A candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend Planned Parenthood, and a candidate who promised to defund it.</p> <p>A choice between a person who has spent her life in public service, and a braggadocious businessman who <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/\">rips off his workers</a>.</p> <p>And, perhaps most tellingly: we\u2019re making a decision between a woman who has said that \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXM4E23Efvk\">women\u2019s rights are human rights</a>\u201d and a man who says if you want to, you can just grab women \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">by the pussy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a feminist rallying cry online right now that I like a lot, and it says: November 8, pussy grabs back.</p> <p>Now, I know that so much has been made of that comment, and the ensuing allegations against Trump by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">multiple women</a> that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape.</p> <p>And while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights, those of us here in this room know better.</p> <p>We know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch women\u2019s bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies. </p> <p>Reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect \u2013 or in this case, disrespect \u2013 of women\u2019s bodily integrity and autonomy.<br></p> <p>Either our bodies are our own, or they\u2019re not.</p> <p>And make no mistake, the conversation that we\u2019re having right now about \u201cgroping\u201d is not just salacious media fodder. The way we come out of this moment \u2013 the direction our culture shifts because of it \u2013 will absolutely determine women\u2019s rights in the future. </p> <p>We are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards \u2013 back to a place where \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and men will make decisions for women. Or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings.<br></p> <p>Those are the two paths.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re on the right one. The one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for. </p> <p>When Trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions, there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments. But more importantly, pro-choice activists and organizations like Planned Parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished, that\u2019s exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal.<br></p> <p>And in fact, what has already happened to women like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/02/it-isnt-justice-for-purvi-patel-to-serve-20-years-in-prison-for-an-abortion\">Purvi Patel</a>, who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in Indiana.</p> <p>Our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent.</p> <p>When Donald Trump claimed that what he said on that Access Hollywood tape was just \u201clocker-room talk\u201d, and later when former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that all men talk like this, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">men across the country came out to say</a>: no.</p> <p>This is not normal. This is not acceptable. Men are better than this. </p> <p>The feminist future that we\u2019re fighting for has men fighting alongside of us, men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a \u201creal man\u201d.<br></p> <p>When Trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted attention, when he called women disgusting, when he called women pigs, the media \u2013 who can so often get things wrong \u2013 took him to task.</p> <p>Because our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked. Women have been disparaged and harassed for too many years, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/sexual-assault-tipping-point-elizabeth-warren-trump\">we\u2019re not going to take one more minute of it</a>. We\u2019re done.</p> <p>Of course this feminist future \u2013 the future that we\u2019re so close to getting \u2013 it\u2019s not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to Donald Trump.</p> <p>We are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the conversation.</p> <p>This week, for the first time ever, a presidential candidate offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">a nuanced and empathetic defense</a> of late-term abortions on a national debate stage. This is a third-rail issue that most politicians won\u2019t touch, but Clinton talked about women\u2019s lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue isn\u2019t just about policy \u2013 it\u2019s about us.</p> <p>We\u2019re living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in decades, maybe ever. People don\u2019t shy away from the word feminism any more, they embrace it.</p> <p>When I started speaking on college campuses 10 years ago, I would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists. Back then, just a few people would raise their hands. When I speak at colleges today, nearly everyone does.</p> <p>Feminism has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it \u2013 Sarah Palin calls herself a feminist, anti-choice organizations call themselves the \u201creal\u201d feminists. They recognize the power that the word and the movement have, and they want to use it toward their own, very anti-feminist, ends. </p> <p>But our feminist future is a smart one, and it knows that anyone who would legislate women\u2019s bodies, who would interfere in women\u2019s and families\u2019 private medical decisions have no place calling themselves feminists.</p> <p>Of course, being in this incredible feminist moment \u2013 when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get \u2013 being in this moment doesn\u2019t mean that our feminist future is guaranteed.</p> <p>It\u2019s not. Those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural strides, there is an intense backlash \u2013 we\u2019re in the midst of it now, and it will only intensify if Hillary Clinton becomes president. </p> <p>Making sure that this backlash doesn\u2019t define us \u2013 that we are not put on the defensive by it \u2013 that is what will truly determine our feminist future. </p> <p>Will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move forward? Will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be done?<br></p> <p>If the people in this room, and the people at Planned Parenthood are any indication \u2013 we know the answer to those questions.</p> <p>This is just the beginning</p> <p>My daughter tells me that she wants children one day. (Though she says she doesn\u2019t want to be pregnant \u2013 her wife will have the kids.) But when she talks about having children, when I think about being a grandmother or a even great-grandmother one day \u2013 that\u2019s when I think about those hundred years that we\u2019ve been talking about.</p> <p>I think about what the world will be like for them. And I have faith, I really do, that it will be a world \u2013 that this will be a country \u2013 where people determine their own destiny.</p> <p>A world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of women\u2019s bodies \u2013 but an economic issue, a family issue, and a human rights issue. </p> <p>And the reason I have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here. Because of Planned Parenthood. Every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where women\u2019s words, lives, bodies and experiences matter. Years where we\u2019re not defending ourselves from attack, but building something progressive and something real.<br></p> <p>All of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future. I could not be more grateful to you, and I could not be more honored to join that fight with you.</p>",
  "<p>Television is often accused by faith leaders of marginalising religion. But, if this sin of omission exists, the charitable explanation would be that the subject imposes a double penance on schedulers. In a largely secular society, not only is the potential audience for shows on religious subjects small, but those few who might tune in tend to be hypersensitive about coverage of their beliefs or those of rival worldviews.<br></p> <p>But, though theology may be a minority interest, the politics and psychology of the Vatican have long proved a fascination, and TV fiction has often genuflected towards Rome. Graham Greene (a convert who made the church his central subject as a novelist) once said that Catholicism was naturally dramatic because of the moral jeopardy within a system in which believers were forbidden contraceptives or abortion, and clergy were forbidden sex at all. This week, The Young Pope \u2013 starring Jude Law as Lenny Belardo, an American cardinal who becomes Pope Pius XIII \u2013 takes its place in a congregation of memorable TV shows involving Catholicism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3dc4c4a74fc8d14db65ff38c7c4b37c48a056c29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc4c4a74fc8d14db65ff38c7c4b37c48a056c29/0_65_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Most of the characters had been baptised in the Roman faith \u2026 The Sopranos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baptised in the Roman faith \u2026 The Sopranos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/HBO/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>President Josiah Bartlet in The West Wing, Dana Scully in The X-Files and Peggy Olsen in Mad Men were all Catholics whose faith was significant. And as a result of their Italian-American background, most of the characters in The Sopranos had been baptised in the Roman faith, and the sacrament of confession (and its secular descendant, therapy) underlay the moral agonies of Tony Soprano and his relatives. Another high-profile US series \u2013 Lost \u2013 and a British one \u2013 Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes \u2013 both proved at their conclusions to have been occurring in versions of purgatory, the place of purification that, in Catholic doctrine, stands between death and heaven for troubled souls.</p> <p>The Young Pope, though, stands out as a startlingly original treatment of the topic. Created by big-screen film director Paolo Sorrentino, whose films include <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review\">The Great Beauty</a> and Youth, no other recruit from the movies has transferred their cinematic sensibility to the new medium so successfully.</p> <p>The most obvious story to have told would be a sort of House of Cardinals, exploiting the parallels (elections, cabinet positions, assassination threats) between the Vatican and Washington. The Young Pope has a small strand of such narrative \u2013 disloyal Cardinals plot to \u201csave the church\u201d from the unpredictable American \u2013 but Sorrentino starts after the papal election, avoiding the tantalisingly melodramatic plotlines of the death of an old pope and the choice of a new one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655d6bbf069c2ae2a9c4c899b414572d57720bc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655d6bbf069c2ae2a9c4c899b414572d57720bc6/0_98_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facing the faithful \u2026 The Young Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Fiorito/Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is no ecclesiastical procedural: Law\u2019s character wakes up as pope, preparing to face the faithful in St Peter\u2019s Square. As it happens, this is logistically improbable (popes tend to be elected in early evening and address the waiting crowds immediately) but Sorrentino needs Pope Pius XIII to start in bed so he can unleash a lavish dream sequence, seamlessly merging pontifical news footage with fantasy material, that sets the tone for the whole show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/25/the-young-pope-jude-law-paolo-sorrentino\">Puffing pontiff: The Young Pope's Oscar-winning director on Jude Law, sex and cigarettes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In terms of televisual heritage, The Young Pope most bends the knee to Mad Men: Lenny Belardo, like Don Draper, has a central blankness that is both attractive and dangerous. Abandoned by hippy parents, he was raised at an orphanage where he came under the tutelage of Sister Mary (Diane Keaton), a nun who became his surrogate mother. As happened with the enigmatic advertising executive, the truths and rumours about Lenny\u2019s past seem set to become central.</p> <p>Otherwise, Sorrentino cuts his own cloth, consistently resisting the templates of Vatican drama. The standard storyline of a liberal reformist pope who battles reactionaries is reversed. Law\u2019s character is theologically severe, confirming homosexuality as a sin and urging the faithful to make God their priority. And, while the current occupant of the throne of St Peter is Pope Francis, a natural theatric happy to pose for selfies with the crowds, Pius XIII refuses to be photographed and delivers his public homilies in silhouette.</p> <p>What\u2019s most striking, though, is that its attitude to the papacy is simultaneously cheeky and serious. Pius XIII is a chain-smoker whose diet consists largely of Cherry Coke Zero, while Keaton\u2019s Sister Mary sleeps in a T-shirt with the slogan: \u201cI\u2019m a virgin (but this is an old shirt).\u201d Sorrentino also delights in surreal background details, including a kangaroo gifted to the pope by the Australian government, Cardinals playing pool on a table occupied by a dog, and footballing nuns taking part in a penalty shootout while Ave Maria soars on the soundtrack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc2f5d6269186ea6b6fc61d4c11d4ead9b24d15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2f5d6269186ea6b6fc61d4c11d4ead9b24d15/0_0_1500_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This is no ecclesiastical procedural \u2026 The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This is no ecclesiastical procedural \u2026 Jude Law plays the Pope with a marvellous mix of humanity and unearthliness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid these moments of irreverence, Law\u2019s pope is a reverent man, whose faith and vows are taken seriously. Even before the virgin T-shirt, it\u2019s clear that Keaton\u2019s character is a sort of Mother Mary. And, while it is common in the work of Dan Brown for the pope to be secretly the antichrist, there are strong early hints that Lenny may have dropped the anti. He seems to possess miraculous powers and, like Jesus, to have known of his mission since childhood. </p> <p>This is a show that trusts its audience enough for a key plot point to be established through words written in unsubtitled Latin in the condensation on a coach window. Handed parts that must be among the most unusual but rewarding of their careers, Law and Keaton will have other actors praying not to be up against them for an Emmy. Their portrayals feature subtle touches of lightness and darkness that leave viewers alternately faithful and agnostic about them.</p> <p>Law creates a hybrid of humanity and unearthliness that recalls David Bowie as Thomas Newton. What might have been House of Cardinals becomes, in Sorrentino\u2019s hands, something more like The Pope Who Fell to Earth \u2013 magnificently strange and strangely magnificent.</p> <ul> <li><em>The Young Pope starts in the UK on Thursday at 9pm on Sky Atlantic. </em><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Unesco, the UN\u2019s world heritage organisation, has adopted a controversial resolution that criticises Israeli actions around the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount complex in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City \u2013 with Israel claiming it deletes Jewish ties to holy sites.</p> <p>The final version of the resolution \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/israel-unesco-resolution-jerusalem-palestine\">which has sparked furious claims and counter-claims</a> \u2013 passed easily on Wednesday after Israel pressed for a secret vote.

Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer, activist and expert on Jerusalem\u2019s fraught politics, accused both sides of \u201cinflammatory point scoring\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are real issues in the Old City and around the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif that really beg for sober and pragmatic solutions based on the norms of international law, and that neither deny nor ignore the equity of any side.

According to the <a href=\"http://cdn.agilitycms.com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_report_en.pdf\">Global Media Monitoring Project 2015</a> [pdf], women are the focus of only 10% of news stories, comprise just 20% of experts or spokespeople interviewed, and a mere 4% of news stories are deemed to challenge gender stereotypes.</p> <p>What we see on-screen matters for what happens off-screen.

The practice of telling stories and producing debates, which reflect a male-dominated political sphere, is both deeply ingrained and incredibly subtle. Getting women in front of the camera is only half the battle; we also need fundamentally to change the way we interact and the language we use. </p> <p>Having grappled with these issues over the past few years, a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/publications-and-resources/policy/practice-briefings/gender-and-governance-empowering-women\">new report for BBC Media Action</a> explores how the media can help redress \u2013 instead of exacerbate \u2013 gender imbalances in politics. Here are three key things it can do:</p> <h2>Provide role models</h2> <p>It can be a revelation to see women as leaders \u2013 or questioning those in power \u2013 especially given that media and political environments habitually sideline and attack women. Moreover, we have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/publications-and-resources/research/reports/media-and-political-participation\">growing evidence</a> that political debate and discussion shows inspire audiences to participate in their own communities. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the ladies ask questions of the officials, I become encouraged and proud of them</p> <footer> <cite>Woman in Afghanistan responds to seeing a woman question the president</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our recent research reports that those who regularly tune in to BBC Media Action\u2019s governance programmes are more likely to participate in politics than those who don\u2019t, even once other influencing factors such as demographics and interest in politics are taken into account. </p> <p>This is how a woman in rural Afghanistan reacted when she saw a woman from her area ask the then President Hamid Karzai a question on our political debate programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/asia/afghanistan/open-jirga\">Open Jirga</a>: \u201cI like her courage for asking. When the ladies ask questions of the officials, I become encouraged and proud of them.\u201d</p> <h2>Put gender on everyone\u2019s agenda</h2> <p>The media can take gender issues out of the private realm and put them on the political agenda. The Tanzanian political discussion programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/africa/tanzania/a-national-conversation\">Haba Na Haba</a> (Little by Little) does this by treating women\u2019s health topics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/23/why-do-a-million-women-still-suffer-the-treatable-condition-of-fistula\">such as fistula</a>, as political issues. </p> <p>But we need to go beyond this. \u201cApplying a gender lens\u201d is common parlance in women\u2019s rights circles \u2013 but how often does the news use this lens? Rarely. Development practitioners can help the media cover all stories in a way that\u2019s representative of both men and women\u2019s lives and experiences. As the senior producer of political debate programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/africa/kenya/sema-kenya\">Sema Kenya</a> says: \u201cWe always made gender part of the programme. If it was on cross-border trade, we\u2019d think about if it affected women in a different way. We didn\u2019t crowbar it in. And gender issues weren\u2019t directed at women, they were just subtly raised.\u201d</p> <h2>Promote inclusion by disrupting norms</h2> <p>Political debate in the media often sends a strong message to women: this is not for you. So it is unsurprising that women are far less likely to watch the news than men. We have been contending with how to make programmes that imagine a new, more inclusive space, rather than recreate an elitist political one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nepal\u2019s <a href=\"http://bbcsajhasawal.com/en/\">Sajha Sawal</a> (Common Questions) debate show is experimenting with new formats. Instead of bringing people into a potentially intimidating studio environment, they take politicians out to communities to visit communal taps, tea shops and fields \u2013 places where women feel much more confident to ask questions. </p> <p>The media is powerful. It can reach millions of people, challenge rigid gender roles and empower both men and women. However, making programmes that transform how we see men and women is complex; there\u2019s no simple, universal recipe to follow. Presidential debates in the US show that having a woman in the race may represent enormous progress, but does not transform the debate. </p> <p>Whether or not women feel genuinely heard, fully valued and spoken to as equals is certainly no box-ticking exercise. And as the pundits deliver their verdicts on Clinton and Trump\u2019s performances, making programmes in which we not only see women, but actually hear them, will still be a work-in-progress. </p> <p><em>Josephine Casserly is a governance and rights adviser at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/mediaactioninsight/entries/703ec6e0-e8e1-4891-b614-752d48c678fc\">BBC Media Action</a>. </em></p> <p><strong>Join our community </strong><strong>of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>\u201cThe whole thing is absolutely crazy,\u201d Ian St John says as he mulls over the possibility of Donald Trump becoming US president. \u201cThere surely must be someone inside the Republican party who\u2019s a more suitable candidate than him \u2013 they\u2019d only need half a brain.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly not, it seems, and in two weeks\u2019 time Trump could be elected to become the most powerful man on the planet.

Why on earth am I discussing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions with the former Scotland and Liverpool striker Ian St John? Because he met him, 25 years ago, in New York, and for the fifth-round draw of the Rumbelows Cup.</p> <p>You may well have seen the clip by now given it\u2019s been doing the rounds for some time, spreading across social media and feeling like an almighty trick of the mind. But it\u2019s real enough \u2013 Donald Trump, he of the scaremongering and frankly absurd bid for the White House, pulling the names of Norwich City, Nottingham Forest (or Southampton), Middlesbrough and Manchester United out of a small green bag.</p> <p>St John was there with Jimmy Greaves, which for anyone of a certain age will immediately spark memories of Saint and Greavsie, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehAbY96AA_4\">hugely popular Saturday afternoon show</a> hosted by the two legendary former players. Running from 1985 to 1992, it consisted of interviews, previews, goals, gaffes and, at seemingly regular intervals, St John chuckling at his television partner\u2019s attempts at what would now be referred to as \u201cbanter\u201d.</p> <p>It was a winning combination and in December 1991 led to the most unlikely of meetings.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in New York to film the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKVt1pAiqSM\">qualifying draw for the 1994 World Cup</a>, which was to be held in America,\u201d St John, now aged 78, remembers. \u201cIt was the idea of our producer, Bob Patience, who is sadly no longer with us, and I was really excited by going over. \u2018That\u2019ll do me!\u2019 I said to Bob.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a problem, though \u2013 Jimmy hated flying. As a player he used to get the train everywhere, even for games abroad with the likes of Tottenham and England. He\u2019d only fly if he could have a drink first but Jimmy was teetotal at the time so that wasn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa24cfa805cb73dddb0e22830a8610ad6002a525\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa24cfa805cb73dddb0e22830a8610ad6002a525/40_290_5720_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian St John, left, and Jimmy Greaves during a recording of Saint and Greavsie, which ran for seven years up until 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian St John, left, and Jimmy Greaves during a recording of Saint and Greavsie, which ran for seven years up until 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>St John eventually persuaded Greaves to board the plane to New York \u2013 \u201cI told Jimmy I\u2019d hold his hand during the flight\u201d \u2013 and the pair attended the draw, which, rather grandly, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/09/sports/soccer-world-cup-94-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle.html\">staged at Madison Square Garden and hosted by I Dream of Jeannie star Barbara Eden</a>.</p> <p>That done, St John and Greaves had another, less glamorous task to undertake while in New York \u2013 sorting out the fifth-round/quarter-final ties of that season\u2019s League Cup, which at the time was sponsored by Rumbelows, an electronic retailers that back in the day rivalled Currys and Dixons.</p> <p>David Dent, the secretary of the Football League, had by now also travelled to the US and the only thing left to organise was a venue for the Saint and Greavsie crew to film the event. \u201cBob thought it would be a good idea to do it from inside the Trump Tower as it was such an iconic building in New York,\u201d recalls St John.</p> <p>Step forward you-know-who.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s involvement in the draw came about through a freak coincidence. His secretary at the time was English and upon spotting St John and Greaves in the lobby of Trump Tower as Patience sought permission to film there, she wandered over for a chat. Rapport developed, she then asked the old pros if they\u2019d like to meet the boss and see if he wanted to appear on their programme. They quickly said yes.</p> <p>\u201cThe plan was to do an interview but then Bob had another great idea \u2013 let\u2019s ask Donald if he wants to get involved with the draw,\u201d says St John, who won 21 caps for Scotland and was a member of the Liverpool team that won two league titles and the FA Cup under Bill Shankly. \u201cHe agreed, even though he clearly knew nothing about football. I think the appeal for Donald was being on a TV show that had a large audience in Britain. He saw it as an opportunity to promote himself and his company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2015/feb/25/david-squires-on-the-league-cup\">David Squires on \u2026 the League Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo be fair to Donald, he was really good with us. He respected the fact Jimmy and I were former pros and asked about that as the crew set up to film the draw. We also had a good chat about golf as he was really into that and we played a bit. But, as I say, he had no idea about football and certainly no idea what Rumbelows was. We didn\u2019t bother explaining it to him.\u201d</p> <p>The draw took place in Trump\u2019s boardroom, or perhaps <em>one </em>of his boardrooms given we\u2019re talking about a <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/new-york-ny/trump-tower/\">68-storey building here</a>. It\u2019s not made clear in the clip but, either way, Greaves was certainly impressed with his surroundings. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a boardroom like this since I was in Doug Ellis\u2019s at Aston Villa!\u201d he\u2019s seen saying in the now widely watched clip of the draw, which leads to collective laughter, with no one laughing harder than Trump despite the fact he clearly has no idea what the Englishman across the glistening oak table was talking about.</p> <p>Trump is dressed in a light blue shirt and a dark blue tie and first grabs our attention with a smug look to camera. He looks really young, despite the fact he was 45 at the time. His skin is smooth, his eyes twinkly, his body relatively slim and the only thing truly linking him to the scorched-skinned potato monster of today is that trademark back-combed haircut. Ridiculous now, ridiculous then.</p> <p>Dent doesn\u2019t waste any time getting proceedings under way. After a quick introduction to camera he states Greaves, who is sitting to his left, will draw the home teams while Trump, who is to his right, will draw the away teams. St John, meanwhile, can be seen hovering in the background with microphone in hand, a position he maintains for the duration of the recording.</p> <p>We\u2019re all set:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRMJ3ftUtnw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RRMJ3ftUtnw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The draw for the fifth-round of the 1992 Rumbelows Cup.

Nice one, Jimmy.</p> <p>Trump makes his first move: No7 \u2013 Norwich City.</p> <p>An all-Division One tie between two sides hovering in mid-table. A solid if unspectacular start.</p> <p>Back to Greaves: No3 \u2013 Swindon Town or Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Back to Trump: No8 \u2013 Nottingham Forest or Southampton.</p> <p>A horribly indecisive tie and no doubt very confusing for Trump given the involvement of four teams, one of which sounds like a glass castle.</p> <p>Tie three and finally some excitement as Greaves pulls out No2 \u2013 Peterborough United. \u201cWell done Jim, that\u2019s a good one for them,\u201d says St John out of shot.</p> <p>Peterborough were in the Third Division at the time and had reached the quarter-finals courtesy of a shock 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the previous round. That had taken place at London Road and now they had another home tie \u2013 the Wembley dream was well and truly on.</p> <p>Who would they get next? Over to you Trump: No1 \u2013 Middlesbrough.</p> <p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d says Greaves and interesting it indeed was given Boro were then just one division above Peterborough. This was a winnable tie for Posh.</p> <p>Pulses finally racing, we come to what proved to be the main event: No5 \u2013 Leeds United.</p> <p>Trump digs his hand into the little green bag \u2026 No6 \u2013 Manchester United.</p> <p>\u201cOoh, Donald!\u201d exclaims St John, again out of shot. As the camera then pans out, Greaves leans forward, looks directly at Trump and says: \u201cYou don\u2019t realise what you\u2019ve done there!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/football-quiz-name-the-league-cup-sponsor\">Football quiz: name the League Cup sponsor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here, for perhaps the only time in history, it feels appropriate to use the phrase \u201cin fairness to Donald Trump\u201d given a) he didn\u2019t set out to pair United with Leeds, who that season battled it out for the Division One title, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/17/leedsunited\">Howard Wilkinson\u2019s side coming out on top</a>, and b) there was only one little red cube left in the bag, so he had no other choice.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a biggy, that sounds like the type of game I want to go to,\u201d Trump says in a nod to the reaction around him but again with the look of someone who has no idea what the hell is going on.</p> <p>Greaves doesn\u2019t help the situation with his next intervention: \u201cI tell you what Donald, are you thinking of opening a store in England? Take my advice, you can open one in Leeds but don\u2019t go to Manchester!\u201d</p> <p>By now Greaves is on a roll and takes it upon himself to ask Trump if he\u2019s ever played football before. \u201cI used to play,\u201d the tycoon replies. \u201cIt\u2019s a great game, I love soccer, I played actually in high school.\u201d He sounds convincing but given the things we\u2019ve heard from the 70-year-old\u2019s mouth during the presidential campaign it\u2019s probably best to take the idea of a teenage Trump shouting: \u201cGet it in the mixer, lads!\u201d with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>There\u2019s also some talk about the upcoming World Cup \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how it catches on in the United States,\u201d Trump muses \u2013 before Greaves draws proceedings to an end by presenting the host with a Saints and Greavsie mug. \u201cThis is the most prestigious award in footballing history,\u201d the former goal-scorer says before informing Trump that if he pours hot coffee into the vessel, \u201cFunny Old Game\u201d will appear on one side.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Bush or Frank Sinatra haven\u2019t got one of those,\u201d Greaves adds as Trumps accepts his new gift and, remembering the moment, St John lets out one of his trademark chuckles. \u201cJimmy\u2019s the biggest piss taker I\u2019ve ever met and Donald wouldn\u2019t know a piss taker if he tripped over one!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he took it all in good spirits and afterwards shook our hands and thanked us for coming.

When Jimmy and I met him he came across as very polite, so much so that Jimmy called him \u2018my mate Donald afterwards\u2019, even though he was probably taking the piss again.\u201d</p> <p>St John lets out another of his infectious chuckles, but his mood becomes instantly sombre when he speaks about how Greaves remains \u201cvery ill\u201d following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/04/jimmy-greaves-severe-stroke-intensive-care-england\">severe stroke the 76-year-old suffered in May</a> and how the pair, once so close, on and off screen, have not been in each other\u2019s company for longer than he\u2019d care to remember. \u201cI\u2019ve offered to go down and see him but been told it\u2019s not worth it as he wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019m there, or if he did, he wouldn\u2019t be able to say much to me,\u201d St John adds with an unmistakable sadness in his voice. \u201cI think about Jimmy all the time and just pray he gets better.\u201d</p> <p>And what does St John think Greaves, the winner of 57 England caps and regarded as one of the finest finishers of his generation, would make of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign? \u201cWell, if we were still doing the show he\u2019d probably try and get him on!\u201d the Scot replies with another of those chuckles. \u201cAnd if that wasn\u2019t possible we could have a special section called: \u2018What daft thing has Jimmy\u2019s old mate Donald said now!\u2019\u201d</p>",

J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir says she has no ambition to be prime minister, pointing to the Pirate party\u2019s horizontal structure.

In other words, we consider ourselves hackers \u2013 so to speak \u2013 of our current outdated systems of government.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>This anti-establishment message has resonated with large swaths of Iceland\u2019s 320,000-strong population, especially the young.

  "<p>A Hong Kong-born former Northern Ireland assembly member has said the Brexit vote will deter other ethnic minority people from entering politics as racism and xenophobia intensifies.</p> <p>Anna Lo, who retired from the assembly partly due to racial abuse she says she has received, also predicted that anti-foreigner violence and intimidation would increase in Northern Ireland as the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU approached.</p> <p>Speaking before the launch of her memoir, The Place I Call Home, the president of the cross-community Alliance party said the EU referendum result had built \u201cdangerous expectations\u201d among pro-Brexit voters that immigrants would leave Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK.</p> <p>\u201cShortly after the referendum the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities organised a conference about Brexit\u2019s impact on this place. Even only a few weeks after the vote I heard dozens of immigrants stating that they were starting to hear their fellow workmates asking them: \u2018Well then, when are you all going home?\u2019 Brexit has raised dangerous expectations as well as putting out lies about immigrants taking up benefits, houses, jobs,\u201d Lo said.</p> <p>\u201cI have been the victim of racist abuse and threats in the recent past but I fear more than ever for immigrant communities living in Northern Ireland following the Brexit vote. It has stirred up so much negativity towards people from ethnic minorities. I am worried like never before about racism and anti-immigrant feeling after Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Lo said she doubted anyone from her ethnic background would be prepared to enter British or Northern Irish politics in the post-Brexit era. \u201cIt was hard enough being in the devolved assembly before the referendum, but given the atmosphere since the Brexit vote I would be very doubtful that anyone from a background like mine would stand up and enter politics now. It is going to get even harder to persuade people from ethnic minorities to come forward and stand for election, but especially in Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>In her book, Lo says she was on the receiving end of racist abuse and intimidation because she was the public face of the immigrant community in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>She writes: \u201cOne Thursday, on my way from Stormont to my constituency office after a committee meeting, I stopped in Connswater shopping centre to get a picture taken for a new passport. On my way out of the centre to the front car park, I heard people shouting my name. As they did not sound particularly friendly, I quickened my pace and got to where my car was parked.</p> <p>\u201cThen a car passed me. A young woman was practically hanging out of the back passenger window, screaming abuse at me. I was extremely glad that they did not catch up with me and that there was a barrier between the road where the vehicle was travelling and my car. I was quite sure that, if they had got closer to me, there would have been an ugly scene.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/03/racism-northern-ireland-muslims-peter-robinson-resign\">Tackling racism in Northern Ireland must start with the first minister | Anna Lo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lo says she was appalled by alleged anti-Islam remarks made by the former first minister Peter Robinson two years ago.

It is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they get anywhere near casting their votes. When Trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the system, he\u2019s right. The only problem is that he is the system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024women_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024women.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024women_KP-2166838.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The political constitution of the United States is not, as Madison envisaged, representation tempered by competition between factions. The true constitution is plutocracy tempered by scandal. In other words, all that impedes the absolute power of money is the occasional exposure of the excesses of the wealthy. What distinguishes Trump\u2019s political career is that, until recently, his scandals have done him no harm.</p> <p>Trump disgusts us because, where others use a dog whistle, he uses a klaxon. We hate to hear his themes so clearly articulated. But we know in our hearts that they suffuse the way the world is run.</p> <p>Because this story did not begin with Trump, it will not end with Trump, however badly he may lose the election. Yes, he is a shallow, mendacious, boorish and extremely dangerous man. But those traits ensure that he is not an outsider but the perfect representation of his caste, the caste that runs the global economy and governs our politics. He is our system, stripped of its pretences.</p>",

In a year that seems ripe for third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.<br></p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents and a majority (54%) of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> took this position, while less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation across class or race.</p> <p>Both Democratic presidential nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Republican standard bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump\u2019s low rating is more consistent with the Republican party\u2019s own favourability (36%).</p> <p>The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him. Less than half the public (43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/american-political-parties-democrats-republicans-representation-survey\">Most Americans do not feel represented by Democrats or Republicans \u2013 survey</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580feb1de4b08d944ba4aa23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T23:30:51.560Z\">12.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>LeBron James - and Nike - appear to be coming for a certain presidential candidate\u2019s views regarding immigrants, women and inner-city African Americans in a new ad:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOZxIpy6Gm4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dOZxIpy6Gm4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580fe799e4b08d944ba4aa11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T23:15:52.392Z\">12.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>TrumpTV is back after Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Florida:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Donald Trump, TV\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDonaldTrump%2Fvideos%2F10157973074675725%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580fe139e4b08d944ba4a9ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/spencerackerman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T22:50:02.348Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Analysis: Hillary Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Retired senior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military\">US military</a> pilots<strong> </strong>are increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal for \u201cno-fly zones\u201d in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5808ba39e54a90bc64f62b75397b3424d2d45f81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5808ba39e54a90bc64f62b75397b3424d2d45f81/0_0_2400_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Lorenzino/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former strategists spoke to the Guardian as Clinton\u2019s Republican rival Donald Trump warned that Clinton\u2019s proposal to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d to protect beleaguered Syrian civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three\">would \u201clead to world war three\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>The proposal of no-fly zones has been fiercely debated in Washington for the past five years, but has never attracted significant enthusiasm from the military because of the risk to pilots from Syrian air defenses and the presence of Russian warplanes.</p> <p>Many in US national security circles consider the risk of an aerial confrontation with the Russians to be severe.<br></p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft,\u201d said James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, on Tuesday in response to a question from the Guardian at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>Those who have patrolled no-fly zones over the relatively freer skies of Bosnia and Saddam-era Iraq fear that a President Clinton would oblige the US to what one retired US air force three-star general described as an indefinite \u201cair occupation\u201d.

Ivana Trump told Mr. D\u2019Antonio about a Colorado ski vacation she took with Mr. Trump soon after they began dating. The future Mrs. Trump had not told her boyfriend that she was an accomplished skier. As she recalls it, Mr. Trump went down the hill first and waited for her at the bottom:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>IVANA TRUMP: So he goes and stops, and he says, \u201cCome on, baby. Come on, baby.\u201d I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared.

In this scenario, senate candidate Patrick Murphy upsets Marco Rubio in Florida and the Democrats end up with a 54-seat senate majority. But, to underscore just how hard this would be, <em><strong>the Democrats still don\u2019t take the House</strong></em>.</p> <p><strong>What about the Trump upset?</strong> He gets Pennsylvania (where polling averages have Clinton up six points), Wisconsin (ditto) and New Hampshire (five points), in addition to all the Romney states plus Florida, Iowa and Ohio.
