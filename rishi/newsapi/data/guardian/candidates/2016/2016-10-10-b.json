  "<p>Lest there be any doubt, Donald Trump made clear Monday that he is running a scorched earth campaign for the next month.<br></p> <p>Speaking in a high school gym in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, his first public event since the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">leak on Friday of his 2005 comments about</a> groping women without their consent, Trump amplified <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">his rhetoric from Sunday night\u2019s debate</a> and attacked rival Hillary Clinton and her husband \u2013 former president Bill Clinton \u2013 in starkly personal terms. </p> <p>Trump, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">invited four women</a> who claimed to be the victims of misconduct by the Clintons to be his guests at the debate on Sunday, renewed his offensive against his Democratic opponent. </p> <p>The Republican nominee called Bill Clinton \u201ca predator\u201d and said his wife enabled him \u201cinstead of trying to stop it, she made possible for him to take advantage of more women, she put more women into harm\u2019s way\u201d.</p> <p>He also threatened that \u201cif they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we\u2019ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary doing inappropriate things.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also referenced the Chappaquiddick incident \u2013 in which a woman died after a car being driven by the late senator Ted Kennedy went off a bridge in 1969. Trump cited the incident as another example of Democratic scandals covered up by the media. </p> <p>The speech came as Republican leaders <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">increase their efforts</a> to distance themselves from their party\u2019s nominee. Speaker Paul Ryan told members of the House GOP caucus on Monday \u201cyou all need to do what\u2019s best for your district\u201d and seemed to write off Trump\u2019s chances of winning, saying he would \u201cspend his entire energy making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress\u201d. </p> <p>After widespread condemnation over his debate threat to jail his political rival, Trump did not explicitly renew his calls to jail Hillary Clinton if he was elected. Instead, he took a somewhat milder tone and merely called for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. Trump also suggested \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the NSA might have the missing emails that Clinton deleted from her personal email server.</p> <p>But Trump also attacked Clinton on policy grounds. He railed against the Democratic nominee from the left on entitlement reform and claimed that she wants to \u201cknock the hell out of Medicare and Medicaid\u201d. The former secretary of state has committed to expanding both programs. </p> <p>He also attacked Clinton for her support for \u201copen trade\u201d. \u201cYou know what that does to your community,\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s the end.\u201d He also returned to familiar attacks and falsely claimed Clinton is \u201cfor radical unlimited immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-renews-voter-warning-and-says-clinton-could-be-crazy\">once again offered a</a> vague, evidence-free warning of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. He told the almost entirely all-white crowd \u201cit\u2019s so important that you watch other communities because we don\u2019t want this election stolen from us\u201d. He has made this statement several times in the past in the Keystone state, seemingly based on a popular <a href=\"http://billypenn.com/2016/08/08/what-sean-hannity-got-wrong-about-philly-election-fraud/\">rightwing conspiracy theory</a> that Mitt Romney was the victim of voter fraud in Philadelphia in 2012. The theory, which is a dogwhistle reference to African American voters, is premised on the fact that in 59 precincts in majority black neighborhoods, Romney did not receive a single vote. There are 1,687 precincts in the city and Obama received over 85% of the vote there in 2012.</p> <p>While a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-after-trump-tape-revelation-clinton-s-lead-double-digits-n663691\">new NBC/WSJ poll</a> showed the Republican nominee falling behind Clinton by 14 points in a two-way race, Trump supporters in Pennsylvania were unfazed by the nominee\u2019s growing woes. Instead they took heart in what they saw as a dominating debate performance, one which former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told the crowd was \u201cthe best performance any presidential candidate had in the history of debates\u201d.</p> <p>Joe Tedeski, a Trump supporter who watched the debate, thought his candidate won while Clinton was \u201cthe greatest liar I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He dismissed concerns about Trump\u2019s remarks saying \u201cpeople change, attitudes change\u201d and insisting that Trump\u2019s graphic description of groping women without their consent was \u201cjust talk\u201d and that he had never actually engaged in that behavior. </p> <p>This was echoed by Isaac Foldi of Bloomingdale, Ohio, who was decked out in Trump merchandise for the event and praised his candidate\u2019s performance. In particular, Foldi pointed to Trump\u2019s line that Clinton was \u201cno honest Abe\u201d as an effective zinger. While the Trump supporter thought the nominee\u2019s 2005 comments were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d, he found them insignificant compared to Clinton\u2019s sins. \u201cIt makes little sense to go after him for saying some crude things when Hillary humiliated women raped and assaulted by her husband.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night before spending the next two days in Florida.</p>",

  "<p>The 2005 tape of Donald Trump bragging that his celebrity status allowed him to grope women with abandon has sent the Republican party reeling.

I would never intentionally suggest otherwise.\u200e\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson has not responded to a follow-up asking Sessions to clarify whether he thinks Trump\u2019s comments in the recording describe sexual assault. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-pussy-grabs-back-meme-women-twitter\">'Pussy grabs back' becomes rallying cry for female rage against Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their remarks came just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">three days after the tape of Trump</a> sent shockwaves through the Republican party and a few hours before the House speaker, Paul Ryan, without withdrawing his earlier endorsement, announced he would no<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\"> longer come to Trump\u2019s defense</a>.</p> <p>The tape, recorded while Trump and NBC host Billy Bush rode a bus to the set of Access Hollywood, captured Trump making lewd comments about actor Arianne Zucker \u2013 and women in general \u2013 while Bush egged him on. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\u201d Trump is heard to say on the tape, which the Washington Post released on Friday. \u201cYou know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2013 I just start kissing them.

  "<p></p> <p></p> <p>Right from the very start of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">second US presidential debate</a> on Sunday night, Donald Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-presidential-debate-trumps-anger-against-women\">playing a power game</a>. His entry into the debating hall was ponderously slow \u2013 noticeably slower than Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Psychologists have discovered that people who move and speak slowly are generally seen as bigger, more substantial and more powerful \u2013 characteristics that the Republican was clearly doing his utmost to project throughout the entire debate. </p> <p>When Clinton was asked a question by a member of the public she would often walk over towards the person, endeavouring to show that she was approachable and willing to engage with people \u2013 a trick, incidentally, that was used to great effect by Bill Clinton when he debated George Bush Sr. </p> <p>But when Trump was talking, his Democratic opponent remained respectfully stationary. Trump, on the other hand, made a point of moving around \u2013 not only when he was purportedly answering questions, but even while Clinton was holding the floor. Was this because he finds it so difficult to keep still or \u2013 what seems more likely \u2013 because his prowling was surreptitiously designed to unsettle Clinton and throw her off balance? The fact that Trump also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">made a habit of standing unusually close</a> behind Clinton when she was speaking certainly adds weight to this interpretation of his behavior. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-behind-hillary-clinton-debate-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56pxc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793567\"            data-video-name=\"Trump 'prowls' behind Clinton during presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb8cc1e4b03b4fd4fa5f18\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-behind-hillary-clinton-debate-video\">Donald Trump made a habit of standing close behind Clinton when she spoke</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She seemed to be aware of his close proximity (\u201cHe was very \u2026 present,\u201d she told reporters afterwards), and the millions of viewers watching the debate would certainly have noticed his readiness, not only to take the argument to Clinton but also to intrude upon her personal space.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">Paul Ryan deserts Trump campaign but won't formally drop endorsement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Clinton is surrounded by her supporters she\u2019s normally extremely animated, especially in her facial expressions. During this debate, however, her facial behaviour was much more muted, largely because, presumably, she was trying to come across as serious and presidential. There were several times when she smiled \u2013 typically when Trump was launching a verbal attack or accusing her of something which she considered to be ridiculous. Trump\u2019s facial demeanour was almost the exact opposite of Clinton\u2019s. He hardly produced any smiles at all \u2013 just the occasional wry half-smile of self-congratulation when he thought he\u2019d notched up another point in his favour. That\u2019s because smiling is basically an appeasement signal, and the last thing that Trump wanted to do is appease anyone in public, least of all Clinton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25811efcedd140cc58507fc26cefafeace93167b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25811efcedd140cc58507fc26cefafeace93167b/0_232_3234_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton smiled several times, while Trump\u2019s demeanour was almost the exact opposite.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton smiled several times, while Trump\u2019s demeanour was almost the exact opposite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump also displayed his other hallmark facial features \u2013 the narrowed eyes, the lips clamped tightly together and the occasional jut of the chin. These are all macho signals, designed to convey an impression of someone who\u2019s naturally dominant and comfortable about exercising power. During the debate there were several moments when Trump jabbed his index finger accusingly at Clinton. This was designed not only to point the finger at Clinton, but also to deflect attention away from himself \u2013 which, given the tasteless disclosures of the last few days, was probably his most urgent strategy. There were also occasions when Trump came in for criticism, and where he reacted by licking or pursing his lips. Here was nonverbal evidence that, for all his bluster, he was feeling very uncomfortable and, for the moment at least, had decided that he should say as little as possible. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Dr Peter Collett is a body language expert and author of The Book of Tells.</em></p>",

Another is to get back control of our laws. The one I did not list was our aim to keep our justice and security arrangements at least as strong as they are.

Earlier,<strong> Ed Miliband,</strong> the former Labour leader, told BBC News that MPs should vote on the Brexit strategy, not least to give the government a mandate. The government could publish a white paper on its plans and put it to a vote, he said. He said he was not trying to enable MPs to reverse the referendum result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am saying we are going to be leaving the European Union. That\u2019s what the British people voted for. But we\u2019ve got to get those negotiations right. It was Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who said last week the British people did not vote to make themselves poorer. And he\u2019s right about that. And what worried me about some of what we heard at the Conservative conference was - I understand the concerns about immigration - but what I felt was our whole economy was in danger of being thrown off a cliff ...</p> <p>We need to be knowing now what the government will be negotiating for. And I believe they need to get the consent of MPs. Because there is no other mandate here. The Conservative manifesto said that the Conservative party was determined to stay in the single market. Now, it sounded from what Theresa May and some of her ministers were saying that we were going to leave the single market, contrary to the mandate. So there is no mandate for a hard Brexit. That is why parliament has got to be consulted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One <strong>Dominic Grieve</strong>, the Conservative former attorney general, said MPs should be given the chance to vote on triggering article 50, the move that will start the formal EU withdrawal process. And <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong>, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, told the same programme that he thought MPs should debate the government\u2019s negotiating position.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to me British interests will be best served by an early and full and detailed explanation from the government of what its negotiating position is before it embarks on those discussions ...</p> <p>What has never been discussed in any depth is what we arrive at.

It gives them a 17-point lead.</p> <p>Here are the new figures, and how they compare to the previous Guardian/ICM polling figures from early September, before the conference season started.</p> <p>Conservatives: 43% (up 2)<br></p> <p>Labour: 26% (down 2)</p> <p>Ukip: 11% (down 2)</p> <p>Lib Dems: 8% (down 1)</p> <p>Greens: 6% (up 2)</p> <p>The fieldwork was carried out from Friday to Sunday.</p> <p>The 17-point lead is the joint second highest ever recorded for the Conservatives by ICM in its polling series going back to 1992. They only once got a higher lead (20 points in June 2008, when Gordon Brown was at his most unpopular) although in September and October 2009 they also had a 17-point lead in ICM polls. But Labour did have larger polling leads at various points in the Blair era.</p> <p>At 26%, the Labour figure is only one point higher than their lowest rating in ICM polling - the 25% they hit in June 2008 and August 2009.</p> <p>The Conservative conference was dominated by news about Theresa May hardening up her stance on Brexit and the ICM figures suggest this has gone down well with voters. Although the proposal to force firms to reveal what proportion of their workforce is foreign has now been dropped, following a backlash from business,<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/public-backs-plans-make-companies-say-how-many-for/\"> a YouGov poll at the end of last week suggested voters backed the idea by two to one.</a></p> <p>The Tories may also have benefited from the fall in the Ukip share of the vote. At 11% Ukip are on their lowest level in an ICM poll since the 2015 general election, and this may reflect the damage done to the party\u2019s reputation by the fight in the European parliament on Thursday that left Steven Woolfe MEP hospitalised.</p> <p><em> ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,017 adults aged 18+ on 7-9<sup>th</sup> October 2016, and the data has been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T11:07:13.912Z\">at 12.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fb64f3e4b03258bcac633e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:06:58.098Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/all\">here.</a></p> <p>As for the rest of the papers, here is<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/must-reads\"> the Politics Home list of top 10 must-reads</a>, and here is<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/frontpage/2016/10/newslinks-for-monday-10th-october-2016.html\"> the ConservativeHome round-up of today\u2019s politics stories.</a></p> <p>And here are two Brexit-related stories worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773a9770-8e34-11e6-8df8-d3778b55a923\">George Parker and Arash Massoudi in the Financial Times (subscription) say the government plans a new system of vetting foreign takeovers.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May is to push ahead with a new system to vet foreign investment in Britain, but has heeded warnings from chancellor Philip Hammond that the country cannot afford to adopt \u201cFrench-style\u201d protectionism.</p> <p>The UK prime minister wants the government to be able to intervene in an \u201corderly and structured\u201d way in sensitive foreign investment and is studying regimes used in other countries such as the US and Australia.</p> <p>But at a ministerial meeting last month Mr Hammond led a chorus of warnings that any new regime must not undermine Britain\u2019s position as Europe\u2019s top destination for foreign direct investment, particularly with Brexit approaching in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12d7ac24-2433-11e2-94d0-00144feabdc0\"> down the Danone route</a>,\u201d Mr Hammond said, referring to action taken by the French government a decade ago that appeared to be intended to prevent a takeover of the yoghurt maker Danone.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/brexit-risks-closing-door-on-economy-bosses-warn-9ksg7n5x8\">Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) says the CBI has warned about Brexit being a threat to Britain\u2019s \u201copen economy\u201d.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leader of Britain\u2019s biggest business group has warned Theresa May that she risks \u201cclosing the door\u201d on an open economy with her immigration clampdown and Brexit policy.</p> <p>Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, issued the stark message in an interview with <em>The Times </em>as the government climbed down on its plan to name businesses thought to be relying too heavily on foreign workers ...</p> <p>Ms Fairbairn, who took over at the CBI last year, said: \u201cWhat we have heard over the last few days, if you add up the messages in total, are signs that the door is being closed, to an extent, on the open economy, that has helped fuel investment.

This is the danger we are in, this over-extrapolation. It is not good for our country and it is not the way we go forward. </p> <p>This is precisely why we do need to take the debate into parliament and not see it as having a vote at this stage or that stage, but just beginning at least to know what are the guiding principles as we now leave the European Union.

I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChampioned and revered? You do know that women are human beings and not pedigreed show dogs, right?\u201d Oliver said. \u201cYou hope he works to demonstrate respect for women? What are you talking about? It\u2019s too late in absolutely every way. First, it\u2019s October of an election year, and second, he\u2019s fucking 70!\u201d</p> <p>Oliver also criticized John McCain, despite the senator\u2019s decision to no longer vote for Trump in wake of the controversy (\u201cHe alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences\u201d). <br></p> <p>Trump \u201calone does not bear the burden of his conduct, because he alone did not make himself your party\u2019s nominee\u201d, responded Oliver. \u201cAll of you have consistently supported him through some absolutely heinous shit.

Anything less than that, and this is on you too.\u201d<br></p> <p>Oliver concluded by reiterating what Clinton argued in the debate: that the contents of the video are \u201centirely in character\u201d for Trump. Oliver warned that Trump isn\u2019t going anywhere, even as GOP members flee his ticket. </p> <p>\u201cThis is happening,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd, in a way, perhaps we have been always heading towards this historic moment.

  "<p>Polls normally do pretty well to get a thousand respondents, but <a href=\"https://polldaddy.com/poll/9546050/?view=results&amp;msg=voted\">the poll I\u2019m looking at</a> about the second presidential debate has received a total of 907,211 responses, 68% of whom said that Trump \u201cwon\u201d the night. Sounds solid, right? Not so fast \u2013 there are about 907,211 reasons to dismiss this online poll as garbage.</p> <p>When polls speak to just a thousand people, they try to make sure those people are a good representation of the entire country. If they get it right, the results shouldn\u2019t change by more than 3 or 4 percentage points whether you\u2019ve polled 1,000 people or 2,000. That wasn\u2019t the case last night.</p> <p>When I checked in at 10.15pm, the results looked very different from how they look right now. Of the 49,280 votes that had been cast, 93% of them stated that Trump was the winner of the debate. It\u2019s highly unlikely that most people changed their minds in the last 15 minutes of the debate or in the time since. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi/status/785302597200650240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">sure  <a href=\"https://t.co/juiFdsFAgx\">https://t.co/juiFdsFAgx</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZEWe1FBarR\">pic.twitter.com/ZEWe1FBarR</a></p>&mdash; Mona (@MonaChalabi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi/status/785302597200650240\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Unlike polls that attempt to get a nationally representative sample of voices, this online poll\u2019s respondents were just any old random people on the internet. Well, not quite <em>any</em> old people. The fact that the poll was created by and appeared on the homepage of drudgereport.com means it was probably more of a representation of Drudge readers than the country as a whole. And, according to <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/drudge-report/\">surveys conducted by Pew Research Center</a>, 74% of readers of Drudge Report are on the right of the political spectrum. </p> <p>Lastly, unlike in more reliable polling, people were able to vote more than once in this poll (and still can \u2013 at the time of writing, it\u2019s still open).

That was just hours before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-tape-arianne-zucker-sexual-assault-groping\">the infamous tape surfaced</a> to show that Trump, a rich white man \u2013 not Mexicans, not immigrants, not black men \u2013 making light of sexual assault.<br></p> <p>The debate was depressing. I know Clinton will be better than Trump in many ways, but she\u2019s not going to protect black people. Not really. At best she will maintain the status quo, which even with a black man in the White House involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/14/black-lives-five-years-shorter-why-we-interrupt-you\">black folks dying younger</a>, having a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-opportunity-wealth_us_568c44cee4b0c8beacf4a391\">fraction of white wealth</a>, being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/09/27/yale-study-suggests-racial-bias-among-preschool-teachers/\">considered guilty in preschool</a> and being more likely to be <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/\">arrested</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">killed</a> by police. Another Clinton presidency will not change this.</p> <p>And yet, as the writer Kiese Laymon mused, I looked at Clinton, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel physically afraid for her as she faced off against this monster, seething with white male rage \u2013 this man who stalked her around stage and who cut her off whenever she spoke, even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/09/everything-that-was-said-at-the-second-donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-debate-highlighted/\">just to say</a> \u201cyou have nothing to say\u201d.</p> <p>Trump managed to dictate the conversation however he wanted, and so maybe there would never have been a chance to discuss Black Lives Matter. But if racism can\u2019t be vigorously debated in a town hall in 2016, in St Louis, when we have a black president, then what hope do we have?</p> <p>Perhaps it is appropriate then that Black Lives Matter never came up, even in St Louis. It is a movement taking up issues which are beyond the scope of presidential politics and the failures of the American political system. Sunday night made that all too clear.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 10 October 2016 to reflect the fact that Washington University in St Louis is around 8 miles from the Canfield Apartments, where Michael Brown was killed.

Ben Carson, a former primary season rival of the Republican nominee, insisted that when Trump made those remarks \u201cthat was a very different time in his life and at that time he was a billionaire playboy and the language that he used was consistent with that\u201d.</p> <p>Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani also dismissed the wave of Republicans who had announced in the past 48 hours that they were no longer voting for Trump. \u201cSometimes Republicans get a little weak-kneed,\u201d said Giuliani. \u201cI happen to be a Republican with very strong knees.\u201d</p> <p>Only two Republican officials were in the spin room to praise Trump\u2019s performance: longtime Trump ally Senator Jeff Sessions and congressman Jason Smith of Missouri.

Simple,\u201d said Farage.</p> <p>An hour before the debate started, Trump sought to distract attention away a newly released recording of him boasting of molesting women by staging a surprise stunt to highlight claims once made against his opponent\u2019s husband.</p> <p>Despite recently claiming that he would rather the second presidential debate be about \u201cpolicy\u201d rather than \u201cin the gutter\u201d, the Republican nominee held the extraordinary three-minute press event with four women who have accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing. One of them claimed: \u201cBill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in a conference room to handful of reporters in an event aired on Facebook Live, Trump appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathy Shelton and Kathleen Willey. Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton, which he has denied. Shelton was the victim of a 1975 rape where Hillary Clinton was assigned by an Arkansas court to represent her assailant.</p> <p>The women took turns in speaking after Trump praised them as very courageous.

  "<p>The pound has continued to fall against the US dollar as worries persist over the UK\u2019s economic prospects outside the EU.</p> <p>Sterling suffered sharp losses last week as ministers at the Conservative party conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">signalled they would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d settlement</a> that sacrifices access to the single market and prioritises stricter immigration controls. </p> <p>Sterling was under pressure again at the beginning of this week but some calm had returned to markets. The pound fell 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2395 on Monday. It was flat against the euro at \u20ac1.11. </p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s weakness boosted the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index \u2013 which features companies that make a significant proportion of their profits in dollars \u2013 as it closed at 7,097.5, near its record closing high of 7,104 last year.</p> <p>Investor nerves were strained on Friday when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/theories-emerge-for-pounds-flash-crash-against-dollar\">the pound slumped more than 8% in a \u201cflash crash\u201d in overnight trading in Asia</a>. It dropped from $1.26 to $1.1491 in just eight minutes \u2013 a huge plunge in a market where a single cent is a big change \u2013 and recovered only some of those losses during London trading hours. Sterling still ended the week about 4% lower against the euro and US dollar.</p> <p>One market watcher said the currency was stabilising after the events of Friday morning. \u201cThe dust has started to settle after the flash crash overnight on Thursday saw the pound briefly trade below \u20ac1.10 and $1.20,\u201d said Chris Saint, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s currency service.</p> <p>With a quiet week ahead on the economic indicator front, he expected the pound to continue to take its cues from politics. \u201cThere is little on the domestic calendar this week to draw attentions away from ongoing worries over how politicians will handle Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, although Friday\u2019s construction output data will garner some interest,\u201d said Saint.</p> <p>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, claimed that the \u201cmajor part of the fall\u201d in the pound to a 31-year-low had been down to a \u201cflash crash\u201d. He told parliament on Monday: \u201cThere will be lots of speculative comments in the next two-and-a-half-years that will drive the pound down and up and down and up and there is little we can do about that.\u201d</p> <p>The pound\u2019s sharp fall has raised pressure on those UK firms that rely on imports, such as retailers and those manufacturers who need raw materials like plastics and metals. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive. On the other hand, it makes UK exports more competitive and some companies have reported a pick-up in overseas sales since the British vote to leave the EU in June knocked sterling.</p> <p>For consumers, the weak pound makes overseas holidays more expensive. There are also worries that sterling\u2019s fall will be felt at the tills as retailers pass on their higher costs. The British Retail Consortium warned on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/prices-will-shoot-up-if-uk-fails-to-get-eu-single-market-access-retailers-warn\">a failure to get a good trade deal would push prices up further still</a> as shops adjust to higher trade tariffs.</p> <p>Currency experts expect the pound to remain under pressure against the dollar on continued fears about the UK economic outlook.

  "<p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/georgia-news\">Georgia</a>\u2019s ruling party has cemented its grip on the former Soviet nation by claiming a decisive victory after a fiercely contested parliamentary election..</p> <p>On Monday, the electoral commission announced that Georgian Dream, a party supported by the billionaire former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, had received 48.6% of the vote in the proportional representation race.</p> <p>The rival United National Movement (UNM), supported by ex-president Mikhail Saakashvili, received just 27.14%, while almost all of the other parties failed to clear the 5% threshold required to gain a seat in the 150-member parliament. </p> <p>Georgian Dream, which is pro-western but also favours closer ties with Russia, the country\u2019s former ruler, declared victory shortly after polls closed on Saturday. </p> <p>\u201cI congratulate you with a big victory, Georgia,\u201d Georgi Kvirikashvili, the prime minister, told jubilant supporters who had gathered outside the party\u2019s headquarters in the capital, Tbilisi.</p> <p>Kvirikashvili then invited on to the stage his party\u2019s billionaire supporter, who immediately took aim at the rival UNM.</p> <p>Georgia today has a true people\u2019s government \u201cinstead of the obscure government you had before\u201d, Ivanishvili said. \u201cYou have Kvirikashvili instead of those confused, disorganised people. You have a government you love,\u201d he added, as the crowd chanted his name.</p> <p>The UNM disputed the result, and said there was still a chance for the party to strengthen its position. </p> <p>Georgia\u2019s parliament elects 77 seats by proportional representation and 73 in single-seat constituencies. Though Georgian Dream leads confidently in the proportional race, a further 50 so-called runoff votes will be held in the constituency race, as most candidates failed to garner the 50% required to represent single-mandate districts, the election authorities said on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cThere are tens of districts where we were the favourites. The runoffs will be decisive in defeating the Ivanishvili regime,\u201d said Giga Bokeria, a senior UNM member.<br></p> <p>Georgian Dream is expected to get a super-majority in the assembly if it also prevails in the district votes, scheduled to be held before the end of this month.</p> <p>Though violent attacks in several precincts marred the race, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> said on Sunday that the election had been competitive and that fundamental freedoms had been generally respected.</p> <p>However, others pointed to the wiretapping scandals, fist fights and accusations of coup-plotting that rocked the campaigns as evidence that Georgia\u2019s democracy was still fragile: the first peaceful transfer of power since the 1991 Soviet collapse only took place four years ago. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/22/georgian-politicians-brawl-on-live-tv-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/545m4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2740180\"            data-video-name=\"Georgian politicians brawl on live TV \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e37e60e4b011f2eb71200d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922GeorgiaBrawl_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922GeorgiaBrawl.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922GeorgiaBrawl_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/22/georgian-politicians-brawl-on-live-tv-video\">Georgian politicians brawl on live TV</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Last week, an opposition MP\u2019s car was badly damaged after an explosive device was planted beneath the vehicle. <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/world/georgian-opposition-leader-givi-targamadzes-car-blown.html\">The MP, named as UNM representative Givi Targamadze</a>, was not hurt in the attack. </p> <p>Critics of the government said Ivanishvili and Saakashvili\u2019s feud was to blame for the fiery campaigns. Neither man is running for office, yet many see their influence over the country\u2019s two largest political parties as a burden on Georgia\u2019s young democracy.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an unusual situation when at the centre of the campaign we have two individuals who have no status involving direct public accountability,\u201d said Mikheil Benidze, executive director of the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy.</p> <p>The feud has dogged Georgia since the last parliamentary vote in 2012, when Ivanishvili\u2019s party, then a member of the multi-party Georgian Dream coalition, won a majority of the seats on offer.</p> <p>Ivanishvili then stepped down as a prime minister in 2013, claiming that his job to end the near decade-long dominance of Saakashvili\u2019s UNM was done. Saakashvili went on to become governor of Ukraine\u2019s Odessa Oblast, but both men remain influential in Georgian politics.</p> <p>The question of Russian influence also loomed large over the campaigns, and for the first time the Patriots\u2019 Alliance of Georgia, widely seen as a pro-Moscow party, narrowly passed the 5% barrier to enter the legislature \u2013 a result that could change as the vote count continues.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p> <p></p>",

Do you understand that?\u201d Trump, who later dismissed the tape as \u201cjust words\u201d, doubled down on calling his comments \u201clocker room talk\u201d.</p> <p>What made that non-apology even worse was the physical way Trump held himself in the debate. Perhaps if you\u2019ve been embroiled in a controversy about groping women and bragging about groping women, you don\u2019t skulk around stage behind a woman. (And maybe don\u2019t threaten to throw her in a jail \u2013 a new low!)</p> <p>I predict that on Monday there will be people saying that Trump won simply because he didn\u2019t spontaneously combust on stage. Clinton was clearly more composed and knowledgable, while Trump did his usual word salad, ignoring questions and making the odd racist move of talking about inner cities to an undecided voter seemingly only because he was black.</p> <p>But at the end of this strange event, I think the biggest loser was all of us watching.</p> <h2>Kenneth Pennington: \u2018Trump is depriving Americans of robust national discourse\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4321f5f371d89c8009ec8a1dc664a4643cd1b2a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4321f5f371d89c8009ec8a1dc664a4643cd1b2a8/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kenneth Pennington.

His asinine attempts to dismiss his piggish behavior by distracting viewers with talk of Bill Clinton and Isis were a failure.</p> <p>But the real losers in tonight\u2019s debate, and in this election, are the American people. When Donald Trump answers a serious question about his (lack of) healthcare proposals, he says simply, \u201cThe plans are going to be so good.\u201d When asked about his (lack of) morals, he says randomly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna knock the hell out of Isis.\u201d He won\u2019t answer questions.</p> <p>Part of that is a deliberate diversion strategy. To avoid talking about the video clip where he appears to condone sexual assault, he slams Bill Clinton or resorts to fear-mongering. But most of Trump\u2019s answers lack depth because he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. When Anderson Cooper pressed him on how he could possibly reconcile his policy on preconditions with a repeal of Obamacare, he had absolutely nothing to say. He just doesn\u2019t know.</p> <p>When it comes to the Syrian civil war and the millions of victims it\u2019s claimed, his policy also remains to be seen. This is a man who decides consequential policy positions on the stage because he hasn\u2019t thought of them ahead of time. When he threw Mike Pence under the bus on Syria, it appeared to be the first time he\u2019d even considered the question at hand.</p> <p>Sadly, his lack of depth means our country has lost a valuable opportunity to engage in a desperately needed public discussion about the differing viewpoints in America on consequential issues. America needs Hillary Clinton to face off with an opponent who will challenge her viewpoints, not a hollow-headed clown with zero depth.</p> <p>How can we fight climate change, raise incomes for the middle class, reform our ailing democracy, educate our children or champion world peace without serious and deep debate? We\u2019ll never make headway on our serious challenges without robust national discourse.

Whether sparring over Obamacare or foreign policy or tax reform or job creation, he effectively kept hammering her on her 30-year record.</p> <p>Instead of a debate that was focused on Trump\u2019s vulgar comments, the debate was focused on policy issues, and despite all of Clinton\u2019s \u201cpreparation\u201d when it came to the nuts and bolts of policy, Trump managed to not only go toe-to-toe with Clinton, he often got the best of her.</p> <p>Trump needed to win tonight to stay alive. Clinton did not. Trump won, and he lives to fight another day. This race is far from over.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of Sunday\u2019s second televised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential debate</a>, Hillary Clinton said something that political candidates often say, but which in 2016 is no longer the usual banality. \u201cThis is not an ordinary time,\u201d said Mrs Clinton. \u201cAnd this is not an ordinary election.\u201d If anything, this was an understatement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">The second debate</a> between her and Donald Trump, and the days running up to it, have been extraordinary living and livid proof of that.</p> <p>Rarely in any democratic country, never mind in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, can the substance and the temper of the debate have been so low, so dark, so personal and so damaging as it has now become in the US race. The responsibility for this cannot be dismissed as six of one and half a dozen of the other. The responsibility for it rests squarely with Mr Trump, his campaign and his personality. To take just one example: in most democracies, the tape that exploded into the public arena <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\" title=\"\">at the end of last week</a>, in which Mr Trump was heard boasting about his sexual aggression towards women, would have destroyed his candidacy. He would have been forced to quit, partly because of the offensiveness of his words and views, and partly so his party\u2019s other candidates can save their electoral skins.</p> <p>Yet not only did Mr Trump brazen the tape out at the weekend, but on Sunday night he deliberately went lower and darker still. Shortly before the debate, Mr Trump held a press conference championing women who claim to have been Bill Clinton\u2019s past sexual targets. This attempt to fan the stone-cold embers of arguments that distracted and demeaned America nearly 20 years ago was a clear signal. It showed that Mr Trump will fight as dirty as he can, all the way to November. It also suggested that his focus is on firing up the angriest and most paranoid parts of the Republican vote. This was confirmed once the debate was under way, when Mr Trump insulted, abused and patronised Mrs Clinton at every opportunity, both in his words and by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\" title=\"\">intimidatory platform manner</a> that his admirer Nigel Farage revealingly likened to the dominant behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-fights-donald-trumps-corner-in-post-debate-spin-room\" title=\"\">a silverback gorilla</a>.</p> <p>There have been other bitter presidential contests in the US. Yet this contest has become a break with the past that will not be easily repaired and for which America will pay a price at home and abroad, whatever the outcome next month. When before did one candidate say of another in debate that they have \u201ctremendous hate\u201d in their heart? Or refer to his opponent as the devil? And when before did one candidate say, as Mr Trump did, that, if elected, he would try to see his opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">prosecuted and put in jail</a>. That\u2019s what happens in autocracies and dictatorships. It\u2019s the way leaders behave in countries with no respect for the rule of law or the separation of powers. But it has not been the way, until now, in America.</p> <p>Mr Trump does all this partly because that is the kind of person he is: impulsive, rude, aggressive, extreme. He does it partly because there has always been something violent and vengeful about the white right in the US. And he does it partly because his rise has been one manifestation of a global anger against democracy\u2019s failures to control the rich and compensate the poor.</p> <p>But it is no accident that this is happening in the first US presidential race in which a woman may win. Of course, Mr Trump would behave aggressively if his Democratic opponent were a man too. He\u2019s that kind of bully. But his anger through the campaign, and in Sunday\u2019s debate, is the anger of a man who cannot treat women as equals. In another remark in the debate Mrs Clinton said her vision of America is of somewhere where everyone has a place. Mr Trump\u2019s view of women\u2019s place does not bear thinking about \u2013 and should not be voted for.</p>",

  "<h2>Trump goes low while Clinton is subdued in debate </h2> <p>Donald Trump is waiting to learn this morning if he did enough in his debate performance last night to stabilize his floundering presidential campaign. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\">heated match-up</a> in St Louis that followed the release of a tape last week of him crudely bragging about groping women, the Republican nominee exceeded low expectations. The tone of the debate was bitter, with Trump at one point <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">threatening </a>to \u201cjail\u201d Democratic rival Hillary Clinton while she accused him of trying to divert attention from the release of the lewd recordings.  Clinton accused the businessman of being in the pocket of Vladimir Putin, but looked rattled by the brutal onslaught over her record in office. Trump began the night by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">introducing three women</a> at a press conference who had accused the candidate\u2019s husband of rape or sexual assault in the 1990s, and one woman, raped as a child, whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended, as ordered by a judge, when she was a 27-year-old lawyer. They sat in the audience for the debate throughout the evening.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">Donald Trump threatens Hillary Clinton with jail in second presidential debate</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56nhb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2792540\"            data-video-name=\"Highlights from the second presidential debate: Trump fights dirty against Clinton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb22ade4b05c2f1e953d92\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010DebateSubs_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010DebateSubs.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010DebateSubs_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\">Highlights from the second presidential debate: Trump fights dirty against Clinton</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Our columnists react</h2> <p><strong>Richard Wolffe</strong>: \u201cThe nicest thing you could say about Trump\u2019s performance was that it was bonkers\u201d; <strong>Jessica Valenti</strong>: \u201cPeople will say that Trump won simply because he didn\u2019t spontaneously combust on stage\u201d; <strong>Kenneth Pennington</strong>: \u201cTrump is depriving Americans of robust national discourse\u201d; <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Christopher R Barron</strong>: \u2018Trump succeeded in recapturing the momentum.\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-fact-check-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">Here,</a> the candidates\u2019 claims are fact checked, while Adam Gabbatt meets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/trump-supporters-debate-clinton-critics-pennsylvania-bar\">pro-Trump voters</a> in Pennsylvania. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\">Trump or Clinton: who won the second presidential debate?</a></p> <h2>Facebook facing pornography test case</h2> <p>A legal case against Facebook, which will involve a 14-year-old taking the company to court in Belfast over naked images published on the social network, could open the floodgates for other civil claims, according to lawyers who work with victims of revenge pornography. The trial centers on a claim that Facebook is liable for the publication of a naked picture of the girl posted repeatedly on a \u201cshame page\u201d as an act of revenge.

Today, the US economy has seen the longest streak of job creation on record and the White House claims that the economic recovery is here. Yet many feel that financial insecurity remains high and job security low. We speak to five people about how they feel about the economy eight years after the start of the financial crisis. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/oct/08/great-recession-financial-crisis-recovery\">The Great Recession: the hollow recovery</a></p> <h2>Christians against climate change</h2> <p>John Abraham considers the growing movement among people of faith to bring more action to dealing with climate change.

Paul Douglas, a respected meteorologist, entrepreneur, Republican and Christian, and his writing partner Mitch Hescox, who leads the Evangelical Environmental Network, offer a side-by-side presentation first of science, then faith, and back to science again.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/10/caring-for-creation-makes-the-christian-case-for-climate-action\">Caring for Creation makes the Christian case for climate action</a></p> <h2>Tom Brady returns, Patriots win</h2> <p>After missing four games as punishment for \u201cDeflategate\u201d, Tom Brady stepped onto the field in Cleveland to cheers and \u201cWelcome back Tom!\u201d signs.

Here\u2019s what happened:</p> <ul> <li><strong>It was a nasty affair </strong>without perhaps being quite so sordid or raw as might have been expected, given Donald Trump\u2019s signal beforehand that he would attack Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husband\u2019s sins.</li> <li><strong>Challenged to defend his recently uncovered hot mic remarks </strong>about grabbing women, Trump said they amounted to \u201clocker room\u201d talk he was embarrassed by \u2013 but he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been \u201cso abusive to women.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Clinton did not respond to Trump\u2019s catalog </strong>of her husband\u2019s sins, apart to say it was inaccurate. \u201cWhen they go low, you go high,\u201d she said.</li> <li><strong>Clinton placed Trump\u2019s hot mic remarks in context</strong> with others \u2013 she listed his attack on the Khan family, his \u201cbirther\u201d attack on Obama, his attack on a disabled reporter and his attack on a federal judge of Mexican descent \u2013 to paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump \u201cowes the country an apology.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton</strong>. He repeatedly called her a liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career, loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members, and told her if he were president, \u201cyou\u2019d be in jail.\u201d He pointed at her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62\">said</a>, \u201cshe has tremendous hate in her heart.\u201d</li> <li><strong>\u201cI know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight,\u201d</strong> Clinton told Trump. \u201cAnything to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are leaving it.\u201d</li> <li><strong>More than one snap analyst \u2013 FWIW </strong>\u2013 thought Trump had \u201cshored up his base\u201d of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, Benghazi and other issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal.</li> <li><strong>Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence </strong>the election, and not on her behalf. </li> <li><strong>Trump said he disagreed with running mate</strong> Mike Pence\u2019s assertion that the United States should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after.<br></li> <li><strong>Trump also said there\u2019s no Muslim ban plan anymore:</strong> \u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.\u201d</li> <li><strong>A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. </strong>He said that Capt.

Several weeks after the invasion, Trump told the Washington Post: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/25/hollywood-partyers-soldiering-on/06327347-83d3-44c4-ab7b-dcd6fbda5437/?resType=accessibility\">The war\u2019s a mess</a>.\u201d In August 2004, he told <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">Esquire</a>: \u201cTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201d </p> <p>Even in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/a-guide-to-donald-trump-early-flip-flops-on-the-iraq-war?utm_term=.vq5VjeKwe#.uy2eDvV5v\">the interview</a> cited by the Trump campaign to explain his \u201copposition\u201d, Trump expressed impatience with Bush for not invading sooner. \u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Trump: Hillary Clinton wants to increase refugees by 550%</strong></p> <p>Trump is correct that Clinton has proposed a 550% increase in refugees, from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017.</p> <p>But this does not add up to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d, as he says. He appears to have borrowed this figure from an ally, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who <a href=\"http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/clinton-refugee-plan-could-bring-in-620-000-refugees-in-first-term-at-lifetime-cost-of-over-400-billion\">invented it. </a>Session falsely claims Clinton would continue to grant asylum to 55,000 Syrian refugees every year in addition to 100,000 refugees from the Middle East in general. Clinton has called for allowing 55,000 refugees from Syria for one year, and has not proposed yearly asylum for 155,000 Middle East refugees for her term.</p> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201c<strong>People are coming into our country, like, we have no idea who they are, where they\u2019re from, what their feelings about our country are \u2026 We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love of our country\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is false. The US has likely the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

His campaign cited <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html\">data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> (NLEOMF), which does show <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">a 56% increase</a> in officers killed by guns between 1 January and 16 July 2016 (28) compared with the same span in 2015 (18). But according to the nonprofit group, officer deaths overall, including from traffic accidents and job-related illnesses, are roughly on par with figures from this point in 2015: 60 deaths this year to 61 the year before.</p> <p>The nonprofit\u2019s data also shows that police fatalities overall <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">have declined</a> in the last 15 years: the last seven years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency saw an average of 135 police deaths, a 17% decline on the final seven years of George W Bush\u2019s administration, which saw an average of 162 a year. Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition. In the years between its enactment and repeal, from 1920 to 1933, an average of 250 officers were killed each year. Gun-related deaths were <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/research-bulletins/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">highest in 1973</a>, according to the NLEOMF figures, when 156 officers were killed.</p> <p>The FBI also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted\">reports</a> police deaths with information submitted to it from various law enforcement agencies, though its most recent figures date to 2014. According to such data, that year 96 law enforcement officers were killed, 51 by \u201cfelonious acts\u201d and 45 in accidents, and 48,315 officers were assaulted while on duty. Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 in accidental deaths died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet. The last four years of Bush\u2019s presidency and the first four of Obama\u2019s saw <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2014/tables/table_29_leos_fk_type_of_weapon_2005-2014.xls\">about the same number of gun-related police deaths</a>, according to this data, with about 46 a year.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI did not say that \u2026 it\u2019s locker room talk.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump did say that he would \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d, and was recorded saying so in 2005 in a video published by the Washington Post on Friday. </p> <p>Pressed by moderator Anderson Cooper, he did admit to having made the comment, though he then said he had never actually acted in the way.

The debate is to last 90 minutes with no commercial interruptions.</p> <p>The first question, the moderators have said, was to be about Trump\u2019s remarks caught by a hot mic that being a star meant he could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women for example \u201cgrab them by the pussy.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign called Trump\u2019s appearance with the Bill Clinton accusers a \u201cstunt\u201d in a statement that concluded, \u201cas always, she\u2019s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s own disparaging comments about one of the women he appeared with, Paula Jones, and other women linked to Bill Clinton have resurfaced this evening, as have reports about hostile working environments for women in Trump companies and on his reality show.</p> <p>Here\u2019s video of Trump\u2019s appearance with Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/regated/status/785264884267290625\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald Trump&#39;s Pre <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Debate?src=hash\">#Debate</a> Press Conference with Rape and Sexual Assault Victims of Bill Clinton. <a href=\"https://t.co/JPrYX88uoD\">https://t.co/JPrYX88uoD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/eFW5xuWAeU\">pic.twitter.com/eFW5xuWAeU</a></p>&mdash; REGATED (@regated) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/regated/status/785264884267290625\">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Thanks again for reading and please join us in the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:52:00.859Z\">at 1.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fae36ae4b03258bcac6119\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:41:47.447Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bill Clinton accusers are Trump's guests in debate hall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/785277458065006593\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump campaign has confirmed all four women, Paula Jones, Broaddrick, Wiley and Kathy Shelton will be guests of Trump in the hall tonight</p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/785277458065006593\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fae284e4b03258bcac6114\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:39:49.240Z\">1.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The \u201cBill Clinton raped\u201d strategy </strong>and its exponents have been competing for oxygen in the Trump campaign for months.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not.</strong></a></p> <p>To be clear, I\u2019ve always found Broaddrick\u2019s claims about Bill Clinton credible, though only the two of them know the truth. Five people say she told them about the assault right after it allegedly happened. She denied the rape in a 1997 affidavit filed with Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers but changed her story the next year, when she was interviewed by the FBI in the course of Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation. At the time, some Clinton defenders treated her changing story as evidence of her untrustworthiness, but it seems perfectly plausible that, as she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public but also felt she couldn\u2019t lie to federal investigators. In the 1990s, Clinton defenders sometimes pointed to the fact that Broaddrick attended a Clinton fundraiser three weeks after she says he raped her. But we know it\u2019s not uncommon for rape victims to blame themselves and continue to seek their rapists\u2019 favor. After all, I also believe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html\">Jill Harth</a>, who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape, even though later, reeling from a divorce, she became his girlfriend.</p> <p>Far less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence. </p> <p><strong>Click through above to read the full piece.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/trumps-lawsuits-include-20-involving-allegations-mistreating-women-president-republican/91832012/\"><strong>Trump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits</strong></a></p> <p>One woman sued Donald Trump\u2019s Miami resort saying she lost her job because she got pregnant.</p> <p>Two others claimed they were fired after complaining that co-workers sexually harassed them.</p> <p>And a number of women testified in a lawsuit that Trump himself repeatedly instructed managers to hire younger, prettier workers at his Los Angeles golf club.</p> <p>The release of a video Friday showing Trump\u2019s sexist remarks in 2005 has created a firestorm of controversy that threatens to derail his campaign.

  "<p>We all have mental health, just as we all have physical health, and in both cases we are on a continuum, where our health can vary day to day. It is estimated that <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/statistics-and-facts-about-mental-health/how-common-are-mental-health-problems/\" title=\"\">one in four people experience a mental health issue in any given year</a>, and that <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/workplace/\" title=\"\">one in six employees</a> is depressed, anxious or suffering from stress-related problems at any time. However, many of us know little about mental health.

Worryingly, the report uncovered the fact that over three-quarters of employees have experienced poor mental health, and almost half of workers would not talk to their manager about a mental health issue. And while employers are talking more about it, words are not translating into action.</p> <p>There is a disconnect between the ideals of company bosses and the reality of employees when it comes to mental health. Most board members believe their organisation is supportive on the issue, but 56% of people who have disclosed a mental health issue at work said their employer took no mitigating actions, found BiTC. How can we close this gap between perception and reality? A vital and practical step employers can take, and a key recommendation of the BiTC report, is investment in first-aid training in mental health for staff.</p> <p>Mental health first-aid is the mental health equivalent of a physical first-aid course. It teaches people the skills and confidence to recognise the signs and symptoms of common mental health issues, listen empathetically and effectively guide a person towards the right support.</p> <p>Recently, I became a mental health first-aider myself, and now have the tools to start a meaningful conversation on the issue, something most of us would struggle to do. Could you think of the right words to say to someone who may be feeling suicidal? Having experienced loss in my family the training allowed me to reflect on what I might have done differently.</p>  <!-- Invalid pullquote element without \"html\" field -->  <p>We spend a considerable amount of our lives at work and with more of us working longer hours, under more pressure, having mental health first-aid support in the workplace is critical not just for employees, but for businesses too. As it stands, mental health issues (stress, depression or anxiety) account for almost <a href=\"http://www.publicmentalhealth.org/Documents/749/Bob%20Grove.pdf\" title=\"\">70m days off sick per year</a>, the most of any health condition.</p> <p>Today, on <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/en/\" title=\"\">World Mental Health Day</a>, with support from Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England and Mind, I am calling on the government to act and bring parity to mental and physical health in the workplace. I\u2019m submitting an <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/edm\" title=\"\">early day motion</a> on the issue as the first step towards amending the current legislation, which requires employers to train staff in physical first aid, to in future include mental health first aid.</p> <p>How can we possibly justify leaving the law as it is? So far as the NHS is concerned the government has committed to the principle of \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between physical and mental illness. Surely they must apply the same logic to the workplace.</p> <p>Put simply, this is a call for every workplace to have trained mental health first-aiders just like they have physical first-aiders. A number of employers are taking action. WHSmith has committed to match the number of staff that are physical first-aiders with mental health first-aiders over the next 12 months.</p> <p>There\u2019s a growing momentum for change, and hundreds more businesses across a range of sectors are implementing mental health training for staff from Unilever and Crossrail to Channel 4. Employers have a duty of care to their workforce, and with the scale of mental issues in this country much more needs to be done. The government must act now to ensure every employee has access to mental health support at work.</p>",

Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition.

Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet.

The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

It would increase tax revenue by $1.1tn over a decade, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">the Tax Policy Center estimated</a>, though much of that money would go into spending plans. The Committee for a Responsible Budget <a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">estimated</a> that Clinton\u2019s plan would add about $200bn to the debt, saying it would raise tax revenue by $191bn but decrease GDP by 1% \u201cover the long term due to slightly higher marginal tax rates on capital and labor\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. Another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018[The US is] just about the highest taxed country in the word\u2019</strong></h2> <p>For months, Trump falsely claimed that the US is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world; he later adjusted to a more specific and more correct claim, about corporate tax rates. The US corporate income tax rate does rank among the highest among industrialised nations, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\">according to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)</a>.

She did say the \u201cgold standard\u201d but she said she didn\u2019t say it\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Clinton has not been consistent on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and her language from 2010 through 2014 suggests she was broadly in support of Barack Obama\u2019s trade deal. </p> <p>As secretary of state in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trade-tpp-20160926-snap-story.html\">she said</a>: \u201cThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.

And with Clinton allowing him to continue to bumble away, she's slowly chipping away at the undecideds who see her as more stable, safe, and presidential.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>Trump should return to the Apprentice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85043606\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15100588\" title=\"View mwwesqcpa\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/15100588\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for mwwesqcpa\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15100588\" title=\"View mwwesqcpa\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">mwwesqcpa</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85043606\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">10 October 2016 5:47am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Donald Trump clearly demonstrated tonight with both words and body language , that he is a rude, crude, fatuous, vacuous,panting, ranting, shallow, bellowing maniac. </p> <p>Having said the above , my view is that he would be a most fascinating host and should return to the Apprentice show instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p> <p>I sincerely believe that God will bless and save America from this delusional, egomaniac, sociopath and from the hateful, racist, deplorable nihilists.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>Trump was disgusting<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85043924\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10712850\" title=\"View nzchef\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/10712850\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for nzchef\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10712850\" title=\"View nzchef\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">nzchef</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85043924\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">10 October 2016 5:57am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Hillary Clinton played this debate perfectly.

The simple truth is they didn\u2019t have a plan B in case they won. The simpler truth is they didn\u2019t even have a plan A. This is not the only similarity between our referendum and the Brexit debacle.</p> <p>Since last Sunday, when Colombians decided \u2013 by a margin of just 60,000 votes \u2013 not to end a war that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/colombia-end-in-sight-longest-running-conflict\">cost hundreds of thousands of lives</a> and displaced millions more, we have heard and read over and over the useless platitude: we all want peace in the end. The words have been insisted upon by those who voted against the deal, surely in an attempt to avoid accusations of warmongering.</p> <p>No one has pointed out that what really bothers those of us who supported the peace deal isn\u2019t the defeat \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that so many people rejected this chance under the influence of lies and superstition. It is self evident that rejecting the agreements, to many, was the same as rejecting the guerrillas, whose criminal record is a long inventory of pain and suffering, and who were late in assuming their guilt with something resembling humility. But the days to come will have to see a national debate about the weight of lies in our final decision.</p> <p>For four years, while negotiations went on in Havana, the leaders of the no vote repeated a series of lies that became more extravagant as support for the agreements appeared to grow. Ex-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/peace-deal-rejection-returns-alvaro-uribe-to-political-limelight\">\u00c1lvaro Uribe</a>, head of the Democratic Center and a shameless populist, maintained that the agreements would turn Colombia into the next Venezuela; he then said that the purpose of the agreements was to abolish private property; he then accused the government of negotiating his own imprisonment with the guerrillas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While negotiations went on in Havana, the leaders of the 'No' vote repeated a series of increasingly extravagant lies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of his most powerful allies is Alejandro Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, whose CV includes burning copies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/25/marquez-one-hundred-years-solitude\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> in his youth. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who used his considerable power as head of the public ministry to condemn homosexuality and try to ban abortion, got the Colombian people to believe that the peace deals were a secret strategy to impose a \u201cgender-oriented ideology\u201d on the country. He then said that the deals would abolish the Catholic family model; he then accused the government of negotiating his dismissal with the guerrillas. Of course, none of this is remotely true. But people voted with these fears in their minds, and openly said so.</p> <p>Now we are left with the moral obligation of rescuing whatever is possible from the wreckage of a great opportunity. No one knows right now what will happen in Colombia.</p> <p>Santos had the statesmanlike reflex to enforce the bilateral ceasefire \u2013 the best piece of news many Colombians have received in half a century \u2013 and then called the leaders of the no vote to \u201cvoice their concerns\u201d. The Farc guerrillas vowed to use only words to defend their ideas, which was their way of announcing their intention to respect the ceasefire too. But in such conditions \u2013 in the rarefied air of distrust and fear \u2013 any provocation can turn into a tragedy. Several negotiations in our past have failed in this way. This is what will have to be avoided at all costs, and the calendar is less lenient this time around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/juan-manuel-santos-wins-nobel-peace-prize-for-work-with-farc\">Juan Manuel Santos wins Nobel peace prize despite rejection of Farc peace deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Nobel prize for peace awarded to president Santos, besides honouring the courageous stubbornness of those who support the peace deals, came as a serious acknowledgement of what is at stake here. It remains to be seen whether it will give the government any leverage.</p> <p>Yes, the leaders of the opposition met President Santos last Wednesday. But it is uncertain whether anything will come out of this meeting. The Democratic Center is a sectarian party: over recent years, its members have spoken about saving the country from \u201catheist communism\u201d; they have also suggested that anyone who didn\u2019t vote for Uribe in the last election was an accomplice of the terrorists.</p> <p>The situation is dire because Uribe has no tangible reason to reach an agreement: it is in his interests to stretch the new talks until they slowly melt into the presidential elections in 2018. A return to power for this man who reformed the constitution in order to allow his own re-election in 2006, could be the most significant outcome of this national crisis. This, of course, justifies every lie, every piece of misinformation, every distortion of the truth.</p> <p>For myself, I never thought we could become the next Venezuela.

  "<p>If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s candidacy has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the debate format is easily gamed, and \u2013 the man\u2019s many shortcomings as a potential commander-in-chief notwithstanding \u2013 he is a master of it.</p> <p>Sunday night\u2019s town-hall-style event at Washington University in St Louis was no exception to this rule. Seasoned moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, who had clearly prepared with an eye toward not letting Trump get away with as much nonsense as usual, repeatedly allowed him to pivot away to areas he was comfortable in. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, sometimes a bit too eager to defend herself or display her foreign policy knowledge, enabled Trump by engaging him wherever he went.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\">'A Red Bull display of madness': reactions to the Trump-Clinton presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked for an opinion on the way forward in Aleppo, Trump, who clearly had nothing to say about the war-torn city, merely repeated the word a couple of times, before redirecting the conversation entirely with a non sequitur, \u201cLet me tell you about Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>A similar diversion happened with questions regarding Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, which Trump always manages to make a centerpiece of debates. Trump\u2019s threat to use the power of the presidency to prosecute his political rival \u2013 \u201cbecause there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception\u201d \u2013 wasn\u2019t strong enough of a statement. He also had to threaten her with incarceration, quipping, when Clinton replied with a comment about how it\u2019s a good thing someone with his temperament is not currently in charge of the law in our country: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail!\u201d</p> <p>When the conversation finally did move on from Clinton\u2019s email scandal, Trump reprimanded the moderator for not following up about the emails, a topic that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-veterans-forum-debate-preview-moderators-elections-2016\">already dominated</a> the commander-in-chief forum in September, an event nominally about foreign policy. As for his repeated insistence that there\u2019s \u201cnever been so many lies\u201d? That isn\u2019t true, according to Politifact, which finds Clinton is an unusually truthful candidate.</p> <p>Not that that\u2019s much of an advantage in our current debate climate.</p> <p>Pithy redirections of substance and reason have resurfaced again and again over the course of the election cycle. It\u2019s become endemic to the way we do debates, as Trump\u2019s rise in the primaries has proved, and it is deleterious to our democracy. We punish the candidates who are honest about what they don\u2019t know (Gary Johnson\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s Aleppo\u201d moment comes to mind here), and reward the best bullshitters.</p> <p>In the internet era, and the rise-of-Trump era, society must be able to do better. While it\u2019s important for a potential president to be able to deftly pivot away from uncomfortable questions and set the course of conversation on their terms, these are also the skills of a master propagandist. They are not the most important skills in a leader, who should be able to identify what they don\u2019t know and, in the right context, occasionally admit it.</p> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t bother. Rather he draws blanks in huge areas of policy but he\u2019s never held to account for it, because in debates, as in politics everywhere this year, authenticity is king, even Trump\u2019s authentic disregard for the truth.</p> <p>So it\u2019s hard to say what anyone learned from the second debate, not because it was conspicuously less substantive than previous ones, but because it was presidential debates as usual.</p> <p>The truth, and knowledge specifically, is simply not that valuable in a debate format as it exists; voters are simply unable to evaluate it in the framework provided.</p> <p>Experts and the media learned nothing, but that\u2019s less of an indictment of the system \u2013 they\u2019ve heard it all before. But low-information voters could have learned worse than nothing. As in previous debates and pre-debates, they might have come away from thinking Trump was against the war in Iraq (he wasn\u2019t), that Clinton should have done more to reform healthcare (she never had the relevant job description), and that Clinton was somehow the reason Trump was able to dodge paying federal taxes (everyone who can do it does do it). </p> <p>Why should our democracy\u2019s debate system put an emphasis on spontaneity and authenticity at the expense of truth and knowledge? There has to be something better than this at this late date, whether it\u2019s a real-time fact check displayed on screen, a sidebar of data-informed commentary, prepared videos that are vetted for accuracy and submitted in advance.</p> <p>I doubt that authenticity-loving Americans will go for it, but perhaps the public should reconsider. It\u2019s a format that could benefit Trump as much as it would benefit Clinton \u2013 he would have the advantage of not having a meltdown on stage, as he\u2019s constantly in danger of having. Meanwhile Clinton and the rest of us would hear a whole lot fewer lies.</p> <p>We already know enough about Trump\u2019s temperament from the way he uses his Twitter account, and it would certainly be an improvement on the current situation, which seems to be an exercise chiefly in spreading voter misinformation.</p> <p>But don\u2019t expect Trump to lead the charge to reform presidential debates. As his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway put it shortly after the town-hall style debate drew to a close, it\u2019s \u201ca great format for him\u201d.</p> <p>The entire 2016 presidential election thus far is the proof that she\u2019s right.</p>",

  "<p>It was a Sunday, so there was little to do but mark time and sniff glue. The shops were shut, the market half empty. With few people out and about, begging was unlikely to be a profitable enterprise.</p> <p>Instead, many of Eldoret\u2019s street children had retreated to its central rubbish dump. Foetid and pestilential, this wasteland has long been a haven for the waifs of Kenya\u2019s fifth city, the country\u2019s highland capital and long-distance running heartland.</p> <p>\u201cCalifornia Barracks\u201d, as it is known to the 700 homeless children and young adults who sleep there, usually provides something to eat: unwanted food dumped by local hotels or overripe fruit discarded by traders from the nearby market. It also offers a refuge, from society and from Eldoret\u2019s police, who can rarely stomach the stench.</p> <p>But not on that day, the penultimate Sunday of May. It was getting on for 4pm, the shadows lengthening on a chilly afternoon. Some of the children were asleep. Others sought solace in the cheap, hunger-suppressing fix of solvent abuse: boys inhaled glue from plastic containers clutched to their nostrils, girls in their early teens shared theirs with infants strapped to their backs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/kenya-dadaab-refugee-camp-what-happens-when-it-closes-asad-hussein\">I grew up in the world's biggest refugee camp \u2013 what happens when it closes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the warren of alleys above, the police advanced silently from three directions. Municipal officers, known as county askaris, carried cudgels and led the way; men from the Administrative Police, a feared state paramilitary unit, followed with rifles and teargas.</p> <p>The inhabitants of California Barracks have grown accustomed to police brutality. Many there that Sunday had experienced it, like Samuel Asacha. A decade ago, when he was 15, he had one of his eyes gouged out by a particularly notorious officer. Or Shereen, then 10, and Shelagh, 14, both badly disfigured in 2014 when the same man, they say, threw acid in their face.</p> <p>But the raid on California Barracks seemed different. This was not casual, workaday bullying but a carefully planned operation, systematic, meticulous \u2013 and one which city authorities have until now largely managed to cover up.</p> <p>\u201cThey gave no warning,\u201d said Eric Omondi, who at 20 is, like Samuel, one of the older members or \u201cprefects\u201d of California Barracks. \u201cIt was an ambush. Suddenly there were kids screaming, teargas being fired and officers shooting into the air.\u201d<br></p> <p>Advancing in a line, beating as they went, the police forced their victims towards the Sosiani river, which hugs the southern perimeter of the dump. Babies, girls, boys, disabled and able alike, were trampled down in merciless fashion.</p> <p>None caught were spared, not even a 17-year-old called Mary, whom Omondi saw being beaten with such force that her baby fell headfirst from her arms onto the stony ground.</p> <p>In a wheelchair after being run over by a county bulldozer clearing homeless shelters last year, Ronny, 16, had no chance of escape.</p> <p>As blows rained down on his head and shoulders, he begged his tormenters to stop: \u201cI told them \u2018If you don\u2019t stop, you are going to kill me.\u2019 They replied: \u2018We don\u2019t care if we kill you. If killing you is what will scare others away, we will do it.\u201d</p> <p>By now some had managed to slip through the police lines, but others had been pushed to the riverbank. To escape the blows, they had no choice but to plunge into the Sosiani, then in full spate after heavy rains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"706ec1c506636e8ef19c49074bba3137a40111a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/706ec1c506636e8ef19c49074bba3137a40111a6/0_619_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sosiani river.

The following October, the county authorities forcibly rounded up more than 100 street children, forced them into a lorry and dumped them 80 miles away in Malaba, a town on the Ugandan border. Most walked back to Eldoret.</p> <p>The killings began after that, activists say. Ex-Street has documented the deaths of 14 minors so far this year, including three boys shot dead as they ran from police and three more whose bodies were found days after they had been arrested. At least five more are missing after being taken into custody and another two \u2013 9-year-old Kevin Simuyu and David Kamau, eight, have not been seen since they were shot and wounded by police a fortnight after the raid on California Barracks.<br></p> <p>Some believe that the attacks on street children are ethnically motivated. Most are not members of the county\u2019s dominant Kalenjin community, the ethnic group of Kenya\u2019s powerful deputy president, William Ruto.</p> <p>The region around Eldoret has witnessed some of Kenya\u2019s worst ethnic violence, often because of politically-manipulated tensions over land ownership. In 1991, Kalenjin warriors impaled foetuses ripped from dying Kikuyu women on spears which were then placed on the side of the road leading into Eldoret, as anger over Kikuyu encroachment into the ancestral lands exploded.</p> <p>The violence reached a peak after a controversial election in 2007 saw Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, re-elected president. At least 1,200 people were killed in the ensuing violence across Kenya, but the clashes were at their deadliest in and around Eldoret, where scores of Kikuyu women and children sheltering in a church were burned to death by Kalenjin fighters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f/0_202_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in Eldoret, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in Eldoret, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the Kalenjin and Kikuyu are now reconciled and share power (President Uhuru Kenyatta is a Kikuyu), some local politicians and clergymen say the attacks on street children appear to be part of a campaign of intimidation designed to force non-Kalenjins to leave Eldoret.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the killing of street families, this will escalate,\u201d said Peter Chomba, a ruling party county legislator, who is Kikuyu. \u201cIf you look at what is happening, it is a pre-planned campaign. They profile professions drawn from certain communities and then attack them. What is happening is an attempt to claim this place for one community.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the motive, few Kenyans would be particularly shocked to hear that the police were killing minors in Eldoret. Human rights groups have raised repeated concerns that extrajudicial killings have become part of police culture in Kenya. Reports of the execution of suspected Islamists, petty criminals and even human rights activists are becoming increasingly common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">Kenya\u2019s seaside looks peaceful, but a murderous war is being waged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week Kenya\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper published a database documenting 122 police killings in the country so far this year.

  "<p>For seven decades BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour has charted a social and political revolution in women\u2019s lives \u2013 covering everything from backstreet abortions and the introduction of the pill to the fight for the Equal Pay Act. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/08/70-years-of-womans-hour-radio-4-jenni-murray-jane-garvey-interview\">70 years of Woman's Hour: \u2018Our listeners like frank conversations about sex\u2018</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not all aspects of women\u2019s lives have changed \u2013 a poll to mark the show\u2019s 70th anniversary, published on Monday, has found that while the majority of female listeners are happier at work and in marriage than they were 40 years ago, many still worry about their appearance, as well as having concerns about health and money. </p> <p>A special 70th anniversary programme of Woman\u2019s Hour on Monday hosted by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/about/jenni_murray.shtml\">Jenni Murray</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1rtmf0y9DWkzm3Pwb0cHP2g/jane-garvey\">Jane Garvey</a>, will look at how the profile of its listeners has changed over the decades, with 60% of female respondents in employment today, compared with 31% in 1951. </p> <p>Garvey, who has presented the show alongside Murray for nine years, told the Guardian that a glance at the script from the first ever show \u2013 which featured a section on how to \u201cput your best face forward\u201d \u2013 revealed the vast shift in women\u2019s lives in the past 70 years. \u201cIt ends \u2018a light dusting of powder can do wonders for your look and the family morale\u2019, which I think shows that we have come a very long way,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking at the issues we talk about today you realise how much things have changed in the last 70 years, and the huge shift in our expectations compared with our grandmothers.\u201d<br></p> <p>But when Garvey joined the programme in 2007 she voiced some scepticism about its tone, saying: \u201cOne of my bugbears about it would be \u2013 and they know this \u2013 that there is too much about the negative side of being female and not enough about the many good factors. </p> <p>\u201cI would also like to have [fewer] middle-class ladies talking about cookery. Although there is nothing wrong with cookery, I think there is a massively middle-class bent to every programme on Radio 4.\u201d</p> <p>With 3.7 million listeners weekly, Woman\u2019s Hour is now the second most popular daily podcast across BBC Radio \u2013 after The Archers \u2013 and a quarter of its listeners are under 35, while 40% are male.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere simply isn\u2019t anything else like it,\u201d said Garvey. \u201cThe running order is such an incredible cocktail of things that everybody will find something they are interested in, something they want to know more about, or something they want to tell their mother, daughter or friend \u2013 that\u2019s why it works.\u201d<br></p> <p>It survives, according to Murray, who has presented the programme for 29 years, \u201cbecause it\u2019s endlessly interesting, completely trustworthy and always up to date on the often neglected interests and concerns of 52% of the population\u201d.</p> <p>Gwyneth Williams, controller of Radio 4, also lavished praise on the programme saying: \u201cIt is hard to imagine Radio 4 without Woman\u2019s Hour. For 70 years the programme has been celebrating women and focusing on the issues that most affect their lives. It is part of our radical tradition and I am proud of the fresh voices, originality and alternative perspective that Woman\u2019s Hour offers our listeners every day.\u201d The show remains, according to guest presenter Emma Barnett, \u201cthe Rolls Royce of Radio 4 \u2026 It\u2019s a programme that brings out the best in people as they know they have the space to share deep feelings with an incredibly engaged audience hanging on their every word,\u201d she said. \u201cIts listeners, male and female, trust it implicitly and the female gaze [through which] it reflects the world is invaluable and unique.\u201d</p> <p>The anniversary <a href=\"http://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FTWET0710JN16WH.pdf\">poll</a> also found that women are also more positive about marriage in 2016 than 65 years ago, with 42% saying that men and women gave up equal amounts of freedom when married, compared to 25% of all respondents \u2013 female and male \u2013 who felt this way in 1951, according to a Gallup survey at the time.<br></p> <p>Delving into the history of the show sheds light on the frustration many listeners felt when it launched on 7 October 1946. While the modern programme has explored taboo issues from the onset of menopause to female masturbation, the first Woman\u2019s Hour was, in fact, presented by a man. </p> <p>Aired at 2pm to coincide with the moment that busy housewives could briefly put their feet up before the children came home from school, BBC bosses hired Alan Ivimey, an ex-RAF-officer-turned-journalist who \u201cspecialised in writing for and talking to women\u201d to present the radio show. A woman, they decided, risked being \u201cresented\u201d by her listeners.</p> <p>The subjects covered included \u201cmother\u2019s midday meal\u201d and \u201chow to hang your husband\u2019s suit\u201d \u2013 much to the first listeners\u2019 ire, according to Amanda Vickery, professor of early modern history at Queen Mary, University of London. \u201cCitizen housewives were not be hectored by professional men or bossy matrons,\u201d Vickery wrote <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-10-07/womans-hour-was-launched-70-years-ago--but-the-bbc-almost-got-it-totally-wrong\">in the Radio Times</a>.</p> <p>A doctor\u2019s talk on \u201chow to be a happy woman\u201d, encouraging listeners to let go of \u201cfrustration\u201d, lead one housewife to retort: \u201cI should like him to do a hard day\u2019s housework \u2013 bending over a sink washing, then shopping and queuing \u2013 then see if his backache is only frustration and not due to hard work.\u201d<br></p> <p>While listener Bridget Long, writing to The Daily Worker in 1946, complained: \u201cThe programme is much too patronising. What women want is a programme to compensate us for being tied to our domestic chores, to help us keep in touch with the world outside, whether it\u2019s books, films, politics or other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Woman\u2019s Hour\u2019s popularity seems likely to endure into its eighth decade thanks to its \u201cfrank and honest\u201d debate and \u201cunique insight into women\u2019s lives\u201d, according to its editor, Alice Feinstein. But its most recent poll also suggests the need for a programme that challenges deeply rooted sexism. </p> <p>In the 25-34 age bracket, only 27% of respondents considered themselves happier than their mothers were at their age, compared to 43% of those aged 65 and over. And 70 years after those first make-up tips were broadcast on the first Woman\u2019s Hour, 46% of younger listeners polled by the programme this year said they would consider having cosmetic surgery.</p> <h2>Woman\u2019s Hour timeline</h2> <p><strong>14 April 1948</strong> The US first lady of the day, Eleanor Roosevelt, talks about women\u2019s rights and being the driving force behind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \u201cWomen should make their voices heard,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>7 Oct 1956</strong> Viscountess Nancy Astor, an American-born socialite and ardent supporter of social reforms for women and children, was the first woman to enter the Commons when she became MP for Plymouth in 1919. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01lfw2p\">She talks to Mary Stocks about her early days in parliament</a> on the 80th anniversary of her maiden speech: \u201cI wanted the world to get better and I knew it couldn\u2019t get better if it was going to be ruled by men.\u201d</p> <p><strong>19 September 1960</strong> A ground-breaking programme about contraception, before the pill is introduced the following year.</p> <p><strong>13 January 1963</strong> Enid Blyton, the celebrated author of children\u2019s classics The Famous Five, Noddy and Malory Towers, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01lg00v\">reveals that her motivation is to inspire children</a> to live moral and happy lives.</p> <p><strong>31 March 1971</strong> Fashion designer <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01ngk5j\">Mary Quant talks about her creations</a>.

  "<p>The second presidential debate is in the can.

But he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been \u201cso abusive to women\u201d.</li> <li><strong>Clinton did not respond to Trump\u2019s catalog </strong>of her husband\u2019s alleged assaults, apart to say it was inaccurate. \u201cWhen they go low, you go high,\u201d she said.</li> <li><strong>Clinton placed Trump\u2019s hot mic remarks in context</strong> with others \u2013 she listed his attack on the family of Humayan Khan, a US soldier killed in the Iraq war, his \u201cbirther\u201d attack on Barack Obama, his attack on a disabled reporter and his attack on an American federal judge of Mexican descent \u2013 to paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump \u201cowes the country an apology\u201d.</li> <li><strong>Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton</strong>. He repeatedly called her a liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career. Physically, he loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members. He also told her if he were president, \u201cyou\u2019d be in jail\u201d. He pointed at her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62\">said</a>, \u201cshe has tremendous hate in her heart\u201d.</li> <li><strong>\u201cI know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight,\u201d</strong> Clinton told Trump. \u201cAnything to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are leaving it.\u201d At least 36 elected Republicans had either rescinded endorsements of Trump or explicitly stated rejections of him in the wake of the 2005 video. </li> <li><strong>More than one snap analyst \u2013 for what that\u2019s worth </strong>\u2013 thought Trump had \u201cshored up his base\u201d of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, and other issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal.</li> <li><strong>Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence </strong>the election, and not on her behalf, citing US intelligence officials who accused the Kremlin of attacks on Friday.</li> <li><strong>Trump said he disagreed with running mate</strong> Mike Pence\u2019s assertion that the US should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after the debate.<br></li> <li><strong>Trump also said there\u2019s no Muslim ban plan any more, despite his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">call for one</a> in December 2015</strong>. \u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.\u201d</li> <li><strong>A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. </strong>He said that Capt Humayun Khan would still be alive if he, Trump, were president at the time \u2013 when George W Bush, a Republican, was commander-in-chief.</li> <li><strong>Trump admitted unapologetically</strong> that he had applied almost $1bn in personal losses to not pay federal income tax. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Trump staged a media event before the debate </strong>with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape and one woman, raped as a child, whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended, as ordered by a judge, as a 27-year-old lawyer.</li> <li><strong>Clinton was asked about a line from a WikiLeaks version</strong> of a purported paid speech in which she describe a president\u2019s need to have separate public and private faces. She said she was talking about Abraham Lincoln.</li> <li><strong>The candidates did not shake hands</strong> when they arrived at the town hall. Trump had the sniffles. And he complained a lot about the moderators letting Clinton talk more than him. A time clock count afterwards showed the time was split almost evenly.</li> </ul>",
  "<p><br></p> <p>Less than two hours before appearing on stage for the second presidential debate, Donald Trump staged a surprise event with women who have accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Just days after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-the-clear-winner-in-town-hall-debate-featuring-only-himself\">told a crowd</a> in New Hampshire he would rather make the second debate about \u201cpolicy\u201d rather than \u201cin the gutter\u201d he held a three-minute press conference with four women.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics\">Trump holds debate press conference with Bill Clinton accusers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of them bluntly stated: \u201cBill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement issued in response, Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said: \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in a conference room to a handful of reporters in an event aired on Facebook Live, Trump appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathy Shelton and Kathleen Willey. </p> <p>Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton. Shelton was the victim in a 1975 rape case in which Hillary Clinton, in her capacity as a lawyer, was assigned by an Arkansas court to represent her alleged assailant. All four were subsequently Trump\u2019s guests in the debate hall.</p> <p>Both Jones and Willey have alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Jones claimed in a civil law suit in 1994 that the then Arkansas governor propositioned her and exposed himself to her in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusations. Jones\u2019s case was settled without admission of guilt, with Clinton paying her $850,000. </p> <p>Willey, a former White House aide, accused Clinton in 1998 on 60 Minutes that the president had sexually harassed her during a meeting in the Oval Office in 1993. The Office Of Independent Counsel <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-ICREPORT-LEWINSKY/pdf/GPO-ICREPORT-LEWINSKY-12.pdf\">reviewed</a> Willey\u2019s claims and found them inconclusive, saying Clinton and Willey were the only witnesses to the allegation and that Willey gave false evidence to the FBI. Through lawyers, Clinton denied the accusation.</p> <p>The women took turns in speaking, after Trump had praised their courage. Broaddrick, who has alleged that the former president raped her in 1978, when he was Arkansas attorney general, spoke in the most stark terms.</p> <p>Trump has mentioned her on social media several times in the run-up to the debate, tweeting several times. He even retweeted her tweets, a step rarely taken by the candidate who normally manually quotes tweets.</p> <p>Broaddrick alleges that Clinton raped her in a hotel room while violently biting her upper lip. Clinton has flatly denied the claims, which emerged publicly in 1999 during the investigation of the former president by the independent counsel Ken Starr. The year earlier, Broaddrick had filed a sworn affidavit saying that the allegations against Clinton were untrue. Starr ruled that Broaddrick\u2019s testimony about the incident was \u201cinconclusive\u201d and did not use it. Friends of Broaddrick <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/09/497291071/a-brief-history-of-juanita-broaddrick-the-woman-accusing-bill-clinton-of-rape\">say she told them</a> about the alleged incident at the time. </p> <p>At the press conference, Shelton said: \u201cHillary put me through something you should never put a 12-year-old through.\u201d<br></p> <p>The former secretary of state served as the lawyer for an alleged rapist, Thomas Alfred Taylor in 1975. She was<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/20/exclusive-hillary-clinton-took-me-through-hell-rape-victim-says.html\"> appointed by the court</a> to represent the man, one of two accused of raping Shelton, who was then 12. Taylor eventually took a plea bargain for a lesser charge. </p> <p>In her statement, Palmieri continued: \u201cHillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn\u2019t change that. </p> <p>\u201cIf Donald Trump doesn\u2019t see that, that\u2019s his loss. As always, she\u2019s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.\u201d</p> <p>Ivanka Trump, who has been one of her father\u2019s top surrogates in his attempts to appeal to women, did not immediately comment. When reached on Saturday with a request for comment about the mounting controversy surrounding her father\u2019s campaign, she hung up on the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-groping-remarks-sexual-assault-tim-kaine-debate\">Donald Trump groping remarks reveal 'pattern of sexual assault', says Kaine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s press event came just 48 hours after a tape was released of the candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">making obscene boasts</a> about using his fame to kiss and grope women without their consent. </p> <p>The tape, captured on a live microphone with then Access Hollywood host Billy Bush in 2005, includes the statement: \u201cI am automatically attracted to beautiful women. I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don\u2019t even wait \u2026 and when you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d </p> <p>Trump, then 59 years old and newly married to his third wife, Melania, adds: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Republican nominee issued a videotaped apology after midnight on Friday, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\"> mounting controversy has led</a> a growing number of Republicans to announce that they<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-tape-quit-republicans-lewd-comments\"> will not vote</a> for Trump in November. </p> <p>These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">party\u2019s 2008 nominee, John McCain</a>, and a number of other senators in a tight re-election battles including Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.</p> <p>Trump did not address questions from reporters about whether he had groped women without their consent, instead sitting silently while Paula Jones angrily proclaimed: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t you all ask Bill Clinton that?\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 11 October 2016 to remove a statement that Donald Trump had signaled that he was willing to campaign in the gutter.<br></li> </ul>"
