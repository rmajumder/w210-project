It\u2019s about Trump\u2019s entire world view. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, strong men,\u201d Obama said, \u201cmen who are truly role models, don\u2019t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful\u201d.</p> <p>Women know this. Americans know this. Why then did it take Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault on video for the country to take the claims seriously?</p> <p>This is an issue that\u2019s come up before this year, and not just on the presidential campaign trail. We didn\u2019t need one woman to come forward against Bill Cosby in order to get society\u2019s attention \u2013 we didn\u2019t even need 10 of them to. We needed male comedian Hannibal Buress to make a joke about it. For a lone woman to be heard she seems to require special status. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-tv-producer\">Numerous women</a> have now come out to accuse Roger Ailes, former Fox boss \u2013 and current Trump surrogate \u2013 of sexual harassment. But they were only empowered to do so after one of the country\u2019s most famous female anchors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/06/fox-news-gretchen-carlson-roger-ailes-sexual-harassment\">filed a lawsuit</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s to be expected then, that what it actually took for the country to take Harth and other women\u2019s stories of sexual assault seriously was not their own complaints, or a female reporter airing them: it was Trump himself bragging about sexual assault on video. Similarly, Trump himself talking to Howard Stern about walking into the dressing rooms of pageant contestants was what it took for us to start listening to women\u2019s reports of that kind of behavior.</p> <p>As Obama put it in her speech today, this isn\u2019t about politics, \u201cit\u2019s about basic human decency\u201d. And we should be appalled to look back and see there are obvious patterns in the stories alleging sexual assault by Trump. We have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">two</a> <a href=\"http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/\">accounts</a> of sexual assault perpetrated in the midst of a supposed tour of Mar-a-Lago; two accounts of women alleging he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">kissed</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmichael-barbaro&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0\">them</a> on the lips without permission as a form of introducing himself; and we have multiple accounts of him barging into the dressing rooms of naked beauty pageant contestants \u2013 one of the women reporting these incidents <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing?utm_term=.blNmOK1y7#.vjR6PVBxW\">was apparently</a> 15 years old at the time.</p> <p>With the Access Hollywood and Howard Stern tapes, we now have audio of Trump saying that he does all of these things. And we should be ashamed that what it took for allegations of abuse to be believed was two men joking about their sexual misdeeds, and for that to be broadcast far and wide. We\u2019ve learned that women\u2019s accounts are not enough. </p> <p>As Shaun R Harper argued in the Washington Post recently, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/08/many-men-talk-like-donald-trump-in-private-and-only-other-men-can-stop-them/?utm_term=.3217f3ca57fe\">many men talk like Trump does in private</a>, and only men can fix that. There\u2019s a lot of truth in his argument \u2013 men have a vital role to play in stopping the perpetuation of rape culture. But there is also something disturbing in that message. We should not have to hear from men to recognize it\u2019s a problem. We should be able to hear women when they first speak. And those women should not have to be Michelle Obama, married to the most powerful man in the world.</p> <p>There\u2019s a reason \u201cThat\u2019s what she said\u201d is the punchline to sex jokes told by men about women. As a society \u2013 one driven by men\u2019s expectations \u2013 we rarely value what \u201cshe said\u201d at all. </p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year I was invited to be part of <a href=\"http://graphic.sydneyoperahouse.com\">Graphic</a>, an event at the Sydney Opera House that describes itself as \u201ca festival of visual storytelling\u201d.

I would like to, but as you pointed out it is very time consuming.</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I actually get a good night\u2019s sleep these days \u2026 We\u2019re pretty confident that we can deliver the jokes</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Very</em> time consuming, and the best thing to do is get other people to do the hard work. It needs sustained attention; it\u2019s amazing how wrong things can go in animation. Whenever I see a piece of animation, a TV show or movie that doesn\u2019t work, I feel so bad, because I know how many tears and how many drops of blood went into that, into those projects. And you can\u2019t always get the tone right \u2013 that\u2019s the hardest part. It\u2019s a painful process.</p> <p>When you get to work with a group of people who are incredible collaborators, then it\u2019s a little more relaxing. Back at the beginning of The Simpsons, I used to go home after working until the middle of the night and still not be able to sleep, because I was so worried about the problems that we were going to be facing the next day. I actually get a good night\u2019s sleep these days, so that\u2019s pretty good. And we\u2019re pretty confident that we can deliver the jokes.</p> <p>By the way, I\u2019m really looking forward to coming to Australia because \u2013 just based on fan mail and occasional encounters with Australians \u2013 it seems like the country where The Simpsons has the most fanatical fans. They just really really dig it, and it makes me really happy because they\u2019re watching the show in its original language. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b05478d9bcffbc2747fbbe97e1a4b36a6b156a87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05478d9bcffbc2747fbbe97e1a4b36a6b156a87/0_0_1634_1140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian fans of The Simpsons, by First Dog on the Moon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian fans of The Simpsons, by First Dog on the Moon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: First Dog on the Moon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I hear fans from Brazil or Argentina or wherever, I\u2019m always wondering: are they laughing at our jokes, or are they laughing at the Portuguese- or Spanish-speaking actors who are dubbing it into another language?

And then we did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTsEueaIWG8\">an episode for the World Cup in Brazil</a>, and we correctly predicted bribery and payoffs and corruption \u2013 and we were just making that up too.</p> <p><strong>And Donald Trump?

When historians are writing about this election, after all of the other presidents, it\u2019s the worst. Just quoting from it would be like a clown show. It\u2019s just the most amazing thing. And I\u2019m hopeful that this is just an aberration but I don\u2019t think it will be. There\u2019s a certain lack of civility and common sense, a complete exaggeration of name calling and triviality [that] is just astounding. And it may be here to stay.

I won\u2019t [leave the US] because I actually think it will be amazing in all its horror. <br></p> <p><strong>You\u2019re coming to Graphic and doing a session on The Simpsons, and <a href=\"http://graphic.sydneyoperahouse.com/home/matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/\">also one with your friend, the cartoonist and writer Lynda Barry</a>. What can we expect from that conversation?</strong></p> <p>She and I went to college together and we do a tandem talk about growing up and how our childhoods were similar and different \u2013 and at one point she and I read some of my strips [from Life in Hell] together \u2026 </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As years went by, and I had more things to do, I simplified my style</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was doing strips in which the characters stayed in exactly the same positions from frame to frame, and the only thing that changed were their expressions and the dialogue. It plays like a very primitive form of animation when you see it on the big screen. And it is quite gratifying for me, to read these comic strips and get a laugh, you know.<br></p> <p>I always thought \u2013 and I see this in your stuff too \u2013 that you\u2019re holding the reader\u2019s eye on the page so that the dialogue [works]. You can\u2019t just go to the last frame and get the punchline; you need to be led through the strip. That\u2019s one reason why Life in Hell was so dense at the beginning: I was in weekly newspapers and I felt I only got a crack at getting people to look at my stuff once a week, so I was going to make it so they really had to work at it in order to get the joke. And as years went by, and I had more things to do, I simplified my style.</p> <p>And also, man, after doing things a certain way it\u2019s fun to mix it up a little.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s Python\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/03/life1.lifemagazine2\">the tyranny of the punchline</a>\u201d, isn\u2019t it? I often struggle if I have to come up with a punchline, whereas if I put 20 sort of vaguely funny jokes into one cartoon and you add them all together, it\u2019s actually possibly funnier. Well, that\u2019s one way of working anyway. </strong></p> <p>I agree completely: you make getting there the fun part; you just don\u2019t want to let the air out of the tyre for the last frame, that\u2019s all. </p> <p>A lot of animated cartoons \u2013 the great Warner Brother cartoons, Bugs Bunny and all those \u2013 they\u2019re brilliant. Generally the last gag of the cartoon is a complete misfire, but you still go, \u201cThat was brilliant.\u201d You know, getting there was great. </p> <p>Although I have to say, for the most part when writing a comic strip I do know where I\u2019m going before I start drawing. Occasionally I change my mind along the way; as I\u2019m pencilling the strip, I sometimes come up with a better joke at the end. </p> <p>I love pacing and timing and it\u2019s fun \u2013 comics are definitely their own medium. It\u2019s not animation, it\u2019s not a single panel; you\u2019re capturing time. And partly that time is the time it takes to read the dialogue balloons.<br></p> <p>Getting back to your stuff \u2013 that\u2019s why I like your stuff so much: I like the journey, I like the story.</p> <p><strong><em>(Grinning like an idiot)</em> Do you have any pets? </strong></p> <p>Pets?

  "<p>Donald Trump scrambled to dig himself out from an avalanche of fresh abuse allegations on Thursday after a series of women came forward to dispute his claim that his comments about sexual assault were only empty boasts.</p> <p>The torrent of accusations, which includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal\">claims from beauty pageant contenders</a> who allege he burst into their dressing rooms to ogle them while they were nude, added nearly a dozen new names to the tally of women who have accused the Republican nominee of inappropriate behavior. </p> <p>Many say they were galvanised into speaking by Trump\u2019s denials during Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, where he dismissed a recording of him bragging about groping women as \u201clocker room talk\u201d and insisted they were \u201cwords not action\u201d.</p> <p>But with allegations to the contrary casting an ever-growing shadow over the campaign, Trump instead sought to dismiss the accusations as a vast establishment conspiracy, orchestrated by his opponent Hillary Clinton \u201cas part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing the political establishment will not do, no lie they won\u2019t tell to hold their prestige and power at your expense and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told a rally in Florida. \u201cThe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.\u201d</p> <p>After a series of initial denials in capital letters on Twitter and more than an hour after his speech was due to start, Trump launched into an hour-long attack on the media and female accusers he called \u201chorrible, horrible liars\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTake a look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter <a href=\"http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/\">who alleged he had \u201cforced his tongue down my throat\u201d</a>. </p> <p>The New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">which quoted another woman alleging Trump \u201cwas like an octopus\u201d</a> who put his hand up her skirt on an aeroplane, was dismissed as peddling \u201cthird-rate journalism\u201d on the instructions of the Clinton campaign. Trump threatened to sue the paper over the article. </p> <p>And while the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal\">has interviewed a former beauty contestant who claimed he deliberately walked in on two young Miss USA 2001 contestants while they were naked</a>, Trump portrayed himself as a martyr.</p> <p>\u201cI never knew it would be this vile, this vicious,\u201d he told the crowd in Florida. \u201cNevertheless I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you. I take them for the movement so we can have our country back.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the American people. The only thing Clinton has going for her is the press. Without the press she is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, his response to the new claims took up almost the entire speech and Trump refused to take questions on them, dismissing from the room a reporter who asked about them beforehand and calling him \u201ca sleazebag\u201d.</p> <p>The New York Times dismissed his threat to sue in withering terms.</p> <p>\u201cThe essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one\u2019s reputation,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytco.com/the-new-york-timess-response-to-donald-trumps-retraction-letter/  \">its lawyer wrote to Trump\u2019s</a>. \u201cNothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr Trump through his own words and actions has already created for himself.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign insisted it had evidence for bringing its legal action against the New York Times, however.</p> <p>\u201cYour article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se. It is apparent from, among other things, the timing of the article, that it is nothing more than a politically motivated effort to defeat Mr Trump\u2019s candidacy,\u201d wrote Marc Kasowitz, Trump\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>Under the US constitution, any suit filed by Trump would be almost certain to be thrown out. American libel law as defined in the 1964 case of New York Times v Sullivan states that any public figure suing for libel must prove a defamatory statement was made with actual malice, \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech in Florida came as even close allies began distancing themselves.<br></p> <p>Newt Gringrich, a leading supporter and surrogate who was considered a potential running mate, described the Republican nominee as sometimes \u201cfrankly pathetic\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a big Trump and a little Trump,\u201d the former House speaker told Fox Business. \u201cThe little Trump is frankly pathetic.\u201d</p> <p>Amid reports that his campaign was pulling out of Virginia because it was no longer competitive there, Trump cancelled a Fox News interview planned for Thursday night that was expected to deal with charges against Bill Clinton, while his daughter Ivanka was forced to sit awkwardly during a campaign coffee event as moderators tried to avoid the subject.</p> <p>Democrats also revelled in the campaign\u2019s apparent meltdown. \u201cThis is not normal, this is not politics as usual,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-donald-trump-misconduct-frightening\">Michelle Obama told a rally in New Hampshire</a>. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,\u201d she said. \u201cNo woman deserves to be treated this way \u2013 none of us deserves this kind of abuse.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-speech-donald-trump-sexual-assault-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57bnm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2803648\"            data-video-name=\"Michelle Obama's powerful rebuke to Trump's 'predatory behavior' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ffcde9e4b01601238957c0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/13/161013michelle_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/13/161013michelle.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/13/161013michelle_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-speech-donald-trump-sexual-assault-video\">Michelle Obama\u2019s powerful rebuke to Trump\u2019s \u2018predatory behavior\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI was shocked but not surprised,\u201d Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, told ABC. \u201cI was surprised on stage on Sunday night when he said \u2018I never did it\u2019 and wondered how many days it would be before folks came out and said he did.\u201d</p> <p>Allegations of sexual misconduct and crude treatment of women had attached themselves to Trump since launching his campaign in June. When the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly questioned him about these in the first presidential debate in August, the New York real estate developer implied her tough questioning was the result of menstruation. Trump also later attacked Republican primary opponent Carly Fiorina for being unattractive, an accusation that was also levelled at the wife of Senator Ted Cruz via a retweet on Trump\u2019s Twitter account.</p> <p>In the spring of 2016, the Boston Globe reported on Trump\u2019s behaviour towards beauty pageant contestants and the New York Times published a detailed history of Trump\u2019s relationships with women over decades. The reporting prompted Ivanka Trump to deny the allegations in an interview with CBS. \u201cHe\u2019s not a groper,\u201d said Ivanka about her father. \u201cIt\u2019s not who he is. I\u2019ve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">pledged to \u201copen up\u201d</a> American libel laws, has a long history of litigiousness and is known for issuing legal threats after unfavourable stories. In September, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-irresponsible-intent\">used Twitter </a>to threaten a suit against the New York Times for what he called \u201cirresponsible intent\u201d and his wife Melania is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\">currently engaged i</a>n an active lawsuit against the Daily Mail. Trump also <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431575/donald-trump-tim-obrien-courtroom-story\">engaged in years of litigation </a>with biographer Tim O\u2019Brien in 2005, who stated Trump was nowhere near as wealthy as he claimed. The suit was eventually dismissed.</p> <p>Speaking to campaign volunteers at a field office in San Francisco, Clinton said the election was defined by \u201ctwo very different visions, views, and sets of values\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why the stakes are so high,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause we know we\u2019ve already learned who Donald Trump is.

I don\u2019t agree it will dilute the quality,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cI&#xa0;would like to remind you that in the last World Cup, England and Italy were eliminated by Costa Rica. The level of football is increasing all over the world.</p> <p>\u201cIn a 48 team format, the quality would be higher because the 32 teams would have a play off. The quality would improve and not decrease in any way.\u201d</p> <p>He said the idea would increase excitement and boost football participation and finances in those countries that qualified, rejecting criticism of the fact that 16 teams would have to fly home after just one match. \u201cIt is certainly an exciting moment for that country and the players and the fans. You don\u2019t just travel to play a friendly but a match that is extremely important.</p> <p>\u201cLook at England \u2013 one of the matches that is most followed is the play-off to get into the Premier League.\u201d</p> <p>Among a raft of promises, Fifa said it would increase the amount awarded to each member association to $1.25m over four years from the current $400,000, while introducing more oversight of World Cup ticketing and local World Cup organising committees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/gordon-strachan-remain-scotland-against-england\">Gordon Strachan to remain in charge of Scotland against England in November</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Infantino promised that the 2026 World Cup bidding process would be \u201cabsolutely transparent and bulletproof\u201d and said he would encourage the idea of co-hosting to keep down costs. \u201cWe want to ensure World Cups are in future sustainable events.

  "<p>Nigerian defence officials say they believe more schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram will be released in the coming weeks, raising the prospect of a swift end to one of the most high-profile kidnappings perpetrated by a terrorist group in recent years.</p> <p>Twenty-one of the 276 schoolgirls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/chibok-nigeria-200-kidnapped-schoolgirls-boko-haram\">taken from their hostel in a government boarding school in the town of Chibok</a> by the Islamic militant group in April 2014, were freed early on Thursday morning in a deal brokered by international mediators.</p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls led to the global campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/may/09/bringbackourgirls-power-of-social-media\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>, with public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama, taking part.</p> <p>Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks.</p> <p>About 190 girls from Chibok are still held by the militants. Fifty-seven fled within hours of being captured, and in May this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/nigerian-president-meet-chibok-schoolgirl-escaped-boko-haram\">one girl was found and rescued</a> in an area close to Boko Haram strongholds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not authorised to release the details of how the girls were retrieved yet, but the operation to retrieve the girls is ongoing. We are optimistic we will retrieve more of the Chibok girls from Boko Haram very soon, in the coming weeks,\u201d Gen Rabe Abubakar, a defence ministry spokesman, said.</p> <p>The freed girls were being transported from the north-east of the country, where Boko Haram has its remaining strongholds, to Abuja, the capital, on Thursday afternoon. A team of social workers, doctors and counsellors were awaiting their arrival. Many were reported to have babies with them, born in captivity. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, confirmed that 21 of the missing girls were in the custody of the department of state services.</p> <p>\u201cThe release of the girls, in a limited number, is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government. The negotiations will continue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe president welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>The information minister, Lai Mohammed, denied reports that four Boko Haram prisoners were exchanged for the girls. \u201cThis is not a swap, but a release,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-fg-not-swap-boko-haram-prisoners-chibok-girls\">Mohammed said</a>.</p> <p>The release will be a boost to Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/opposition-candidate-muhammadu-buhari-wins-nigerian-election\">took power in May 2015</a>. While government forces have taken back large amounts of territory from the group, it has remained active, killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings.</p> <p>The #BringBackOurGirls campaign group said Thursday\u2019s release was a \u201cwonderful development\u201d that confirmed \u201cwhat we have always known about the capacity of our government to rescue our #ChibokGirls\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Emma Shehu, a leader of the group, said she was relieved by the news.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been castigated by the past government, by the military and by the hardliners in the current administration for continuing with our advocacy and protests for the kidnapped girls. They\u2019ve treated us as though we were mad but we\u2019re happy that this is partly a vindication of our insanity. For the parents it\u2019s raised their hopes,\u201d Shehu said.</p> <p>The Chibok girls are among thousands of adults and children who have been abducted by Boko Haram during its seven-year insurgency. The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.</p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram. The movement has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was the new leader of Boko Haram, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>Shekau has continued to claim to be in control of the group. A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p> <p>A suicide bomber in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-idUSKCN12C0XM\">killed eight people on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>British and US special forces have been assisting the Nigerian military in their campaign against Boko Haram.

They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage. The government is negotiating with Boko Haram, including prisoner swaps, but at the same time we the military are degrading them where we can. That is proving an effective way of defeating this group.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Donnelly, an expert at London\u2019s Chatham House, said the release suggested \u201ca potential opening with the insurgents\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a question of why only this number [of girls has been released] but it shows that negotiations are possible and that is really important in trying to shift the nature of the conflict,\u201d Donnelly said.</p> <p>In the past year, the Nigerian army has retaken towns and villages in the north-east controlled by Boko Haram, and has freed hundreds of women and children held captive. However, many survivors face rejection or are stigmatised when they return to their families or are settled in refugee camps.</p> <p>In many areas of northern Nigeria, millions of victims of malnutrition, neglect and in some cases famine are surfacing, threatening a vast humanitarian crisis.

That\u2019s the question?\u201d</p> <p><em>Turtle:</em> \u201cDo I give a fuck? That\u2019s the answer!\u201d</p> <p>So picture the same dynamic, only with Nigel Farage. Of course, I mean it only metaphorically as far as the bad boys of Enfarage are concerned. I\u2019m pretty sure they all have wives, estranged or otherwise and, anyway, they wouldn\u2019t have gone near the traditional RNC hookers\u2019n\u2019coke bonanza. Fine wines, yes. Blowing rails off a paid friend while telling her about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">Breaking Point poster</a>? Don\u2019t be absurd. Essentially, these are country mice. I get the feeling they\u2019re a bit \u201cunsettled\u201d by alt-right comers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/my-night-out-in-cleveland-with-the-worst-men-on-the-internet\">Milo Yiannopolous </a>.</p> <p>Of course, there are some characters too silly even to make the Enfarage cut. There is Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam, for instance, who is running for the Ukip leadership under the Trump-frotting slogan Make Britain Great Again. Raheem once poignantly bought <a href=\"http://www.thecommentator.com/system/articles/inner_pictures/000/005/856/thumb/Capture_1_pgsh4p.png?1431874200\">the same coat as Nigel</a>, but his puritan dullardry is preventing him getting even a three-episode arc. \u201cIrony of Trump tape,\u201d ran a Raheem tweet revealing a grasp of irony to make Alanis Morissette\u2019s look Sophoclean. \u201cThe left has pushed sex liberation &amp; filthy Hollywood culture for decades. Now complaining about the language it causes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComplaining about the language\u201d? Also, \u201cfilthy Hollywood culture\u201d? Obviously, no one expects Raheem to have a clue as to why so many Republican women are vocally enraged and disgusted by Trump\u2019s sexual assault boasts \u2013 he presumably last spoke to a female sometime during the Dubya administration. But it\u2019s an interesting choice to run for the Ukip leadership on a Mary Whitehouse platform, and he is advised to manage his expectations accordingly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f162e0bb465f28cd12cf0a2e95d33020b678daa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f162e0bb465f28cd12cf0a2e95d33020b678daa/1986_427_1471_1840/799.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farage: Trump \u2018isn\u2019t running to be pope\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back to Nigel, though. Back to our star. Clearly, this is the most concerted attempt to break America since Robbie Williams moved there for a decade and became the de facto leader of the Brits in LA for No Good Reason. Robbie\u2019s US career basically consisted of hosting five-a-side football matches for fellow time-rich expats such as Vinnie Jones. Farage\u2019s strategy, in contrast, is to get as close to Trump\u2019s campaign as he possibly can, build up his recognition Stateside, and hope it doesn\u2019t end up like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/28926346/simon-cowell-has-revealed-why-he-sacked-cheryl-cole\">when Cheryl went to US X Factor</a>.</p> <p>Thus he\u2019ll do anything. Farage is now the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ross\">Paul Ross</a> of the Trump campaign \u2013 as in, his answerphone message says: \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Wait \u2013 the candidate has been taped bragging about grabbing women\u2019s pussies? Fine, Nigel will go on Fox News to defend him. Like he told the anchor, Trump\u2019s apparent predilection for sexual assault was fine because \u201che\u2019s not running to be pope\u201d. Quite. That\u2019s the last way to get ahead in the Catholic church.</p> <p>Anyway, the pope bit was sufficiently splashy for Nigel to be invited into the post-debate spinroom, where he dispensed further look-at-me lines. Trump, Farage declared, was <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/nigel-farage-donald-trump-gorilla/\">\u201clike a big silverback gorilla\u201d</a> \u2013 an analysis that makes me wonder if those paw ashtrays are always morally wrong. Either way, the last thing you should think is that Nigel is coming off like a small fish in a massive pond. \u201cI\u2019ve been there myself,\u201d he mused of the first presidential debate. \u201cI remember my first debate.\u201d Thanking you, Obi-Wan.</p> <p>What is the endgame to all this? If Nigel has an Ari Gold figure, where is he steering him? My feeling is that Farage ultimately wants a berth on <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/donald-trump-fox-republicans-network/487667/\">Trump TV</a>, the network Trump is rumoured to be launching should his presidential bid fail. Our natural instinct is probably to see Nigel occupying the Partridgean 3am-6am graveyard slot. Then again, in the world of Trump, maybe the small hours are prime time? God knows that\u2019s when the candidate has done some of his <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/09/30/trump-goes-on-3am-tweetstorm-to-attack-former-miss-universe-check-out-her-sex-tape/\">most eye-catching work</a>.</p> <p>Or perhaps Nigel hopes Trump will employ him as a sidekick on his own show \u2013 kind of like Hank on Larry Sanders. The fear, naturally, is that Nigel will end up some kind of <a href=\"http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/australian-comedian-barry-humphries-as-his-professional-alter-ego-picture-id558933657\">Madge Allsop figure</a> \u2013 monstrously insulted and abused, but too beaten to find the courage to escape. All we can do is remind Nigel that lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Britannia will be waiting for him with open arms if all goes tits up. Leave a $10 bill on her nightstand, Nige, and tell her about the time you were big in America.</p>",

  "<p>One of the joys \u2013 or this time possibly the only one \u2013 of an election year is the nerd pageant of political commentators who, after broadcasting in the dark for four years, burst into the light, high on facts and the novelty of prime time.

And then there is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/column/maureen-dowd\" title=\"\">Maureen Dowd</a>.</p> <p>Dowd has covered nine elections, never more energetically than when a Clinton is running, because, famously, the New York Times columnist hates the Clintons \u2013 particularly Hillary. Over the years, Dowd has called her \u201cshifty\u201d and a \u201cdominatrix\u201d, a \u201cmanly girl\u201d, and written endlessly about her \u201ccreepy\u201d marriage to Bill, which she once described as a \u201crepugnant&#xa0;arrangement\u201d.</p> <p>When Hillary first ran against Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/opinion/19dowd.html\" title=\"\">Dowd wrote</a> of how pathetic it was \u201cthat she has to wage a major offensive \u2026 to make herself appear warm-blooded\u201d, and commentary this year includes the sour gem: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/reigning-cats-and-dogs.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">After running as a man last time</a> around, Hillary Clinton is now running as a woman.\u201d Since she has a book out \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Year-Voting-Dangerously-Derangement-American/dp/1455539260\" title=\"\">The Year of Voting Dangerously</a>, a collection of writings on the season\u2019s political insanity \u2013 Dowd popped up on talk shows last weekend; arch, brittle and fairly twitching with the strain of being caught between Clinton and a hard place. It was a small, thrilling piece of drama alongside the frankly exhausting spectacle of the main event.</p> <p>That is the joy of Dowd these days; not that her laborious wisecracks hit home \u2013 she is neither subtle nor funny \u2013 but the showmanship that goes into creating them. If you look past the overblown language, a lot of what she has written about Clinton isn\u2019t even that bad, but is a sensible critique of how the senator calls out sexism when it suits her and not when it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Sensible is not the effect Dowd is aiming for. In a monolithic media landscape, she is an increasingly eccentric figure, akin to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Leslie\" title=\"\">Ann Leslie</a> emerging from a dugout in a fur coat, the grande dame who doesn\u2019t give a damn.

Nonetheless, there is one band the size of which never ceases to amaze me, and that is the middle class.</p> <p>Clinton is campaigning on a platform of no tax cuts for middle-class voters \u2013 which, by her reckoning, means any household with an income of less than $250,000 (\u00a3205,000) a year. Median family income in the US is $52,000 but, for those in the most expensive cities, that is nowhere near a living wage. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/realestate/what-is-middle-class-in-manhattan.html\" title=\"\">A study by the New York Times</a> a few years ago concluded that, \u201cto accommodate the cost of living in Manhattan, [a] salary would have to fall between $80,000 and $235,000.

They are, instead, trapped in a Brexit box and that\u2019s worth a chortle or two. Maybe that is so, but many of these sage and serious people are also the idiots who thought, for reasons best explained by their own ignorance and complacency, that only one in three Scots would vote for independence in 2014.

And it\u2019s an important one.</p> <p>When Scotland does come to take this decision again - whenever that might be - we must not take for granted how anyone will vote.<br></p> <p>It will be a new debate - not a rerun of 2014.</p> <p>We must not assume that people\u2019s views - yes or no - are the same today as they were two years ago.</p> <p>Instead we must engage the arguments with a fresh eye and an open mind.</p> <p>The case for independence will have to be made and won.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the SNP would vote against the proposed \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d - the bill planned for the next session of parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can confirm today that SNP MPs will vote against the Brexit bill when it come before the House of Commons next year.</p> <p>That Bill will repeal the legislation that enacted our EU membership. Scotland didn\u2019t vote for that and so neither will our MPs.</p> <p>But we will also work to persuade others - Labour, Liberals and moderate Tories - to join us in a coalition against a hard Brexit: not just for Scotland, but for the whole UK.</p> <p>In practice this is unlikely to make much difference because Labour is unlikely to vote against the bill at second reading. Many Labour MPs are opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, but most of them do not intend to right against the principle of the UK leaving the EU.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the Conservatives were pushing for a hard Brexit for which they had no mandate.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are using the [referendum] result as cover for a hard Brexit for which they have no mandate - but which they are determined to impose, regardless of the ruinous consequences.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She accused the Conservatives of embracing Ukip-style xenophobia and said their views had \u201cno place in a civilised society\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week, in Birmingham, we heard an intolerance towards those from other countries that has no place in a modern, multicultural, civilised society.</p> <p>You know, on the day of the prime minister\u2019s speech to the Tory conference, the new leader of UKIP resigned.</p> <p>Perhaps she realized that her job and her party are now redundant.</p> <p>Last week, we saw the Tories adopt UKIP policy and Farage-style rhetoric - lock, stock and beer-barrel.</p> <p>It was a disgrace. It shames the Tory party and all who speak for it.</p> <p>But make no mistake - the right wing of the Tory party is now in the ascendancy and it is seeking to hijack the referendum result.</p> <p>Brexit has become Tory Brexit.</p> <p>The rampant right wing of the party are using it as license for the xenophobia that has long lain under the surface - but which is now in full, unlovely view.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She compared Theresa May to Margaret Thatcher. </strong>This was noteworthy because of Thatcher\u2019s continuing unpopularity in Scotland.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said that even though 1m Scots voted for Brexit, they did not vote for the hard Brexit now on offer from the Tories.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I know that one million of our fellow citizens voted to Leave. They did so for a range of legitimate reasons and as first minister, I have a duty to listen to, to understand and to respond to these reasons.</p> <p>But I suspect that many of those who voted to Leave, look now at the actions and rhetoric of the Tories and think \u2018that\u2019s not what I voted for\u2019.</p> <p>They may have voted to take back control.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t imagine many of them voted to hand control to the unholy trinity of Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox ...</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to throw economic rationality out of the window.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to lower their own living standards or to sacrifice jobs and investment.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for our businesses to face tariffs or for holiday-makers to need visas.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for the scapegoating of foreigners.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s language at this point in the speech is similar to what has been said by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who has also been arguing that the referendum vote was not a vote for \u201chard\u201d Brexit. (The problem for Hammond and Sturgeon is that there is ample evidence that people were voting for this, because the UK government warned very clearly about the economic consequences of Brexit, and Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage even said explicitly that lower living standards would be a price worth paying for independence from Brussels.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39d5eb2b85593ab4fceb4117a9e7caf3fa36e8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39d5eb2b85593ab4fceb4117a9e7caf3fa36e8ee/0_341_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon addressing her conference today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon addressing her conference today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T11:12:57.306Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speeding up the referendum bill process opens up a deepening and increasingly significant political divide between the Scottish and UK governments, signalling Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s increasing confidence that the Tories shift to a harder line stance on Brexit has strengthened her hand.</p> <p>But she made clear that was to protect her government\u2019s longer term position.

Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a4e6bd4-84ae-11e6-8897-2359a58ac7a5\">a withering column about him that <strong>Philip Stephens </strong>published in the Financial Times (subscription) recently.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Word in Westminster has it that Boris Johnson would like to apologise personally to Barack Obama for raising his \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d ancestry when the US president backed the pro-Europeans during the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit\">EU referendum</a>. Word in Washington is that the UK foreign secretary would do as well not to bother. Such slights are not easily forgotten by the first African-American president.</p> <p>Mr Johnson seems to have something of a problem with, well, foreigners. Fellow Europeans have not forgiven the mendacity of the EU \u201cout\u201d campaign. Some in Africa may recall his allusions, albeit some while ago, to \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d and \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. He says such remarks have been taken out of context. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e356f76-84bd-11e6-a29c-6e7d9515ad15\">Visiting Ankara this week</a> he presumably told his hosts something similar about the Leave campaign\u2019s scaremongering about Turkish migrants.</p> <p>Foreign policy is a serious business, the more so in an age of global upheaval and rising disorder. Mr Johnson looks more comfortable in the role of court jester than thoughtful policymaker. He prefers the broad brush to irksome detail. His Italian opposite number Paolo Gentiloni was left baffled when Mr Johnson proposed a post-Brexit grand bargain: Italy would back open access to the EU for London\u2019s financial industry and Britain would continue to drink lots of Italian prosecco.</p> <p>Word in Berlin is that Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the intensely serious German foreign minister, can scarcely abide being in the same room as Mr Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b1a3c3e-81b7-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4\">Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble</a>, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has mocked the foreign secretary\u2019s shallow grasp of the way the union works by offering to send him the Lisbon treaty. Finance ministers, he remarked waspishly, were \u201caccustomed to having a high degree of respect for foreign ministers\u201d. It might be added that Theresa May, the prime minister, is banking on Berlin\u2019s support to secure a good deal in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Allies say that Mr Johnson is \u201ca quick read\u201d \u2014 when paying attention, he absorbs information easily. Whitehall no doubt has laid on crash seminars on the workings of the world. The foreign secretary does not help himself, though, by addressing fellow ministers in the manner of Bertie Wooster, the twittish toff from the pages of English humorist PG Wodehouse. The other day Mr Johnson sat down with the hard-bitten Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. An unkind observer might have imagined Wodehouse\u2019s Wooster meeting Machiavelli\u2019s Prince.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff3822e4b01d9dd2c9074f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T08:03:14.594Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Who\u2019d have guessed that Brexit would trigger a national Marmite shortage?

The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.<br></p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram.

A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno.

  "<h2>Trump faces raft of allegations about behavior towards women</h2> <p>Donald Trump is facing a torrent of allegations about his behaviour towards women, countering his claims at last week\u2019s debate that he had only engaged in \u201clocker room talk\u201d and that his remarks about groping women without their consent in a leaked 2005 recording were \u201cjust words\u201d. Nearly 10 allegations surfaced late on Wednesday. Two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, told the New York Times that Trump had groped or kissed them without consent. \u201cHe was like an octopus,\u201d Leeds said of the airplane encounter 35 years ago. \u201cHis hands were everywhere.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/trump-makes-inappropriate-remarks-about-10-year-old-girl-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/579b2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2801846\"            data-video-name=\"Trump makes inappropriate remarks about 10-year-old girl \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"CBS News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ff289ae4b05d915e4246d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/13/161013trumpchild_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/13/161013trumpchild.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/13/161013trumpchild_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/trump-makes-inappropriate-remarks-about-10-year-old-girl-video\">Trump makes inappropriate remarks about 10-year-old girl</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Another woman, Mindy McGillivray, claimed she was groped by the Republican nominee at a Trump foundation event in Florida while Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, said Trump forced himself on her in 2005.

  "<p>Last March, my 71-year-old grandmother, Betty, waited in line for three hours to caucus for Bernie Sanders. The wait to be able to cast her first-ever vote in a primary election was punishing, but nothing could have deterred her. Betty \u2013 a white woman who left school after ninth grade, had her first child at age 16 and spent much of her life in severe poverty \u2013 wanted to vote.</p> <p>So she waited with busted knees that once stood on factory lines. She waited with smoking-induced emphysema and the false teeth she\u2019s had since her late 20s \u2013 both markers of our class. She waited with a womb that in the 1960s, before Roe v Wade, she paid a stranger to thrust a wire hanger inside after she discovered she was pregnant by a man she\u2019d fled after he broke her jaw.</p> <p>Betty worked for many years as a probation officer for the state judicial system in Wichita, Kansas, keeping tabs on men who had murdered and raped. As a result, it\u2019s hard to faze her, but she has pronounced Republican candidate Donald Trump a sociopath \u201cwhose mouth overloads his ass\u201d.</p> <p>No one loathes Trump \u2013 who suggested women should be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html\">punished</a> for having abortions, who said hateful things about groups of people she has loved and worked alongside since childhood, whose pomp and indecency offends her modest, midwestern sensibility \u2013 more than she.</p> <p>Yet, it is white working-class people like Betty who have become a particular fixation among the chattering class during this election: what is this angry beast, and why does it support Trump?<br></p> <h2>Not so poor: Trump voters are middle class</h2> <p>Hard numbers complicate, if not roundly dismiss, the oft-regurgitated theory that income or education levels predict Trump support, or that working-class whites support him disproportionately. Last month, <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822059\">results of 87,000 interviews </a>conducted by Gallup showed that those who liked Trump were under no more economic distress or immigration-related anxiety than those who opposed him.</p> <p>According to the study, his supporters didn\u2019t have lower incomes or higher unemployment levels than other Americans. Income data misses a lot; those with healthy earnings might also have negative wealth or downward mobility. But respondents overall weren\u2019t clinging to jobs perceived to be endangered. \u201cSurprisingly\u201d, a Gallup researcher wrote, \u201cthere appears to be no link whatsoever between exposure to trade competition and support for nationalist policies in America, as embodied by the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, primary exit polls revealed that Trump voters were, in fact, more affluent than most Americans, with a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">median household income of $72,000</a> \u2013 higher than that of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders supporters. Forty-four percent of them had college degrees, well above the national average of 33% among whites or 29% overall. In January, political scientist Matthew MacWilliams <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-authoritarian-213533\">reported</a> findings that a penchant for authoritarianism \u2013 not income, education, gender, age or race \u2013predicted Trump support.</p> <p>These facts haven\u2019t stopped pundits and journalists from pushing story after story about the white working class\u2019s giddy embrace of a bloviating demagogue.</p> <p>In seeking to explain Trump\u2019s appeal, proportionate media coverage would require more stories about the racism and misogyny among white Trump supporters in tony suburbs. Or, if we\u2019re examining economically driven bitterness among the working class, stories about the Democratic lawmakers who in recent decades ended welfare as we knew it, hopped in the sack with Wall Street and forgot American labor in their global trade agreements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, for national media outlets comprised largely of middle- and upper-class liberals, that would mean looking their own class in the face.</p> <p>The faces journalists do train the cameras on \u2013 hateful ones screaming sexist vitriol next to Confederate flags \u2013 must receive coverage but do not speak for the communities I know well. That the media industry ignored my home for so long left a vacuum of understanding in which the first glimpse of an economically downtrodden white is presumed to represent the whole.</p> <p>Part of the current glimpse is JD Vance, author of the bestselling new memoir <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lives-of-poor-white-people\">Hillbilly Elegy</a>. A successful attorney who had a precariously middle-class upbringing in an Ohio steel town, Vance wrote of the chaos that can haunt a family with generational memory of deep poverty. A conservative who says he won\u2019t vote for Trump, Vance speculates about why working-class whites will: cultural anxiety that arises when opioid overdose kills your friends and the political establishment has proven it will throw you under the bus. While his theories may hold up in some corners, in interviews coastal media members have repeatedly asked Vance to speak for the entire white working class.</p> <p>His interviewers and reviewers often seem relieved to find someone with ownership on the topic whose ideas in large part confirm their own. The New York Times election podcast <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/podcasts/understanding-the-trump-voter.html?_r=0\">The Run-Up</a> said Vance\u2019s memoir \u201cdoubles as a cultural anthropology of the white underclass that has flocked to the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s candidacy\u201d. (The Times teased its review of the book with the tweet: \u201cWant to know more about the people who fueled the rise of Donald Trump?\u201d)</p> <p>While Vance happens to have roots in Kentucky mining country, most downtrodden whites are not conservative male Protestants from Appalachia. That sometimes seems the only concept of them that the American consciousness can contain: tucked away in a remote mountain shanty like a coal-dust-covered ghost, as though white poverty isn\u2019t always right in front of us, swiping our credit cards at a Target in Denver or asking for cash on a Los Angeles sidewalk.</p> <p>One-dimensional stereotypes fester where journalism fails to tread. The last time I saw my native class receive substantial focus, before now, was over 20 years ago \u2013 not in the news but on the television show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne\">Roseanne</a>, the fictional storylines of which remain more accurate than the musings of comfortable commentators in New York studios.</p> <p>Countless images of working-class progressives, including women such as Betty, are thus rendered invisible by a ratings-fixated media that covers elections as horse races and seeks sensational b-roll. </p> <p>This media paradigm created the tale of a divided America \u2013 \u201cred\u201d v \u201cblue\u201d\u2013 in which the 42% of Kansans who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 are meaningless. </p> <p>This year, more Kansans <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-sanders-wins-kansas/\">caucused for Bernie Sanders</a> than for Donald Trump \u2013 a newsworthy point I never saw noted in national press, who perhaps couldn\u2019t fathom that \u201cflyover country\u201d might contain millions of Americans more progressive than their Clinton strongholds. </p> <p>In lieu of such coverage, media makers cast the white working class as a monolith and imply an old, treacherous story convenient to capitalism: that the poor are dangerous idiots.</p> <h2>Poor whiteness and poor character</h2> <p>The two-fold myth about the white working class \u2013 that they are to blame for Trump\u2019s rise, and that those among them who support him for the worst reasons exemplify the rest \u2013 takes flight on the wings of moral superiority affluent Americans often pin upon themselves.</p> <p>I have never seen them flap so insistently as in today\u2019s election commentary, where notions of poor whiteness and poor character are routinely conflated. </p> <p>In an election piece last March in the National Review, writer Kevin Williamson\u2019s assessment of poor white voters \u2013 among whom mortality rates have sharply risen in recent decades \u2013 expressed what many conservatives and liberals alike may well believe when he observed that communities ravaged by oxycodone use \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer\">deserve to die</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles,\u201d Williamson wrote. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\u201d</p> <p>For confirmation that this point is lost on most reporters, not just conservative provocateurs, look no further than a recent Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/08/31/opiods-and-anti-anxiety-medication-are-killing-white-american-women/\">series</a> that explored spiking <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/white-death/\">death rates</a> among rural white women by fixating on their smoking habits and graphically detailing the \u201chaggard face\u201d and embalming processes of their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/life-lessons-from-a-small-town-undertaker-as-white-women-die-younger-in-america/2016/08/20/a1e64d76-60b6-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">corpses</a>. Imagine wealthy white woman examined thusly after their deaths. The outrage among family and friends with the education, time, and agency to write letters to the editor would have been deafening.</p> <p>A sentiment that I care for even less than contempt or degradation is their tender cousin: pity.</p> <p>In a recent op-ed headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/opinion/dignity-and-sadness-in-the-working-class.html\">Dignity and Sadness in the Working Class</a>, David Brooks told of a laid-off Kentucky metal worker he met. On his last day, the man left to rows of cheering coworkers \u2013 a moment I read as triumphant, but that Brooks declared pitiable. How hard the man worked for so little, how great his skills and how dwindling their value, Brooks pointed out, for people he said radiate \u201cthe residual sadness of the lonely heart\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a worse slight than the media figures who have disregarded the embattled white working class for decades now beseeching the country to have sympathy for them. We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told, preferably by someone who can walk into a factory without his own guilt fogging his glasses.</p> <p>One such journalist, Alexander Zaitchik, spent several months on the road in six states getting to know white working-class people who do support Trump. His goal for the resulting new book, <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/books/gilded-rage-conversation-trump-supporter-will-surprise-you\">The Gilded Rage</a>, was to convey the human complexity that daily news misses. Zaitchik wrote that his mission arose from frustration with \u201c\u2018hot takes\u2019 written by people living several time zones and income brackets away from their subjects\u201d.</p> <p>Zaitchik wisely described those he met as a \u201cblue-collar middle class\u201d\u2013 mostly white people who have worked hard and lost a lot, whether in the market crash of 2008 or the manufacturing layoffs of recent decades. He found that their motivations overwhelmingly \u201cstarted with economics and ended with economics\u201d. The anger he observed was \u201cpointed up, not down\u201d at those who forgot them when global trade deals were negotiated, not at minority groups.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the racism and nationalism that surely exist among them also exist among Democrats and higher socioeconomic strata. A poll conducted last spring by Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-trump-idUSKBN0TQ2QT20151208\">found</a> that a third of questioned Democrats supported a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. In another, by YouGov, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/12/09/most-americans-dislike-islam/\">45%</a> of polled Democrats reported holding an unfavorable view of Islam, with almost no fluctuation based on household income. Those who won\u2019t vote for Trump are not necessarily paragons of virtue, while the rest are easily scapegoated as the country\u2019s moral scourge.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton recently declared half of Trump supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, Zaitchik told another reporter, the language \u201ccould be read as another way of saying \u2018white-trash bin\u2019.\u201d Clinton quickly apologized for the comment, the context of which contained compassion for many Trump voters. But making such generalizations at a $6m fundraiser in downtown New York City, at which some attendees paid $50,000 for a seat, recalled for me scenes from the television political satire Veep in which powerful Washington figures discuss \u201cnormals\u201d with distaste behind closed doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd/0_0_2000_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DeBruce Grain elevator.

Federal safety inspectors had not visited it for 16 years when an explosion ripped through the half-mile long structure, killing seven workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Schiappa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we talked, Zaitchik mentioned HBO talk-show host Bill Maher, who he pointed out \u201cbasically makes eugenics-level arguments about anyone who votes for Donald Trump having congenital defects. You would never get away with talking that way about any other group of people and still have a TV show.\u201d</p> <p>Maher is, perhaps, the pinnacle of classist smugness. In the summer of 1998, when I was 17 and just out of high school, I worked at a grain elevator during the wheat harvest. An elevator 50 miles east in Haysville, Kansas, exploded (grain dust is highly combustible), <a href=\"http://www.kansas.com/news/article986253.html\">killing seven workers</a>. The accident rattled my community and reminded us about the physical dangers my family and I often faced as farmers.</p> <p>I kept going to work like everyone else and, after a long day weighing wheat trucks and hauling heavy sacks of feed in and out of the mill, liked to watch Politically Incorrect, the ABC show Maher hosted then. With the search for one of the killed workers\u2019 bodies still under way, Maher joked, as I recall, that the people should check their loaves of Wonder Bread.</p> <p>That moment was perhaps my first reckoning with the hard truth that, throughout my life, I would politically identify with the same people who often insult the place I am from.</p> <p>Such derision is so pervasive that it\u2019s often imperceptible to the economically privileged. Those who write, discuss, and publish newspapers, books, and magazines with best intentions sometimes offend with obliviousness.</p> <p>Many people recommended to me the bestselling new history book <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/books/review-white-trash-ruminates-on-an-american-underclass.html\">White Trash</a>, for instance, without registering that its title is a slur that refers to me and the people I love as garbage. My happy relief that someone set out to tell this ignored thread of our shared past was squashed by my wincing every time I saw it on my shelf, so much so that I finally took the book jacket off. Incredibly, promotional copy for the book commits precisely the elitist shaming Isenberg is out to expose: \u201c(the book) takes on our comforting myths about equality, uncovering the crucial legacy of the ever-present, always embarrassing \u2013 if occasionally entertaining \u2013poor white trash.\u201d </p> <p>The book itself is more sensitively wrought and imparts facts that one hopes would dismantle popular use of its titular term. But even Isenberg can\u2019t escape our classist frameworks.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/americas-long-unaddressed-history-class/\">On the Media</a> host Brooke Gladstone asked Isenberg, earlier this year, to address long-held perceptions of poor whites as bigots, the author described a conundrum:\u201cThey do subscribe to certain views that are undoubtedly racist, and you can\u2019t mask it and pretend that it\u2019s not there. It is very much a part of their thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Entertain a parallel broad statement about any other disenfranchised group, and you might begin to see how rudimentary class discussion is for this relatively young country that long believed itself to be free of castes. Isenberg has sniffed out the hypocrisy in play, though.</p> <p>\u201cThe other problem is when people want to blame poor whites for being the only racist in the room,\u201d she told Gladstone. \u201c\u2026 as if they\u2019re more racist than everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>That problem is rooted in the notion that higher class means higher integrity. As journalist Lorraine Berry wrote last month, \u201cThe story remains that only the ignorant would be racist. Racism disappears with education we\u2019re told.\u201d As the first from my family to hold degrees, I assure you that none of us had to go to college to learn basic human decency.</p> <p>Berry points out that Ivy-League-minted Republicans shepherded the rise of the alt-right. Indeed, it was not poor whites \u2013 not even white Republicans \u2013 who passed legislation bent on preserving segregation, or who watched the Confederate flag raised outside state capitols for decades to come.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t poor whites who criminalized blackness by way of marijuana laws and the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d.</p> <p>Nor was it poor whites who conjured the specter of the black \u201cwelfare queen\u201d.</p> <p>These points should not minimize the horrors of racism at the lowest economic rungs of society, but remind us that those horrors reside at the top in different forms and with more terrible power.</p> <p>Among reporters and commentators this election cycle, then, a steady finger ought be pointed at whites with economic leverage: social conservatives who donate to Trump\u2019s campaign while being too civilized to attend a political rally and yell what they really believe.</p> <h2>Mainstream media is set up to fail the ordinary American</h2> <p>Based on Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and available data, it appears that most of his voters this November will be people who are getting by well enough but who think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>One thing the media misses is that a great portion of the white working class would align with any sense before victimhood. Right now they are clocking in and out of work, sorting their grocery coupons, raising their children to respect others, and avoiding political news coverage.</p> <p>Barack Obama, a black man formed by the black experience, often cites his maternal lineage in the white working class. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s shaped me came from my grandparents who grew up on the prairie in Kansas,\u201d he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-thank-god-im-a-country-boy/article/2603608\">wrote</a> this month to mark a White House forum on rural issues. </p> <p>Last year, talking with author Marilynne Robinson for the New York Review of Books, Obama lamented common misconceptions of small-town middle America, for which he has a sort of reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge gap between how folks go about their daily lives and how we talk about our common life and our political life,\u201d he said, naming one cause as \u201cthe filters that stand between ordinary people\u201d who are busy getting by and complicated policy debates. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged when I meet people in their environments,\u201d Obama told Robinson. \u201cSomehow it gets distilled at the national political level in ways that aren\u2019t always as encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>To be sure, one discouraging distillation \u2013 the caricature of the hate-spewing white male Trump voter with grease on his jeans \u2013 is a real person of sorts. There were one or two in my town: the good ol\u2019 boy who menaces those with less power than himself \u2013 running people of color out of town with the threat of violence, denigrating women, shooting BB guns at stray cats for fun. They are who Trump would be if he\u2019d been born where I was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Media fascination with the hateful white Trump voter fuels the theory, now in fashion, that bigotry is the only explanation for supporting him. Certainly, financial struggle does not predict a soft spot for Trump, as cash-strapped people of color \u2013 who face the threat of his racism and xenophobia, and who resoundingly reject him, by all available measures \u2013 can attest. However, one imagines that elite white liberals who maintain an air of ethical grandness this election season would have a harder time thinking globally about trade and immigration if it were their factory job that was lost and their community that was decimated. </p> <p>Affluent analysts who oppose Trump, though, have a way of taking a systemic view when examining social woes but viewing their place on the political continuum as a triumph of individual character. Most of them presumably inherited their political bent, just like most of those in \u201cred\u201d America did. If you were handed liberalism, give yourself no pats on the back for your vote against Trump.</p> <p>Spare, too, the condescending argument that disaffected Democrats who joined Republican ranks in recent decades are \u201cvoting against their own best interests,\u201d undemocratic in its implication that a large swath of America isn\u2019t mentally fit to cast a ballot. </p> <p>Whoever remains on Trump\u2019s side as stories concerning his treatment of women, racism and other dangers continue to unfurl gets no pass from me for any reason. They are capable of voting, and they own their decisions. Let\u2019s be aware of our class biases, though, as we discern who \u201cthey\u201d are.</p> <h2>Journalist? Then the chances are you\u2019re not blue collar</h2> <p>A recent print-edition New York Times cutline <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/opinion/sunday/we-need-somebody-spectacular-views-from-trump-country.html\">described</a> a Kentucky man:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMitch Hedges, who farms cattle and welds coal-mining equipment. He expects to lose his job in six months, but does not support Mr Trump, who he says is \u2018an idiot.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This made me cheer for the rare spotlight on a member of the white working class who doesn\u2019t support Trump. It also made me laugh \u2013 one can\u2019t \u201cfarm cattle\u201d. One farms crops, and one raises livestock. It\u2019s sometimes hard for a journalist who has done both to take the New York Times seriously.</p> <p>The main reason that national media outlets have a blind spot in matters of class is the lack of socioeconomic diversity within their ranks. Few people born to deprivation end up working in newsrooms or publishing books. So few, in fact, that this former laborer has found cause to shift her entire writing career to talk specifically about class in a wealth-privileged industry, much as journalists of color find themselves talking about race in a whiteness-privileged one.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that one must reside among a given group or place to do it justice, of course, as good muckrakers and commentators have shown for the past century and beyond. See On the Media\u2019s fine new series on poverty, the second episode of which includes Gladstone\u2019s reflection that \u201cthe poor are no more monolithic than the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>I know journalists to be hard-working people who want to get the story right, and I\u2019m resistant to rote condemnations of \u201cthe media\u201d. The classism of cable-news hosts merely reflects the classism of privileged America in general. It\u2019s everywhere, from tweets describing Trump voters as inbred hillbillies to a Democratic campaign platform that didn\u2019t bother with a specific anti-poverty platform until a month out from the general election.</p> <p>The economic trench between reporter and reported on has never been more hazardous than at this moment of historic wealth disparity, though, when stories focus more often on the stock market than on people who own no stocks. American journalism has been willfully obtuse about the grievances on Main Streets for decades \u2013 surely a factor in digging the hole of resentment that Trump\u2019s venom now fills. That the term \u201cpopulism\u201d has become a pejorative among prominent liberal commentators should give us great pause. A journalism that embodies the plutocracy it\u2019s supposed to critique has failed its watchdog duty and lost the respect of people who call bullshit when they see it. </p> <p>One such person was my late grandfather, Arnie. Men like Trump sometimes drove expensive vehicles up the gravel driveway of our Kansas farmhouse looking to do some sort of business. Grandpa would recognize them as liars and thieves, treat them kindly, and send them packing. If you shook their hands, after they left Grandpa would laugh and say, \u201cBetter count your fingers.\u201d</p> <p>In a world in which the Bettys and Arnies of the world have little voice, those who enjoy a platform from which to speak might examine their hearts and minds before stepping onto the soap box.</p> <p>If you would stereotype a group of people by presuming to guess their politics or deeming them inferior to yourself \u2013 say, the ones who worked third shift on a Boeing floor while others flew to Mexico during spring break; the ones who mopped a McDonald\u2019s bathroom while others argued about the minimum wage on Twitter; the ones who cleaned out their lockers at a defunct Pabst factory while others drank craft beer at trendy bars; the ones who came back from the Middle East in caskets while others wrote op-eds about foreign policy \u2013 then consider that you might have more in common with Trump than you would like to admit.</p>",
  "<p>The 2016 presidential campaign isn\u2019t turning out to be the Facebook election, as some people <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-facebook-is-dominating-the-2016-election-1475429365\">have dubbed it</a>.

In less than two days, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/sunlightfund\">a crowdfunding effort</a> has raised over $33,000 for more damaging Trump videos. Mark Burnett, the producer of The Apprentice and an alleged close friend of Trump, reportedly threatened to sue anyone on his staff who leaked more videos (though he <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/10/10/mark-burnett-apprentice-cant-release-trump-tapes/91875804/\">later denied</a> making those remarks).</p> <p>On the Clinton side, the campaign and its surrogates have spent the past week trying to delegitimize the latest WikiLeaks release of campaign manager\u2019s John Podesta\u2019s emails, while heavily pushing the Trump taxes and video stories. Several people caught up in the leak have slyly insinuated that some could be faked by alleged Russian hackers, while providing no proof that they\u2019ve been altered.

Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.</p> <p>Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.</p> <p>A recently uncovered tape revealed his comments bragging about sexually assaulting women. Any faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense \u2013 taking the name \u201cLiberty University\u201d with him. \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners,\u201d Falwell told the media, as if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses across America, including our own.</p> <p>It is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments. We must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven, a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nation\u2019s highest office.</p> <p>Jesus tells a story in the Bible about a man who tries to remove a speck of dust from his brother\u2019s eye, while he has a log stuck in his own. \u201cYou hypocrite,\u201d Jesus says, \u201cfirst take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.\u201d</p> <p>We Liberty students are often told to support Donald Trump because the other leading candidate is a bad option. Perhaps this is true. But the only candidate who is directly associated with Liberty University is Donald Trump.</p> <p>Because our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support.</p> <p>We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don\u2019t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57feda24e4b03b22b4fb2c62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:50:44.194Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clinton campaign has responded to Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone\u2019s statements that he has had \u201cback-channel communications\u201d with Wikileaks, the organization that has released hacked documents and emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt is disturbing that Roger Stone, a longtime Donald Trump confidante, has confirmed the fact that has \u2018back-channel communications\u2019 with Wikileaks, an organization that is working with the Russian government to affect the American presidential election,\u201d said Glen Caplin.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also now clear that the illegal hack of John Podesta\u2019s email is the work of the Russian government, according to the FBI.

That would be smart \u2013 but we don\u2019t run government smart.\u201d</p> <p>In a bizarre aside, Trump even took on the NFL over its new regulations to limit concussions. \u201cA little ding in the head you can\u2019t play the rest of the season,\u201d he said mockingly.</p> <p>But the Democratic candidate remained his primary target. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between the pessimism of Hillary Clinton and the optimism of a movement powered by millions of people all over the country...

The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them.</p> <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw. On Monday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, fired another salvo at Trump by saying he would no longer campaign for him or defend him, and told members they should feel free to focus on their own survival.</p> <p>\u201cI think Republicans were feeling pretty good about the Congress a couple weeks ago, but this morning they\u2019re very worried,\u201d former representative Vin Weber told the Guardian on Monday.

Israel has long claimed that the global campaign calling for it to be held to account for its violations of human rights and international law occupation is seeking to hold Israel to a different standard than that expected of other nations \u2013 and in doing so questions the motivations of advocates of the campaign. The opposite is true.</p> <p>The call is for Israel to be treated like other nations, and for it to abide by the same rules. The rules that Fifa applied to clubs in Northern Cyprus and South Ossetia, among others, who are excluded from competition, should now be applied to the IFA. Any other decision would represent a fundamental violation of the principle that makes football so popular: that we are all equal under the law and all play under the same set of rules.</p>",

Some girls were topless.</p> <p>\u201cWe were naked or half naked in a very physically vulnerable position,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd then to have the pressure of the people that worked for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him, talk to him, get his attention.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing?utm_term=.om6L9zmv#.kyVjAmPl\">reported</a> on Wednesday that several teen beauty queens from the 1997 Miss Teen USA said Trump entered a communal dressing room while several of them were naked. One girl was 15 years old at the time.</p> <p>Another Miss USA contestant from 2001 who spoke to the Guardian did not recall Trump showing inappropriate behavior. She recalled Trump being backstage, she said, but only on the evening that the pageant was nationally televised.</p> <p>\u201cThe chaperones made announcements that he was there &amp; would be coming into the dressing room,\u201d the former contestant, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote in an email. \u201cThey gave us all a heads up, it was also very close to the pageant starting &amp; very brief. I would imagine that most, if not all contestants were already, or at least should have been, dressed to compete.\u201d</p> <p>The contestant remembered Trump standing in the doorway and wishing them good luck and said he did not \u201cparade\u201d through the room. \u201cI am not endorsing anyone, but giving an honest account of meeting Mr Trump,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The contestant who accused Trump of bursting into her dressing room acknowledged that not every contestant had negative experiences with Trump. She did not report Trump\u2019s behavior at the time, she said, because her position was too tenuous.</p> <p>\u201cThis was my boss. I\u2019m there to represent my state, my town, my reputation on one of the most prestigious stages on the planet,\u201d she said. \u201cI had not a lot of experience under my belt. And it was horrifying \u2026 It was extremely uncomfortable from there forward.\u201d</p> <p>Until she saw Dixon\u2019s interview, she thought that she and the other woman in the dressing room were Trump\u2019s only targets.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that this has been a personality trait of his for a long time,\u201d she said, explaining her motivation for speaking out. \u201cHe completely exerted his power and the control that he had \u2026 And I do believe that kind of behavior perpetuates rape culture and makes young boys think they can behave that way.\u201d</p> <p>Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.</p>",
  "<p>Voters in the Australian Capital Territory will return to the polls this Saturday to elect a new legislative assembly for the next four years. The ACT has had its own self-governing assembly since 1989 and, in that time, it has developed quite differently from most other parliaments in Australia, with the voting system favouring minority governments and multi-party politics.</p> <p>Since 1995, the ACT has used the Hare-Clark system to elect the assembly. This system is also used to elect the lower house of the Tasmanian parliament and is similar to the system used to elect the Senate. Five members are elected to represent each electorate and each candidate needs a quota of roughly one sixth of the vote to win a seat. This proportional voting system makes it very difficult for one party to win a majority on their own, with members of different parties representing the same electorate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2016/oct/11/clean-energy-transition-happening-act-at-risk\">A clean energy transition is already happening, but it is at risk | Alexander White</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main difference between the Senate voting system and Hare-Clark is in how each party\u2019s candidates are ranked. In Senate elections, each party nominates a ticket in a particular order. The candidates are listed in that order on the ballot and we have the shortcut of voting above the line to preference the candidates in the predetermined order. There is no such order in ACT elections. The \u201cRobson rotation\u201d system means that different ballot papers have different candidates at the top of their party\u2019s list and you can\u2019t just vote above the line for a party: you have to vote for individual candidates. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ACT elections\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://benraue.carto.com/viz/b987dcc0-fad2-48e6-8b10-7a3fbee25d70/embed_map\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Robson rotation weakens the power of the party and encourages individual candidates to run their own campaigns. Even if a party holds one or two \u201csafe\u201d seats in an electorate, those seats are not safe for any individual member \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon for a member of the assembly to lose their seat to a fellow member of their own party and seats are only safe when the sitting MP is a high-profile and popular MP (such as the leader of a party).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/08/australian-territory-to-pay-for-domestic-violence-prevention-with-yearly-levy\">Australian territory to pay for domestic violence prevention with yearly levy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since 1995, the assembly has consisted of 17 members elected to represent three electorates.

Only one election produced a majority for a single party \u2013 for Labor in 2004. In every other assembly, the government had to form an alliance with independents or minor parties to pass legislation and stay in power.</p> <p>Labor has ruled the ACT for a majority of the last 27 years. Both parties formed government at different times in the first ACT legislative assembly, with Labor leading the second assembly elected in 1992. A Liberal minority government served for two terms, from 1995 until 2001.</p> <p>Jon Stanhope led Labor back into power in 2001. He won a second term in 2004, winning the only majority government in ACT political history.</p> <p>Stanhope\u2019s Labor government lost its majority in 2008. The ACT Greens, who had held at least one seat in every assembly since 1995, managed to win four seats and formed an alliance with the Labor government.</p> <p>At the 2012 election, Labor and Liberal both gained seats off the Greens. The major parties each won eight seats, with the Greens\u2019 Shane Rattenbury holding a single seat for his party. The Labor-Greens alliance was renewed, with Rattenbury becoming the first Greens minister in the ACT.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/11/job-cuts-in-act-public-service-would-be-a-broken-promise-says-chief-minister\">Public service job cuts would break promise to the ACT, says chief minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A party will need to win a majority of seats in three out of five electorates to win a majority in the assembly. That will be tough for either Labor or Liberal to achieve. The Greens should retain their single seat and will be hopeful of gaining a handful of other seats. Numerous other minor parties and independents are running but it will be hard for any of them to win a seat.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t possible to predict who will win the election, as there hasn\u2019t been any reliable polling published. It seems most likely that a Labor minority government, probably in alliance with the Greens, will continue after this election but the Liberal party holds hope that, after 15 years of Labor rule, territorians will be looking for change.</p>"
