  "<p>He struggled through the frozen wastes of North America in his Oscar-winning performance in <em>The Revenant</em>. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a different role \u2013 taking his powerful new eco-documentary to the White House, in the hope it can help restart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/03/obama-us-china-have-joined-paris-climate-pact-g20-video\" title=\"\">President Obama\u2019s battle against global warming</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s an issue of importance to both men. Obama, who appears in the documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/26/leonardo-dicaprio-sharon-jones-obama-white-house-south-by-south-lawn-festival-sxsl\" title=\"\"><em>Before the Flood</em></a>, is using the last days of his presidency to make environmental protection a central pillar of his legacy. Last month he created the world\u2019s largest ecologically protected area when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/hawaii-marine-ocean-conservation-papahanaumokuakea\" title=\"\">expanded Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea</a>, a marine reserve in his native Hawaii, to encompass more than half a million square miles. He also gave \u201cmarine national monument\u201d status to 4,913 sq miles off the New England coast.</p> <p>Two years ago, DiCaprio \u2013 who has raised money for protecting tigers, orangutans and elephants \u2013 was designated a UN messenger of peace, with a special focus on climate change.</p> <p>The White House screening of <em>Before the Flood</em>, which follows DiCaprio as he travels to parts of the world including Greenland, the Pacific islands, Sumatra and industrial regions of China, precedes a global release via National Geographic later this month. DiCaprio and the film\u2019s director, Fisher Stevens, hope to use it in the run-up to next month\u2019s US presidential and Senate elections. They plan to show the film on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat\" title=\"\">Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,\u201d Stevens said. The film-makers claim 38 US senators accept money from the energy industry, in effect blocking the passage of environmental legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are not necessarily climate deniers. They\u2019re just in the pockets of the energy industry, even though that\u2019s at the expense of all of us,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cAnd [Republican presidential candidate] Donald Trump has said he\u2019s going to try to kill the Paris accords if elected.\u201d</p> <p>Last month DiCaprio told the audience after the film\u2019s world premiere at the Toronto international film festival: \u201cWe cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.\u201d</p> <p><em>Before the Flood</em>\u2019s release comes as statistics relating to the health of the planet worsen. Last week the Scripps Institution of Oceanography announced it was safe to conclude that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\" title=\"\">global CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a> will not drop below 400 parts per million this year \u2013 \u201cor ever again for the indefinite future\u201d. The figure is seen as the point at which global warming becomes irreversible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/17/arctic-sea-ice-climate-change-britain-must-commit-to-paris-agreement\">The Observer view on global warming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>DiCaprio and Stevens came up with the idea to make the documentary while in the Gal\u00e1pagos islands with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle. \u201cWe were frustrated with our government, and I felt if the media isn\u2019t getting to the population about climate change, maybe Leonardo can,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cSo the message is, it\u2019s up to all of us. It\u2019s a simplistic message but it really is.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the intransigence of US legislators, Obama is using his last months in office to establish his legacy as the most environmentally effective president since Theodore Roosevelt created national parks. In Obama\u2019s reading of the issue, climate change is as much a national security issue as an environmental one.</p> <p>He tells the film-makers: \u201cIn addition to the sadness I\u2019d feel if my kids can never see a glacier the way I did in Alaska, even if you were unsentimental about that, you\u2019ve got to be worried about national security and the capacity of the world order to survive the kinds of strains climate scientists are predicting.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty-one countries, including China and the US, representing about 48% of global emissions, have adopted the Paris accords. Countries representing at least 55% of emissions have to adopt the accords for them to be ratified.</p> <p>The film-makers visit Pope Francis in the Vatican, Obama in Washington, political leaders in the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Kiribati, climate scientists in Greenland and the Indian conservationist Sunita Narain, who explains to DiCaprio that access to energy is as much an issue as climate change for 300 million Indians.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this to you, as an American, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet,\u201d Narain tells DiCaprio. \u201cWe need to put the issue of lifestyle and consumption at the centre of climate negotiations. \u201d</p> <p>DiCaprio responds that it\u2019s difficult to present to Americans the argument that they need to change their lifestyle. \u201cI would also argue that it\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d he says. If the climate crisis is to be solved, it will be because \u201crenewables will become cheaper the more we invest into them, and that will solve the problem\u201d. But Narain shakes her head.</p> <p>The film-makers have enlisteded Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the pair behind the <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, for the soundtrack. They use Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s triptych <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> \u2013 which made a strong impression on the young DiCaprio \u2013 to frame the progress of humankind\u2019s impact on the planet, from innocence to Bosch\u2019s final panel of darkness and ruin.</p> <p>How far off are we now, they wonder? \u201cWhat haunts me is the last panel, with the planet in ruins, charred and blackened skies,\u201d DiCaprio muses. \u201cIf this was a movie we could write our way out of this mess, but real life isn\u2019t a movie and we can\u2019t pretend we know how this is going to end.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cWhat we can do is control what we do next, how we live our lives, what we consume \u2013 and how we vote, to let our leaders know that we know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>One passage of the documentary takes place during the filming of <em>The Revenant,</em> when director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was forced to move production 9,000 miles from a snow-free Canadian location to Argentina in search of a snowy landscape.</p>",
  "<p>This was meant to be <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s year. The British version of the magazine turned 100, resulting in, among other celebratory goings-on, an exhibition at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/vogue/exhibition.php\">Vogue 100: A Century of Style</a>, telling the story of one of the world\u2019s most influential magazines. But a turn of events, and the social media reaction, threw a stiletto at the brand\u2019s well-manicured public appearance and demonstrated very publicly an insurgency that is under way next to the catwalk.</p> <p>During a round-table discussion about Milan fashion week, editors on <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s American edition gave their views on style bloggers, and it was damning. Questioning the street-style business model of wearing paid-for brand placements, they used descriptors like \u201cdesperate\u201d and said it \u201cherald(ed) the death of style\u201d. In response, style blogger Susie Bubble tweeted: \u201cThe fashion establishment don\u2019t want their circles enlarged and for the ivory tower to remain just that. Towering and impenetrable.\u201d</p> <p>The incident highlighted how the ground beneath the establishment\u2019s feet has shifted this season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/24/burberry-reinvent-retail-from-catwalk-to-checkout-see-now-buy-now\">See-now-buy-now</a> and genderless catwalks have reflected economic and social shifts towards a younger mindset, while Bubble\u2019s point about enlarging circles could equally read as a comment on what\u2019s been happening on the front row (the \u201cFrow\u201d) in this summer\u2019s global fashion shows.</p> <p>Traditionally the place where old Hollywood glamour mixed with fashion journalism, the Frow has shifted its allegiances, actively courting a younger and more social media-savvy crowd. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s Milan fashion week show was an extreme example of this. It saw the fashion house fly in a range of millennial celebrities, such as Cameron Dallas, Lily-Rose Depp, Lucky Blue Smith and Rafferty Law, to sit in pride of place. The Frow resembled a particularly large group selfie, where mainstream media journalists were relegated to the second row.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the kitschy, high-energy presentation featured street dancers, model Hailey Baldwin and a pre-show soundtrack of Justin Bieber, pointed attempts to capture not just hearts and minds but the smartphone\u2019s lens too. As the show came to a close, exiting fashionistas, such as Anna Wintour, were met by swarms of pre-pubescent girls screaming not for her but for the heart-throbs they follow on Vine or Instagram. It was Beatlemania for Generation Z.</p> <p>Backstage before the show, Stefano Gabbana admitted that the label was trying to appeal to a younger market. \u201cWe looked at the millennials [for inspiration],\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to be young.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal to fashion labels is clear: a Frow full of social media-savvy celebs creates publicity and generates sales. \u201cVloggers, Viners and Instagram celebs almost exist for endorsements,\u201d says Malcolm Mackenzie, editor of <em>We Love Pop</em> magazine. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a day job, like shooting a movie, to get in the way of self-promotion, because self-promotion <em>is</em> their day job.\u201d</p> <p>But arranging the seating plan of the Frow can be a tricky jigsaw to solve. \u201cMy feeling is that it\u2019s always a balance \u2013 you want heavy-hitter celebrities, but the editors are just as vital with huge followings, too,\u201d says Mandi Lennard, fashion PR and consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance, as you don\u2019t want to make an editor feel neglected.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps editors just need to adapt to the times: 2016 has seen the fashion industry focus on young celebrities who fit the Hailey Baldwin template: heritage names with large social media followings. \u201cStars like Dallas have a direct line to millions of fans who avidly watch everything they do, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for business to want in on the action,\u201d says Mackenzie. Things can only get younger.</p> <h2>MEET THE MILLENNIALS</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88c9cb0dc0f4b3fb6a82b05e8dd7856902921bb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c9cb0dc0f4b3fb6a82b05e8dd7856902921bb0/0_490_1945_853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The front row at Milan fashion week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"439\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front row at Milan fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1 Thylane Blondeau, 15</strong></p> <p>She modelled at a Jean Paul Gaultier show aged four and caused controversy with her appearance in a Vogue Enfants editorial aged 10 that some called sexualised.

  "<p>The singer Katy Perry, a Hillary Clinton supporter, has produced a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSd-3Yc1N3s\" title=\"\">\u201cVoting naked\u201d video</a>, urging people to vote in the US election. Madonna responded with her own \u201cVoting naked\u201d photo on Instagram, showing her bare shoulders, also urging people to back Clinton, saying that women need to support each other. \u201cWomen Run The World now \u2013 they have to get out and start supporting one another. No more misogynist feminists! No more misogony [sic]. Get out and vote,\u201d wrote Madonna, with good intentions, albeit bad spelling.</p> <p>The image was later deleted, along with the one where Madonna had photoshopped Clinton between her legs. (Stay classy, Ms Ciccone!) Both singers\u2019 efforts did the job by causing a media flurry. Were their actions successful in a deeper feminist way? In my view, quite the opposite.</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious what they were trying to do; in fact, Perry says that her whole aim was to be click-bait. In fairness, Perry\u2019s video is ditsy-humorous rather than sexualised. Her breasts and genitals are blanked out with dark, modesty-style strips; her hair is styled as a rat\u2019s nest with lollipops sticking out of it. While it was still up, Madonna\u2019s image merely gave the impression of nudity.</p> <p>They\u2019re not the first to use nudity to raise awareness. (Famously, there was the Peta campaign \u201c<a href=\"http://www.peta.org/videos/id-rather-go-naked-than-wear-fur/\" title=\"\">I\u2019d rather go naked than wear fur</a>\u201d, featuring various supermodels, one of whom, Naomi Campbell, went on to rather let the side down, by, you guessed it, wearing fur.) Moreover, they were doing it for a \u201cgood cause\u201d, not out of a sense of the now-routine monetised, sexualised exhibitionism. (I don\u2019t know about you lot, but, as a heterosexual woman, I\u2019m officially bored with Kim Kardashian\u2019s constant updates on the state of her tits and arse.) Compared with that, it\u2019s pretty cool that Madonna supported Perry supporting Clinton.</p> <p>However, there\u2019s something worrying, something distinctly non-feminist about these \u201cnaked voting\u201d efforts. In that, with the semi-exception of the actor Mark Ruffalo, a fellow Clinton supporter (who\u2019d previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/22/robert-downey-jnr-offers-up-a-naked-mark-ruffalo-to-enocurage-americans-to-vote-video\" title=\"\">jokingly promised to go naked</a> in his next film), there were no prominent males opting for the nudity-equals-attention option.</p> <p>There were no equivalent men running around butt-naked with modesty strips and lollipops stuck in their hair or provocatively leaning their bare shoulders into the camera lens. So why did these incredibly famous, successful women do it?</p> <p>To an extent, where\u2019s the harm? This is an era where revenge porn verges on an epidemic and there have been wretched attempts to shame celebrities with their own stolen explicit images. It\u2019s arguable that by exploiting their own nudity, Madonna and Perry are subverting the global sexualisation of women.</p> <p>The logic here is that there\u2019s a constant scrabble to look at famous women naked, to reduce them and all other women to body parts. Well, these famous women can play this game on their own terms and you\u2019ll listen to their message too.</p> <p>At which point, the argument frays and disintegrates. If a woman feels that the only way she can command attention is by taking her clothes off, then her \u201cmessage\u201d is a scream lost in a&#xa0;hurricane.</p> <p>However good the cause, it doesn\u2019t make up for the core rationale that the quickest, easiest way for a woman to get attention is to disrobe. Men simply don\u2019t feel that they have to behave this way \u2013 they think the quickest, easiest way to get attention is to open their mouths.</p> <p>The fact that both these successful women performed their well-intentioned \u201cethical\u201d striptease on behalf of a female candidate just makes it seem even more skewed and desperate.</p> <p>If, among other things, Clinton is fighting for respect for women beyond their worth (or lack of it) as sexual/post-sexual objects, then I\u2019d wager that the very last thing she needs is for even her supporters to peddle sex.</p> <h2>Foxhunting?

An Ipsos Mori poll says that any attempt to <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2016-09-30/hunting-ban-supported-by-84-of-voters/\" title=\"\">repeal the Hunting Act</a> would be \u201cdeeply unpopular\u201d with 84% of the British public. The poll was commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports, which could hardly claim no bias, but the findings are clear enough. There was also huge opposition to hare coursing (91%) and deer hunting (88%).</p> <p>So by a huge majority, the British public would prefer that the hunting ban stay in place. Who\u2019d have thought it? Well, actually, most people would. Common sense dictates that the only people who oppose the hunting ban are the relatively small number who hunt. Normal people are unlikely to say: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t hunt myself, but I still feel very strongly that they should repeal the law banning the practice of live animals being chased and ripped to pieces by hounds, pursued by horse riders in fancy dress costume.\u201d</p> <p>However much the pro-hunt lobby tries to frame this as an issue of personal freedom, most people are quite rightly repulsed by the idea of animals being made to suffer and die for what is&#xa0;effectively just a niche sporting pursuit. In 2016, the vermin control argument is also becoming silly. There are quite a few urban foxes these days. Should we start insisting that competitive cyclists chase them around the streets, followed by packs of braying hounds? Perhaps skateboarders could join in?</p> <p>Polls such as this make a mockery of environment secretary Andrea Leadsom saying that she intends to take a \u201cfresh look\u201d at the foxhunting ban. Here\u2019s your fresh look, Ms Leadsom \u2013 84% against, and not likely to go down much in the near future.</p> <h2>Sooty and Soo: greatest glove story ever told?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ea8d90bb3d8df94cbd4fb5bc5bdef330e68660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ea8d90bb3d8df94cbd4fb5bc5bdef330e68660/248_730_3891_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Corbett with Sooty, Sweep and Soo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Corbett with Sooty, Sweep and Soo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FremantleMedia Ltd / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Readers of a delicate disposition, please look away now \u2013 there is news of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/13/sooty-bbc-television-harry-corbett\" title=\"\">Sooty</a>-themed sex scandal. In the 1960s, there was a row when Sooty\u2019s creator, the late Harry Corbett, suggested Sooty should have a girlfriend, Soo. Some people, including the show\u2019s producer and a BBC governor, were scandalised, saying it would \u201cintroduce sex into a children\u2019s programme\u201d. The issue generated so much controversy the director general, Hugh Carleton Greene, had to intervene.</p> <p>All of which has been revealed by Corbett\u2019s son and Sooty-heir, Matthew, in the documentary, <em>Sooty Ungloved</em>, which just enjoyed its, ahem, \u201cworld premiere\u201d in Guiseley, West Yorkshire, where the Corbett family lived for 35 years. I\u2019ve yet to see <em>Sooty Ungloved</em>, but I\u2019m imagining a Watergate-vibe, featuring Sweep interviewed with his face in semi-darkness.</p> <p>In the end, the DG ruled Sooty could have Soo, but that the puppets must \u201cnever touch\u201d (what sordid practices was Carleton Greene envisaging?).

First was the news that the conservative editorial board of the Arizona Republic had endorsed Clinton, a groundbreaking moment for a local newspaper that had never chosen a Democrat for president over a Republican since its founding in 1890. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to carry the state, in 1996 \u2013 but polling shows a tight race between Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Moments later, John Warner, a retired Republican senator from Virginia, announced he was also backing Clinton over Trump. The second world war veteran\u2019s support could carry weight within the national security community and military veterans in the vital swing state.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Both endorsements fed into one of Clinton\u2019s core arguments \u2013 that her opponent, in addition to being a divisive figure, was simply unfit to serve as commander-in-chief. <br></p> <p>The following day, Clinton travelled north to another battleground state, arriving in New Hampshire on a blustery autumnal afternoon.<br></p> <p>In the snows of February, she lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, triggering an unexpectedly long and bitter Democratic primary. But the two stood side by side on Wednesday, as she drew upon his star power to galvanize young voters with the promise of a debt-free tuition plan.</p> <p>Her audience, a mixture of students and parents concerned with college affordability, responded with enthusiastic applause.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sanders, who endorsed Clinton in July at a rally also held in New Hampshire, implored those in attendance to understand that the election presented a stark choice.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/554ca\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758870\"            data-video-name=\"Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ec31b7e4b07eb0f44b8316\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928sanders_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928sanders.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928sanders_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-video\">Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am asking you here today not only to vote for Secretary Clinton, but to work hard to get your uncles and your aunts, to get your friends, to vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis election is enormously important for the future of our country.

If in recent weeks Trump\u2019s campaign had sought to soften his image with scripted lines about outreach to African Americans and the rollout of a paid family leave policy, the aftermath of the debate cast a spotlight once more on Trump\u2019s troubled relationship with women.<br></p> <p>In one of the defining moments of the opening debate, Clinton successfully baited the former reality TV star by sharing the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/donald-trump-alicia-machado-clinton-twitter-unhinged\">Alicia Machado</a>, the winner of the 1996 Miss Universe pageant, whose physical appearance Trump later derided with nicknames such as \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d. Thirty-six hours later, Clinton had refocused on policy at a roundtable on student loan debt, while Trump walked into a feud with Machado by again taking shots at her weight.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe reason we\u2019re talking about Alicia Machado today is because Donald Trump insulted her again yesterday,\u201d Palmeri told the press gathered in Durham, New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>As reporters continued to pepper Palmieri with questions, the staffer tasked with escorting the travelling press from point A to B tried several times to wrap up the discussion or risk being left behind by Clinton and her motorcade.

Republicans often criticize Clinton along these lines, but Trump has recently escalated the rhetoric. He called Clinton a \u201cglobalist\u201d and a \u201cvessel for special interests \u2026 who want to strip [the US] of its status as a sovereign nation\u201d and accused her of \u201cmany crimes against our country and against society itself\u201d. </p> <p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to questions about what crimes the nominee meant. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also stirred concerns about voter fraud, returning to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/trump-recruits-election-observers-voter-intimidation-fears\"> unsubstantiated claims</a> of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rigged-election-voter-fraud-intimidation\">\u201crigged election\u201d</a> and \u201ccheating\u201d that he made for several weeks this summer. On Friday, Trump claimed voter fraud \u201cis a big, big problem in this country\u201d and that \u201cnobody has the guts to talk about it\u201d.</p> <p>He then urged attendees at this rally to \u201cgo and watch the polling places and make sure it is on the up and up\u201d, even though an exhaustive investigation in 2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/?tid=a_inl\">found only 31 potential incidents</a> of in-person voter fraud in all US elections over 14 years.</p> <p>The complaints about a \u201crigged\u201d system follow days of negative revelations about the nominee.

We cannot take that risk.\u201d</p> <p>It was joined by USA Today, which issued its first-ever <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/dont-vote-for-donald-trump-editorial-board-editorials-debates/91295020/\">presidential endorsement</a> to write that Trump was \u201cunfit for the presidency\u201d.

But credit to the New York Times for its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/books/hitler-ascent-volker-ullrich.html\">review of a Hitler biography</a> that contains some unnerving points without ever mentioning Donald Trump\u2019s name and is all the more powerful for that (after all, the pigs in Animal Farm are not called Stalin and Trotsky).</p> <p>Highlights include: \u201cHitler was often described as an egomaniac who \u2018only loved himself\u2019 \u2013 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatisation and \u2026 a \u2018characteristic fondness for superlatives\u2019\u201d; \u201cHitler was known, among colleagues, for a \u2018bottomless mendacity\u2019 that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message\u201d; \u201cHitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising \u2018to lead Germany to a new era of national greatness\u2019, though he was typically vague about his actual plans\u201d; \u201cEarly on, revulsion at Hitler\u2019s style and appearance \u2026 led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \u2018evening\u2019s entertainment\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Just coincidence, then, that Barack Obama should make a Hitler reference of his own at a White House ceremony for the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Noting the presence of relatives of Jesse Owens and 17 other African American athletes who competed at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/29/remarks-president-welcoming-2016-usa-olympic-and-paralympic-teams\">the outgoing president said</a>: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Jesse. It was other African American athletes in the middle of Nazi Germany under the gaze of Adolf Hitler that put a lie to notions of racial superiority \u2013 whupped them \u2013 and taught them a thing or two about democracy and taught them a thing or two about the American character.\u201d</p> <p>Trump: come 8 November, beware a whupping.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Spotted on the menu at the new <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/hotel-collection/washington-dc/trump-intl-hotel\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington: \u201cThe Benjamin beer silver bucket, unlimited Amerrica beer.\u201d</p> <p>Make Amerrica great again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gingrichproductions.com/\">Newt Gingrich</a>, former House speaker and Clinton foe, was at the Kennedy Center with his wife, Callista \u2013 a chorister \u2013 to watch Mozart\u2019s opera The Marriage of Figaro last weekend. Asked how his friend Donald Trump\u2019s debate homework was going, and who was playing the role of Clinton in mock debates, Gingrich replied airily: \u201cNo one. He doesn\u2019t need that.\u201d But you can\u2019t rehearse too much, in opera or in life. The night\u2019s performance made a false start when the curtain got stuck due to a technical hitch. As the orchestra trailed off into silence, the hapless conductor turned to the audience and wailed: \u201cThey should be singing now!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4b03dcb8b5a2eae3a91255db0fd3f5428d98ccb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b03dcb8b5a2eae3a91255db0fd3f5428d98ccb/382_41_2254_1352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newt Gingrich replied to a question on who was playing Clinton in mock debates with Trump: \u2018No one.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newt Gingrich replied to a question on who was playing Clinton in mock debates with Trump: \u2018No one.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Marriage of Figaro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/18/opera-confusing-plots-marriage-figaro-andrea-chenier\">features a philandering count</a> with distinctly 18th-century attitudes towards women. Presumably, thrice-married Gingrich gave thrice-married Trump a full report.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Trump is the first candidate in recent memory who doesn\u2019t travel with reporters on his campaign plane. Instead, he employs a second \u201cchase plane\u201d for the media. Time magazine\u2019s Zeke Miller has anointed it First Amendment One, a reference to the US constitutional measure that protects freedom of the press.<br></p> <p>The arrangement enables Trump to continue to enjoy his own private plane, which he flies largely at taxpayer expense since it transports his secret service detail. On at least one occasion, it has kept reporters from making it to a Trump rally in time to hear him start speaking. The Republican nominee used the absence of the reporters, many of whom have been following him for more than a year, as an opportunity to mock them.</p> <p>Not all reporters on \u201cFirst Amendment One\u201d relish the nickname. However, none has yet come up with a catchier one.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The cast of The West Wing was <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/west-wing-cast-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton\">out in force campaigning for Clinton</a> in Ohio last weekend. But not the president himself, Jed Bartlet, aka Martin Sheen. Not because he\u2019s a secret Trump supporter, we trust. That really would be the liberal apocalypse.<br></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Remarkable as it seems, there really is a presidential candidate who knows less about foreign policy than Donald Trump. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, running third in the polls, was asked on TV recently about the crisis in Aleppo, Syria. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\">What is Aleppo?</a>\u201d he asked, sending jaws to the ground. This week, he was at it again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/29/us-presidential-candidate-gary-johnson-has-another-aleppo-moment-video\">Johnson was asked to name his favourite foreign leader</a>. As the candidate fumbled, host Chris Matthews pressed: \u201cYou gotta do this.\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cI guess I\u2019m having an Aleppo moment.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews said: \u201cBut I\u2019m giving you the whole world. Anybody in the world you like. Anybody. Pick any leader.\u201d<br></p> <p>The best Johnson could muster was: \u201cThe former president of Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p> <p>Johnson confessed: \u201cI\u2019m having a brain freeze.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Johnson wrote on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s been almost 24 hours \u2026 and I still can\u2019t come up with a foreign leader I look up to.\u201d</p> <p>At least it\u2019s better than saying Robert Mugabe.

A Clinton campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, told reporters: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>In two rallies in Florida, Clinton blended her attacks on Trump with new policy priorities, proposing at an earlier address in Fort Pierce a new national service reserve program for young Americans that appeared to be an attempt at winning back support among millennial voters.</p> <p>With recent polls showing the Democratic presidential nominee losing the confidence of voters under 30, and more than one in three planning to vote for a third-party candidate, Clinton offered students a pathway to paying down college debt in return for public service.</p> <p>\u201cIf you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country,\u201d Clinton said, touching on themes of civic responsibility and renewing a \u201cculture of service\u201d among Americans of all ages, as well as declaring her intention to massively expand the AmeriCorps volunteer program.</p> <p>\u201cI want to find more ways for more students to get college credit for service,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s lighten that burden.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton, who was introduced in Coral Springs by a middle school civics teacher, also repeated a campaign pledge from earlier in the week, for free college tuition for children in middle-to-low-earning families.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are a family that makes less than $125,000 you will not pay tuition to go to public college,\u201d Clinton said, to cheers from a crowd of 2,400 inside a small municipal gymnasium. \u201cA college degree should not lead to being mired in debt.\u201d</p> <p>Students at the rally praised the new proposals. Emily Beth, 24, and Stav Berlin, 23, studying education management together at Palm Beach State College, said they were worried about taking on debt to finance their master\u2019s degree studies in two years\u2019 time, once their current course ends.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea,\u201d Berlin said. \u201cInstead of paying back big corporations the money, we can pay it back by giving back to the community, rather than the Sallie Maes of the world that take and take and take.\u201d</p> <p>Beth, who will be voting in her second presidential election, said she liked that the volunteer work she already does tutoring children through the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach could help pay off her college loans.</p> <p>\u201cThis country is drowning is student debt,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea because the paying back is in the form of community service that\u2019s positively going to impact our entire country.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be here in Florida so much you\u2019ll get sick of me</p> <footer> <cite>Hillary Clinton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another student, Mia Ulrich, 18, of Pompano Beach, said she hoped to study anthropology at Florida International University in Miami, but admitted: \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about how I\u2019m going to pay for school. I like the community service aspect because then I\u2019ve given back in an active way, not only to get what I need.\u201d</p> <p>In a part of her speech that resonated with the audience, Clinton demanded answers from Iran over the fate of Bob Levinson, 68, a Coral Springs resident, former FBI agent and private investigator who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/cia-robert-levinson-iran-analysts-co-operation\">disappeared in 2007</a>.</p> <p>The Levinson family believes he is being held hostage by or with the knowledge of the Iranian government. </p> <p>\u201cMy heart goes out to Bob\u2019s family,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Iran\u2019s regime to provide information about his whereabouts.\u201d</p> <p>She also mentioned the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/25/jose-fernandez-miami-marlins-pitcher-killed-baseball\">Miami Marlins pitcher Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez</a>, a popular Cuban-born baseball star who was killed in a boating accident last weekend.

But this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times.\u201d</p> <p>The paper \u2013 like most \u2013 acknowledged that Clinton has serious flaws: a lack of transparency, bad judgment in using a private email server, 275 days without a press conference. But those reservations, the editorial board wrote, \u201cpale in comparison to our fears about Trump\u201d.</p> <p>The Republican has cozied up to white supremacist groups, the paper wrote, perpetrated the lie that Obama was not born in the US, praised the country\u2019s enemies while insulting a sitting president, a Gold Star family and a former prisoner of war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f73e78b1f893f6a4a41cb17dd871dab898cca1ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f73e78b1f893f6a4a41cb17dd871dab898cca1ab/0_395_5227_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cincinnati Enquirer says its reservations about Clinton \u2018pale in comparison to our fears about Trump\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"591\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cincinnati Enquirer says its reservations about Clinton \u2018pale in comparison to our fears about Trump\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOf late, Trump has toned down his divisive rhetoric, sticking to carefully constructed scripts and teleprompters,\u201d the Enquirer wrote. \u201cBut going two weeks without saying something misogynistic, racist or xenophobic is hardly a qualification for the most important job in the world.</p> <p>And then there are those publications whose editorial boards could not bring themselves to endorse either Trump or Clinton, no matter how hard they held their noses.</p> <p>At least a half dozen threw their reputations behind Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate who, in various interviews, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/gary-johnson-cant-name-foreign-leader-aleppo-moment\">could not name a foreign leader</a> and did not know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\">what Aleppo is</a>. </p> <p>Among them is the always iconoclastic <a href=\"http://www.unionleader.com/editorials/an-editorial----joseph-w-mcquaid-publisher-a-better-choice-for-president-no-need-to-hold-your-nose--20160914\">New Hampshire Union Leader</a>.

  "<p>The recession in Nigeria, <a href=\"http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/207294-nigeria-technically-recession-finance-minister.html\">announced in July</a> by finance minister Kemi Adeosun and confirmed when the National Bureau of Statistics subsequently published figures showing a <a href=\"https://www.channelstv.com/2016/08/31/nigerias-gdp-contracts-2-06-second-quarter/\">2.06% dip</a> in economic growth, is indicative of the country\u2019s vulnerability to the vagaries of oil.</p> <p>When oil prices started to tumble in mid-2014, the government \u2013 its sights set on the following year\u2019s elections \u2013 did not take steps to mitigate the economic impact. By early 2015, Brent crude oil was <a href=\"http://www.investing.com/commodities/brent-oil\">trading at $53 (\u00a341) a barrel</a> and growth was slipping fast. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/01/economic-growth-failing-to-deliver-prosperity-for-many-africans-study-says\">Economic growth failing to deliver prosperity for many Africans, study says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The situation was compounded when Muhammadu Buhari, who won the presidential race after campaigning on the delivery of a robust economy, failed to act with the required speed. The early stages of his administration were fraught with delay in <a href=\"http://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/why-we-delayed-appointment-of-ministers-buhari/\">appointing ministers</a>, stagnating public contracts and an inconsistent approach to the exchange rate that worsened the crisis, tipping the economy into recession.</p> <p>The Nigerian government has sought solutions, but the recession has been further compounded by <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/nigerias-inflation-rate-hits-17-6-august-nbs/\">rising inflation</a> that hit 17.6% in August. The inflationary spiral was triggered by the high cost of energy prices following the removal of state subsidies, combined with an alarmingly swift depreciation in local currency. Nigeria\u2019s currency has lost 114% of its value in a year and there are signs that this trend might continue, raising local prices in a nation dependent on imports.<br></p> <p>The government is considering <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/nigeria-raise-1-billion-eurobond-market/\">raising $1bn in the eurobond market</a>. However, the challenge lies in the cost of borrowing after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-16/s-p-downgrades-nigeria-further-into-junk-as-oil-crisis-worsens\">downgraded Nigeria\u2019s credit rating</a> from B+ to B, five steps below investment grade.<br></p> <p>Another possibility being mooted by the government, as it looks to shore up its<a href=\"https://www.cbn.gov.ng/intops/Reserve.asp\"> foreign reserves to $24.7bn</a> and boost foreign exchange liquidity to forestall the depreciation of the naira, is the sale of its national assets. The Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man, recently <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/sell-off-nlng-invest-proceed-well-recession-dangote-tells-buhari/\">proffered this solution</a>, and the senate president, governors and central bank have all indicated agreement. The tone taken by the government is that state assets \u2013 including government shares in oil joint ventures, the Africa Finance Corporation, the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company and major airports \u2013 will be sold to shore up its foreign exchange base.</p> <p>Nigeria has benefited from the good fortune of NLNG, the largest tax-paying entity in west Africa, which has turned over <a href=\"http://www.nlng.com/NIGNLNG/News.aspx?ID=21\">$33bn to the government </a>in the past 16 years. However, the country has persistently underfunded its share in joint ventures with international oil companies. As of May 2016, the annual funding gap stood at <a href=\"http://nnpcgroup.com/Portals/0/Monthly%20Financial%20and%20Operations%20Data/Full%20Reports/NNPC%20Monthly%20Financial%20&amp;%20Operations%20Report%20for%20the%20Month%20of%20May%202016.pdf\">roughly $4.28bn</a>. While the sale of Nigeria\u2019s share in the joint ventures is a positive step, there has to be deeper interrogation of selling NLNG, which has been <a href=\"http://www.nlng.com/NIGNLNG/News.aspx?ID=21\">valued at $16bn</a> and is expected to return at least $8bn to the Nigerian government.<br></p> <p>There is the option of joining the International Monetary Fund programme, but the government \u2013 perhaps scarred by the memory of the punitive cuts to public efficiency that accompanied structural adjustment programmes in the 1980s \u2013 appears uninterested. </p> <p>While the country is mulling over the sale of national assets, it has still not resolved the problems that are hampering the private sector. The Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s rate-setting committee <a href=\"http://www.nta.ng/news/investment/20160921-economy-cbn-maintains-14-interest-rate/\">maintained baseline interest rates at 14%</a>, triggering commercial lending rates of up to 28%. Subsequently, <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/cbn-disagrees-adeosun-refuses-cut-interest-rate/\">the finance ministry supported a drop in interest rates</a> to catalyse economic activity, contradicting the CBN and highlighting a lack of harmony on monetary and fiscal policy that \u2013 at a time when <a href=\"http://www.signalng.com/nigerias-debt-rises-n4-17-trillion-one-year-buhari/\">national debt has risen by 4.71tn naira inside a year</a> \u2013 is likely to compound the uncertain nature of the government\u2019s policy response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afea802ddf9b2be816cc6ad7002944a937d2fd5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afea802ddf9b2be816cc6ad7002944a937d2fd5e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Motorcycles wait for fuel at the petrol station in the Nigerian capital Abuja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motorcycles await fuel at a petrol station in Abuja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, Nigeria might have to put its assets up for sale, but analysts will remain concerned that it is a short-term fix for a country that needs new engines of growth for its exports. Is it not too hasty to sell national assets built up over years, such as NLNG, in response to a recession that has spanned just two quarters? In a distressed energy market \u2013 and with the outlook bleak for intensive energy markets \u2013 will these assets be sold at the right value? </p> <p>As lead partner of <a href=\"http://yourbudgit.com/\">BudgIT</a>, an organisation that promotes transparent public resources, I am worried about the process and particularly concerned that national assets might be sold to cronies who will seek government bailouts to put them in shape. The sale of power plants in Nigeria, which triggered <a href=\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/03/16/cbn-to-resume-payment-of-n213bn-power-intervention-fund-2/\">a round of bailout funds</a> by the central bank, is an obvious example of the potential pitfalls.<br></p> <p>Nigeria might seem to be on track with diversification, but the political risks posed by the 2019 election are obvious. Even if the reserves get a boost, good plans can be undone by a change of government. For Nigeria to continue selling public assets as a short-term fix to a structural problem seems deeply introspective. The bleeding might be delayed but, if the portfolio of national exports is not expanded beyond oil, it will be back to the drawing board. National assets should only be sold as part of a long-term plan that is strictly followed through.</p>",
