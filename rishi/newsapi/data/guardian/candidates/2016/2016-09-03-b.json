  "<p>Theresa May has insisted in her first major interview since taking office that there will be no snap general election before 2020. The prime minister told <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> the country needed a period of stability after the shockwaves of the pro-Brexit vote, and that the UK should be prepared for \u201cdifficult times\u201d ahead, despite better-than-expected economic indicators.</p> <p>Pressed on whether she was tempted to call a snap election, with polls showing she could increase her majority of just 17 to 130 seats, May said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be calling a snap election. I\u2019ve been very clear that I think we need that period of time, that stability, to be able to deal with the issues that the country is facing and have that election in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011</a>, there is a statutory five-year gap between elections, unless two-thirds of the Commons agree, or there is a motion of no confidence in the government. Any other circumstances would require a change in the law.</p> <p>Discussing her plans for securing the best Brexit deal possible for the UK, the prime minister insisted controls on the movement of people from the EU to Britain needed to be imposed as part of a deal with Brussels. Brexit secretary David Davis will make a statement to the Commons this week on the government\u2019s emerging position on the terms of withdrawal and what kind of relationship the UK wants with the EU, May said.</p> <p>Her decision not to call an early election eases the immediate pressure on Labour, but leadership contender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\" title=\"\">Owen Smith</a> has warned that his party faces a \u201cdecade of doom\u201d under successive Tory governments if Jeremy Corbyn is re-elected leader. Smith supporters claim that the leadership contest could still be far closer than polls have suggested.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0da84b56dbe0168f41eefc32fae188edbf71fd2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da84b56dbe0168f41eefc32fae188edbf71fd2d/0_190_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Smith addresses a campaign rally in Hammersmith, London, last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/LNP/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing in the <em>Observer </em>before a major speech on Sunday, Smith says that, under Corbyn, the party has never been further from power and will be staring at \u201celectoral oblivion\u201d if Corbyn is chosen for a second time on 24 September.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s supporters are confident that the Labour leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/23/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-more-double-support-owen-smith\" title=\"\">is heading for a thumping win </a>and another huge mandate in the contest, and say that polling suggests he is trouncing Smith among the more than 600,000 members who are eligible to vote.</p> <p>But the anti-Corbyn Saving Labour campaign, which says it has conducted detailed investigations into polling statistics and voting intentions, claims that the reality is that the contest is on a \u201cknife edge\u201d.</p> <p>Former Labour MP Reg Race, who is working for <a href=\"https://www.savinglabour.com/\" title=\"\">Saving Labour</a>, says he is deeply sceptical of polling figures suggesting that trade union affiliates will vote for Corbyn by 62% to 38%, while those who have paid \u00a325 to become registered supporters will do so by 74% to 26%. He says Saving Labour recruited 120,000 new anti-Corbyn members who have not been picked up by pollsters. \u201cThe reality is that this is too close to call,\u201d Race said.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s camp also claim their man can still win if they can convince enough people that Labour has no hope of winning under Corbyn. In his article, the former shadow minister for work and pensions paints Corbyn as irresponsible for surrounding himself only with \u201cpeople who agree with him\u201d and for \u201cdefining himself against his own party instead of the Tories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cKnowingly marching off to electoral irrelevance is a gross betrayal of the people all Labour members and supporters \u2013 new and longstanding \u2013 came into politics to help,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf we give up on winning the next election, or falsely claim to be on course to win, we are willing accomplices for every Tory cut.\u201d</p> <p>on Monday, the Labour leadership will try to rally the disunited parliamentary party behind opposition to Conservative plans to cut corporation tax and capital gains tax when MPs return to the Commons from the summer break to debate the finance bill.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s opposition to the tax cuts will be led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/labour-shadow-cabinet-resignations-jeremy-corbyn-who-has-gone\" title=\"\">the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rebecca Long-Bailey, </a>who said that the debate was an opportunity for the party to stand four-square behind the leader.</p> <p>Long-Bailey said: \u201cThe government wants to reduce corporation tax to 17% by 2020. If we thought these cuts would benefit business and would increase investment, we would be fully behind them. But there is no evidence for that.\u201d</p> <p>She said Labour\u2019s emphasis was not on tax cutting but investment, adding that she was confident that if Corbyn won, the party would quickly reunite.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just a matter of time before everyone falls into line. There will be a lot of discussions between disgruntled MPs. There need to be discussions and negotiations, and I think they will take place.\u201d</p> <p>Privately, however, critics of Corbyn say that if they do not succeed in removing him in the current contest, they will attempt to trigger another contest some time next year.</p>",
  "<p>In the picturesque hamlet of Brachay, in scorching late summer heat, Marine Le Pen was preaching to the politically converted. \u201c<em>Marine, pr\u00e9sident</em>\u201d, they chanted. \u201c<em>On va gagner</em>\u201d (we\u2019re going to win). A banner stretching the length of one of the stone buildings overlooking the village square read: \u201cMarine: Save&#xa0;France.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen\u2019s stump speech was the most closely watched and significant campaign launch of <em>la rentr\u00e9e</em>, the national return to work after the long summer holidays, and the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National was welcomed like a conquering hero.</p> <p>Le Pen has been largely absent from the political scene for several weeks and has refrained from adding her 10 cents\u2019 worth to the raging polemic over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/the-burkini-ban-what-it-really-means-when-we-criminalise-clothes\" title=\"\">burkini</a> and rows about security following deadly attacks by Islamic fundamentalists, both fertile ground for her party.</p> <p>In the meantime, the country\u2019s governing Socialists and centre-right opposition Les R\u00e9publicains have engaged in what one FN heavyweight described with schadenfreude as a \u201cbloodbath, left and right\u201d.</p> <p>The Parti Socialiste is bitterly split and in turmoil over whether Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, with his calamitous popularity ratings will, or indeed should, stand for a second term. The alternative, to stand down, would be unprecedented for a serving leader. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the finance minister who resigned last week, might be the rabbit that the party pulls out of the hat, but he is disliked by the PS\u2019s leftwing, which is fielding its own candidates. In any case, Macron has not said whether he will even throw his hat into the presidential ring.</p> <p>On the right, things are scarcely more harmonious. The deadline for Les R\u00e9publicains candidates is Friday, and already former president Nicolas Sarkozy, mayor of Bordeaux Alain Jupp\u00e9 and former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon have either announced they are standing or are expected to do&#xa0;so.</p> <p>Amid this political free-for-all, Le Pen is trying to throw off the party\u2019s divisive reputation and market herself as a politician above and beyond the fray of the same-old-same-old French elite: a new, unifying, patriotic force who will break the shackles of Europe, end \u201cmass immigration\u201d and give France back to the French. Her slogan is <em>La France apais\u00e9e</em> \u2013 a soothed France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d76a4ad832a38d58e63950a0dc85399f8bfdc6f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76a4ad832a38d58e63950a0dc85399f8bfdc6f3/90_0_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman in burkini and two friends in bikinis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le Pen kept out of the controversy over banning burkinis on French beaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was, she said grandly from a hastily constructed stage in Brachay\u2019s main square, speaking for \u201ca forgotten France, a France abandoned by the self-appointed elite who either don\u2019t see it or view it with a kind of condescension\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey describe places like Brachay as <em>la France profonde</em> [deepest France]. I prefer to think of it as deeply patriotic France,\u201d she said to more cheers.</p> <p>\u201cThe presidential campaign that is opening is unlike any other. The coming eight months will decide the fate of our nation, not just for the five years to come, but much longer. Maybe even for ever.\u201d</p> <p>Brachay mayor G\u00e9rard Marchand had likened Le Pen\u2019s appeal for his villagers \u2013 all 61 of them \u2013 to the popularity of the Beatles and there was a similar element of hero worship.</p> <p>Even by the standards of rural France, Brachay is a backwater. The road to the pretty hamlet, 200 miles south-east of Paris in the newly created Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region \u2013 renamed the Grand Est \u2013 a few kilometres from Colombey-les-deux-Eglises, where General Charles de Gaulle is buried, winds through gently rolling farmland for as far as the eye can see. Brachayens, as they call themselves, boosted by party supporters, some of whom had been bussed in, cheered and clapped wildly and waved the tricolor as Le Pen spoke and they jostled bad-temperedly with the media. Her speech was punctuated by cries of \u201cit\u2019s true\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s why we need you\u201d. Reporters on the other hand, seen as being party to a political elite hostile to the FN, were branded <em>collabos</em> (collaborators).</p> <p>One exchange between FN supporters and the <em>Observer</em> set the tone: \u201cWhat are you writing, is that Arabic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, shorthand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like Arabic. Anyway, all journalists write lies and propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen said she was happy to be among rural French people with real concerns in the real France, far from the salons and sophistication, what Le Pen calls the \u201cbrouhaha\u201d of Paris.</p> <p>These are people, the FN leader refers to almost poetically, as \u201cthe forgotten French\u201d. They may not remember the last time, if ever, they saw a migrant in their midst and nobody has ever turned up in Brachay wearing a burkini. The European Agricultural Fund for rural development allocated \u20ac202m for the period 2014-2020 to the region. But Le Pen pledges to wrest sovereignty back from Europe, like the \u201ccourageous British who, despite dire warnings, chose their destiny\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a49165287a369473e2240e4da7552f950f22f18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a49165287a369473e2240e4da7552f950f22f18d/0_218_4560_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Front National supporters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the first sentence of the French National anthem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Front National supporters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the first sentence of the French National anthem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Nascimbeni/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brachay may be small, but it perfectly encapsulates the FN\u2019s target audience and has become a totem in the party\u2019s campaign. In the first round of the last presidential election in 2012, Le Pen won her highest score, 72% of the votes \u2013 31 out of the 43 votes cast. Back then, the PS and the UMP, predecessor of Les R\u00e9publicains, failed to get a single Brachay vote.</p> <p>Marchand admitted there was very little crime in his village, and no foreigners, but there were cases of severe poverty \u201cmostly among those who work and who earn less than those who don\u2019t and get benefits\u201d, he said.</p> <p>If locals were angry with the press, it was because journalists had \u201ccome here, taken pictures of them washing their socks in the sink\u201d and assumed they were all know-nothing country bumpkins, he explained.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest Le Pen could win 28-29% in the first round of the presidential election next year. It seems likely that, unless the PS can come up with a stronger candidate than Hollande, who is scraping the bottom of the popularity barrel, Le Pen will be up against a centre-right opposition candidate, most likely Jupp\u00e9 or Sarkozy in the second round.</p> <p>That Le Pen will be there seems hardly to be in doubt. All of the last 38 opinion polls carried out in France suggest she will be in the second round.</p> <p>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, director of the opinion pollsters Ifop, said Le Pen\u2019s discretion after the summer terrorist attacks in Nice and near Rouen had played well with the public.</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t needed to speak out because the news, from Brexit to the attacks and on to the row over the burkini \u2026 have worked in her favour. There was no point in her spoiling this momentum with even tougher proposals,\u201d Fourquet told <em>Les Echos</em> last week.</p> <p>In Brachay, like many other communities in <em>la France profonde</em>, Le Pen has already said more than enough to gain their unwavering support.</p>",

When I was growing up in the US in the 60s, our family, like so many, all sat down to watch the NBC news, the evening news with Walter Cronkite or the ABC news. They all aired the news at the same time and seemed to have assumed a responsibility to offer a balanced report on US and world events.</p> <p>With the advent of cable TV, there was an alternative to watching the news and the dumbing down of the American population began.

Its history since independence cannot be characterised as one long series of \u201cmultiple uprisings between peasants and a landed elite\u201d. \u201cSuccessive Colombian governments\u201d have not \u201cresorted to ruthless extirpation and repression\u201d against Farc. Starting with President Turbay, 1978-1982, followed by Presidents Betancur, Barco, Gaviria, Samper, Pastrana and including Uribe, all have in their different ways and degrees attempted peace accords with guerrillas, and sometimes with success, though not hitherto with Farc, which for long regarded peace talks as merely a tactic in their famous \u201ccombination of all forms of struggle\u201d.</p> <p>Not one of these presidents can be characterised as a hard-line right winger countenancing paramilitary death squads. Many army officers who did countenance them have been jailed. These governments have also had to fight Farc and the ELN, whose popular support has always been limited. That for a long time they did so ineffectually, with inadequate means, in part explains the rise of paramilitarism.</p> <p>Since the Pastrana government, 1998-2002, the US has provided effective military aid, which, to my mind, Colombia has every right to expect, and has supported the Havana peace talks consistently and discretely. As for Cuba, it is not in the Che Guevara berets that the feathers should be stuck \u2013 the compliments should go to the more sober analysts Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro, who long ago ended their support for the Colombian guerrillas.</p> <p>You are too kind to Farc in other matters. Their ideologists have not been dreamers of democracy in any usual sense of that term and it is pussyfooting to refer to \u201callegations of narco-trafficking and the use of minors in combat\u201d.

But after 20 years of investigating the couple, Bossie has once again been summoned to help bring down his old foe, Hillary Clinton, this time from the perch of a presidential campaign with no apparent limits.</p> <p>Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he hired Bossie as a deputy campaign manager during an<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-enlists-veteran-operative-david-bossie-as-deputy-campaign-manager/\"> interview with the Washington Post</a>.

On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has vowed to overturn the decision and push for limits on the amount of money corporations and unions can spend on campaigns.</p> <p>The case, Citizens United v the Federal Election Commission, stemmed from a decision by the FEC to block the conservative advocacy group, from publishing an unfavorable documentary about Hillary Clinton in early 2008, when she was locked in a tough primary battle with Barack Obama. </p> <p>The supreme court case was only one iteration of a deeply antagonistic relationship between Hillary Clinton and Citizens United that dates to before her husband was president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/11/13/a-firefighters-blazing-trail/b9beb874-fd7b-4dfe-b285-ffcd385501a2/?postshare=6751472783643926&amp;tid=ss_tw\">A 1997 Washington Post profile</a> of Bossie traces his first turn on the national stage to 1992, when a CBS documentary identified him as one of two men who had been harassing the parents and friends of a young woman who had killed herself some years before. The men were reportedly trying to confirm that the woman had killed herself after becoming pregnant by her law professor, Bill Clinton.</p> <p>During Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, Bossie, a college drop-out and volunteer firefighter, began to develop a reputation as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Slick-Willie-America-Cannot-Clinton/dp/0963439707/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0963439707&amp;linkCode=w50&amp;tag=thedailybeast-autotag-20&amp;imprToken=hKkmAr8rZivpkToxCL5GUQ&amp;slotNum=0\">bloodhound</a>\u201d and a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/10/weekinreview/may-3-9-a-top-aide-resigns.html?src=pm\">dogged anti-Clinton sleuth</a>\u201d. After Clinton was elected, Bossie joined Citizens United as a researcher, which eventually led him to the early discovery of what became the Whitewater real estate scandal. </p> <p>Bossie became a staffer on the Senate\u2019s special committee on Whitewater and he was later promoted by the speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, to chief investigator for the House\u2019s government reform and oversight committee. He was pushed to resign in 1998 amid criticism of his overzealous tactics. </p> <p>In the profile, published one year before his resignation, the Post compared Bossie to Roy Cohn, the bare-knuckled right-hand man for Senator Joe McCarthy who mentored Donald Trump. </p> <p>Before joining Trump\u2019s campaign, Bossie served as president of Citizens United and head of the Super Pac Defeat Crooked Hillary. He has taken a leave of absence from both organizations while he serves on Trump\u2019s campaign. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-trump-campaign-ceo\">Steve Bannon, Trump campaign CEO, faced domestic violence charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bossie is among a slate of recent top-level hires that include Stephen Bannon, the former head of the conspiracy theory-laden website, Breitbart News, where <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/author/david-bossie/\">Bossie has occasionally been published</a>, and Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster and strategist. </p> <p>The triumvirate of new hires are close allies of shadowy hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer.

But the ACA relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that is dwindling.</p> <p>Under the ACA, health insurance marketplaces, also called health exchanges, were set up to facilitate the purchase of health insurance in each state. Customers are free to choose from a set of standardized healthcare plans from participating insurers, and those policies are eligible for federal subsidies.</p> <p>But insurers have been fleeing the exchanges, arguing that they are loss makers and the types of people attracted to them make the risks too great for the insurers  to provide affordable (and profitable) policies.</p> <p>David Howard, an associate professor at Emory University\u2019s department of health policy and management, said the ACA included provisions to keep the marketplaces stable, but some of those were watered down in the push to get the deal through Congress, and in other cases the provisions have not been enacted in the way people expected. \u201cSo that means the exchanges are potentially on the cusp of falling apart,\u201d Howard said. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover\">The perils of turning 26: when US millennials lose their parents' healthcare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marketplaces are unstable in part because they are new, and all the parties involved \u2013 from insurers to those who need insurance \u2013 are trying to figure out where they fit into the equation.

Amid fierce Republican criticism of the Democratic presidential candidate, the party\u2019s nominee, Donald Trump released a statement which said \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief\u201d and added that he did not \u201cunderstand how she was able to get away from prosecution\u201d. </p> <p>The FBI documents describe how Monica Hanley, a former Clinton aide, received assistance in spring 2013 from Justin Cooper, a former aide to Bill Clinton, in creating an archive of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Cooper provided Hanley with an Apple MacBook laptop from the Clinton Foundation \u2013 the family organisation currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/26/election-2016-clinton-foundation-trump-campaign-live\">embroiled in controversy</a> \u2013 and talked her through the process of transferring emails from Clinton\u2019s private server to the laptop and a thumb drive.<br></p> <p>\u201cHanley completed this task from her personal residence,\u201d the notes record. The devices were intended to be stored at Clinton\u2019s homes in New York and Washington. However, Hanley \u201cforgot\u201d to provide the archive laptop and thumb drive to Clinton\u2019s staff.</p> <p>In early 2014, Hanley located the laptop at her home and tried to transfer the email archive to an IT company, apparently without success. It appears the emails were then transferred to an unnamed person\u2019s personal Gmail account and there were problems around Apple software not being compatible with that of Microsoft.</p> <p>The unnamed person \u201ctold the FBI that, after the transfer was complete, he deleted the emails from the archive laptop but did not wipe the laptop. The laptop was then put in the mail, only to go missing.

She did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not have been on an unclassified system. She also stated she received no particular guidance as to how she should use the president\u2019s email address.</p> <p>In addition, the notes say: \u201cClinton could not recall when she first received her security clearance and if she carried it with her to state via reciprocity from her time in the Senate. Clinton could not recall any briefing or training by state related to the retention of federal records or handling of classified information.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was aware she was an original classification authority at the state department, but again \u201ccould not recall how often she used this authority or any training or guidance provided by state. Clinton could not give an example of how classification of a document was determined.\u201d</p> <p>Nor could she recall any specific briefing on how to handle information associated with special access programme information. </p> <p>\u201cClinton could not recall a specific process for nominating a target for a drone strike,\u201d the notes say.</p> <p>According to the notes, on 23 January 2009 Clinton emailed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/04/colin-powell-condoleezza-rice-private-email-accounts-classified-hillary-clinton\">her predecessor, Colin Powell,</a> to ask about his use of a BlackBerry. In his response, Powell told Clinton that if it became \u201cpublic\u201d that she was using a BlackBerry to \u201cdo business\u201d, the emails could become \u201cofficial records[s] and subject to the law\u201d.<br></p> <p>Powell wrote: \u201cBe very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton told the FBI she understood Powell\u2019s comments to mean that any of her work-related communications would be records of the government and \u201cdid not factor\u201d the comments \u201cinto her decision to use a personal email account\u201d, the documents say.</p> <p>The release also includes technical details about how the server in the basement of Clinton\u2019s home in Chappaqua, New York, was set up. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s critics seized on the latest revelations. Trump\u2019s full statement read: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief. I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don\u2019t understand how she was able to get away from prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to Trump, said: \u201cHillary Clinton is applying for a job that begins each day with a top secret intelligence briefing, and the notes from her FBI interview reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty.<br></p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s secret email server was an end run around government transparency laws that wound up jeopardizing our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/hillary-clinton-wellesley-college-freshmen-women\">Where Hillary called home: Wellesley\u2019s 2020 class on its most famous alumnus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cClinton\u2019s reckless conduct and dishonest attempts to avoid accountability show she cannot be trusted with the presidency and its chief obligation as commander-in-chief of the US armed forces.\u201d </p> <p>The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said: \u201cThese documents demonstrate Hillary Clinton\u2019s reckless and downright dangerous handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state. They also cast further doubt on the justice department\u2019s decision to avoid prosecuting what is a clear violation of the law. This is exactly why I have called for her to be denied access to classified information.\u201d</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe FBI\u2019s summary of their interview with Hillary Clinton is a devastating indictment of her judgment, honesty and basic competency. Clinton\u2019s answers either show she is completely incompetent or blatantly lied to the FBI or the public. </p> <p>\u201cEither way it\u2019s clear that, through her own actions, she has disqualified herself from the presidency.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign insisted that it was pleased the notes had been made public. Spokesman Brian Fallon said: \u201cWhile her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the justice department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m standing on the edge of a one-horse town in the middle of nowhere, blinded by the mid-morning sun. Nothing to the left of me, nothing to the right. Just heat and dust.

He apologises; he doesn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just that he values his privacy, and this town 150km from Madrid is where Clegg\u2019s wife, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/miriam-gonzalez-durantez\">Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez</a>, grew up, and where they come every summer with their three boys to stay with her mother. A sanctuary.</p> <p>He takes me on a brief tour. From the bridge, we can see sugar beet fields in the distance; here is the only hotel, there the town hall. Here is the church where he and Miriam got married, there the bust of his father-in-law, the first democratically elected mayor of Olmedo (though he was also in office under Franco). We continue walking. I wonder if we are heading towards the family home, but we end up at a cafe. Clegg orders two milky coffees in Spanish. \u201cYou\u2019re not hungry, are you?\u201d he asks. But it\u2019s more a statement than a question.</p> <p>Few have experienced the extremes of political fortune quite like Nick Clegg. In 2010, there was no politician in the land as popular as the then leader of the Liberal Democrats. He appeared so much fresher than David Cameron and Gordon Brown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/15/leaders-debate-nick-clegg-tv\">in the televised election debates</a>. He answered directly, remembered the names of people who asked questions, and promised change. He represented the radical centre that, given half a chance, would introduce proportional representation, elect the House of Lords, save the planet. The young loved him, not least because of one crucial pledge: the Lib Dems would not increase university tuition fees. Five years before Corbynism, there was Cleggmania, and it was just as giddy.</p> <p>Perhaps it was easy for Clegg to make his promises: after all, the Lib Dems were never held accountable because they never won general elections. Only, this time, they grabbed 57 seats and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition\">formed Britain\u2019s first coalition government</a> since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_war_ministry\">Churchill\u2019s war ministry</a> in the 1940s. Cameron was more than willing to work with the Lib Dems \u2013 he was desperate to: Clegg gave him the numbers and provided likability. But six years is an eternity in politics. The deputy prime minister became better known as Calamity Clegg, Cameron\u2019s puppet, the ultimate political Judas.</p> <p>Clegg has just written a political memoir, baldly called <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/politics-419192.html\">Politics</a>. We are spoilt for choice when it comes to personal nadir: there\u2019s the 2014 poll that reveals <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/10867964/Nick-Clegg-voted-least-popular-party-leader-in-modern-British-history.html\">he is the least popular leader in modern British history</a>; the occasion when his security guards told him to lie flat in his car to hide from protesters; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015\">the 2015 election</a>, when the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their seats; and, my personal favourite, his then nine-year-old son Alberto walking around the supermarket singing the spoof song I\u2019m Sorry, based on the apology his father issued after the coalition tripled tuition fees.</p> <p>How did Alberto come to be singing it in a supermarket? \u201cI can\u2019t remember! This is\u2026 four years ago! It\u2019s a very catchy tune.\u201d Clegg laughs through gritted teeth. Remind me how the song goes, I say. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sing the bloody song. We were in quite a crowded supermarket in Putney, and he just started singing it. I quickly gave him some sweets and he stopped \u2013 they weren\u2019t gobstoppers, but they had the same effect.\u201d</p> <p>Was Alberto the only one of his three boys who sang it? \u201cI don\u2019t quite know what the relevance of this is.\u201d His voice rises. Well, I say, it\u2019s in your book. \u201cHave the other kids ever sung it? Yes, of course.\u201d Has Miriam? Now his voice rises to an incredulous squeak. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Simon!\u201d Well, I say, if ever a song was written taking the piss out of me, I\u2019m sure my whole family would sing it loud and proud. He relaxes. \u201cExactly! <em>Exaaaactly</em>! So they all sang it. Whether Miriam sang it as well\u2026 I\u2019m sure she hummed along.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m bristling because there was a lot of piss-taking, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not wrong there.

Perhaps he was a moderating influence on the Tories, after all. Perhaps we didn\u2019t give him the credit he deserved. That\u2019s what he claims in his book, at any rate. An examination of the nature of coalition and liberalism, it is also a rage against the populism of the Brexiteers and Corbyn and, more than anything, a defence of his five years holding Cameron\u2019s hand \u2013 and occasionally slapping it.</p> <p>Why write it? \u201cThe turbulence in politics right now is so great, and accelerating at such a pace, that I wanted to have a stab at understanding what\u2019s going on. And, crucially, given that liberalism is on the defensive everywhere, it\u2019s: how can you get back in the ring?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just don't understand what this whole Corbyn thing is for, if it doesn't do anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clegg\u2019s is a memoir that reveals itself by stealth; a book by a man wounded by his experience. One leitmotif is the lack of credit the Lib Dems, and Clegg in particular, got for the coalition\u2019s successes, from putting a brake on austerity to taxing plastic bags. If the Tories liked a policy, he says, they simply claimed it as their own. Today, it\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/plastic_bag_charge_is_lib_dem_success_story\">plastic bag tax</a> that irks him. \u201cWhat did I see last week? There was a great deal of stuff in the press about the plastic bag tax. I personally insisted on that, and the Conservatives were ferociously opposed. I remember Osborne saying, \u2018This is ridiculous \u2013 I\u2019m not going to accept it.\u2019 Did you see any mention\u2026?\u201d</p> <p>Clegg is so worked up, he can\u2019t complete his sentence. You sound really pissed off, I say. He instantly recovers his cool, and insists he\u2019s anything but. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not my nature to be angry, but am I a bit frustrated? Yes. I did not cater for the sheer brazen ruthlessness with which the Conservative party would hoover up any good news.\u201d</p> <p>Why did he want to form a coalition: to soften austerity or because he wanted power? Simple, he says: power. \u201cFashionable parts of the left now sneer at government, and I\u2019ve never understood that. I can understand it if you\u2019re a philosopher or a religious figure, but if you\u2019re in the secular world of politics, which is a grubby, tough, volatile business, why on earth would you not want to try and do shit? I just don\u2019t understand what this whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Corbyn thing</a> is for, if it doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5966a05f4441569f4924379ac7fe85ed6af6a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5966a05f4441569f4924379ac7fe85ed6af6a62/21_158_2248_1349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg at 10 Downing Street with David Cameron on the first day of coalition government.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At 10 Downing Street with David Cameron on the first day of the coalition government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is, Clegg says, he didn\u2019t understand the importance of the political symbols, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2010/may/12/coalition-government-general-election-2010\">the Rose Garden press conference</a> with Cameron (which came across as more bromance than business) to his acceptance of a nothingy office with no front entrance (Cameron refused to allow him to use Downing Street as a backdrop for media interviews).</p> <p>Clegg was so busy justifying the Lib Dems\u2019 role as a restraining agent that he forgot to tell the public they were in power. \u201cIt is something I mistakenly played up to. We portrayed ourselves as a political prophylactic, rather than an agent of change.\u201d Actually, he says, the coalition negotiations were a triumph. The Tories agreed to virtually all the Lib Dems\u2019 demands: fixed-term parliaments, scrapping ID cards, a referendum on electoral reform, measures to tackle climate change. \u201cAt the outset, it felt like a genuinely composite government. We got more of our policies into the coalition agreement than they did. And that shows both the strengths and weaknesses of me as a leader, and us as a party, in that we were diligently ticking off the number of policies. But we learned in hindsight that you can get as many of your policies in, but if there\u2019s one policy you don\u2019t, notably tuition fees, that\u2019s the thing people remember.\u201d</p> <p>But reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/20/conservative-liberal-democrat-coalition-agreement-analysis\">the coalition agreement</a>, it looks as if the Lib Dems knew from the start that they would be screwed on tuition fees. The final paragraph, under the heading Education, reads: \u201cIf the response of the government to Lord Browne\u2019s report [the review into higher education funding] is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept, then arrangements will be made to enable Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain in any vote.\u201d In the event, Clegg did not abstain on the vote to increase tuition fees (from \u00a33,290 a year to a maximum of \u00a39,000); <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/tuition-fees-how-liberal-democrat-mps-voted-22346.html\">six months into government, he voted in favour</a>.</p> <p>In his book, Clegg accuses Cameron, whom he broadly likes, of hypocrisy, claiming to care about climate change and Europe and the poor, then kowtowing to the right wing of his party. Is it true that when Clegg suggested there needed to be more social housing, Cameron told him it only turned people away from the Tories? \u201cIt would have been in a Quad meeting [the committee of Cameron, George Osborne, Clegg and Danny Alexander], so either Cameron or Osborne. One of them \u2013 I honestly can\u2019t remember whom \u2013 looked genuinely nonplussed and said, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing \u2013 it just creates Labour voters.\u2019 They genuinely saw housing as a Petri dish for voters. It was unbelievable.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more I governed with Gove and his team, the more I realised he was just striking a series of superficial poses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before long, he says, he was dealing with a very different Tory party from the one with which he went into government. He initially found Osborne bright, funny and empathetic. \u201cOne of the gifts he has is the ability to think of politics from someone else\u2019s point of view, which is genuinely unusual, and why he was such a consummate dealmaker.\u201d But their relationship soured. \u201cWhat I found offputting was the callousness to his political calculations, particularly around welfare. Welfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn\u2019t really matter what the human consequences were, because focus groups had shown that the voters they wanted to appeal to were very anti-welfare, and therefore there was almost no limit to those anti-welfare prejudices. I found that very unattractive, very cynical.\u201d</p> <p>He also accuses <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> of distorting figures to stoke up anti-immigrant feeling. \u201cThe Home Office produced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335088/SingleMarketFree_MovementPersons.pdf\">a report called Free Movement</a>. It was all about giving red meat to their backbenchers on Europe. She kept saying there was this terrible \u2018abuse\u2019 of freedom of movement, when simply describing EU citizens exercising their right to come and work in the UK. They tried to insert statistics suggesting the number of UK citizens living and working in other EU countries was half a million lower than any other mainstream estimate.\u201d</p> <p>Who does he think comes out worst in his book? Clegg looks appalled: \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of book.\u201d</p> <p>It is, I say.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he says, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cM\u2026\u201d I begin.</p> <p>He grins. \u201cOh, gosh, yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a>. Yep, you\u2019re probably right. Fair enough.\u201d</p> <p>The stories are endless: from Gove hiding in the toilet when Lib Dem education minister David Laws visits him, to Gove leaking apocryphal stories about Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez to the press, and announcing the return of O-levels on a whim. Clegg tells me Gove was cultured and often had him in stitches, but then he goes for him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2d92dc8c598010c9d7aa6a50dc6efc98b58e931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2d92dc8c598010c9d7aa6a50dc6efc98b58e931/54_266_3394_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg meets David Cameron, Danny Alexander and George Osborne to plan the coalition\u2019s first budget\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clegg meets David Cameron, Danny Alexander and George Osborne to plan the coalition\u2019s first budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe more I governed with Gove and his team, the more I realised he was just striking a series of superficial poses. You\u2019ve got a generation of politicians very close to the media, people like Boris Johnson and Gove, and the problem is, the skill of tossing off 800 words on one subject and then on another a week later is completely different to governing. With Cameron and Osborne, there was a seriousness about what they were doing \u2013 a deadly seriousness I often didn\u2019t like. But with Gove it was just a series of throwaway poses about our kids\u2019 futures. There\u2019s this ersatz intellectual heft that Gove and his people have that I don\u2019t think is merited.</p> <p>\u201cPeople such as Gove and Johnson have elevated striking poses into a political art form. Their apogee was the referendum. I wanted Gove to win the party leadership. He won the argument, and he should have been in a position of power to face the music.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg recently revealed that Gove was responsible for leaking a story about a supposed conversation Clegg had with the Queen (with Gove present), in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/12/queen-elizabeth-brexit-sun-nick-clegg-eu-referendum\">she tore a strip off him for being so unquestioningly pro-European, and suggested she was a Brexiteer</a> \u2013 a conversation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/eurosceptic-rant-by-the-queen-never-happened-says-nick-clegg\">Clegg insists never happened</a>. \u201cIt was complete rubbish. I was lucky enough to be president of the privy council, so I had the huge honour of meeting the Queen pretty well monthly for five years. I don\u2019t remember every conversation we had, but would I remember if I had received this tongue-lashing? Of course I would. And I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>How does he know the story came from Gove? \u201cThe other source of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1078504/revealed-queen-backs-brexit-as-alleged-eu-bust-up-with-ex-deputy-pm-emerges/\">the Sun\u2019s story</a> told me.\u201d</p> <p>Of all our recent British political leaders, Clegg is the most bracingly European. He speaks fluent Spanish, Dutch, French and German. His half-Russian father, a descendant of Tsarist nobility, was a successful banker; his Dutch mother had lived in Indonesia, where she and her family were interned in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the second world war. Clegg attended Westminster public school, where he was a keen actor, appearing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/helena-bonham-carter\">Helena Bonham Carter</a> in a production of The Changeling (she accidentally kicked him in the balls). He studied archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge university, where he appeared in a play about Cyrano de Bergerac under the directorship of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sam-mendes\">Sam Mendes</a>. There is still something actorly about him. At times, when he asserts himself, his voice shifts from urbane political class to a rasping Ray Winstone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought long and hard about quitting. But it would have been the worst of both worlds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clegg went on to study at the University of Minnesota and then the prestigious College of Europe in Bruges, where he met Miriam, today regarded as a leading expert on European trade law. After working for the European Commission, Clegg became a Lib Dem MEP for the East Midlands, and in 2005 won a seat as MP for Sheffield Hallam. Astonishingly, two years later he was leader of the party. Now 49, he looks both young and old for his age \u2013 boyish but jowly, with white chest hair prodding through his T-shirt, and surprisingly hairy ears. He has a bad back, and regularly asks if we can stand up or walk around to ease his discomfort.</p> <p>Again, he talks of the viciousness of the personal attacks on him. At one point, Labour MP Barry Gardiner stood up in parliament and called him a quisling. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling\">Vidkun Quisling</a> was the head of Norway\u2019s government who collaborated with the Nazis.) Did he challenge Gardiner? \u201cNo,\u201d Clegg says quietly. \u201cI think I should have. The advice you get in the frontline of politics is, don\u2019t answer back.\u201d</p> <p>Are you saying that if you had somebody round for dinner and they called you a quisling, you wouldn\u2019t fight back? He smiles apologetically. \u201cI\u2019d probably get up and lamp them,\u201d he says. \u201cWith hindsight, I should have been more outspoken. There\u2019s a very British culture in Westminster where people say unspeakably beastly things to each other in the Chamber, then, when they shuffle next to each other for a cup of tea, they talk about the weather. I\u2019m too Dutch for that.\u201d Only he wasn\u2019t: he took it on the chin.</p> <p>Does he feel a bit sorry for himself? He pulls himself up, straight-backed, and momentarily morphs into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Gowen\">the Major from Fawlty Towers</a>. \u201cNo. Never have done. Wasn\u2019t brought up like that. You get on with things and take the knocks. Look, it was a fantastic privilege to do what I did. I\u2019m very lucky. I\u2019m absolutely besotted with my kids, and I survived more or less with my limbs still attached to my body.\u201d</p> <p>As if on cue, a procession of mini-Cleggs strolls by the cafe. His gorgeous boys (14-year-old Antonio, 12-year-old Alberto and seven-year-old Miguel), accompanied by Miriam and her mother, stop to chat. Miriam asks how my flight was, Antonio tells me Manchester United will win the league now that they\u2019ve signed Paul Pogba. And then they are on their way. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Miriam says. Clegg looks at Miriam adoringly, as if he still can\u2019t quite believe his luck. \u201cI was smitten by her the first day,\u201d he says. \u201cBowled over. Love at first sight. She didn\u2019t speak a word of English; our early courtship was in French. She kept telling me stories I couldn\u2019t quite follow. I was so bewitched, it made no difference.\u201d</p> <p>Miriam recently wrote a warts-and-all cookbook, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/made-in-spain.html\">Made In Spain</a>, in which she revealed that the Camerons had wanted to be friends, but she wasn\u2019t really up for it; that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jul/26/dont-spread-about-sam-cams-hellmanns-mayonnaise-habit\">Samantha Cameron had served the Cleggs roast chicken with a tube of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise</a>, rather than making her own; and that she had refused to be in the house, let alone cook, when Osborne visited (Clegg and the then chancellor had a takeaway). Was it embarrassing when Miriam refused to stay around for Osborne? \u201cNot at all,\u201d Clegg says, his voice rising again. \u201cMy embarrassing thing is that I\u2019ve not actually read what Miriam said in her book,\u201d he says by way of a diversion. \u201cI remember her leaving as George came. But she didn\u2019t stalk off. She went out with friends, having put the kids to bed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01bd4130d25ec6a50782d3c5d024a92733d334f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01bd4130d25ec6a50782d3c5d024a92733d334f3/102_136_4387_2632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clegg with his wife, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clegg with his wife, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez: \u2018I was smitten by her the first day.

Others, no more favourably disposed, told the deputy PM that he\u2019d made his bed and had better lie in it. How much did it take out of him? A lot, he says. In the book, he writes that by 2011 he was working long hours, smoking too much and putting on weight. How many cigarettes? Sometimes three to five a night, he says. There\u2019s something touching about the fact that even his excess is so modestly calibrated. How much weight did he put on? \u201cI didn\u2019t weigh myself, Simon! But Paddy Ashdown told me very sternly, \u2018You\u2019re too fat.\u2019\u201d Did he have to get bigger trousers? \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Did he consider resigning? \u201cI didn\u2019t think, in spring 2011, when I was feeling so shit and was fat and whatever, that I should quit. But there were several times in the last two or three years when I thought long and hard about whether that was the right thing to do. In the end, I thought, it\u2019s the worst of both worlds: you\u2019ve created a government that lots of people heap opprobrium on you for, and then you quit when you\u2019ve got nothing to show for it.\u201d</p> <p>He felt that leading players <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrishuhne\">Chris Huhne</a> failed to give him their full support. (Cable seemed to be preparing to take over the leadership, while Huhne didn\u2019t help matters when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/chris-huhne-trial\">he ended up in prison for perverting the course of justice</a>.) \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Vince and Chris would ever count themselves as great team players,\u201d Clegg says.</p> <p>If I was skippering the Lib Dems, I say, I\u2019d want team players on my side. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that, is it? Vince\u2019s strength, and the reason he\u2019s liked by the public, was precisely because he stood apart. So there was no point in me saying, \u2018Oh, Vince, can you put in a shift in the boiler room with the rest of the team?\u2019 What I did was give them both big departmental responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>However much Clegg points the finger at a treacherous Tory leadership or the recalcitrant big beasts in his own party, he knows that ultimately there is one person to blame for his failures: himself. The day he agreed to triple tuition fees, he lost credibility. Isn\u2019t it easy to promise to freeze fees when you think you\u2019ll never be in power? \u201cYes, clearly,\u201d he concedes. \u201cAnd when we made that commitment, I didn\u2019t think it was very sensible. Nor did Vince.\u201d</p> <p>You sold yourself as the politician youngsters could trust and you ended up being defined by\u2026</p> <p>He finishes my sentence: \u201cA lack of trust.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg argues there will always be something on which the smaller party in a coalition fails to deliver. But this is different, I say. It wasn\u2019t about failing to deliver, it was about doing something you expressly promised not to. \u201cYes. Right. Yes, I see what you mean. My hunch is, the reason why the tuition fees thing enraged people as much as it did \u2013 and for some people still does, because it\u2019s so personal to people \u2013 is that it\u2019s their sons, their daughters. Getting your kids into university, seeing them in a gown on the mantelpiece, it\u2019s the distillation of a better life for your children. I have spent a lot of time thinking about the emotional pungency of it. It\u2019s like a politician coming out of the television going \u2018Bang!\u2019 [he makes a fist with one hand and delivers a knockout blow to the other] to my face as a parent. That\u2019s my explanation.\u201d</p> <p>Does he replay the conversation he had with Cameron when he agreed to the increase, and come up with alternative scenarios? \u201cYeah, of course. One of the many lessons I\u2019ve learned is that you can\u2019t just spring things on people if they don\u2019t see there is a problem in the first place. We just sprung this massive change on how we were going to fund our universities, without explaining there was a crisis in university funding. So often I do wonder what would have happened if we\u2019d just pushed the university sector over the edge and said, we\u2019re not going to help you out, we\u2019re not going to give you a perfectly formed solution.\u201d</p> <p>So he conceded to Cameron too quickly? \u201cFar too quickly. We should have let the universities talk about it, and yes, there would have been egg on my face, I would have had to swallow my pride. But at least we could have said, \u2018Listen, we are responding to an urgent problem.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So many of those students who placed that hope in him have since dumped him for Corbyn. They could have been his, I say. \u201cYes. Yep.\u201d Is that his biggest regret? \u201cYes, of course it\u2019s a huge regret, but that is not just a phenomenon in Britain. What you\u2019re seeing across the developed world, particularly among university-educated youngsters active on social media, is a movement from one figure of hope who can deliver the next Jerusalem to the next.\u201d</p> <p>Now he has to look to his own future. \u201cMy days of leadership are over. I promise you, having been as battle hardened as I have \u2013 do you mind if I stand up? \u2013 I\u2019m not hankering for another go in the trenches.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron\">Tim Farron</a>, the current Lib Dem leader, has given Clegg the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/farron_appoints_clegg_to_challenge_government_on_brexit\">job of scrutinising the government\u2019s Brexit strategy and holding it to account</a>. He is keen to do that, and says that if there is a snap election, he will defend his seat in Sheffield Hallam. Beyond that, he doesn\u2019t have a clue; he\u2019s too young for a bit-part life and wants a new career.</p> <p>I ask if the day after the 2015 general election was his lowest point. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get much lower than that,\u201d Clegg says. But no, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cI felt more wretched after the referendum than after the election. Political parties go up and down. Dare I say it, it\u2019s not the end of the world. I immediately fell on my sword after the election, took responsibility, but we will come back. We already are. But on the 23rd of June we lost something for good as a country, which I feel much more strongly about. You can\u2019t undo a lot of that damage.\u201d</p> <p>He walks me back to the bus station at the edge of town. I tell him I still think his biggest regret is the fact that all those young voters now feel he betrayed them. No, he says, I\u2019m being sentimental: he\u2019s more ruthless than I want to believe. His real regret is failing to deliver constitutional reform. As for tuition fees, if it hadn\u2019t been that, it would have been another issue that would have killed off Cleggmania. But the people he is interested in are those still convinced that coalition government can work \u2013 messy, compromised and occasionally shaming, but always serious politics. And if you believe in governing alongside parties you disagree with, as he does, you can never hope to emerge blemish-free. Actually, he says, the reality, is even less heroic. \u201cThere is absolutely no way that you can maintain a steadfast reputation for integrity.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018No wonder there was a Nick Clegg Looking Sad website\u2019: an exclusive extract from his revealing new book</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc1515a72ee15c722dd5381e5836aacf0fd44a3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1515a72ee15c722dd5381e5836aacf0fd44a3b/1510_1184_2489_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg presenting his LBC radio show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clegg\u2019s radio phone-in show was seen as a risk, but proved so popular that other MPs have followed suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Cameron seemed a little on edge. We were alone in his study in Number 10, very shortly after the formation of the coalition, and he wanted to ask me something that had clearly been preying on his mind. \u201cThis is terribly awkward,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe thing is\u2026 George has for so long had his eye on Dorneywood\u2026 He\u2019s very close to me\u2026 Would you mind if he used Dorneywood instead of you?\u201d He then proposed that I share the foreign secretary\u2019s traditional grace-and-favour countryside retreat, Chevening, rather than Dorneywood, which was ordinarily used by the number two in government.</p> <p>I was a bit taken aback. I thought he wanted to ask me something important. It hadn\u2019t really occurred to me that I might get a retreat to use at weekends, still less that there was any great distinction between one or the other. Cameron\u2019s plea suggested that George Osborne had been measuring up the curtains for years.</p> <p>I accepted the new arrangement and found myself sharing Chevening, a grand mansion in the Kent countryside near Sevenoaks, for the next five years with the foreign secretary, first William Hague and later Philip Hammond. Not at the same time, I hasten to add; that would have been taking coalition a little too far. </p> <p>Whether or not occupying Dorneywood made any difference to anything, I couldn\u2019t say. But, like Westminster itself, many of the so-called trappings of power \u2013 grace-and-favour mansions, grand offices, ministerial Jaguars \u2013 can seem completely alien to people who have not spent their lives preparing for power. As such, it is easy to underestimate their importance. </p> <p>When it was suggested that I take an office with no publicly recognisable entrance of its own, I didn\u2019t mind, as I thought I wouldn\u2019t need an equivalent of the Number 10 door at which to receive guests. When it was decided where I would sit in the House of Commons at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, I thought it made sense to sit supportively next to the PM, to show that the coalition could work smoothly.</p> <p>Big mistakes. All of them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>From the outside, the first day of the coalition government looked just about as smooth a transition of power as you could wish for, but behind closed doors it was anything but. With the negotiations wrapped up in just five days, the prime minister and I spent the morning of Wednesday, 12 May 2010 in Downing Street, appointing ministers to our first cabinet, before sharing the stage in the sun-drenched Rose Garden. When Cameron turned to me shortly afterwards and told me that, \u201cWe may have overdone it a bit\u201d, he was probably right. It was easy to get a little carried away with the \u201cnew dawn\u201d feel of the occasion. But I soon found out that not only was I physically unprepared for government; government was physically unprepared for me.</p> <p>On that first day in Downing Street, there was no office waiting for me. The in-house team at Number 10 quickly switched into gear for the incoming prime minister, but had little idea how to handle a deputy prime minister sharing power at the top. I was ushered upstairs to one of the first-floor state rooms. There I spent several hours, accompanied by Danny Alexander and a small number of my closest advisers, while the civil service buzzed around the building, supporting the new PM and largely ignoring us. There wasn\u2019t even a phone.</p> <p>While the 200 or so staff in Downing Street leapt into action to support the new prime minister, I was given just a single civil servant. My mistake, at least at first, was to accept the model presented to me. Having negotiated the coalition agreement without the help of civil servants, and with no experience in government myself, I simply didn\u2019t see the need to surround myself with teams of officials. And having witnessed the infantile Whitehall turf war waged by Gordon Brown\u2019s courtiers against Tony Blair, I thought it best to avoid rival power centres. </p> <p>The most unforgiving consequence was the tsunami of paperwork that fell directly to me to contend with. I was asked my opinion on things I didn\u2019t have the remotest clue about \u2013 dense, technical issues to do with the mechanics of everything from local government finance to energy subsidies. Every evening I would plonk myself on the sofa at home with my box and sit there dutifully wading through it, as family life happened around me. I would stay there virtually every night until the early hours. Then I would grab a few hours\u2019 sleep, which were disturbed most nights by our then one-year-old son Miguel, only to get up early to help get our two older boys fed, changed and packed off to school.</p> <p>The effect was not only physically draining, it was politically debilitating, too. Very quickly it became obvious that the central nervous system of Whitehall lay in the daily negotiations between me and Cameron. At the same time, the two most senior Liberal Democrats in the cabinet, Vince Cable and Chris Huhne, were, notwithstanding their obvious intellectual strengths, not known as nature\u2019s keenest team players. From the outset, their focus was devoted to their own departments \u2013 and their own political reputations. While they did this to great effect (and I encouraged them to do so), it meant I was unable to rely on others to defend in the media what we were doing. I soon became such a focal point for anger that I felt the impulse to defend myself publicly. No wonder Osborne said, somewhat smugly, in an interview in 2011 that, having expected to become British politics\u2019 public enemy number one, he \u201chadn\u2019t reckoned on Nick Clegg\u201d.</p> <p>I never contacted newspaper editors in response to negative coverage about myself. My only exception to this rule was when my family was affected. Every few weeks, Miriam and I had to devote a fair amount of time and emotional energy to rebutting ludicrous claims: that Miriam was somehow responsible for human-rights abuses in Western Sahara; that she was guilty of tax irregularities in her law firm several years before she was even employed by it; that our decision to send our Catholic children, who had attended a Catholic primary school, to a Catholic secondary school was a sign of hypocrisy. And so on.</p> <p>I mistakenly assumed that if I worked hard within government, did my homework and took decisions on their merits, then, one way or another, the truth \u2013 that the coalition was acting out of reasonable motives \u2013 would become plain to see and political dividends would follow. What I did not anticipate was what actually happened: I did all that \u2013 and no one knew about it. This enabled critics from the left to lampoon the Liberal Democrats as spineless, and critics from the right to lambast us as illegitimate irritants who shouldn\u2019t have been in government in the first place. The public readily turned away from us. I failed to realise an interesting paradox of modern politics: in an age of unprecedented transparency, the reality of power can still remain obscure to the public.</p> <p>By the spring of 2011, I was both drained and physically unfit. I smoked several cigarettes a night. I got virtually no exercise. Since becoming leader of the Liberal Democrats, I had dealt with pneumonia, chest pains, a broken toe, chronic coughs and bronchitis, while trying to look perky in public at all times. And throughout all of this, I would regularly crisscross London in the early evening to help put our three young boys to bed before returning to Westminster. No wonder there was a Nick Clegg Looking Sad website. They could have added Nick Clegg looking fat, pale and unhealthy, too. </p> <p>Over time, I worked out a better balance. I employed a larger team; I took up weekly kickboxing classes and had a rowing machine installed in a cubbyhole near my office; I cut down on the cigarettes and started to eat better. I handled the vast amount of paperwork more effectively by tackling most of it early in the morning instead of late at night, a switch of technique I later discovered Cameron had adopted, too. </p> <p>I discovered that one of the best ways to master the dysfunctional worlds of Westminster and Whitehall was simply to work outside them as much as possible. I restarted my pre-election habit of holding public question-and-answer sessions. I even started my own call-in show on LBC Radio with the veteran presenter Nick Ferrari. It was condemned as a foolish risk by many in the Westminster village, yet quickly proved to be sufficiently popular that a number of other politicians followed suit.</p> <p>Much of what I have described might seem like the footling ephemera of political life. But I believe it lifts the lid on something more serious: politics is already populated by a surfeit of political professionals and apparatchiks; if we want people with an independent turn of mind who have led normal lives to represent our country in the future, there will need to be a shift. If every youthful misdemeanour is recycled on social media for ever, if the dysfunctional operation of Whitehall continues to expect too much of people at the top, and if politicians cannot protect their loved ones, we should not be surprised if in future parliament is populated by robots, monks and nuns. </p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited extract from Politics: Between The Extremes, by Nick Clegg, published on 15 September by The Bodley Head at \u00a320.
