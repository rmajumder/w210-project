  "<p>The FBI is investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal server, its director has announced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/28/us-election-live-donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton\">FBI to reopen investigation of Clinton private email server \u2013 campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FBI had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">announced in July</a> that its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter, although James Comey, the FBI\u2019s director, criticised Clinton as \u201ccareless\u201d.</p> <p>But in a letter sent to members of Congress on Friday, Comey said new emails had been discovered in an \u201cunrelated\u201d case.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cI am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d<br></p> <p>Comey added: \u201cAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and I cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.\u201d</p> <p>At an evening press conference in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton briefly addressed the letter to reporters. \u201cThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe director himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\u201d she concluded, alluding to Comey\u2019s finding of \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">extremely careless</a>\u201d email practices but no criminal wrongdoing.</p> <p>Her rival, Donald Trump, also remarked on the letter, telling rallygoers: \u201cThe system might not be as rigged as I thought.\u201d</p> <p>A US security source firmly ruled out that the \u201cunrelated case\u201d Comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee earlier this year. US intelligence officials have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">blamed Russia</a> for hacking the DNC and releasing its internal communications online.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The source, who would not speak on the record, said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to Clinton. Nor is the recent criminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/accused-nsa-contractor-harold-martin-ex-wife-interview-classified-information\">investigation into a National Security Agency contractor</a> accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data.</p> <p>Later the Associated Press, citing an unnamed official, claimed the newly discovered emails \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/792076589190316032\">did not come from her private server</a>\u201d. Several outlets <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-ab-top-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">have reported</a> that the emails came from devices seized from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, in connection to an investigation of inappropriate text messages that Weiner sent to an underage girl.</p> <p>The letter from Comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the FBI director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">announced</a> the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for what it dubbed \u201cextremely careless\u201d use of a private email server while secretary of state. The FBI director said then: \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes \u2026 our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was campaigning in Iowa. It was not immediately clear if she would address the matter publicly and she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the airport tarmac. She did not raise the issue after taking the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sticking with her routine stump speech.</p> <p>In Des Moines, she referred to the news only obliquely, saying: \u201cWe have got to keep our foot on the gas. Donald Trump says he can still win and he is right. You know this has been such an unusual election. I don\u2019t take any place, anyone or anything for granted. I am going to work as hard as I can until the end.\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, called on Comey to \u201cimmediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAlready, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \u2018reopening\u2019 an investigation, but Comey\u2019s words do not match that characterization,\u201d he said. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he was \u201cconfident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, told reporters he had to \u201cread a little more\u201d when asked about the matter on the campaign trail in Florida.</p> <p>The Dow Jones fell more than 100 points after the release of Comey\u2019s letter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/trump-responds-fbi-investigation-clinton-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yj8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2850182\"            data-video-name=\"Trump gleefully responds to new FBI investigation into Clinton emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5813975ce4b08d944ba4bb6c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028Trump_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028Trump.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028Trump_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/trump-responds-fbi-investigation-clinton-emails-video\">Trump gleefully responds to new FBI probe into Clinton emails</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the state department has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/11/hillary-clintons-candidate-un-press-conference-republicans\">loomed over her candidacy</a> since before she even announced her intent to seek the White House in April. Clinton\u2019s use of a \u201chomebrew\u201d email server left emails containing classified information potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton-email-server-connection-vulnerable-to-hackers\">vulnerable to foreign hackers</a>, and her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">deletion of 33,000 emails</a> deemed personal has been a major campaign issue.</p> <p>Trump took the stage to a cheering crowd in New Hampshire shortly after the news broke. \u201cThey are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America,\u201d the Republican nominee said to loud chants of \u201clock her up\u201d.</p> <p>He continued to assail his rival in deeply personal terms. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before \u2013 we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>Trump, who has long claimed that the former secretary of state was only allowed to run for the White House because of a \u201crigged system\u201d, added: \u201cI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, also pounced on the news while campaigning in Pennsylvania \u2013 bringing the crowd to its feet when informing supporters of the FBI\u2019s announcement. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe commend the FBI for having the courage to reopen this case, because no one is above the law,\u201d Pence said.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee also called on the FBI to make public all emails pertinent to the investigation.<br></p> <p>In a statement, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, condemned Clinton\u2019s behavior. \u201cYet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation\u2019s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/792049114624163840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BIG: The FBI is reopening its investigation into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a>&#39;s email server.

Feinstein had praised Comey in July for a \u201cthorough, objective review\u201d, after the FBI director declined to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s private email service.</p> <p>Comey had \u201cplayed right into the political campaign of Donald Trump,\u201d Feinstein said, adding that his departure from the FBI\u2019s \u201chistory of extreme caution near Election Day\u201d was \u201cappalling\u201d.</p> <p>Democrats also complained in private that Comey\u2019s letter was vague and raised more questions than it answered.<br></p> <p>The Republican National Committee was quick to cast the FBI\u2019s announcement as a reopening of the investigation into whether Clinton engaged in criminal behavior \u2013 even though the nature of the new inquiry remained unclear.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email server just 11 days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be,\u201d the RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, said in a statement. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide pay-to-play corruption at her State Department,\u201d he added. \u201cThis alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing.\u201d</p>",

The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from a separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <p>But there is little doubt it gives everyone something to talk about in the 11 days left before election day. Unless the FBI moves far faster than is normal to clarify that there is nothing new of significance here, Democrats may also struggle to come up with convincing answers to questions that will undoubtedly weigh on the minds of some voters.</p>",
  "<p>The election approaches; the nation seethes; the hatred festers; the dead start to talk. Old intolerances have come roaring back as the United States finally reaches the end of the most virulent, vacuous presidential contest in living memory.

Against the current backdrop of racist demagoguery and national disbelief, it arrives as a godsend. This stone-cold stunner of a retrospective \u2013 spanning two floors of the Met\u2019s luxury rental on Madison Avenue, and organized with judicious restraint by <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/spectrum-spotlight-ian-alteveer\">Ian Alteveer </a>and Meredith Brown \u2013 proudly insists on the place of African Americans in the American artistic imagination. And yet that is only one of its achievements. It also, and perhaps more powerfully, grounds that placement <em>inside</em> a larger western artistic tradition, and utilizes the very tropes and techniques once used in exclusionary imagery to new, more moral ends.<strong> </strong>(The show opened last April at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Marshall\u2019s hometown; <a href=\"http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/first-lady-michelle-obama-visited-the-museum-of-contemporary-art/\">Michelle Obama made time to see it</a>.

Not the shades of brown skin we misleadingly call \u201cblack\u201d, but <em>black</em>. It\u2019s achieved through the admixture of several different pigments \u2013 coal black, or an ivory black produced from charred bones, or else something called <a href=\"http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=591544\">mars black</a>, which is made from iron oxide. The blacks gain further richness through blue or golden undertones, but no white is mixed into the pigment to model the actual flesh tones of African Americans.</p> <p>His small, breakthrough painting <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kerry-james-marshall-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-shadow-of-his-former-self\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self</a> (1980) features a man whose jet-black skin just barely can be distinguished from the dark gray background. A fedora perches on his head cartoonishly, and teeth and eyeballs disrupt the crepuscular surface with shocks of white. Lean into this disturbing, uncanny work when you encounter the portrait in one of the early galleries here. At first the indeterminate, half-visible figure appears an instantiation of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s invisible man</a>. Seen up close, the portrait\u2019s gemlike hardness recalls the exactitude, but also the opacity, of Flemish portraiture \u2013 and, indeed, this is a rare work done with old-style, fast-drying egg tempera, rather than the malleable acrylic he would later embrace. (The exhibition\u2019s title, Mastry, is a brilliant, misspelled rejoinder to the old designation of skilled northern European artists as masters.) This \u201cshadow\u201d of Marshall has been cast by Renaissance depictions and minstrel shows alike, and by the constraints of not just American life but European high art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e/0_0_3250_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Souvenir I, 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Souvenir I, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Ziolkowski, \u00a9 MCA Chicago/Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Marshall\u2019s uncanny, intense blackness has both a personal derivation and a conceptual underpinning. His figures are not faithful depiction of black individuals. They\u2019re signs, and they channel and frustrate a centuries-long history of representations of blackness as evil, inferior, or simply absent \u2013 before then, gloriously, asserting the prestige afforded to those representations as Marshall\u2019s rightful inheritance. Marshall paints barbershops and housing projects, spaces of black community and independence, and he also frequently turns to interiors: black people in bed, in their living room, reading a book, listening to music. But these depictions are not ends in themselves, any more than C\u00e9zanne\u2019s still lifes are advertisements for apples. His black-pitched portraits and genre scenes gain their force, rather, from the historical tradition they partially embrace, partially refute, and ultimately expand.</p> <p>Sometimes Marshall can dip into a citational mode that gets a bit facile, a bit look-what-I-know, as in a barbershop panorama that features a cartoon white girl in the manner of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">the distorted skull in Holbein\u2019s Ambassadors</a>. He is far better when he trusts his art history to serve as the mood music for his contemporary visions, above all in the largest gallery of this retrospective: a suite of nine giant paintings of Chicago and Los Angeles housing projects, plus suburban landscapes that wink heavily at the pastoral tradition. A black family sprawled out at a lakeside picnic recalls, but hardly imitates, the bourgeois snackers of <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=7123\">Manet\u2019s D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe</a>; children in an LA project frolic in the grass like rococo pleasure-seekers, and paintball-like flowers stud the painting\u2019s surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08/0_0_5233_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"7am Sunday Morning, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">7am Sunday Morning, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry James Marshall/Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These paintings draw on art history not as a crutch, and not as a clapback. They draw on the past as a set of procedures, which Marshall combines and reworks to depict black bodies with a sophistication and intricacy usually not afforded them. Only that way, Marshall seems to insist, can black lives be seen as lives that matter. You can neither junk the past nor outrun it, but you can recode its values, and make the past your own. (A pendant show here, Kerry James Marshall Selects, offers a revealing glimpse of the artist\u2019s sources and inspirations: a stern portrait from the workshop of Hans Holbein, flowing figure studies by Veronese, <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/491419\">a social-realist lithograph</a> by his former teacher Charles Wilbert White, and <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/267361\">a photograph of Gerhard Richter\u2019s wife, smudged with paint</a>.)</p> <p>The very conception of western artistic beauty, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124700316\">as the historian Nell Irvin Painter has written</a>, springs from a racialized misunderstanding of the Greek ideal, as 18th-century aesthetes elevated the white marbles they venerated into the very standard of elegance.

She even made mention of Obama\u2019s appearance on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4\">Carpool Karaoke</a> and called it a \u201cprivilege\u201d to watch the first couple dance, eliciting a <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/election2016-dance-dancing-3oz8xIbbFutBokoGS4?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=tag_click\">little groove</a> from Obama.<br></p> <p>The crowd thrilled to their playful rapport. \u201cYou go, girls,\u201d a woman shouted above the wild applause.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4d3dd5e18573f23a2b5b344ed528f919afae5db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4d3dd5e18573f23a2b5b344ed528f919afae5db/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton speaks during the opening session of the Democratic national convention in Los Angeles on 14 August 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton speaks during the opening session of the Democratic national convention in Los Angeles on 14 August 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>East Wing sisterhood </strong></h2> <p>The contrast between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama is sharp. But they will for ever have in common the shared experience of living two terms as America\u2019s first lady. As both Clinton and Obama have expressed publicly, the role of first lady is complicated, constrained by the weight of social and cultural traditions and devoid of any real power. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to state the obvious,\u201d Clinton said of the role. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. You\u2019ve got so many people counting on you, you\u2019ve got the eyes of the world on you. </p> <p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s be real, as our nation\u2019s first African American first lady, she\u2019s faced pressures I never did, and she\u2019s handled them with pure grace.\u201d</p> <p>The women, both Ivy-League educated lawyers, charted very different paths after reaching the White House. As the joke goes, one can\u2019t wait to return to the White House while the other can\u2019t wait to leave.</p> <p>Clinton followed the path of her role model, Eleanor Roosevelt. She pushed the boundaries of tradition \u2013 and shocked some in her husband\u2019s administration \u2013 when she set up her desk in the West Wing, as opposed to the East Wing where first ladies traditionally worked. She delved into policy and led a failed effort to pass universal healthcare.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama has all but avoided policy battles. She has focused on combatting childhood obesity, improving girls\u2019 access to education around the world and, especially lately, fighting racial and economic inequality. </p> <p>Obama has animated the role by using social media and public appearances to reach new audiences. America has seen the first lady <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mkAVIm6SZc\">hula hoop on the White House lawn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/11/michelle-obama-makes-rap-video-about-benefits-of-going-to-college-video\">rap about college</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ihOXaU0I8o\">shop with Ellen Degeneres</a>. She is also known the world over for her impeccable and symbolic sartorial decisions. (She wore a Versace dress made of rose gold chain mail to the Obamas\u2019 final state dinner with the Italian prime minister last week.)</p> <p>As the Obamas prepare to leave the White House, many Democrats are holding out the unlikely hope that Michelle will overcome her distaste for politics and run for office. </p> <p>Asked at a January town hall if his wife might consider running for president, Obama replied: \u201cThere are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes and Michelle is not running for president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6092cdc636178bdffa8b9dabc441f93597376e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6092cdc636178bdffa8b9dabc441f93597376e7/0_30_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Michelle Obama await the arrival of the Italian prime minister on 18 October 2016 in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Michelle Obama await the arrival of the Italian prime minister on 18 October 2016 in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leigh Vogel/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Campaign trail rivals turned allies</strong></h2> <p>Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama began as adversaries in 2008, pitted against one another in an grueling and at turns acrimonious primary that left deep political wounds on the Democratic party. Obama resented the fact that Clinton had attacked her husband as inexperienced and unprepared, and Clinton was stung by criticism of stirring racial tensions. </p> <p>Obama extended an olive branch to Clinton during her 2008 speech at the Democratic national convention, when, quoting from Clinton\u2019s concession speech, she praised \u201cpeople like Hillary Clinton, who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling, so that our daughters \u2013 and our sons \u2013 can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher\u201d.</p> <p>Their bitterness softened when Clinton accepted the job as secretary of state but the nature of their relationship has remained a source of speculation.</p> <p>During one of this year\u2019s presidential debates, Trump tried to undercut their relationship, recalling an oblique comment Obama made during the 2008 primary about keeping one\u2019s house in order, which some had interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons\u2019 marital tribulations. In context, Obama was explaining the importance of putting family first despite the rigors of a contested primary campaign.</p> <p>But it was a clear sign that Obama\u2019s wide appeal and increasing presence on the trail was a threat to Trump\u2019s struggling campaign. </p> <p>Last week, the first lady <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-donald-trump-misconduct-frightening\">delivered a devastating riposte</a> to Trump, in response to the release of a 2005 tape that showed the Republican nominee boasting that his fame enabled him to grab and kiss women without their consent. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying that \u2013 a candidate for President of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,\u201d Obama said at an event in New Hampshire, her voice trembling and her hand placed over heart. \u201cI have to tell you that I can\u2019t stop thinking about this \u2013 it has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\u2019t have predicted.\u201d</p> <p>On the trail, Obama doesn\u2019t only counter Trump, whose name she has not uttered once. She also makes what many political observers argue is the most effective and clear case <em>for</em> Clinton, offering herself as a character witness. </p> <p>In Winston-Salem on Thursday, any remnants of an old rivalry was overshadowed by their public show of mutual respect and admiration.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt takes a level of generosity of spirit to do what Hillary has done in her career and in her life for our family, for this nation,\u201d Obama said. </p> <p>\u201cIf people wonder, yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s dominant lead over Donald Trump in opinion polls is narrowing slightly as the final week before the US presidential election approaches, with independents and undecided voters appearing to gravitate toward the two main candidates.</p> <p>Though few analysts believe the latest numbers will disprove almost universal predictions of a Democratic win on 8 November \u2013 even despite the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the FBI is investigating newly-discovered emails sent by Clinton via a personal server</a> \u2013 they also highlight unusually large spreads between poll results in an election that has broken many of the conventional laws of American politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">Hillary Clinton's private email server under investigation by FBI again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A well-regarded rolling average of national opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html#polls\">calculated by Real Clear Politics</a> showed a 4.4 percentage point lead for Clinton over Trump on Friday, with libertarian Gary Johnson and Green candidate Jill Stein dropping to their lowest levels since polling for the 2016 election began.</p> <p>Ten days ago, after struggling in the first two presidential debates and still fending off damaging allegations of sexual assault, Trump was 7.1 points behind in the same four-way rolling average of national polls, though much of his gain since appears to have been at the expense of Johnson rather than Clinton.<br></p> <p>The tightening of the race has prompted some analysts to somewhat adjust upward their predictions of how likely it is that Trump could pull off a surprise win. </p> <p>Nate Silver, who runs statistics-driven website FiveThirtyEight.com and correctly predicted the 2012 result, says his <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">modeling of poll numbers and wider historical trends</a> suggests the Republican now has around a one in five chance of winning \u2013 up from the lows seen during the debates but still down sharply from the near even chance he had based just on polls earlier in the year.</p> <p>\u201cClearer signs now of a tighter race, as Trump has inched up to 21% in our polls-plus forecast (19% in polls-only),\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/791979727749783552\">he wrote</a> on Friday. </p> <p>Silver acknowledged that the wide disparity among pollsters about the size of Clinton\u2019s lead \u2013 which has ranged from 1 to 14 points in recent days \u2013 is unusual, but <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-polls-disagree-and-thats-ok/\">argued</a> that that is a healthy reflection of different methodologies. </p> <p>Analysis at the state level continues to show a difficult path to the required 270 electoral college votes for Trump, particularly as the 17 million votes cast already in early voting point to an unusually strong Democratic turnout in must-win states, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/nevada-senate-election-catherine-cortez-masto-joe-heck-trump\">Nevada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/florida-voting-clinton-trump-election\">Florida</a>. </p> <p>To turn things around in the barely 270 hours remaining, Trump would need to hold on to Republican states like Utah and Arizona where his support has been slipping; win the crucial battlegrounds of Ohio, Florida and North Carolina; and pull off a surprise in swing state like New Hampshire, Nevada or Pennsylvania, all of which appeared to have slipped out of his grasp in recent weeks.</p> <p>As both candidates head to Arizona next \u2013 practically unknown territory for a Democratic presidential nominee \u2013 before a frantic final 10 days of campaigning, there were signs of the strain for Republicans.</p> <p>Trump continued to call on his supporters to disregard the evidence of poor poll numbers and watch for vote-rigging. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying <em>if</em><em> </em>we win \u2019cos I want to be nice, right, but the people are getting angry at me so we\u2019ll just say <em>when</em><em> </em>we win on November 8,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/ds-2710-trump-rally\">he told a rally in Geneva, Ohio</a>.</p> <p>He also joked, \u201cWe should just cancel the election and give it to Trump,\u201d after hinting that the opening of his new hotel in Washington was a sign he would get to Pennsylvania Avenue \u201cone way or another\u201d this year.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile his vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence had a narrow escape when his plane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/mike-pences-plane-slides-off-runway-at-laguardia-airport-in-new-york\">skidded off the runway</a> in heavy rain at New York\u2019s LaGuardia airport on Thursday night.</p> <p>Clinton meanwhile continues to show much more confidence in her lead, even though Democrats are warning supporters not to take anything for granted in the final days.</p> <p>Rumours circulated widely in Washington on Friday that she was considering asking the current vice-president, Joe Biden, to be her secretary of state, a suggestion that will help both shore up support among the party\u2019s populist base and signal her intention to look beyond 8 November.</p> <p>She also received a welcome boost on Thursday from the first lady, Michelle Obama, who has emerged as one of the most popular political figures of the 2016 election cycle. \u201cHillary doesn\u2019t play,\u201d she said after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/hillary-clinton-rally-michelle-obama-north-carolina\">joint appearance in North Carolina</a>. </p>",

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u2019s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u2019s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency. Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17%, at one point reaching a 31-year low.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3083964fca582527138f7bfbec22541e4a340740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3083964fca582527138f7bfbec22541e4a340740/164_2_2073_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK prime minister Theresa May in Parliament this week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK prime minister Theresa May in Parliament this week</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In early October, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government will invoke Article 50 of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty no later than March 2017. This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u2019s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers.

  "<p>An unusual election year has ushered in an unusual silence: the issue of abortion, almost always a cause for pitched battles between presidential candidates, has been all but invisible on the national stage as the campaign between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton draws to a close.</p> \n<p>There have been moments of high drama. Trump\u2019s call for \u201cpunishment\u201d when women get abortions in illegal circumstances collided with Clinton\u2019s demand, unprecedented for a major party presidential candidate, to roll back a 40-year restriction on public funds for abortion. And the third presidential debate saw Trump unleash an inflammatory line of attack, saying Clinton supported policy allowing doctors to \u201crip\u201d infants out of the womb days before birth.</p> \n<p>But contrast that with 2012, when the Republican ticket struggled to escape accusations that the party had waged a war on women\u2019s reproductive health.

Asked about abortion late in a pregnancy, Trump opened up an inflammatory line of attack. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d Trump said, \u201cyou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clinton shot back that many terminations late in pregnancy take place when \u201csomething terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">Clinton condemns Trump's abortion 'scare rhetoric' in debate question</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cUsing that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The exchange concerned one of the least understood and most controversial types of abortion \u2013 those taking place when the fetus approaches or passes the point of viability.</p> \n<p>It is a topic wracked by falsehoods. Wallace raised the issue of \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d, a political term that doesn\u2019t readily correspond to a specific medical procedure, but which Congress nonetheless banned more than a decade ago. In 2003, the ban was upheld by the supreme court. </p> \n<p>Clinton has never campaigned on overturning the ban, but as a senator she voted against it. In the final debate, she explained that she voted \u201cno\u201d because the bill didn\u2019t make an exception for the health of the mother. Prior to the debate, she has said she supported \u201clate-pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump, meanwhile, has committed to signing a ban on abortion in the 20th week of pregnancy \u2013 before a fetus is viable outside the womb. </p> \n<p>But his suggestion that pregnancies are ended days before a pregnancy is full term doesn\u2019t appear to be supported in fact.</p> \n<p>The percentage of women having abortions past the midpoint of their pregnancy is very small. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6410a1.htm\">latest estimate</a> by the CDC is that fully 98.7% of abortions take place before 21 weeks\u2019 gestation. Most fetuses are not viable outside the womb for another three weeks. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights thinktank, estimates that proportion of terminations after 20 weeks is slightly higher, or about 15,000 procedures every year.</p> \n<p>Clinton\u2019s remarks, which characterized these terminations as being done in cases of severe fetal anomaly, do not fully capture what we know about later abortions. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-feminism-election-jessica-valenti\">Grab Trump by the ballot: either our bodies are our own, or they\u2019re not</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe know very little about women who seek later abortions,\u201d reads a 2013 study published in the journal of the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cBut data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.\u201d (The study characterized \u201clater abortions\u201d as those taking place after 20 weeks.)</p> \n<p>Dr Warren Hern, who is one of only a handful of doctors in the country performing third-trimester abortions, agreed to speak in as much detail as he could about his own patients. </p> \n<p>Hern estimates that in a majority of his later abortion cases, the women are there because of a severe fetal anomaly. The rest of his clients are a mix. Hern objects to the term \u201celective abortion\u201d. \u201cIt makes it sound like you decided to have curls instead of bangs as a hairdo,\u201d he said. But he allows that many \u2013 although not a majority \u2013 of patients having later abortions are not there because of fetal anomaly.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout doing the kind of analysis I would need to do to be sure, I would say that more than half of the patients who come in [post-viability] are there because of fetal abnormalities, and this was a very desired pregnancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other, smaller proportion are usually very young women, 12 or 13 years old, who are victims of sexual assault, of incest. Or they are adult women who have been told by a doctor they can\u2019t get pregnant, or who thought they were post-menopausal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hern says he turns many women away. For one, after about 33 weeks, termination carries more serious risks. </p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the things I have to decide is, first of all, do I feel comfortable ending the pregnancy at a late stage when there is no obvious problem, such a fetal abnormality or a rape? If I have someone who\u2019s 33 weeks pregnant, and she should have had this done four or five months ago, I\u2019m not going to do that, because there\u2019s a certain amount of risk involved.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump, he said, \u201cis totally and abysmally ignorant about this subject. His statements are highly inflammatory and obscene and designed to inflame his followers, who don\u2019t need to be inflamed.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it is unclear if Trump\u2019s comments won him any followers.</p> \n<p>Wallace also asked Trump whether or not he wanted Roe v Wade to be overturned. Trump declined to answer, saying the issue \u201cwill go back to the states\u201d.

The Bakken formation is the biggest oil producer in the US, along with Texas\u2019s Eagle Ford, but <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/article/shale_in_the_united_states.cfm\">production has peaked</a>.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a7a817a-4863-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab\">US shale oil remains relatively cheap</a> to produce and there are signs <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/two-years-into-oil-slump-u-s-shale-firms-are-ready-to-pump-more-1474968601\">output is set to increase</a>.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton has not won the presidential election. Granted, the polls look good. The New York Times gives her a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0\">92% chance</a> at taking the White House as of Thursday morning, and more Republican elites are defecting from their party\u2019s nominee each day. Data hub FiveThirtyEight\u2019s numbers are a little more modest, putting Trump\u2019s odds of victory just north of 15%. Evan McMullin \u2013 the once-laughable conservative independent candidate \u2013 <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-may-be-underestimating-evan-mcmullins-chances-in-utah/\">could even win</a> his home state of Utah, fueled by Republican recoiling. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/bernie-sanders-supporters-young-voters-hillary-clinton\">No, Hillary, young voters aren't naive. The system doesn't work for them | Alexander Zaitchik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not every picture is so rosy. A recent <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/22/trump-gains-on-clinton-poll-shows-rigged-message-resonates.html\">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> saw Clinton with just a 4-point lead nationwide, with Trump undershooting his campaign high by just one point. That a full 15% of voters <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-where-are-the-undecided-voters/\">remain undecided</a> leaves a huge potential for the election to swing at the last minute. Worryingly, the candidates remain neck in neck in several swing states. </p> <p>By all accounts, Trump (to speak generously) has a slim hope of walking away with a win come 8 November. But that there is still any chance he could become commander in chief, America\u2019s ambassador to the world and a central player in literally any decision about the future of the United States should inspire not just concern, but a trip to knock on doors in your nearest swing state.</p> <p>Mind, this isn\u2019t a call to silence dissent about Clinton, let alone to start phone banking for her campaign. But those savvy enough to hold principled and well-founded critiques of her role in the Honduran coup and ending \u201cwelfare as we know it\u201d, for instance, can also recognize the stakes of voting for anyone besides her in a swing state.</p> <p>There are more than a few good reasons to help make sure Clinton wins that have almost nothing to do with her. Anything but victory by a sizable margin will feed Trump\u2019s omens about election \u201crigging\u201d, potentially tying up the news cycle for several months in some horrific recount debacle like the one in 2000. A narrow defeat is also likely to embolden Trump\u2019s most irascible supporters, many of whom happen to be armed. </p> <p>Assuming the election is over could further hit down-ballot candidates by driving down voter turnout at a time when Democrats have a real potential to flip the Senate and render Bernie Sanders chairman of the budget committee. (By fear-mongering about that possibility, Paul Ryan inadvertently helped Sanders raise <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://berniesanders.com/thankspaul/\">$2.4m</a> to aid in down-ticket races.) </p> <p>So whether you want to avert open revolt, take back Congress or just be done with this hellscape marathon of an election cycle, assuming Clinton has already coasted to victory is a dangerous move. </p> <p>Perhaps the best reason to double down on electing Clinton, though, is to aid the movements that will be a thorn in her side. Especially after reading the transcripts of her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other major banks, few progressive activists have illusions as to where Clinton\u2019s priorities \u2013 and donor pools \u2013 lie. </p> <p>Veterans of Occupy Wall Street, the movement for black lives and the climate fight know that major egalitarian change in the United States has never come straight from the Oval Office. From the New Deal to women\u2019s suffrage to beating back Jim Crow, nearly every transformative shift in American politics has been the result of militant and confrontational social movements pushing Democratic presidents into a corner. </p> <p>Where Republican administrations spark defensive fights \u2013 against ill-advised wars (Bush II) and neoliberal crusades (Reagan) \u2013 Democratic ones allow activists to play up the contradictions between a party that claims progressive values and the hawkish, corporate one that actually exists. </p> <p>As Sanders\u2019s unlikely primary success showed, the Democrats\u2019 establishment base is quite literally dying off, being replaced year after year by voters from the youngest and most progressive generation in American history. It\u2019s the same generation that has headed up the most dynamic social movements of the last five years, and it stands to change the musty face of this country\u2019s political system for the better, working within and outside of elected office.</p> <p>As longtime organizer Nelini Stamp <a href=\"https://medium.com/@NelStamp/presedential-elections-are-not-radical-litmus-tests-and-why-im-voting-for-my-opponent-a55a7259d35d#.6ab195ex3\">put it</a>, \u201cI am voting for who I want my opponent to be post November 9th and that person is Hillary Clinton.\u201d In other words, nothing ends on election day. But making sure she wins will allow movements \u2013 the messy, disruptive politics that actually change things \u2013 a chance to thrive.</p>",

The key is initiating the conflict by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic \u2026 You can message to draw them out and message them to punch you.\u201d</p> <p>Two other activists, Zulema Rodriguez and Aaron Minter, claim credit for a March protest in Chicago. The former says she \u201cdid the Chicago event\u201d and the latter says: \u201cWhen they shut all that, that was us.\u201d</p> <p>Foval was contracted by the Democratic National Committee months after the Chicago protest, and the video does not link him to Rodriguez or Minter. Campaign finance reports show the Clinton campaign paid Rodriguez $1,610 in late February, though the video makes no mention of it. The Clinton campaign has said Rodriguez\u2019s employment ended in late February and pertained to her organizing work in Arizona. Rordriguez also worked for MoveOn.org, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArielCohen37/status/708477056384901120/photo/1\">took partial credit</a> for the Chicago protest.</p> <p>The out-of-context remarks were damning enough that the current chairwoman of the DNC, Donna Brazile, immediately condemned them. Foval was laid off and Creamer said he would be \u201cstepping back\u201d from work with Democrats. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim conflates quotes into a large, sinister story, but we lack facts to actually support most of it and the heavy editing of the video forces viewers to draw their own conclusions. There might be more to this story, but neither O\u2019Keefe or Trump have shown clear proof for it.</p>",
  "<p>When the Guardian reported this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">Theresa May had privately made a passionate case for Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU</a> shortly before the referendum, it didn\u2019t look great. The problem wasn\u2019t her opinion: she was saying the sort of things a member of the remain campaign was supposed to. The problem was that she wasn\u2019t doing so in public \u2013 and the audience for her secret pitch was a select group of bankers from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>May is very far from the first politician to accept such an invitation. She has, for example, put herself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\">same category as Hillary Clinton</a>, who between resigning as US secretary of state and running for president made a number of highly lucrative speeches for the same bank. For both politicians, the idea that they are giving off-the-record briefings to the banking industry that stand at odds with their public pronouncements makes for very bad publicity indeed. For the spin doctors at Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, this must have been a pretty good week.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that \u201cGoldman\u201d or \u201cGoldmans\u201d \u2013 as insiders call the bank \u2013 is in general enthusiastic about publicity. Much like Fight Club, the first rule of the City is that you do not talk about the City: especially at major banks, unauthorised contact with reporters or researchers is grounds for immediate dismissal. Nowhere is this rule enforced more vigorously than at Goldman. There isn\u2019t even a sign with the bank\u2019s name on at its City HQ.</p> <p>In the absence of a more conventional PR strategy, though, visits from the likes of May and Clinton serve a very useful purpose. Other banks may have good risk management, but none has Goldman\u2019s mystique, or its network of former employees, from the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and former US Treasury ministers Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. Goldman loves to present itself as the bank that is better than any of its competitors at drawing the most powerful decision-makers into its orbit \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/jean-claude-juncker-jose-manuel-barroso-decision-to-join-goldman-sachs\">hiring the former EU leader Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso</a> earlier this year. All of this helps with recruitment as well as with holding on to staff. And so, publicity shy though Goldman may be, the outcry over May\u2019s speech this week makes it look exactly the way it wants to.</p> <p>\u201cAny person being seen as at the global top of what they do, be it in basketball, green technology, fashion or chess, will be an interesting speaker for a bank trying to position itself as the global leader in its own field,\u201d says one insider. Another adds: \u201cIt is the rock-star effect. \u2018Look who we know! Look who we got!\u2019 They say that politics is show business for ugly people. Getting a big-name politician in is just part of that \u2013 a celebrity to cheer up and maybe stimulate very well-paid but hard-pressed employees.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5929j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836072\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e2c3de4b0c146d58914f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\">Theresa May\u2019s private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That May was invited to Goldman Sachs and that she accepted, then, is neither surprising nor remarkable, City insiders agree. While her argument may have been more passionately stated behind closed doors, there was technically no gap between what she said at Goldman and her public position at the time and she was not paid \u2013 in line with a generally adhered-to rule that those in office come for free. Though there are other opportunities for political leaders to snuggle up to top bankers, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/refugee-crisis-dominates-downbeat-davos-2016\">World Economic Forum in Davos</a> and conferences such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/bilderberg-conference-dresden-charlie-skelton-bilderblog\">Bilderberg</a>, building some bridges to Goldman must have felt to May like a smart thing to do \u2013 not least because so many of her recent parliamentary colleagues have ended up with a role in banking as \u201cspecial advisers\u201d: John Major at Credit Suisse, Gordon Brown at Pimco, Alistair Darling at Morgan Stanley, William Hague at Citibank and of course Tony Blair taking a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7186975.stm\">reported \u00a32.5m a year</a> at JP Morgan.</p> <p>She may have had more immediate reasons for moving closer to Goldman, too, and if she made any contacts in the margins of her speech these could actually come in useful amid all the uncertainty over a hard, soft or \u201cdirty\u201d Brexit. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/07/alistair-darling-back-from-brink-review\">memoir Back from the Brink</a>, Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer in 2008, recounts how at one point the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, openly threatened him with no longer buying British sovereign bonds if the government were to introduce a tax on bonuses. Global banks can relocate, and then there is the possibility of a global bank\u2019s chief economist talking down your country. Today\u2019s global mega banks wield immense power and while banks have good reason to lobby governments, politicians have good reason to lobby banks, too.</p> <p>This week, May must have regretted her decision to speak at Goldman, given that the larger public is unlikely to understand that unlike Clinton, who charged an estimated $200,000 per speech, May got nothing. Their audiences appear to have been very different, too. Clinton seems to have spoken mainly to groups of Goldman Sachs clients whom the bank was probably hoping to impress. These are so-called professional asset managers, whose job is to invest the money of pension funds, insurers, rich families or oil-rich countries. Many of them might very well make more than the Goldman Sachs bankers trying to sell them investment products. The term here is \u201cclient entertainment\u201d \u2013 giving your clients something interesting for free in the hope of securing some business later. Recent regulation makes it increasingly hard for banks and brokers to take clients to expensive restaurants, exclusive cultural events or prestigious football, tennis or golf tournaments in exotic locations. But flying out for a speech by a global political celebrity is usually still allowed. In the words of one insider with decades of experience: \u201cBringing in a very expensive speaker is also a way of saying to your clients: \u2018See how much we care for you, that we paid XXX to get this person here! We play in the big leagues.\u201d</p> <p>The same dynamic seems to be at work when global banks bring in a celebrity to speak to their youngest recruits. A young maths student who finished an internship at a big global bank said: \u201cWhen they flew in a famous politician from the other side of the globe just to talk to us interns, you can\u2019t help feeling, well, important. You think, wow, my bank can do this?\u201d</p> <p>All in all, those responsible for crafting Goldman\u2019s image as the world\u2019s most powerful and well-connected bank must have been happy to see this week\u2019s outrage about May\u2019s speech. Could the same be said of those actually in the audience?</p> <p>Goldman\u2019s top brass are paid well over \u00a33m a year, and nearly all of them must make the bank a multiple of that amount in order not to be demoted or \u201cculled\u201d by the end of each year. Based on how much the average senior banker works, \u00a33m breaks down to a little under a thousand pounds an hour. So there they were, sitting in a room listening to May rehearsing the same arguments she had made many times before, positions she was to abandon within days after the referendum. Even worse, May\u2019s speech might very well have contributed to the false sense of complacency in the City over the referendum result. In retrospect, then, attending the speech must now feel to those in the audience like a momentous waste of time. In City jargon: a pretty bad trade.</p> <p><em>Joris Luyendijk is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/swimming-with-sharks-406352.html\">Swimming with Sharks: My Journey into the World of the Bankers</a></em></p>",

  "<p>As the owner of the New Jersey Generals in the short-lived United States Football League, Donald Trump took on the NFL and lost. More than 30 years later, the mogul may have extracted an accidental revenge on the world\u2019s most lucrative sports league via his presidential election campaign.</p> <p>Through week four, the NFL\u2019s television ratings were down by 11%. In an internal memo dated 6 October and obtained by several media outlets, two league executives floated an explanation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no question that unprecedented interest in the Presidential election is impacting primetime ratings - this was clear when Monday Night Football went head to head with the first presidential debate on 26 September,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/784428496089182208/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">the memo read</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe effect of the presidential election on NFL ratings has been seen before: in 2000, during the campaign between George W Bush and Al Gore, all four NFL broadcast partners suffered year over year declines.\u201d</p> <p>This season\u2019s dips, though, are dramatic. The NFL game scheduled against last month\u2019s first presidential debate was down by 40% compared with the game at the same time last year, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2016/10/10/presidential-debate-ratings-giants-packers-sunday-night-football/91859434/\">USA Today reported</a>. For the second debate, which had a lower audience, the NFL\u2019s viewership declined by 20%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/there-are-no-undefeated-teams-left-in-the-nfl-and-thats-a-problem\">The NFL needs help when even its marquee games stink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s transcended news and become entertainment,\u201d said Michael Cramer, a sports and media programme director at the University of Texas. \u201cIf there is a competition between a debate and a football game, I feel compelled in this election to watch the debate, at least part of it \u2026 I\u2019m not happy with the content \u2013 but it\u2019s clearly almost entertainment. You would never say that about a debate between George Bush and Al Gore.\u201d</p> <p>The theory that Clinton v Trump has siphoned attention from the likes of the Green Bay Packers v the New York Giants will be easier to measure once the election is \u2013 finally \u2013 over. More subjective is the impression that while politics may be unusually captivating this year, the NFL\u2019s storylines are less enjoyable than usual. Roger Goodell, the commissioner, <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/10/19/roger-goodell-nfl-not-losing-viewers-but-some-are-watching-less/\">told reporters last week</a> that he believes the league has not lost viewers, but they may not be watching for as long as they used to.</p> <p>In an impatient culture with many entertainment options, one risk is that fans conclude that a competition where three-hour matches might <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704281204575002852055561406\">contain 11 minutes of actual play</a> is best enjoyed through highlights on social media, especially if a lack of narratives and drama erodes the sense of a fixture as viewing that demands to be seen live and in full.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of compelling product on the field this year, which is not unusual \u2013 you have slow baseball seasons and slow NBA seasons and slow NHL seasons and we\u2019ve had NFL seasons in the past which haven\u2019t exactly been the greatest. And I think people notice that,\u201d Cramer, a former president of the Texas Rangers MLB team and Dallas Stars NHL franchise, said.</p> <p>\u201cSome seasons just don\u2019t have a compelling story, and if you asked me what the compelling story was in the NFL this year I\u2019d kind of have to put my feet up and think about it. There\u2019s no compelling game, there\u2019s no compelling on-field story. There are a lot of stories off the field that are eating up news time and broadcast time and none of them are particularly favorable for the league.\u201d</p> <p>No teams remain undefeated, leaving some to wonder whether parity is a synonym for mediocrity. Last Sunday\u2019s 6-6 tie between the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/there-are-no-undefeated-teams-left-in-the-nfl-and-thats-a-problem\">was a primetime festival of incompetence</a>. In <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">four of the league\u2019s eight divisions</a>, only one team has a winning record. Several franchises are stagnant; the only way the league has been able to generate buzz around the Jacksonville Jaguars <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-jacksonville-jaguars-indianapolis-colts-london-international-series-093016\">is by dispatching them to a different continent</a>; last year\u2019s most entertaining team, the Carolina Panthers, are struggling badly.</p> <p>The absences of two famous quarterbacks have been felt, with Peyton Manning retiring to pursue his true calling, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEw4pyf3aeA\">acting in commercials</a>, and Tom Brady \u2013 of the New England Patriots and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/tom-brady-explains-supports-good-friend-trump-article-1.2466564\">the first-class carriage of the Trump Train</a> \u2013 suspended for four games thanks to the Deflategate saga (since his return, Brady has been excellent but, at the age of 39, he is hardly an exciting new talent). The league is becoming younger, <a href=\"https://theringer.com/the-nfl-has-an-age-problem-7068825845e4#.q3acdoom6\">which may be adversely affecting the quality of play</a> as inexperienced players struggle to adapt to complex gameplans.</p> <p>San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been the highest-profile player of the season \u2013 not for his performances, but his refusal to stand for the national anthem in protest against racism and police brutality. Some commentators have cited his actions as a contributing factor to the ratings slide, suggesting that fans are turned off because their escapist fun is being politicized. Fans seem to agree, too: a poll this week found 56% of those surveyed thought player protests had contributed to the drop in ratings (although crucially the poll did not ask whether the respondents themselves had been put off by the players\u2019 actions).</p> <p>\u201cIs it so hard to imagine that a majority-conservative, NFL-watching fanbase might have issue with an overpaid, overrated child of privilege putting his ill-conceived \u2018look at me\u2019 campaign over and above the national anthem?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/10/18/nfl-ratings-drop-kaepernick-protests-continue/\">opined a writer</a> for the rightwing website Breitbart.</p> <p>This claim was dismissed by the NFL\u2019s memo, and football fans have previously stuck by the league amid domestic violence scandals, inept officiating, and a concussions problem so alarming <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/will-smith-concussion-reaction\">it was turned into a Will Smith movie</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46d85e02ed97549c6d448ea4dd56326271a87fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46d85e02ed97549c6d448ea4dd56326271a87fdd/0_120_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raiders fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Football fans are still coming to stadiums in large numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just fans who are turning away. Players seem increasingly disgruntled with a league that cracks down on seemingly small infractions, such as touchdown celebrations \u2013 something the Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman addressed this week in a post on the the Players\u2019 Tribune:</p> <p>\u201cTV ratings are down, and I think we can point to the NFL legislating the emotion out of the game as a contributing factor,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theplayerstribune.com/richard-sherman-nfl-celebrations-personal-conduct-policy/\">Sherman wrote</a>. \u201cThe NFL is enforcing a policy against celebration. Against joy. Against <em>fun</em>. It\u2019s something I know a lot of players are frustrated with, and it appears that fans may be as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/19/roger-goodell-tv-ratings-slump-viers\">Roger Goodell on NFL TV ratings slump: 'We don't think we've lost viewers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think the hardcore football fans are still watching the NFL and always will. I believe it is mostly the casual fans, those who simply look at the NFL as entertainment, who have cut back on their viewership,\u201d said Clark Haptonstall, a sport management professor at Rice University, citing the national anthem protests and concussion concerns as possible reasons. \u201cWhen big hits occur during a game, the casual fan cringes because they know about the health problems that could be coming down the road for that player,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/facing-cash-flow-problems-fanduel-draftkings-ad-spend-vanished/\">The legal struggles and reduced promotional activities</a> of two big daily fantasy sports sites, DraftKings and FanDuel, may have prompted the \u201cunwinding of the fantasy sports bubble\u201d and turned off viewers, according to a report from MoffettNathanson, a research company.</p> <p>All the same, with every NFL team enjoying attendances averaging more than 80% of stadium capacity, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/attendance/_/sort/homePct\">almost all above 90%</a>, supporters are still packing the stands. Regional broadcast ratings remain strong. But if it continues, the national ratings slide will challenge the NFL\u2019s image as a bulletproof property in a state of perpetual growth, with each colossal broadcasting contract worth more than the last.</p> <p>Major networks placed long-term, multi-billion dollar bets that in the age of video on-demand on multiple devices, live sport, and especially the most popular sport in the nation, would continue to be irresistible to advertisers and subscribers.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s possible that scenarios specific to this season have exacerbated a fade that says more about the state of cable television than the sport. The NFL\u2019s memo aimed for a reassuring tone. Over the past 15 years, it soothed: \u201cNFL viewership has increased 27% while primetime broadcast viewership has decreased 36%.\u201d</p> <p>This, though, raises the question of how the biggest fish can continue to thrive in a shrinking pond. As Awful Announcing noted in June, <a href=\"http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/espn-down-1-5-million-subscribers-as-cable-sports-networks-keep-shedding-viewers.html\">ESPN\u2019s reach has fallen</a> from 99 million subscribers in 2013 to an estimated 89.5m last summer, and Fox Sports 1 and NBC Sports Network also trended downwards.</p> <p>In the UK, ratings for some Premier League and Champions League soccer games <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/sky-sports-bt-sport-people-switching-football-off\">have recently sunk by 20-40%</a>, with broadcasters arguing \u2013 and no doubt praying \u2013 that this is a blip with logical explanations, such as match-ups with limited appeal, rather than a sign that the competitions have peaked.</p> <p>In a media market where prices are pushed up by bidding wars and fear of missing out, there may be a time when rising costs and decreasing returns create a point where the gaudy numbers no longer make sense. And, as newspapers have found, embracing social media and internet distribution can boost content consumption, but it is not easy to monetize them.</p> <p>\u201c[The NFL] still continues to be head and shoulders above other categories of sports programming in terms of ratings and viewership,\u201d said Lee Berke, a sports network development specialist. He pointed out that although changes are afoot for next year, a leading ratings measurement service, Nielsen, does not yet track out-of-home viewership, which has grown as technology has evolved to make it easy to watch TV on portable devices.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a short-term issue and it\u2019s based on specific issues in terms of how you measure audiences. Because in part you\u2019ve got audiences now that are consuming NFL games and other sports content across a number of screens, and the measurement data doesn\u2019t capture all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought media rights were starting to crest 10 years ago and I wasn\u2019t alone. And yet they\u2019ve continued because for all of its challenges, all of the cord-cutting, all of the seeming decline across the board, [the NFL] is still compelling television \u2013 you\u2019ve heard the phrase \u2018appointment television\u2019,\u201d Cramer said.</p> <p>He believes the NFL\u2019s future prosperity is less a matter of technological change than of potential cultural shifts. Will we still be sports-obsessed in a decade or two? \u201cPeople want to watch a sports event on the biggest, best, screen available. The real question is: will we maintain an interest in sports as a society the way we have grown it over the past 50 years? And I think right now that\u2019s still very much up in the air,\u201d Cramer said. </p> <p>Amid all the league\u2019s challenges, shortcomings and competing pastimes, he said, viewers \u201cmay just say: \u2018I don\u2019t need it\u2019.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I was sick, but that was to be expected. The New Year\u2019s Eve party had been a good one: 2007 had been a tough year; I had got through four separate operations, each one longer and more involved than the one before. I had been changed, worn a bit thin, and was suffering small bouts of depression. But I was still standing. A new year was to be celebrated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/moment-changed-me-group-therapy-hoffman-process-falling-versions-father\">A moment that changed me: group therapy stopped me falling for versions of my dad | Eleanor Moran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So when I woke up sick, I put it down to the excesses of the night before. There had been a lot of laughter, music, and cheap wine. It had been a fun party \u2013 I never claimed it was a classy one.</p> <p>I felt sick, but it wasn\u2019t a normal sort of nausea. It was a sickness which left me panting and breathless. As the pain in my breastbone increased, and my arm felt as though it had been punched until it was dead, I began to realise something was wrong. Very wrong. I told my husband I thought I was having a heart attack. Understandably, he laughed and told me I had a hangover.</p> <p>I just needed to sleep it off and I would be fine.</p> <p>So that\u2019s what I did. I rolled over and breathed slowly, forcing myself calm until sleep took me away from the pain. I never truly believed that, at not even 30 years old, I could actually be having a heart attack. So I slept, and when I woke up in the early evening, I felt a bit better. Well enough to tell myself I had been overreacting; I just needed to calm down at parties \u2013 a thought that tied in well with my resolution to live more healthily.</p> <p>The next days turned into weeks, and weeks became months. I went from being healthy, to being very, very ill. Yet fear stopped me going to the doctor. Not fear of looking stupid, but fear that my suspicions were correct. That I had something seriously wrong with me, and this time it couldn\u2019t be cut away.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t go to the doctor until July. It took me that long to admit to myself, and my family, that I didn\u2019t have late-onset <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/nov/04/health.lifeandhealth1\" title=\"\">asthma</a>, or severe heartburn. By this point, I couldn\u2019t leave my house at all. Some days I couldn\u2019t leave my bed. Most days my mother, disabled and in pain, had to travel a mile to get my infant daughter from a school less than 300 metres from my front door. I was sick constantly. My heart felt like a leaden weight tucked behind my ribcage, and I could feel its torturous heavy beats in my skull. By the time I broke down in the doctor\u2019s office it felt as though I was staying alive through sheer force of will.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fear stopped me going to the doctor. Not fear of looking stupid, but fear that my suspicions were correct</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was right. It was one of the rare times where being right was no victory. My doctor listened to me as I explained my \u201changover\u201d and how I had been feeling worse with each passing day. As I spoke, he called the nurse, and before I had mentioned having a sick bucket as a constant companion, he had me walking \u2013 slowly \u2013 down the stairs to be hooked up to an ECG machine. I was still saying I was sure I was overreacting as he phoned the hospital, booking me in urgently. I think I was still telling doctors I was sure it was nothing as nitroglycerin was sprayed under my tongue for the pain and I was wheeled into theatre for an emergency angiogram. Dye was injected into my heart and I watched the images unfurl on the screens next to me.</p> <p>As a surgeon spoke, telling me words too big for me to grasp, I nodded as I cried, signing consent forms and blanking out the risks of angioplasty even as they were being explained to me. I cursed myself for being stupid \u2013 for leaving it all so long. It was a terrifying time, as I became used to a changed reality. A slower life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3930beb044e3348a7e97ae3b5a029ea712b12da1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3930beb044e3348a7e97ae3b5a029ea712b12da1/128_236_4938_2963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECG machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was still saying I was sure I was overreacting as they hooked me up to an ECG machine.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group Limited/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following year, as Big Ben chimed in 2009, I raised my glass with a thanks more heartfelt than before, amazed I was still standing. Changed, absolutely, but still laughing, while the music still played and my heart still beat. That New Year\u2019s Day, I was able to jump out of bed and walk along the beach, thankful to be alive.</p> <p>The heart attack taught me, profoundly, not to take my health for granted, and not to sweat the small stuff. My weight bounces up and down, and I suffer from water retention; I don\u2019t like the way I look now, bloated and larger than before, but it\u2019s something I can take time to fix. I tell myself it won\u2019t be for ever. A lot of the little things I do \u2013 writing, sewing and knitting \u2013 help me to cope, and to feel useful since my health problems forced me to stop working. No one would employ me now, not when a \u201cbad day\u201d means I can barely roll over in my bed without needing nitroglycerin.</p> <p>I take my health seriously now. I walk for miles with my dog, and I\u2019m tuned in to what \u201cnormal\u201d means for me. I pick up the small signs that I\u2019m not well sooner than I would have done before.

That lesson has been learnt. I eat healthily \u2013 low fat, low salt, low sugar, lots of vegetables. I cook simply, and I live each day as it comes; when I raise a glass now, I do so with feeling. And when I wake up each morning, I take just a small moment to smile to myself, tell myself that life is good, that I made it through another night.</p>",

But those who did attend waved \u201cTrump/ Pence\u201d and \u201cMake America great again\u201d signs and chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d and \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d with the usual gusto.</p> <p>They nodded approvingly when Trump described his opponent as \u201cunstable\u201d and jeered when Trump reeled off a list of State Department expenditures during Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary, including $79,000 on Barack Obama\u2019s books, $630,000 to try to make State Department Facebook pages more popular and $88,000 to send three comedians to India.</p> <p>They whooped with delight when the showman made reference to Vice-President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-joe-mr-tough-guy-biden\">Joe Biden\u2019s recent comment</a> that he would like to take him behind the gym. \u201cYou know what you do with Biden? You go like this.\u201d Trump turned to one side and blew a puff of air from his mouth. \u201cAnd he\u2019d fall over.\u201d He added: \u201cI dream about Biden. Boy, would that be easy. That would be an easy function.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of the event, two Vietnam war veterans moved through the crowd with a giant Trump/ Pence sign. \u201cNow that\u2019s a beautiful, big sign,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow those are fans.\u201d Later one of them, Tom Line, 68, a retired construction worker, said: \u201cI think Donald Trump will keep fighting. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a man who gives up. None of us really believes in the polls because of the way the situation is with the media. We don\u2019t know who to believe any more.\u201d</p> <p>This view was shared by Wesley Gaul, a 57-year-old consultant. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sign of him giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at all the people here. I live around here and there are Trump signs in every yard and only two Clinton signs in 30 miles. I don\u2019t believe the polls. I think the people\u2019s vote will shock everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was Devon Coffin, 24, a maintenance mechanic wearing a profane t-shirt that referenced Monica Lewinsky. He said: \u201cHe\u2019s doing three rallies a day, seven days a week. That\u2019s not giving up. That\u2019s a man on a mission. We\u2019ve got a broken system and this is our way of taking it back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/26/millenial-voters-us-election-trump-clinton-third-party-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59dt5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2844320\"            data-video-name=\"Generation 'meh': the battle to win millennial voters \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581132a3e4b0219a00d390ff\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026mill2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026mill2_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11991154&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/26/millenial-voters-us-election-trump-clinton-third-party-video\">Generation \u2018meh\u2019: the battle to win millennial voters</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cHillary Clinton is a corrupt globalist.

In May Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html\">told the New York Times</a>: \u201cWord of mouth is the No 1 thing.

And you know, one person goes and they talk about it to 20 people.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Seckely, 39, a US Marine, said: \u201cHe ain\u2019t going to quit. If you follow the numbers of people who come out to these events, you have to believe there\u2019s opportunity. It\u2019s like you go to a football game and the crowd is so big, you play hard.

It wouldn\u2019t bother me either way.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, many of his loyalists are clinging to the hope that his campaign can emulate the shock British vote to leave the European Union in June. Nigel Farage, then leader of the UK Independence party, called it a victory for the \u201clittle people\u201d over the establishment and has appeared alongside Trump at rallies.</p> <p>Marte Sellura, 65, an artist, said: \u201cI feel we\u2019re in a similar situation to Brexit. I listen to Nigel Farage\u2019s speeches all the time. I feel that we in America are in tune with the British on immigration issues. America has woken up: there is a globalist agenda. Those things we though are conspiracy theories are not conspiracy theories any more; they\u2019re happening.\u201d</p> <p>Sellura, wearing a t-shirt depicted a rifle with the slogan: \u201cThe people will never surrender\u201d, also launched a critique familiar to consumers of conservative media such as Breitbart News and Fox News. \u201cThe polls are lying. We all know they\u2019re rigged. The real polls show him 10 or 15 points higher. The only way she can win is to have it rigged horribly. They all know they\u2019re going to steal it. There is massive evidence of voter fraud: dead people are voting, illegal immigrants are voting. It\u2019s been a Democratic tradition.\u201d</p> <p>Sellura also claimed that the involvement of TV presenter Billy Bush, cousin of George W Bush, in the lewd 11-year-old video that rocked Trump\u2019s campaign was evidence of a conspiracy by the \u201cBush-Clinton family\u201d. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re up against a crime family that makes the Russian mob and the Sicilian mobs look like schoolboys.\u201d</p> <p>Trump took his usual swipes at the \u201cdishonest\u201d media during Thursday\u2019s rally, eliciting boos and whistles. Chris Burton, 65, a building restorer, said: \u201cThe media are full of BS it\u2019s unbelievable that people don\u2019t go down and burn the newspapers out of existence. It\u2019s just lies.\u201d</p> <p>Most of those interviewed said they would have to accept the outcome and move on without a violent backlash, but not everyone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live under President Clinton,\u201d said one man, who did not wish to be named. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be a revolution. People will rise up and take over the government. A civil war has happened before so it\u2019s not unthinkable today.\u201d</p> <p>Queuing outside the arena was retired secretary Irena Rus, 75, from Melania Trump\u2019s home country, Slovenia. When she explained she had immigrated legally and learned English, Trump supporters congratulated her and shook her hand. Asked if Trump was losing, she pointed to the long queue and said: \u201cCan you see this? No, I don\u2019t think so, because the news media make him lose. He\u2019s doing a good job campaigning. He\u2019s the only one who speaks the truth.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Political violence in Zimbabwe has increased dramatically in 2016, with record levels of assault, abduction and torture recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/31/zimbabwe-facing-most-intense-unrest-in-almost-a-decade-mugabe-video-report\">as opposition to Robert Mugabe\u2019s 36-year rule</a> escalates. </p> <p>Around 654 cases of political violence were recorded by a local NGO, the Counselling Services Unit (CSU), as of 21 October, compared to 476 cases in the whole of 2015.<br></p> <p>The CSU found that assaults were overwhelmingly perpetrated by the state\u2019s security forces \u2013 including police, military and the secretive Central Intelligence Organisation \u2013 while opposition supporters and civil society activists had been on the receiving end of the increasingly violent treatment.</p> <p>One activist interviewed by the Guardian, Ostallos Gift Siziba, a student protest leader at the University of Zimbabwe, said he was abducted by state security agents in August and taken to the headquarters of Zanu-PF, the ruling party, where he was hung from the ceiling by his feet.</p> <p>\u201cIt is at this time that I experienced brutal, callous and inhumane treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cI was tortured and assaulted with my feet hanging upwards and my head downwards as 21 youths and men exchanged chances to beat me until I passed out.\u201d</p> <p>Siziba said his interrogators demanded information about other human rights defenders, and claims at one point he was dangled over a large drum of sulphuric acid.</p> <p>Siziba was then transferred to the Harare central police station, where the beatings continued. \u201cAt this instant I had lost a lot of blood and I was still bleeding. I was injured in almost all parts of my body. I was denied water, and the right to call my parents, a lawyer, or anyone. I received no treatment and had to become my own doctor,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Siziba\u2019s experience tallies with testimonies from other victims, indicating that it is not just the frequency of political violence that is on the rise, but the severity too. </p> <p>Others victims reported being injected with unknown substances during interrogations, kept in solitary confinement, and subjected to sexual threats.</p> <p>Frances Lovemore, the director of the NGO, said the allegations of torture had become increasingly shocking. </p> <p>\u201cThe injecting unknown substances during torture is of concern, as is the abduction of relatives of human rights defenders when the target cannot be found. The sheer force of the beatings by the police, resulting in long bone fractures and life-threatening soft tissue injuries, is reminiscent of the previous violent responses by the state and ruling party when opposition parties were deemed a threat to power,\u201d Lovemore said.</p> <p>Lovemore\u2019s NGO provides medical and rehabilitation services to survivors of organised violence and torture in Zimbabwe. The statistics are a record of people who have sought medical and counselling assistance from the organisation, and therefore provide an indicative rather than complete picture of political violence in Zimbabwe. The real number of incidents of political violence is likely to be even higher.</p> <p>Popular resistance to Mugabe, the 92-year-old president, has intensified this year before the presidential election scheduled for 2018. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/zimbabwe-protest-leader-calls-for-more-strikes-against-mugabe-rule\">Opposition has been increased by a severe drought</a>, which has left millions hungry, and a cash shortage that is disrupting businesses and has left the government struggling to pay wages. <br></p> <p>CSU\u2019s statistics show that of the 654 incidents of political violence recorded, the vast majority occurred in Zimbabwe\u2019s two largest cities, Harare (334 incidents) and Bulawayo (92), both of which have become centres for the recent wave of political opposition.</p> <p>The CSU found that 45% of victims were of indeterminate political affiliation, and of those with clear links to the opposition movement, more than 52% were supporters of the official opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T).</p> <p>Obert Gutu, MDC-T\u2019s spokesperson, responded to the findings by saying the ruling Zanu-PF\u2019s regime had \u201cover the years routinely targeted MDC supporters for assault, torture and intimidation\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe are the largest and most popular political party in Zimbabwe and the regime is acutely aware of the fact that we command massive support throughout the length and breath of Zimbabwe. Hence, the regime has always targeted our supporters for victimisation.\u201d</p> <p>Linda Masarira, a former National Railways employee turned independent political activist, also suffered at the hands of the Zimbabwean police. She was arrested on 6 July and charged with engaging in violent demonstrations, and spent 84 days in jail before being released on bail.</p> <p>She says she experienced constant physical and psychological abuse while in detention, beginning on the day of her arrest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/zimbabwe-protests-leader-charged-inciting-public-disorder-evan-mawarire\">Zimbabwe protests leader charged with inciting public disorder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was the only female person that had been arrested, made to sit between male people\u2019s legs [on the prisoner transfer vehicle]. They were touching me all over. Police were poking me with baton sticks. They try to take away your dignity and self-esteem,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After leading a protest by prisoners against the poor conditions of the Chikurubi female prison, she was moved to the notorious Chikurubi maximum security facility, usually reserved for male prisoners. There she was kept in solitary confinement for 18 days, and forced to wear leg irons.</p> <p>\u201cThese are some things I had to deal with.

  "<p>Iranian authorities executed three Turkish nationals for drug trafficking last year only 11 days after a high-profile visit to Tehran by Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, it has emerged.</p> <p>Iran \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/iranian-stars-shahab-hosseini-campaign-save-lives-convicts-on-death-row\">executed nearly 1,000 people last year</a>, more than any other country apart from China \u2013 usually refrains from sending foreign nationals to the gallows, especially in cases involving countries with which Tehran has maintained friendly relations. <br></p> <p>The family of a 46-year-old man, Faruk G\u00fcner, a father of nine children, confirmed to the Guardian that he was executed. He was a lorry driver working between Afghanistan and Turkey who passed through Iran. \u201cWe tried for four years to save him. They didn\u2019t tell us that he was going to be executed. They hanged him in the morning; we got the news in the afternoon,\u201d G\u00fcner\u2019s brother said. <br></p> <p>The information about the executions was first received by the Norway-based <a href=\"https://iranhr.net/en/\">Iran Human Rights</a> (IHR), which closely monitors Iran\u2019s use of capital punishment. The group said two other Turkish nationals, identified as Mehmet Yilmaz and Matin, whose surname is not known, were executed at the same time. Activists say drug traffickers do not usually receive a fair trial in Iran.<br></p> <p>Most executions in Iran are for drug offences. As a neighbour of Afghanistan, a leading supplier of the world\u2019s drugs, Iran faces big challenges at home, with a young population susceptible to an abundance of cheap and addictive drugs. However, the alarming rate of executions has sparked a debate inside the country and parliamentarians are considering a proposal to replace the death penalty in such cases with imprisonment.</p> <p>The three Turks were executed in April 2015, a little more than a week after Erdo\u011fan met with Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, and the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in Tehran. <br></p> <p>The countries, which have maintained good ties for several decades, have been at odds over regional issues in recent years and relations were frosty at the time of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s visit. However, they have since improved. Iran firmly backed Erdo\u011fan against the failed coup attempt earlier this year and Turkey is realigning itself towards Russia, Tehran\u2019s main ally. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/iranian-stars-shahab-hosseini-campaign-save-lives-convicts-on-death-row\">Iranian stars campaign to save lives of convicts on death row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>IHR said the convicts were executed at Vakilabad prison in the eastern city of Mashhad after being arrested separately for alleged drug trafficking. \u201cThese three prisoners were reportedly not granted their last prison visit with family members before they were executed,\u201d it said. \u201cAdditionally, close sources say that the Iranian authorities did not inform their families of the executions\u201d until late April but \u201ctheir bodies were reportedly returned to Turkey\u201d in May. </p> <p>G\u00fcner\u2019s brother said his family\u2019s pleas to Iranian as well as Turkish authorities fell on deaf ears. \u201cWe asked help from many places; nobody helped us,\u201d he told the Guardian via telephone. \u201cWe found a lawyer and we went to Iran; we tried to prove that he was innocent, but one day they just executed him. This is inhuman.

We couldn\u2019t even see him for the last time,\u201d the brother added. \u201cThere are no laws in Iran. If he were in another country, at least we would be able to see my brother for the last time. They just executed him without telling us. Everything happened suddenly.\u201d</p> <p> Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, IHR\u2019s spokesman, said it was not clear if the cases were discussed by the Turkish president in Tehran. \u201cIt\u2019s also unclear whether the Turkish government took any action to help save their lives. [The] timing of the executions and lack of public reactions by the Turkish government is highly questionable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Michael, Mehmet Yilmaz\u2019s son, told the IHR: \u201cI travelled to Iran seven times in order to deliver my dad\u2019s medication to him. The Turkish authorities did nothing for my dad. All they did was introduce our family to a lawyer. The Iranian authorities confiscated my dad\u2019s truck, which was worth 80,000 Turkish lira (\u00a321,000). My family is currently still paying off the truck through monthly instalments.\u201d <br></p> <p>Madyar Samienejad, who monitors the human rights situation in Iran, said more than 450 people have been put to death in the country this year. He said at least 264 of them were executed for drug offences. Iran has also been reported to have executed at least seven people who committed their crimes while they were under the age of 18 - two of those executions have been confirmed.The execution of juveniles is prohibited under international law. </p> <p>\u201cMore than any other time, people in Iran, including those in the government and the judiciary or media, are debating whether to abolish [the] death penalty,\u201d Samienejad told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cOn 26 October, [reformist newspaper] Etemaad ran a front-page editorial on abolition of [the] death penalty, which talked about how ineffective this punishment has been. It\u2019s the first time this debate is taking place at such a national level and it\u2019s a positive development highlighting the work of abolitionist activists.\u201d</p>",

Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d says a senior official. They\u2019re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans. Trump\u2019s invocation at the debate of Clinton\u2019s WikiLeaks emails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are \u201csuper predators\u201d is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls \u2013 particularly in Florida.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaGreen/status/791587739246309376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.

This sexy Donatello ... we mean, Donatell<em><em>a</em></em> costume will have all the guys saying \u201cCowabunga!\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a49556/sexy-ken-bone/\">And now we have Sexy Ken Bone</a>, promoted with a \u201cwink, wink\u201d by Esquire and many nudges about his name. Ken Bone, for those not up on the latest internet memes, is a man fond of a red sweater who asked an anodyne question about energy policy in the second presidential debate. The internet instantly turned the man into a meme. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g540n3sLh68\">Ellen created a brilliant dance-off between him and Hillary Clinton.</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-ken-bone-this-is-what-happens-when-real-humans-become-internet-memes/\">Salon claimed</a> he \u201crepresented the humanity lacking in this year\u2019s election\u201d. It follows, therefore, that this internet hero had to become a sexy Halloween costume.</p> <p>In so far as we need to find humanity in the crappy year that is 2016, then Ken Bone is a great character to dress up as for Halloween. But we don\u2019t need to sex him up to do so. There is no sexy Ken Bone for men. There is no sexy nurse for men. Or sexy doctor. And so far I haven\u2019t seen male costumes coming with <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a5973947/dripping-blood-choker-asos/\">collars of \u201cblood\u201d around their neck.</a></p> <p>Look, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being sexy. And let\u2019s face it, for singletons, there is no better strike rate for pulling than a drunken dress-up party, in which case we should all dress in the sluttiest, sexiest, most flattering costumes we can find. But those three adjectives are not the same thing, and that\u2019s my point. </p> <p>What we are now served up for Halloween is a cartoon cliche version of sexy that is pretty much the only choice for female costumes, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-stiffelman/daughter-wants-inappropri_b_12517160.html\">even for eight-year-old girls. </a></p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re having a moment. Donald Trump has exposed in all its ugliness the deep-seated misogyny that exists in our society. His crude treatment of women has forced thousands of women to talk about their harassment and humiliation at the hands of men. What struck many of us about the infamous Trump-Billy Bush recordings were not just how disgusting it was but also how common it was.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">As Suzanne Moore pointed out</a>, we\u2019ve heard men talk about women like this our whole lives. We can\u2019t put all this back in the closet. We can no longer ignore how women have been treated as not quite equal, and judged \u2013 always \u2013 first and foremost on how we look. We\u2019re more than our bodies. </p> <p>No matter how hilarious sexy Ken Bone is, now seems the right time to ditch the sexy Halloween costume and just dress up as some awesome women, scary or not. And what a year for it \u2013 we\u2019ve had female Ghostbusters, and Jane Got a Gun, Alice Through the Looking Glass and Eleven from Stranger Things. And none of these are exactly a turn-off. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">So Trump has crossed a line? His views are as old as misogyny itself | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I decided to ditch the sexy Halloween costumes in 2010 when I dressed up as Margaret Thatcher, complete with a remarkably life-like latex mask I pulled on over my head. I expected to be a bit like Cady from Mean Girls and have people horrified at my terrifying costume. I didn\u2019t expect the horror to begin before I arrived at the party.</p> <p>Walking down Shoreditch High Street in London, people beeped their car horns and screamed out windows, \u201cFuck off\u201d, \u201cDie!\u201d (Thatcher was in hospital with flu at the time), some flipped me the bird. At the party, a man approached me, pointed his finger in my face and growled, \u201cYou ruined my family\u2019s life.\u201d In retrospect, the latex mask may have been a step too far. </p> <p>But the mask did not go to waste. Upon discovering my friend was marrying a Tory with quite strong affections for the Iron Lady, I passed on the mask to her as a wedding gift. She appeared in it as a surprise (and nothing else), morning after wedding night, and well, let\u2019s just say that the moral of the story is that there are all sorts of sexy in this world and they don\u2019t have to come in thigh-high boots and a skin-tight costume on Halloween.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/oct/21/california-company-ebola-halloween-costume-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/42j24\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2179039\"            data-video-name=\"California company defends Ebola Halloween costume \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/21/1413883054445/Ebola-Halloween-costume--001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-450273968\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/21/1413883054445/Ebola-Halloween-costume--001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween/141021EbolaHalloween.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/oct/21/california-company-ebola-halloween-costume-video\">California company defends Ebola Halloween costume</a></figcaption> </figure>"
