  "<p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel defended his decision to finance a lawsuit that bankrupt Gawker Media on Monday, saying the news site was willing \u201cto exploit the internet without moral limits\u201d and \u201cdid something beyond the pale\u201d by publishing a former wrestler\u2019s sex tape.</p> <p>Thiel funded a lawsuit by retired wrestler Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/18/hulk-hogan-awarded-115m-in-damages-in-gawker-sex-tape-lawsuit\">ended in March</a> with a jury\u2019s order that Gawker pay $140m in damages. In June, the media organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">filed for bankruptcy</a> and put itself up for auction; the announcement of a new owner is expected Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/25/peter-thiel-gawker-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-lawsuit\">Billionaire's revenge: Facebook investor Peter Thiel\u2019s nine-year Gawker grudge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/opinion/peter-thiel-the-online-privacy-debate-wont-end-with-gawker.html?smid=tw-share\">an op-ed</a> published by the New York Times on Monday, Thiel justified his support for Bollea by saying that Gawker had repeatedly violated people\u2019s privacy, including his own. In 2007 the site outed Thiel as gay, which he said was \u201cminor in comparison with the cruelties that could be inflicted by someone willing to exploit the internet without moral limits\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt seemed only a matter of time before they would try to pretend that journalism justified the very worst,\u201d Thiel wrote. He noted that Gawker later outed another businessman, though it eventually retracted the article, and that the site published a sex tape of Bollea without consent. </p> <p>Gawker has defended itself in court by arguing that Bollea\u2019s personal life was of public interest because of his celebrity, but a jury unanimously rejected this and found that the site had violated his privacy. </p> <p>In May, Thiel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit\">revealed that he was secretly funding Bollea\u2019s case</a> and said that he has financed other lawsuits, raising fears about the influence of wealthy third-party interests in cases regarding the press. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say this is not the only one,\u201d he told the Times in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html\">an interview</a>, adding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/25/peter-thiel-gawker-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-lawsuit\">his crusade against Gawker </a>was \u201cless about revenge and more about specific deterrence\u201d.</p> <p>Thiel did not mention any other suits in his op-ed and argued that his efforts to punish the site were in fact meant to defend journalism. \u201cA free press is vital for public debate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSince sensitive information can sometimes be publicly relevant, exercising judgment is always part of the journalist\u2019s profession. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to draw the line, but journalists should condemn those who willfully cross it. The press is too important to let its role be undermined by those who would search for clicks at the cost of the profession\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/peter-thiel-republican-convention-speech\">Donald Trump, Peter Thiel and the death of democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The billionaire investor, who has reaped a fortune through companies such as PayPal and Facebook, has drawn criticism from his peers in the tech industry. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the Washington Post in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/01/jeff-bezos-on-peter-thiel-seek-revenge-and-you-should-dig-two-graves\">scolded Thiel in June</a>, saying: \u201cSeek revenge and you should dig two graves, one for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that really how you want to spend your time?\u201d he asked. \u201cAs a public figure, the best defense to speech that you don\u2019t like is to develop a thick skin.\u201d</p> <p>Thiel\u2019s foray into the courts has raised fears in newsrooms about a chilling effect of money in the legal system, though legal experts <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/business/revenge-and-the-future-of-media-finances.html\">say the case is unusual</a> and plaintiffs still shoulder the burden of proof. But the suit prompted broad concern: two Republican senators have <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=cornyn%20grassley%20third%20party%20funding%20courts\">called for more oversight</a> of third-party funding, and some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/business/media/thiel-gawker-fight-raises-concerns-about-press-freedom.html\">editors have aired fears</a> about future activism, especially in the context of Thiel\u2019s support for Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">called for looser libel laws</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elections-2016-donald-trump-worth-reveals-in-deposition-tim-obrien-lawsuit-2006/\">sued at least one journalist</a> whose work he dislikes.</p> <p>On Sunday Trump<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/donald-trump-crooked-media-campaign-polls-free-press-hillary-clinton\"> complained about the free press</a>, tweeting: \u201cIt is not \u2018freedom of the press\u2019 when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\u201d</p> <p>At the Republican National Convention last month Thiel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/peter-thiel-republican-national-convention-proud-to-be-gay\">spoke on behalf of Trump</a> but added: \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to agree with every plank in our party\u2019s platform. But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline.\u201d </p> <p>Thiel repeated this denunciation of \u201cfake culture wars\u201d in his op-ed, and as with his convention speech emphasized his belief that \u201cgay pride shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue\u201d. He called for a bill against revenge porn that would make it criminal to distribute explicit images without consent, calling it \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can begin on solid ground by acknowledging that it is wrong to expose people\u2019s most intimate moments for no good reason,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is the kind of clear moral line that Gawker and publishers like it have sought to blur. But they can\u2019t do it if we don\u2019t let them.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>After a year-and-a-half of finding the humor in some of the bleakest moments in American race relations in decades, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/nightly-show-larry-wilmore-cancelled-comedy-central\">Comedy Central is ending Larry Wilmore\u2019s The Nightly Show</a>. I hesitate to call a satirical half-hour talk show a \u201cgrand experiment\u201d, but it was as close as one can get because the overriding topic of conversation was almost always race \u2013 a subject Americans aren\u2019t always excited to discuss frankly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/nightly-show-larry-wilmore-cancelled-comedy-central\">Comedy Central cancels The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if the network stressed that the show would have mass appeal, the very fact that black and brown faces dominated the program both in front of and behind the camera necessitated discussions of race, far more than on any other late-night talk show. As such, the format of The Nightly Show did not lend itself to the cocktail party vibe of the biggest late-night franchises: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jimmy-fallon\">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-corden\">The Late Late Show with James Corden</a>. A light-hearted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/21/michelle-obama-on-carpool-karaoke-with-james-corden-video\">carpool karaoke</a>-esque segment would jar viewers next to a conversation about the trials of the police officers involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/freddie-gray\">the death of Freddie Gray </a>or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/dallas-protest-shooting-hillary-clinton-email-case\"> the attacks on cops in Dallas</a>. A Hollywood Reporter piece on the cancellation <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/larry-wilmore-nightly-show-canceled-919407\">pointed to Wilmore\u2019s de-emphasizing of so-called \u201cviral hits\u201d</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to have the type of things that [Jimmy] Fallon and [James] Corden do, like the [carpool] karaoke type of thing or lip sync battle and those types of things because those are such pure comic things,\u201d Wilmore had told the Reporter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NysITFb_Wbs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NysITFb_Wbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s peculiar that there would even be a question as to whether The Nightly Show would attempt to engage in that world. Its lead-in was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show\">The Daily Show</a>, the doyenne of modern televised American satire. The Daily Show directly birthed The Nightly Show (and before that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/18/colbert-report-10-best-moments\">The Colbert Report</a>); plus, the stars of HBO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, TBS\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tbs.com/shows/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee.html\">Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> are all Daily Show alums. The viral success of those shows usually comes down to the timeliness and passion of the host\u2019s monologues or a clever remote piece.</p> <p>The Nightly Show shined the brightest with its panel \u2013 a healthy mix of media personalities, such as MTV News\u2019s <a href=\"http://anamariecox.typepad.com/\">Ana Marie Cox</a> and New York magazine\u2019s<a href=\"http://nymag.com/author/Rembert%20Browne/\"> Rembert Browne</a>, and minority comedians including <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/05/mike-yard-nightly-show/\">Mike Yard</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=Grace+Parra&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch\">Grace Parra</a>. At times, it felt like the vital conversations on black and feminist Twitter finally had a safe home on TV. Those conversations could be funny, but they were also vital. In the aftermath of the cancellation, one must ask if there\u2019s still a home for satire from a minority perspective on television.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/michael-che-15486\">Michael Che </a>still holds his seat on Saturday Night Live\u2019s Weekend Update and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/02/trevor-noah-on-replacing-jon-stewart-and-changing-the-daily-show\">Trevor Noah\u2019s hosting of the Daily Show</a> is an important step in the right direction, which Comedy Central president Kent Alterman pointed out in his statement on the cancellation decision. But SNL can\u2019t go into the depth that The Nightly Show could, with a full half-hour devoted to racial issues, and Trevor Noah\u2019s experience as a South African is different from Wilmore\u2019s as an African American. This is not to say that Noah can\u2019t speak on American race issues, but the scars of our particular brand of racism are unique.</p> <p>There\u2019s hope in the form of shows like NBC\u2019s sitcom <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/the-carmichael-show\">The Carmichael Show</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adultswim.com/videos/the-eric-andre-show/\">Adult Swim\u2019s The Eric Andre Show</a>. Both programs look at race in different ways \u2013 Jerrod Carmichael\u2019s series uses the classic family comedy template inherited from 1970s Norman Lear shows like<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/\"> All in the Family</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072519/\">The Jeffersons</a> to tweak American race relations. Andre is far more surreal and casts a sideways glance at prejudice \u2013 smashing his way through his point rather than batting it around gently.</p> <p>The medium of the late-night talk show offers so much to the conversation on race, though. Having a Last Week Tonight or Full Frontal devoted to these issues is needed at a time when there\u2019s still so much resistance to even talking about racism from people like Donald Trump and his cronies. Even with the end of The Nightly Show and black comics such as W Kamau Bell and Hannibal Burress struggling to keep their shows on the air, there\u2019s ample talent waiting in the wings, both as hosts and writers. Minorities and allies need to support these shows when they deserve it. Seek out comics like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UlYe6tap6Q\">Solomon Georgio</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Travon\">Travon Free</a> and The Nightly Show alum <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chescaleigh\">Franchesca Ramsey</a>. Give us the opportunity and we will seize it.</p>",

But he is expected to be no less a powerful surrogate for Clinton, particularly among the blue-collar voters comprising America\u2019s \u2018rust belt\u2019 and upon whom Trump\u2019s narrow path to the presidency is predicated. </p> <p>In his trademark emotive tone, Biden repeatedly hushed a crowd of more than 3,000 who packed into a sports facility to celebrate their native son\u2019s return and hoisted signs reading \u201cWelcome home\u201d. Lowering his voice, the vice-president urged voters not simply to cheer but to fully grasp how Trump\u2019s persona ran counter to the working-class experience the businessman claims to champion.</p> <p>\u201cWhat bothers me most about Donald Trump is his cynicism is unbounded,\u201d Biden said, before invoking the former reality TV star\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d catchphrase.</p> <p>\u201cThink about everything you learned as a child,\u201d Biden said, turning a full circle from the podium to look directly at his audience from all corners of the lectern, \u201cno matter where you were raised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can there be pleasure in division and \u2018you\u2019re fired\u2019?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/27/joe-biden-democratic-convention-donald-trump-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p8dm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2624044\"            data-video-name=\"Joe Biden: Donald Trump has no clue about what makes America great \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"DNC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57996b83e4b09895e2508f41\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/28/160727joe2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/28/160727joe2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/28/160727joe2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/28/160727joe2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/28/160727joe2_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/27/joe-biden-democratic-convention-donald-trump-video\">Joe Biden: Donald Trump has no clue about what makes America great</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Biden was originally scheduled to make his debut on the campaign trail last month at a rally that was postponed due to the fatal shooting of five police officers in Dallas. On Monday, the vice-president echoed many of the themes from the impassioned speech he gave on Clinton\u2019s behalf at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, dubbing once again the notion that Trump represented American workers as \u201ca bunch of malarky\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t care about the middle class,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand it.

As the son of a used car salesman, Biden has weaved his personal story into the political narrative with such repetitiveness over the last few decades that it would border on redundancy coming from any rank-and-file politician.</p> <p>But Biden shared the vignettes from his childhood that have long been a staple of his stump speeches with the same vigor as if told for the first time. There was the image, for example, of Biden finding his harried father pacing back-and-forth at work \u2013 \u201cashamed\u201d to tell his son he had been turned down a loan to send him to school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">Hillary Clinton got a big boost from the convention.

The Democratic nominee took aim at her opponent\u2019s tax agenda, coining as \u201cthe Trump loophole\u201d plans she said would benefit only the nation\u2019s top earners.</p> <p>Clinton countered Trump\u2019s economic message by borrowing a phrase of Biden\u2019s as he sat behind her during her own remarks: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you value.

  "<p>The largest single transfer of Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency was announced on Monday, as 15 long-held men departed the infamous detention center.<br></p> <p>The transfer, officially announced by the Pentagon on Monday evening, brings the Guant\u00e1namo detainee population down to 61. </p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, a close US ally which has accepted former Guant\u00e1namo detainees in the past, took the 12 Yemenis and three Afghan nationals, some of whom the US has held for the 14 years Guant\u00e1namo that has served as a detention facility. The Pentagon thanked the UAE for its \u201chumanitarian gesture\u201d and support for shuttering Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Six of the men had first received clearances for transfer in 2010, after a review early in the Obama administration found them eligible to leave Guant\u00e1namo and unfit for military prosecution.

Those detainees are Mohammed Kamin, Mahmud Abd Al Aziz al-Mujahid, Saeed Ahmed Mohammed Abdullah Sarem Jarabh, Zahar Omar Hamis bin Hamdoun, Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmed, Ayub Murshid Ali Salih, Obaidullah, Bashir Nasir Ali al-Marwalah and Hamid al-Razak \u2013 also known as Haji Hamidullah, an Afghan in his 50s.</p> <p>In 2008 two of the three Afghans, Obaidullah and Kamin, were <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-guantanamo-charges-idUSN9A45605320080911\">charged</a> <a href=\"http://archive.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11748\">with crimes </a> related to terrorism, but those charges <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/guantanamo-trials\">were withdrawn</a>. The remaining 13 detainees transferred were held for over a decade without charges of a crime.</p> <p>Administration officials have said for months that they would speed up detainee transfers this summer, as Obama\u2019s time in office winds down with his promise to close Guant\u00e1namo \u2013 made on his second day in the White House \u2013 still unfulfilled.<br></p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/guantanamo-bay-detainees-release-plan-obama\">reported</a> in May that the Obama administration had reached deals with a half-dozen foreign countries to repatriate approximately two dozen detainees. </p> <p>The 15-detainee transfer is the largest Guant\u00e1namo release during Obama\u2019s presidency. While Obama released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/guantanamo-bay-yemen-detainees-oman\">10 Yemeni detainees to Oman</a> in January and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/16/guantanamo-bay-prisoners-released-yemen-saudi-arabia\">nine more Yemenis to Saudi Arabia in April</a>, Monday\u2019s transfer eclipsed a December 2009 release of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-transfers-12-guantanamo-bay-detainees-afghanistan-yemen-and-somaliland-region\">12 detainees</a> to three countries. </p> <p>Transfers of larger numbers of detainees in a single round was more typical of the Bush administration, which established Guant\u00e1namo as a wartime detention facility in 2002. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans\">'No one but himself to blame': how Obama's Guant\u00e1namo plans fell through</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the detainee population at Guant\u00e1namo now down to 61, 10 of whom are in some phase of the military tribunals process, Obama is closer to what his administration calls an \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d of detainees: those it deems unable to prosecute but too dangerous to release. Obama\u2019s heralded plan to \u201cclose\u201d Guant\u00e1namo involves indefinite detention for that cadre, whose number remains undefined.</p> <p>Yet as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama has shown a willingness to take risks on so-called \u201cforever prisoners\u201d.

  "<p>It is ironic that a former chairman of the Conservative party criticises the independent Electoral Commission for acting \u201cas a commentator and lobbyist on policy and law\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/12/report-stringent-id-checks-cordons-electoral-fraud-pickles\" title=\"\">Electoral fraud crackdown may bring police cordons to poll sites</a>, 12 August) while unilaterally proposing significant changes to our electoral laws.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission was established by parliament in 2000 precisely to provide independent commentary and advice on electoral legislation. Although Eric Pickles is right to highlight instances of electoral abuse, his report ignores the most significant problems.</p> <p>The last general election campaign showed the clear need to reform the laws on spending limits. We need to reassert the principle that rich parties should not be able to \u201cbuy\u201d the election in marginal seats by spending vast sums of money in them, claiming that it is national campaign expenditure and not subject to any limit for spending in the&#xa0;constituency.</p> <p>Many young people, together with those living in the private rented sector or in the most deprived communities, are missing from the electoral register. They don\u2019t count when it comes to drawing constituency boundaries and they are of course much less likely than others to vote because they must get registered before being able to do so, and it is not easy to check whether or not you are registered.</p> <p>We need reforms to improve and safeguard the health of our democracy, but not just those that may favour one political party.<br><strong>Chris Rennard</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>I get nauseous every time I hear the name Ralph Nader. If all those votes cast for him for president in 2000 had gone to Al Gore, we might have been spared the Iraq war, the frat-boy alliance of George W and Tony Blair, and other horrors.</p> <p>So I hate so-called third parties. I prefer to call them \u201cfringe\u201d. I don\u2019t believe that voting has anything to do with the so-called likability of the candidates. Who cares which of them is the one you\u2019d rather meet in the pub? Nor should voting be an act of protest. The Green party zealots who went for Nader because they said there wasn\u2019t a dime of difference between Bush and Gore were tragically wrong.</p> <p>Voting is a sacred duty of US citizenship and as such, the presidential contest is about one central question: in whose hands is the country most likely to prosper, be safe and come closest to the American promise of equal rights for all?</p> <p>Because Trump and Clinton are such disliked and polarizing candidates, I understand why alternatives might appeal. Many voters do want to support someone who most purely mirrors their ideals. They don\u2019t want to vote pragmatically or settle for the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>This is a real dilemma. But 2016 isn\u2019t the year for purity. Casting a vote for any of the alternative party or independent candidates in November could have truly disastrous effects.</p> <p>With Trump on the ballot, the risk of unintentionally helping elect an unstable man who is clearly not prepared for the job is too big. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">past two weeks</a>, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that the pugnacious real estate tycoon has spontaneously combusted, like <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/60468/how-charles-dickens-fueled-world-spontaneous-combustion-truthers\">Old Krook</a> in Dickens\u2019 Bleak House. But by November, as has been true in most recent American elections, the gap between the two candidates will narrow. Even with all the self-inflicted wounds, Trump still starts out with a likely base of 170 electoral votes. Getting the next 100 needed for election will be extremely hard but not impossible. If Clinton is to win the swing states she needs to get to 270, she can\u2019t have too many votes siphoned away by fringe candidates like the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>When I combed through their platforms and records, I, too, found a lot to like about Stein and Johnson, especially after I listened to their one hour, <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/green-party-nominee-dr-jill-stein\">back</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/gary-johnson-on-what-it-means-to-be-a-libertarian\">back</a> interviews with Boston radio host Tom Ashbrook. Stein\u2019s sincerity and smarts were evident. Since she twice ran for governor of Massachusetts and once before for president in 2012 (she received 469,000 votes, more than separated JFK and Nixon in 1960), she was more seasoned as a politician than I expected. Her calls for free college tuition and a 15% federal minimum wage mirrored those of Bernie Sanders, some of whose followers are using the Twitter hashtag #jillnothill. As would be expected of a Green candidate, her top issue is protecting \u201cMother Earth\u201d, by dramatically reducing dependence on fossil fuels and banning nuclear power.</p> <p>Her central message is a direct play for disaffected Democrats: \u201cThe [Democratic party] boat is sinking and it\u2019s taking us down with it. This is the time to get off of that boat. We [progressives] have a lifeboat. It\u2019s called the Green party, so let\u2019s not sink together, let\u2019s sail together!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, the genial former Republican governor of a Democratic state, New Mexico, was popular in office, lowering state taxes, expanding jobs and attracting more businesses. Although he says he\u2019s personally against abortion, he believes it\u2019s the woman\u2019s right to decide. His antipathy to stricter gun laws isn\u2019t surprising for a libertarian, but will turn off liberal voters in urban areas. He\u2019s for legalizing marijuana. His low-tax mantra will appeal to Republicans who think Trump\u2019s economic plan is voodoo, to use an old Geroge HW Bush word. Johnson does seem a viable alternative to Trump for Republicans who just can\u2019t stomach Clinton and perhaps for Sanders Democrats. Maine senator Susan Collins <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/susan-collins-no-clinton-226822\">suggested recently</a> that she\u2019s considering voting Libertarian.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that people will see that we don\u2019t have to sit by the sidelines and watch as the two major parties limit their choices to slightly different flavors of the status quo. It is, in fact, possible to join the fray, stand up for principles and offer a real alternative,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also watched some television appearances by Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old factotum of the Republican party, who is running as an independent candidate. Virtually unknown, he is hardly the GOP\u2019s answer to finding a viable Trump alternative. I do give him credit for having the guts to try to drain Republicans away from Trump, but he just won\u2019t be a factor in November.</p> <p>None of this occasional likability translates into anything meaningful, however. None of these candidates could possibly win. So a casting a protest vote for any one of them is akin to throwing your vote away.</p> <p>The most influence they would hope to wield is if any of them reach 15% in national polls. That way, they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">included in the presidential debates</a>, gaining much wider national exposure. Johnson probably has the best chance to make it in, but Trump opposes anything but a direct one-on-one with Clinton. Some suspect this is a ruse to withdraw from the debates altogether, rather than get creamed by Clinton.</p> <p>This extraordinary election is definitely a two-horse race. But the questions raised by the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump point to an uncertain future.</p> <p>A politically savvy friend of mine, who works for one of the American TV television networks, told me he thinks Trump may be the last GOP presidential nominee. This friend, a Republican, believes the party will never recover from the Trump disaster. It will splinter into various other entities, some of them to sit it out on the fringe.</p> <p>And what of those Democrats alienated by Hillary\u2019s pivot away from the left as she moves into territory vacated by Trump, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/hillary-clintons-embrace-of-kissinger-is-inexcusable/\">courting</a> Republican establishment figures such as Henry Kissinger?</p> <p>If there is no realignment, no recalibration, then the risk is that the angry voices on both left and right find no meaningful outlet. Third parties will never be a significant feature American politics, but after this election, the future shape of the two main ones is a question that cannot be neglected.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama declared Louisiana a federal disaster zone on Sunday after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/louisiana-flooding-cuts-off-roads-homes\">historic flash floods in the state</a> left at least six people dead and caused more than 20,000 people to be rescued.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The storm has put another 12,000 people into temporary shelters, Governor John Bel Edwards said during a press conference. Residents were pulled from water-logged homes, flooded cars and at-risk hospitals across the southern portion of the state, he said. </p> <p>Despite sunny skies on Monday morning, more severe storms from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley were expected later in the day and week, potentially complicating relief efforts in the state.</p> <p>\u201cEven with the sunshine out today intermittently, the waters are going to continue to rise in many areas, so this is no time to let the guard down,\u201d Edwards said, describing the flooding as unprecedented. \u201cThis is a serious event. It is ongoing. It is not over.\u201d He urged people to stay vigilant.</p> <p>Obama issued the disaster designation shortly after speaking with Edwards on Sunday, the White House said in a statement.</p> <p>The US president\u2019s orders make federal aid available in the parishes of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St Helena and Tangipahoa. Other parishes could be added.</p> <p>Rivers in the Baton Rouge area have started to fall, but still remained above flood stage, setting record levels over the weekend, the National Weather Service said Monday.</p> <p>\u201cThe rivers and streams north of Interstate 12 have crested and have started to drop, while those south of the interstate continue to rise,\u201d meteorologist Mike Efferson said.</p> <p>On Monday morning the Comite River, just east of Baton Rouge, dropped nearly two feet from a 34.2-feet level over the weekend. Flood stage is 20 feet. The Amite River at Denham Springs was at 43.5 feet on Monday, after reaching 46.2 feet. Flood stage is 29 feet.</p> <p>\u201cThe area around Baton Rouge could see up to a half-inch of rain Monday, with a 40 to 50% chance in the forecast,\u201d Efferson said.</p> <p>At least 1,700 members of the Louisiana National Guard were activated as a part of relief efforts.</p> <p>Across southern Louisiana on Sunday, residents scrambled to get to safety as rivers and creeks burst their banks, swollen from days of heavy rain that in some areas came close to two feet over a 48-hour period.</p> <p>In Livingston Parish, phone service was spotty due to the high waters and most shelters were full. A Greyhound bus traveling from Memphis, Tennessee, to Baton Rouge was diverted to a shelter because of flooded roadways.</p> <p>Louisiana state police Col Michael Edmonson said helicopters were transporting food and water to those still trapped by floods. Helicopters were also transporting some seriously ill people to areas outside the high waters.</p> <p>While the epicenter of the worst damage, Louisiana wasn\u2019t the only state in the region subject to violent weather over the last several days.</p> <p>The Mississippi emergency management agency said early Monday that damage reports were coming in on the flooding in neighboring Mississippi.</p> <p>Greg Flynn, an agency spokesman, said that at least 71 homes were damaged by flooding in southern Mississippi.</p> <p>Flynn said there are 67 people in the shelter opened in Natchez on Saturday.

Not just in his music, but his writings, speeches and university lecture series. Ahead of a tour with his new group Prophets of Rage \u2013 which includes members of Cypress Hill and Rage Against The Machine \u2013 the Guardian spoke with Chuck on current matters of the state, his frustrations, Barack Obama and the current political landscape.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think songs like Fight the Power or 911\u2019s A Joke still resonate?</strong></p> <p>When I said \u201cfight the power\u201d my influences are about the <em>we</em>, not the <em>me</em>. So people say that stuff I\u2019ve said is still relevant today and I\u2019m glad. But I say it\u2019s <em>still </em>around and <em>will </em>always be around because I didn\u2019t make it up. I was able to write a song that gave narrative to things, but I didn\u2019t invent the sentiment or own the slogan.</p> <p><strong>How do you explain the rise of Donald Trump?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not so much him or even the audacity of Trump \u2013 he\u2019s just a businessman. And as a businessman, he will fight democracy and government, not fight for it. I think after he wins, he\u2019ll sit and enjoy feeling his power for a while and being the businessman that he is, he\u2019ll just go for bigger deals internationally that\u2019ll serve him. I believe his intent is to take over the military. He\u2019ll also work for the prison industrial complex and all its materialistic power structures will thrive with little opposition.</p> <p><strong>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a> showed police encounters with communities of colour are much more likely to end in violence. Why do you think that is?</strong></p> <p>I think \u2013 and this is the first time I\u2019ve really talked about this \u2013 is that policing in the US has been so bad because of state laws. These states have the nerve to make it all about them and no one can tell them what to do. So there\u2019s a huge detachment with these states acting and functioning as a state within other states. The other thing that makes policing so lopsided is that counties have their own policing and jurisdiction and they\u2019re not compliant or united. They\u2019re ran on ego and their own sort of fiefdom. And states are made of many, many counties. Say you\u2019re driving across county lines, each and every county has different systems in place as to how they\u2019re gonna deal with you. Policing is evidently not working in the 21st century United States. </p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts on Black Lives Matter?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a defensive movement. It\u2019s just saying, \u201cHey, you need to treat us like people and that we\u2019re not going to tolerate being slaughtered like pigs or sheep.\u201d The whole thing that thinking that BLM is an offensive movement is wrong. All lives matter, true, but if we don\u2019t treat all lives equally then no lives matter.</p> <p><strong>What do you think President Obama\u2019s legacy will be?</strong></p> <p>When you say \u201chow he\u2019ll be remembered\u201d, the media will be making that judgment call. So the question really is, what is media? Will it be a small group of guys controlling Obama\u2019s narrative? I think Obama is the best we ever had, best that ever did it, but worse is on the horizon. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just worse on the horizon, not the worst. Worst being Trump.</p> <p><strong>How will you personally remember President Obama?</strong></p> <p>Besides my inner most beliefs on what government does, I truly believe he battled with the government. As a black man in the United States with its history, I expect nothing from the government [<em>laughs</em>]. But Obama\u2019s also had to endure such and onslaught of direct hatred from the system. He\u2019s also been so ostracized. I remember eight years of George Bush when everyone was scrambling.

But my main disappointment is that this Coke and Pepsi ran country has made elections this eenie-meenie-miney-mo sort of thing. It\u2019s a game of mathematics and having to choose the lesser of two. </p> <p>I\u2019ve always wondered why the vice0-president doesn\u2019t have more power, like some real actual power. Why did Hillary choose [Tim] Kaine and not make Bernie her running mate? Well the answer is because Hilary is backed by wealthy investors. So, even as we speak now and even with Bernie\u2019s efforts, we\u2019re right back at square one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/killer-mike-bernie-sanders-president-run-the-jewels\">Killer Mike endorses Bernie Sanders for president</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What do you think the single biggest obstacle for the next president will be? </strong></p> <p>Getting attention.

You can be youthful and full of youth, but don\u2019t be a fool for youth; this society tries to make you hang onto your youth by any means necessary. But in doing so you forgo responsibilities and accountabilities of what makes you an elder. There\u2019s no narrative for US citizens to understand the quality of ageing gracefully. </p> <p>Look at all these politicians \u2013 they\u2019re all trying to get their young on and it all feels like high school shit. This Republican convention was a straight-up high school prep rally. And the Democratic convention was just showtime. What does that show a 16-year-old? How do they take it? All you have is this glamour and glitz fake show from the left, and on the right it\u2019s a hate rally.</p> <p><em>Chuck D tour with Prophets of Rage starts 19 August at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia</em></p>",
