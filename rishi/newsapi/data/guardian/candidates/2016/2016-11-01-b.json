  "<p>A US cybersecurity firm hired by a Russian bank to investigate allegations of a secret line of communication with the Trump Organization said on Tuesday there was no evidence so far of substantive contact, email or financial links.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Mandiant, which is owned by the California-based company FireEye, said it examined internet server logs presented to the bank by media organisations investigating the link. </p> <p>The online magazine Slate <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html\">published a story </a>on Monday about communication between a server hosting Trump domain addresses and a server owned by the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, owned by two oligarchs, Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven. Aven worked with Vladimir Putin in city government in St Petersburg in the early 1990s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/trump-organization-server-russia-bank-slate-report\">Trump campaign denies report of Trump Organization tie to Russian bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Slate story, quoting a range of cybersecurity experts, said the communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic, and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive. </p> <p> In a statement, FireEye said it had been presented with a log of the communication between the servers over a period of 90 days, listing the separate contacts. </p> <p>\u201cThe information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign or Organization,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe list presented does not contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity opposed to simple DNS lookups, which can come from a variety of sources including anti-spam and other security software.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">Poll shows Trump and Clinton neck and neck in unpopularity contest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The statement continued: \u201cAs part of the ongoing investigation, Alfa Bank has opened its IT systems to Mandiant, which has investigated both remotely and on the ground in Moscow. We are continuing our investigation. Nothing we have or have found alters our view as described above that there isn\u2019t evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign or Organization.\u201d</p> <p>The allegations have triggered debate among security experts in the US, in the midst of a fierce political row over the role of the FBI. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">Democrats have decried the decision of the FBI director, James Comey,</a> to notify Congress of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">the discovery of new emails</a> relevant to its inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state, without making public parallel investigations into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-ties-north-carolina-rally\">Trump\u2019s ties to Russia</a>. </p> <p>Computer scientists quoted in the Slate story said that the Trump server had a capacity for mass email but was only being used for a small amount of traffic, nearly 90% of which was with servers from a single organisation, Alfa Bank.</p> <p>\u201cThe parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project,\u201d said Paul Vixie, a software expert and one of the creators of the domain name system (DNS) that guides communication on the internet. </p> <p>Robert Graham, a cybersecurity expert and head of Errata Security, dismissed the claims as \u201cnonsense\u201d. He said the domain in question, trump-email.com, was actually controlled by Cendyn, a company that handles marketing for hotels, including Trump\u2019s hotels.</p> <p>Graham also argued that there was no sign of human communication between the servers, which appeared to be looking up each other\u2019s IP (internet protocol) addresses, the first step towards establishing communication. The logs show that two Alfa Bank servers sent a total of more than 2,700 lookup requests to the Trump email server. </p> <p>\u201cThe requests are spread out evenly throughout the day, with no correlation to time zones,\u201d Graham said in an email. \u201cThis would indicate automated tools looking up incoming spam addresses, not humans sending email. If it were sign of human activity, we would see spikes around 9am when people got to work and 1pm when they got back from lunch.\u201d </p> <p>John Bambenek, a consultant with Fidelis Cybersecurity, who has also studied the logs, said there were unanswered questions about their provenance and authenticity.</p> <p>\u201cThe identity of the person bringing the data can be more important than the data,\u201d Bambenek said. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious of the claims that this was gathered legally. They tell an interesting story, but it\u2019s not clear whether there is selection or filter applied \u2026 I smell smoke. I just don\u2019t know where the smoke is coming from.\u2019</p> <p>L Jean Camp, a professor of informatics at Indiana University, said there were still a lot of unanswered questions about the communication between the servers.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t act like a marketing server. Because you wouldn\u2019t use a heavy-duty mailer with over 80% of its communication with just one organisation,\u201d Camp said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any marketing campaign that would do that.\u201d </p> <p>According to Slate, the Trump email domain was hastily reconfigured after a New York Times reporter approached Alfa Bank about the connection in September. On Tuesday, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">reported that</a> the FBI had spent weeks looking into the Alfa-Trump logs but concluded that \u201cthere could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts\u201d. <br> </p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s claim during the presidential debates that Hillary Clinton failed as a senator to close tax loopholes he exploited has been proved at least partially false.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-tax.html?_r=0\">New York Times reported</a> on Monday that the Republican candidate had avoided paying potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes through a \u201csleight of hand\u201d that worried even his own lawyers.</p> <p>Trump in effect traded debt relief for virtually worthless \u201cpartnership equity\u201d to swerve past any tax liability in the early 90s, according to documents obtained by the paper.</p> <p>The manoeuvre came under the scrutiny of Congress in 2004 \u2013 and Clinton, then a New York senator, was among those who successfully voted to outlaw it.</p> <p>Yet in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">second presidential debate</a> on 9 October, Trump claimed that the Democratic nominee had missed her chance to close loopholes that he had merely used as anyone else would.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/donald-trump-1-percent-paying-taxes-politician-populist\">Donald Trump is a 1%er.

Trump\u2019s own lawyers reportedly advised him that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would probably find it improper if he were audited.</p> <p>The paper said the manoeuvre may offer a clue as to how Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-income-tax-returns-published\">posted a one-year loss of $916m in 1995,</a> possibly enabling him to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years.</p> <p>The property tycoon was able to cancel a debt of hundreds of millions of dollars as his casino empire in Atlantic City went bust. Cancelled debt usually is treated as taxable income, meaning Trump would have owed the IRS money on debt that his creditors forgave.

While breaking a precedent running for 40 years, Trump has clung to the excuse that he is under audit, despite no proof that he is and no prohibition for releasing returns under audit. </p> <p>\u201cGiven that Trump was required to file his 2015 taxes recently, he has no reason to withhold it since it is too soon for him to possibly be under audit for those year.

Giving evidence to a committee this morning, he said there probably won\u2019t be a war with Russia next year.</p> <p>The Press Association has the story.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fears that Russia and Nato are on a collision course for war next year have been dismissed by defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon. </p> <p>Fallon insisted that a hot conflict with Moscow was not likely in 2017, as he gave evidence to the Commons defence committee. </p> <p>Pressed about warnings by former Nato deputy allied commander in Europe, General Sir Richard Shirreff, that the plot of his novel 2017 War With Russia was plausible, Fallon said that was an extreme view. </p> <p>\u201cWell, there are a lot of people writing books and trying to sell them, and his is a very good one. However, I don\u2019t agree that war with Russia is likely next year. I think that is too extreme. </p> <p>\u201cWe have seen much greater Russian aggression this year, and in previous years, in terms of long-range aviation, in terms of submarine activity, and the carrier task group that sailed through our waters, the role of Russia in Syria, and elsewhere. But I don\u2019t think that presages an open conflict next year. </p> <p>\u201cAnd I hope that General Shirreff would - and I think he does this - recognise that Nato is now responding. So, Nato is waking up to the challenge,\u201d Fallon said. </p> <p>The defence secretary insisted the decision to send 800 British troops to Estonia next year was intended to create an \u201cearlier tripwire\u201d and act as a deterrent against possible aggression. </p> <p>\u201cThe whole point of forward deployment to Estonia is to arrange, if you like, an earlier tripwire so the force there doesn\u2019t have to wait for tension to escalate. The force will be there from next spring in any event, in all three of the Baltic states. It\u2019s partly reassurance, but it\u2019s also deterrence - to make it very clear to any potential aggressor that Nato is ready to respond.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Astute readers will, of course, realise that the very fact that a \u2018no war next year\u2019 declaration has become newsworthy is itself a matter of some concern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b4273636bc65af1108d84b33c6959042a585d1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b4273636bc65af1108d84b33c6959042a585d1e/0_4_1773_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Michael Fallon arriving for cabinet at Number 10 this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Michael Fallon arriving for cabinet at Number 10 this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5818ab91e4b01c528432f015\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T14:50:18.136Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <strong>Ed Miliband</strong>, the former Labour leader, on Karen Bradley\u2019s statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/793464579250647040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DC, NC and I signed pledge to support Section 40 on costs.

Both involve unwinding significant elements of Leveson, the inquiry set up with cross-party support in the Commons after the phone-hacking scandal, and in truth neither is particularly surprising, although there is one line in the small print that is intriguing.</p> <p><strong>1 - Bradley has confirmed that the government may shelve part two of the Leveson inquiry, the bit that was intended to examine in detail allegations of phone hacking and collusion with the police at News International and other newspaper organisations. </strong>Although part one of the inquiry covered phone hacking, it did not consider allegations in details because at that stage prosecutions were pending. When David Cameron launched the inquiry, he specifically said that a second stage would investigate what happened in detail once the police investigations were over.<br></p> <p>All the key prosecutions have now concluded. Bradley has now launched a consultation on whether to press ahead with part two of the inquiry although the chances of part two actually proceeding are probably no higher than nil. When David Cameron was prime minister it was widely reported that part two would be permanently shelved. Theresa May may seem less interested in schmoozing the media than Cameron, but she is not daft and it is very hard to see why she would want to launch an inquiry that would trigger all-out war with powerful, Conservative-supporting newspaper groups, especially News UK, the successor to News International.</p> <p><strong>2 - Bradley has announced that she will consult on whether or not to implement section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013.</strong> This is also unsurprising. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/01/guardianicm-poll-gives-tories-16-point-lead-over-labour-politics-live?page=with:block-58188023e4b01c528432ef0f#block-58188023e4b01c528432ef0f\">12.59am.)</a> But what\u2019s interesting is that Bradley is consulting on four options: keeping section 40 under review, bringing it in, repealing it, or partially introducing it. It was never likely that Bradley would introduce it, and her comments in the chamber (see, for example, what she said about Peter Preston\u2019s column at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/01/guardianicm-poll-gives-tories-16-point-lead-over-labour-politics-live?page=with:block-58189d5ae4b01c528432efc2#block-58189d5ae4b01c528432efc2\">1.50pm)</a> suggest implementation is not a runner. But she has also included the option of partially introducing part 40 - introducing the \u201ccarrot\u201d (exemption from costs for papers that lose a court case, if they are signed up to a Leveson-compliant regulator) but shelving the \u201cstick\u201d (forcing papers to pay their opponents\u2019 costs even if they win, if they are not signed up to a Leveson-compliant regulator). This would benefit the small number of organised that belong to IMPRESS. Papers signed up to IPSO would probably complain if Bradley were to choose this option (and there is no particular reason to think she will) but doing this would allow her to claim she is salvaging one more vestige of Leveson.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T08:27:24.739Z\">at 8.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5818a1f4e4b01c528432efdc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T14:09:15.796Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bradley\u2019s statement is now over.

It is expected that she will use the statement to unpick one of the consequences of the Leveson report into phone hacking.</p> <p>The Leveson report was published in November 2012 and it recommended a tighter form of press regulation. The newspaper industry accepted the need for some reform, but it strongly opposed anything smacking of state regulation and, after much haggling, a compromise system was adopted. A royal charter was granted in 2013 and that led to the establishment of a Press Recognition Panel (PRP) which has the job of approving Leveson-compliant press regulators. Most national newspaper groups decided not to cooperate with this system and support the Independent Press Standards Organisation, an independent regulator. But a few publications signed up to IMPRESS, an alternative regulator, and last week IMPRESS became the first regulator to get PRP approval.</p> <p>This is significant because, one a PRP-approved regulator is in place, section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is supposed to come into force. This section, passed with cross-party support, is designed to provide \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d incentives to newspapers to sign up to a PRP-approved regulator. The carrot is that papers that belong to such a regulator won\u2019t have to pay the costs of claimants if they get sued for libel, even if the paper loses. The stick applies to papers that don\u2019t belong to such a regulator; under section 40, they will have to pay the costs of people who sue them, even if the paper wins.</p> <p>But section 40 only comes into force if the government activates it. As you can imagine, the prospect of this happening has alarmed the newspaper industry. Bradley has already said that she will take her time before deciding what to do, and in a few minutes we will learn more.</p> <p>Section 40 is not the only stick in the Crime and Courts Act 20113. Section 34, which is already in force, allows the courts to impose exemplary damages (ie, extra, punitive damages, on top of normal libel damages) against newspapers that have not joined a PRP-approved regulator. But exemplary damages are relatively unusual, and so far this section has not caused any problems for newspapers outside the Leveson framework.</p> <p>There is more on this topic<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7576/CBP-7576.pdf\"> in this House of Commons library briefing paper (pdf).</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0520dd0d693620dfb607977c470352249fd20e19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0520dd0d693620dfb607977c470352249fd20e19/0_149_5242_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Bradley, the culture secretary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Bradley, the culture secretary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58189107e4b01c528432ef7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T12:58:27.284Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Dennis Skinner </strong>asks why, if more than 30 years is too long to make an inquiry worthwhile, why it is not long enough to justify the release of some cabinet papers about the strike.

The Tories have a 16-point lead - one point down from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/10/jeremy-corbyn-labour-rehsuffle-continues-labour-reshuffle-politics-live?page=with:block-57fb685ee4b03258bcac6355#block-57fb685ee4b03258bcac6355\">our last poll</a>.

And Labour continues to flounder. If you want to know why Theresa May and her ministers do not seem to be remotely worried about anything the opposition are doing or saying, the answer is in these figures.</p> <p>If there is any reaction to this poll, I will post it.</p> <p>Otherwise, here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9am: </em>The cabinet meets.<br></p> <p><em>10am:</em> The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign holds a press conference in Barnsley.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives a speech on the government\u2019s nationaly cyber security strategy.

  "<p>Recent warnings about Russia\u2019s behaviour have become as numerous as they have been, at times, alarmist. Which isn\u2019t to say they are unfounded. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/31/andrew-parker-increasingly-aggressive-russia-a-growing-threat-to-uk-says-mi5-head\" title=\"\">director general of MI5 in a Guardian interview has now added his voice</a> to a widening group of western officials who describe Russia as a threat, and against which new thinking must be developed. In the past months, Russia has been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-07/u-s-confirms-russia-behind-hacking-attacks-to-disrupt-elections\" title=\"\">accused of trying to disrupt the US election through hacking</a>, it has deployed nuclear-capable missiles in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/russia-confirms-deployment-of-nuclear-capable-missiles-to-kaliningrad\" title=\"\">Kaliningrad</a> and flown bomber planes across Europe. Moscow has pursued policies in Syria that have less to do with fighting Isis than with carpet bombing civilians.</p> <p>If Vladimir Putin\u2019s narrative is to make Russia great again, there is by now little doubt he will resort to a wide spectrum of actions, both hard and soft power, to attain that goal. That western officials have been repeatedly caught off-guard says perhaps as much about the illusions or shortfalls of past \u201creset\u201d policies as it does about the slickness with which the Kremlin has learned, over the years, to read western societies and the way their leaders react \u2013 or fail to. More than a decade ago Mr Putin revealed his thinking in an annual address to parliament comparing the US to a Russian folk tale character, remarking: <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-11/news/0605110171_1_russian-president-vladimir-putin-military-spending-parties\" title=\"\">\u201cComrade wolf knows who to eat.\u201d</a> Few, at the time, could have predicted what would unfold: the first redrawing of borders in Europe through use of force since the second world war (annexation of Crimea), and a pattern of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/cold-war-20-how-russia-and-the-west-reheated-a-historic-struggle\" title=\"\">geopolitical confrontation that some have dubbed cold war 2.0</a>.</p> <p>The Kremlin believes the time has come to seek a form of revenge on the west for having \u201chumiliated\u201d Russia after the dissolution of the USSR. That Russia\u2019s economic collapse in the 1990s and the enlargement of Nato and the EU resulted from decades of communist mismanagement and the legitimate aspirations of nations factors little into this vision. Today the west and Russia find themselves talking past each other on almost all issues. Putin\u2019s propaganda machine has made inroads into the west by exploiting its openness, all the while repressing those who, inside Russia, dare dissent.</p> <p>What is to be done to avoid escalation? Talk of nuclear confrontation has become commonplace in Russia, something that points to the need for renewed deterrence. Making sure eastern European allies are protected is not provocation. Nato\u2019s new deployments in the Baltic region and Poland are a reaction to, and not the cause of, Russia\u2019s military adventurism in its neighbourhood. The best way to discourage more Russian revisionism is to make clear that red lines will be defended. Europe can ill afford to let the worst of the 20th century catch up with it in the 21st century. On wider international issues, pressure must be applied wherever it is smart and effective to do so. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/spain-reviews-plan-to-let-russian-warships-refuel-en-route-to-syria\" title=\"\">Spain\u2019s recent refusal to refuel</a> Russia\u2019s aircraft carrier on its way to Syria was an example of how to catch Moscow\u2019s attention. Sanctions over Moscow\u2019s activity in Ukraine should be kept in place until ceasefire requirements are met. Europeans would do well to forge a common response to Russian policies in Syria, which should be seen as part of a wider pattern: chaos on Europe\u2019s doorstep, including refugee movements, serves Mr Putin\u2019s interests because they feed the illiberal forces of which he approves.</p> <p>This is not to say Russia must be quarantined, nor its leader entirely shunned. Partly what matters is language. Speaking of Russia as a \u201cpartner\u201d no longer equates to realities, if only because Moscow consistently relinquishes genuine cooperation and openly casts itself as an alternative, hostile model no longer very interested in international rules. Diplomacy without leverage can be empty choreography, as talks over Syria have shown. Nor should Russia\u2019s power be exaggerated. Its economy is ailing. It has few allies, with China an awkward friend. Mr Putin may choose to designate external enemies and encourage a fortress mentality for domestic consumption, but that does little to bring the investments his country badly needs if it is ever to modernise. The Russian president has shrewdly exploited whatever gaps western powers have offered him, whether through neglect, divisiveness or miscalculation. Mr Putin once said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/06/chechnya.russia2\" title=\"\">\u201cthe weak get beaten\u201d</a>. He believes the west is weak, hypocritical and decadent. The short-term answer should be a resolute show of transatlantic unity \u2013 a question that hangs over the US election. Dialogue with Russia should come with smart leverage \u2013 neither aggressive nor complacent. It\u2019s likely the Russian question will not go away for a long time yet \u2013 Mr Putin plans to get re-elected in 2018.</p>",

On the positive side, the boost to competitiveness drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output volumes.

  "<p>The pharmaceutical company Shire has reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, its biggest source of revenue since the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/shire-clinches-32bn-takeover-of-baxalta\">$32bn acquisition of US firm Baxalta</a> was completed in June.</p> <p>The London-listed company\u2019s third-quarter results disappointed the City. Shire shares closed down 2.6% at \u00a345.28, the second day of falls, as investors also worried about the future pricing of haemophilia drugs in the US.</p> <p>On Monday, Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for US companies, said it was looking at ways to manage the rising cost of haemophilia medicines.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is expected to tackle drug pricing if she wins the US presidential election. The Democratic candidate has repeatedly lambasted high pricing \u2013 describing that of EpiPen, drug firm Mylan\u2019s emergency treatment of anaphylaxis, as \u201coutrageous\u201d and accusing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-refuses-to-testify-congress-drug-daraprim\">entrepreneur Martin Shkreli of \u201cprice gouging\u201d vital medicines</a>.</p> <p>Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, admitted that firms that managed prescription US drug plans wanted to \u201cmanage a number of categories more tightly\u201d including haemophilia.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in an environment, certainly during a presidential campaign, where price is in high focus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can expect for all our categories, not just haemophilia, tighter management, but we have the programmes in place to make sure this does not affect our patients and has limited impact on our overall business. I remain incredibly confident about the outlook for haemophilia.\u201d</p> <p>\u00d8rnskov said existing patients would not be forced to switch haemophilia medications as this would be considered too risky.</p> <p>The Danish businessman was upbeat about Shire\u2019s new drug for dry eye disease. Launched in August, Xiidra has already taken a 16% market share in the US. The eye drop is expected to generate annual sales of more than $1bn by 2020.</p> <p>Shire said its integration of Illinois-based Baxalta, which specialises in treatments for rare blood conditions, cancer and immune system disorders, was ahead of schedule. </p> <p>Sales of haemophilia medicines, also acquired from Baxalta, fell by 6% to $884m in the three months to 30 September, which Shire blamed on the timing of some large orders. </p> <p>Overall, sales more than doubled to $3.3bn after the acquisition, but this was slightly lower than analysts had expected. Excluding Baxalta, revenues rose 12%.</p> <p>Costs related to the takeover were also higher than Shire expected, partly because it has accelerated some factory closures in the US.</p> <p>Shire is based in Dublin for tax purposes and run from Boston. As announced in the spring, it is pushing ahead with the closure of its Basingstoke office, where 270 people work. </p> <p>The company wants to open an office in the Paddington, London, as its UK commercial base, so it can be \u201ccloser to the heart of life science communities\u201d.

According to the ABC/Washington Post tracking <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf\">poll</a> published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent\u2019s 46%.

Far more important will be the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register\">turnout</a> - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">close in terms of unpopularity</a>. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">revealed</a> last week that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way\u201d intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals and young women.</p> <p>Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups \u2013 because more than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">25m</a> ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election\">predicted</a> to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total. </p> <h2><strong>Higher turnout than at this time in 2012</strong></h2> <p>Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots,  North Carolina, California and nine other states report <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">more</a> early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were small.</p> <h2><strong>Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters</strong></h2> <p>The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young voters \u2013 who are much <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/\">more likely</a> than older voters to lean Democratic \u2013 might be staying at home. In 12 states, fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012.  This could be especially problematic for Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/\">Bernie or bust</a>\u201d sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for Clinton.</p> <p>Young voters aren\u2019t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states \u2013 especially in North Carolina, a state that yields <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">15 of the 270</a> electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests Clinton is in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">close contest</a>. If Trump\u2019s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of sense \u2013 those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 but up among Hispanic voters</strong></h2> <p>The good news for Clinton is that Hispanic turnout is up across all states where early voting data is available. More votes from this strongly Democratic-leaning group is good news for Clinton, but it might not be enough to offset declines in black and young votes. Because Hispanic turnout has historically been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/25/us-hispanic-latino-voters-us-election-2016\">low</a>, it needs to increase significantly for this voting bloc to have a real impact. </p> <p>There\u2019s one other source of potential comfort for both candidates in all this. Maybe early voting behavior is a bad predictor of overall voting behavior. It could be that fewer young voters are casting their ballots now because they are just less likely to plan ahead than they were in 2012. Or Hillary Clinton might not be relying on young people for victory, choosing instead to base more of her potential winning coalition on older Americans who have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p20-573.pdf\">consistently</a> been a more reliable voting group historically. </p>",

This election isn\u2019t just going to be studied by political historians; I reckon Hollywood is going to be mining it for inspiration.</p> <p>By election day the campaign will have run for more than 600 days. Nobody is sure how it\u2019s going to end, although theories abound. However, I do have one spoiler for you. We\u2019re going to miss this election. Really, we are. Sure, we\u2019ll be relieved it\u2019s all over but we\u2019ll also be changed. Sad! So before the dramatic climax, let\u2019s look back at some of the elements that have made Election 2016 a must-watch.</p> <p><strong>Strategic targeting of a female audience </strong></p> <p>Previous instalments of American Democracy have focused on male protagonists. This year, of course, central casting decided to shake things up and make the Democratic nominee a woman. If you\u2019re from the UK, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Moldova, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, or around 60 other countries, the whole first-female-head-of-state thing is an old plot device. But women have been waiting a long time for this moment in the US. Indeed, there are women who have been waiting 96 years for this. Women didn\u2019t get the right to vote in America until 1920, meaning there are women born before female suffrage who are now getting the opportunity to vote for a female president.</p> <p><strong>An inspirational outsider</strong></p> <p>As if potentially having the first female president wasn\u2019t groundbreaking enough, you get a guy like Trump entering the race. An outsider. A guy who inherited a fortune and, through hard work and determination, is still very rich. A guy no one thought would make it in America, let alone run for president. But he pushed through. He said things like they were. He stood up for the small folk: the racists and the misogynists and the homophobes. Truly, Trump is an inspiration to us all. A reminder that if you\u2019re born rich and act like an entitled bigot you too can make it in America.</p> <p><strong>A cameo by an evil Brit</strong></p> <p>The British villain is a Hollywood staple. There\u2019s Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Ian McKellen as Magneto in X-Men. And this election keeps that trope alive and well with Nigel Farage starring as the smarmy sidekick.</p> <p><strong>The threat of an imminent apocalypse </strong></p> <p>How many Trump supporters think he will start a nuclear war? It\u2019s 22%. And yet they are still supporting him. Proof that some people are really committed to drama.</p> <p><strong>Always-on immersion</strong></p> <p>Believe it or not, this isn\u2019t the craziest election ever. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/how-did-hamilton-become-broadway-breakout-hit\" title=\"\">Hamilton</a>, of course, and an election that caused so much bother it resulted in Aaron Burr, a sitting vice president, killing a Founding Father in a duel in 1804. In 1860, Lincoln won the election but lost the south. Gore v Bush in 2000 resulted in a recount. But what none of those elections had was Twitter.</p> <p><strong>A will-he-won\u2019t-he cliffhanger</strong></p> <p>If Clinton wins, is Trump actually going to concede? During the third presidential debate, Trump told the moderator: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-accept-election-result-debate-video\" title=\"\">\u201cI will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense, OK?\u201d</a> Clinton called Trump\u2019s response \u201chorrifying\u201d, but I\u2019ve got to say, the guy sure knows how to keep a storyline going.</p>",

It happened last week at the Daily Commercial, based in Leesburg, Florida, in a conservative-leaning area of the state with a lot of affluent retirees nearby. The editors published an open letter to readers in which they <a href=\"http://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20161023/media-election-and-bias\">wrote</a>:</p> <p>\u201cThe Daily Commercial hasn\u2019t done enough to mitigate the anti-Trump wave in the pages of this paper ... This is not an endorsement of Trump, a candidate whose brutish, sometimes childish antics are responsible for his sizable deficit in the polls. Rather, it is a recognition that you, the voter, deserve better than we in the media have given you. You deserve a more balanced approach.\u201d</p> <p>I have frequently observed in my press criticism that mainstream journalists sometimes place protecting themselves against criticism before serving their readers. This is troubling because that kind of self-protection has far less legitimacy than the duties of journalism, especially when the criticism itself is barely valid. This is how the phrase <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/working-refs-continues-work\">\u201cworking the refs\u201d</a> got started. Political actors try to influence judgment calls by screeching about bias, whether the charge is warranted or not. <br></p> <p>My favorite description of \u201cprotecting ourselves against criticism\u201d comes from a former reporter for the Washington Post, Paul Taylor, in his 1990 book about election coverage, See How They Run. I have quoted it many times:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sometimes I worry that my squeamishness about making sharp judgments, pro or con, makes me unfit for the slam-bang world of daily journalism. Other times I conclude that it makes me ideally suited for newspapering \u2013 certainly for the rigors and conventions of modern \u2018objective\u2019 journalism. For I can dispose of my dilemmas by writing stories straight down the middle. I can search for the halfway point between the best and the worst that might be said about someone (or some policy or idea) and write my story in that fair-minded place. By aiming for the golden mean, I probably land near the best approximation of truth more often than if I were guided by any other set of compasses \u2013 partisan, ideological, psychological, whatever ... Yes, I am seeking truth. But I\u2019m also seeking refuge. I\u2019m taking a pass on the toughest calls I face.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><em>I am seeking truth. But I\u2019m also seeking refuge.</em> What if it\u2019s not possible to do both?</p> <p>This is what the editors of the Daily Commercial failed to ask themselves. And this is what the movement for Trump is forcing journalists everywhere in the US to realize, even if word hasn\u2019t reached Leesburg, Florida. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, Dean Baquet, editor of the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/10/the-new-york-times-dean-baquet-on-calling-out-lies-embracing-video-and-building-a-more-digital-newsroom/\">said</a> Donald Trump had changed journalism. <br></p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was either editor or managing editor of the LA Times during the Swift Boat incident. Newspapers did not know \u2014 we did not quite know how to do it. I remember struggling with the reporter, Jim Rainey, who covers the media now, trying to get him to write the paragraph that laid out why the Swift Boat allegation was false ... We didn\u2019t know how to write the paragraph that said: \u201cThis is just false...\u201d We struggle with that. I think that Trump has ended that struggle.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Some of you may wonder: in 1990, in 2004 or in 2016 how could it be hard to say in a news report \u201cthis is false\u201d when the reporter and the editor are both persuaded that it <em>is</em> false? I have an answer for you. Alongside the production of news, reporters and editors in the mainstream press have for a long time been engaged in another manufacture: persuading us of their own innocence, especially when it comes to a contested election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/evangelicals-support-donald-trump-downfall\">Many evangelicals support Donald Trump.

Enter Donald Trump | Michael Arceneaux</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Trump loses the election, the only unifying issues evangelicals will have left are abortion and their hatred of Hillary Clinton. Even with these, they stand to become less influential in political activity.</p> <p>In the past, candidates\u2019 performances of \u201cChristianity\u201d have been strong points for voters, but Trump\u2019s ascendancy with evangelicals has eviscerated that expectation. Evangelicals, like other voters, can be very pragmatic about the issues they want addressed by the leadership they support. In the 2016 election cycle, evangelicals are concerned about the supreme courts, Isis, Islam and nostalgia, as Robert Jones <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/opinion/campaign-stops/the-evangelicals-and-the-great-trump-hope.html?_r=0\">shows</a>. For evangelical voters, these issues trump the candidate\u2019s personal morality. <br></p> <p>Loyalty to Trump has not only a moral but also a structural cost. It will not mean the \u201cReligious Right\u201d is finished, rather that Catholics, Mormons and other religious conservatives will be better positioned to carry its values, lessening evangelical influence. Mormons have been very <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/utah-mormons-republicans-donald-trump.html\">opposed</a> to Trump, and Catholic voters are evenly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.prri.org/research/prri-brookings-october-19-2016-presidential-election-horserace-clinton-trump/\">split</a> between Trump and Clinton. They, not evangelicals, will be able to claim the values high ground post-election.</p> <p>Trump has also proven that Republican presidential candidates do not necessarily have to pander to power brokers such as Bob Vanderplaats, head of the Family Leader in Iowa, or Tony Perkins of Family Research Council. Trump amassed his own coterie of Prosperity Gospel preachers who were not traditional evangelical leaders, such as Paula White, and as a result reached a whole other segment of the religious population more in tune with Trump\u2019s promise of returning economic prosperity and his use of the media. Even James Dobson, longtime evangelical leader of Focus on the Family, had to use <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-pastor-paula-white-225315\">White</a> to convince his following that Trump was really a \u201cbaby Christian\u201d because she had led him to Christ. </p> <p>Trump has changed the ecosystem of the evangelical world, breaking the usual evangelical <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/130422/ted-cruz-lost-evangelical-vote\">synergies</a> that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio worked diligently during the 2016 presidential campaign. As a result, it will be difficult for those choosing to run in the 2020 election cycle to play the cycle of business as usual in courting the evangelical vote. Merely spouting faith-based language and talking about religious freedom did not gather evangelical votes this cycle as well as Trump\u2019s language of the decline of America, terrorism and fear of immigrants did. Whether Trump knew it or not, his strong language tapped into evangelical beliefs about the \u201clast days\u201d and America\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/67748/biblical-numerology-predicts-trump-will-usher-messiah/\">role</a> in biblical prophecy. </p> <p>Samantha Bee jokingly asked: \u201cAre evangelicals that ready to get the apocalypse going?\u201d by <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/samantha-bee-donald-trump-evangelicals_us_5739d7e2e4b08f96c18396a2\">voting</a> for Trump, but their fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency has activated their apocalyptic fervor. Trump has benefitted indirectly from a strong belief of evangelicals that the two terms of Barack Obama has led the country to the <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/pastor-cruz-we-are-brink-destruction-country\">brink</a> of destruction. Obama was bad enough in their eyes; having the Clintons back in the White House would be the end. </p> <p>So while evangelicals are coming together to support Trump, internal frictions are many. Evangelical women are upset about Trump and the accusations of sexual and verbal abuse of women, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/10/13/no-more-evangelical-women-are-done-with-donald-trump-and-his-misogyny/\">many</a> are angered that their male counterparts have been silent about it. Evangelical women are also large consumers of evangelical media and ministries, and their support of these organizations is crucial. Should they shun both Trump and the predominately male evangelical leadership, it may have a ripple effect in these organizations\u2019 fundraising abilities and their ministerial efforts. </p> <p>Similarly, younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are very <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/donald-trump-evangelicals-republican-vote.html\">opposed</a> to Trump. Jim Wallis of Sojourners is very <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/23/evangelicals-trump-white-conservatives-identity-theft-jim-wallis/92355326/\">vocal</a> that \u201cnot all evangelicals\u201d support Trump, but only white evangelicals are being polled about their political support, not African Americans or Latinos. This brings up the biggest issue that evangelicals face with their support of Trump: that they will be seen as agreeing with Trump\u2019s \u201calt right\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/donald-trump-evangelicals-republican-vote.html\">contingent</a> that is not interested in religion, but rather in white nationalism and the restoration of white America. As a result, evangelicals who have claimed to be \u201ccolorblind\u201d find themselves aligning with hate groups who support Trump and are also against Jews and Israel, both important to evangelicals and their beliefs. </p> <p>All of these issues pose important structural and political problems for evangelicals after the 2016 election. I believe that the various coalitions under the evangelical umbrella will be in disarray. Evangelicals will fade in political and social clout on the national stage regarding religious liberty, abortion and the coveted replacement of Antonin Scalia on the US supreme court. Supporting Trump on election day may have many evangelicals gritting their teeth in the ballot box, but it is nothing compared to the aftermath if their \u201cKing David\u201d loses. </p>",

In 2011, when Abedin was five months pregnant and working as deputy chief of staff in Clinton\u2019s state department, her husband was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/anthony-weiner-resigns-twitter-scandal\">stand down</a> from his congressional seat after he inadvertently tweeted a lewd photograph intended for a woman in Seattle to his 45,000 followers.</p> <p>Two years later, when he attempted a comeback run for New York mayor, he was struck low again when his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/23/anthony-weiner-new-york-explicit-photographs\">digital dealings</a> with a woman calling herself Sydney Leathers were exposed. Then this summer Weiner was revealed to have had an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html\">online relationship</a> with an allegedly underage girl, leading to the announcement of Abedin\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/anthony-weiner-sexting-huma-abedin.html\">legal separation</a> from him in August, and in time to the current FBI investigation into his and Abedin\u2019s emails.</p> <p>Through the thick of all this, Clinton has stood by her woman. It may have had something to do with their shared experience of marital pain: Abedin first started as an intern in \u201cHillaryland\u201d, as the then first lady\u2019s coterie was called in the East Wing, in 1996, two years before President Bill Clinton was impeached for his liaison with a West Wing intern.</p> <p>Or it may be that the two women have simply grown inseparable with the passing of the years, to the extent that Abedin has variously been dubbed \u201cmini Hillary\u201d, Clinton\u2019s \u201csecond daughter\u201d and her \u201cyounger sister\u201d. From that modest beginning as a 19-year-old intern, Abedin has risen from \u201cbody woman\u201d \u2013 a glorified maid \u2013 through travelling chief of staff during Clinton\u2019s first run at the presidency in 2008, to the state department position and now vice-chair of Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>The union is so close that Abedin is said to carry Clinton\u2019s cellphone in her bag, prompting Bill Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/05/06/huma-abedin-hillary-clinton-anthony-weiner-453204.html\">complain</a> that even he can\u2019t get past the gatekeeper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">Clinton emails: FBI gets warrant as Comey told he may have broken law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve shared stories about our lives, we\u2019ve shared more meals than I can count, we\u2019ve celebrated together, we\u2019ve mourned together,\u201d Abedin told <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13464218/huma-abedin-family-job-hillary-clinton-campaign-strategist/\">Vogue</a> earlier this year. </p> <p>What\u2019s different about the current crisis is that though its root may have been Weiner \u2013 yet again \u2013 its danger stems directly from Abedin\u2019s own conduct rather than indirectly in her role as wronged wife.

  "<h2><strong>What\u2019s the problem with Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails?</strong></h2> <p>Clinton used a private email server, situated in her New York home, while she was secretary of state, from 2009 to 2013.

In July, the FBI concluded that Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">should not face criminal charges</a>.

As many as 650,000 messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton-fbi-emails\">Anthony Weiner</a>, a former New York congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/huma-abedin-anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton\">Huma Abedin</a>.</p> <p>Abedin and Weiner separated after Weiner was caught in 2011, 2013 and again in 2016 sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed. Federal authorities in New York and North Carolina are investigating online communications between Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. </p> <p>Senior officials at the Department of Justice expressed concern that Comey\u2019s decision to inform Congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election. But the FBI director went ahead.</p> <h2><strong>What is in the emails?</strong></h2> <p>We don\u2019t know. Comey himself admitted: \u201cThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d Those mails with a connection to Clinton\u2019s server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed. Or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises Clinton even after the election. On Sunday, the FBI obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails. The process will not be finished before election day.</p> <h2><strong>What was the reaction to Comey\u2019s announcement?</strong></h2> <p>The timing, less than two weeks before a presidential election, drew harsh criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. At an organising event in Daytona Beach, Clinton called Comey\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d.</p> <p>Her campaign launched an all-out war on Comey. Chairman John Podesta said: \u201cBy providing selective information, he\u2019s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts.\u201d </p> <p>The wider Democratic establishment also weighed in: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">four senators demanded a briefing from Comey</a> and nearly 100 former Department of Justice officials and prosecutors, both Republican and Democratic and led by the former Obama attorney general Eric Holder, <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/10/30/open-letter-from-former-federal-prosecutors-and-high-ranking-officials-of-the-u-s-department-of-justice/\">signed a letter</a> criticising Comey\u2019s decision.</p> <p>The Trump campaign, meanwhile, was elated. \u201cWe never thought we were going to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to Anthony Weiner,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee told a rally in Nevada.</p> <h2><strong>Did Comey abuse his power?</strong></h2> <p>The nearly 100 former officials criticised his actions in their open letter, which was released by the Clinton campaign. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy, and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections,\u201d they said.</p> <p>In another scathing letter to Comey, the Democratic Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, <strong>s</strong>aid he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/on-clinton-emails-did-the-fbi-director-abuse-his-power.html?_r=0&amp;wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1\">had filed a complaint</a> against the FBI for a possible violation of the Hatch Act.</p> <h2><strong>What is the Hatch Act?</strong></h2> <p>Passed in 1939, it forbids anyone in the executive branch (apart from the president or vice-president) from using his or her official position to engage in political activity. </p> <p>Carolyn Lerner, head of the US Office of Special Counsel, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/the-hatch-act-a-law-misused.html\">wrote in the New York Times five years ago:</a> \u201cAt its best, [the act] prevents people in political power from abusing their positions. It prohibits coercion by a government supervisor \u2013 such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign \u2013 and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking.\u201d</p> <p>In July, the housing secretary, Julian Castro, was found to have <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/18/investigation-hud-secretary-julian-castro-broke-law-endorsing-clinton-hatch-act/87263314/\">violated</a> the Hatch Act when he expressed support for Clinton. Comey\u2019s action, however, is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court.</p> <p>The Republican congressman Trey Gowdy told Fox News on Monday: \u201cIt is laughable that Jim Comey committed a violation of the Hatch Act. I actually know what the Hatch Act is.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrating a selective reading of the act, he continued: \u201cIf the president of the United States actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the United States is not a violation of the Hatch Act, then how is Jim Comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to Congress a violation of the Hatch Act?</p> <p>\u201cHarry Reid knows that this is not a violation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>So why did Comey do it?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Will Hillary Clinton lose the US election because of the FBI email investigation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He told FBI colleagues in a memo on Friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood, but felt obliged to notify Congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed. </p> <p>There have been reports that some members of the FBI were in revolt over Comey\u2019s earlier decision not to recommend charges against Clinton, and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media, leading to accusations of a cover-up, especially if it happened after 8 November. He therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option.</p> <h2><strong>Will these events affect the election result?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Possible but not probable</a>. More than 23 million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so far. Clinton still has a three-point lead over Trump, according to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-emails-comey-poll-politico-morning-consult-230519\">a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted after Comey\u2019s intervention. And a CBS/YouGov survey of likely voters across 13 battleground states showed that only 1% of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her after the announcement. </p> <p>Her campaign said its own volunteers had been fired up and this would kill any danger of complacency. Nevertheless, Trump believes he has some fresh momentum from a saga he has described as \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d. </p> <p>Whichever candidate is dominating the headlines tends to find their poll ratings going down. Clinton probably has enough of a cushion but the bombshell might yet affect tight races for the House and Senate.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2016. An earlier version described Harry Reid as the House minority leader; he is leader of the Democrats in the Senate.</p>",

Among them, according to the DNS specialists: two Alfa Bank servers, which the specialists said accounted for 87% of the DNS lookups involving the Trump Organization server.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s ties to Russia have long raised eyebrows. Several of the Republican nominee\u2019s campaign staffers, including former campaign chair Paul Manafort, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">long maintained business ties</a> in Eastern Europe. Manafort was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">a longtime political adviser</a> to deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a close Putin ally. </p> <p>Also on Monday night, Manafort responded to an <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-making-inquiry-ex-trump-campaign-manager-s-foreign-ties-n675881\">NBC News report</a> that there was a preliminary FBI inquiry into his ties to Russia, calling it \u201can outrageous smear being driven by Harry Reid and the Clinton campaign\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an attempt by them to take the focus off of the FBI\u2019s announcement of last Friday on the FBI\u2019s renewed interest in the Clinton email scandal and the Wikileaks release of DNC and Clinton campaign emails. There is nothing of my business activities to investigate.\u201d </p> <p>The Republican nominee has long praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin and refused to condemn the Russian regime\u2019s hostile actions towards neighboring countries, including Ukraine. He has even criticized Hillary Clinton for her criticism of Putin and the United States to cooperate with Russia in Syria, where the Russian air force has been repeatedly conducted air strikes on civilians in Aleppo.<br></p> <p>Further, Trump has long worked with Russian business interests in real estate projects. His son, Donald Trump Jr, said in 2008, \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201d</p> <p>Hillary for America senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan called the alleged \u201csecret hotline\u201d between the Trump Organization and Russian banks \u201cthe key to unlocking the mystery of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis line of communication may help explain Trump\u2019s bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many pro-Kremlin positions throughout this campaign,\u201d Sullivan continued. \u201cIt raises even more troubling questions in light of Russia\u2019s masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia\u2019s meddling in our elections.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Just a week to go. The overwhelming sense I get from people here in Muncie is that they just want it to be over. Their impatience isn\u2019t just election fatigue \u2013 it\u2019s feels like a kind of nervous exhaustion brought on by the clear fragility of the whole enterprise formerly known as American democracy. But the other thing that\u2019s happened, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the email leaks</a> on Friday, is that Democrat supporters are abandoning the notion that Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory will be a formality and are now trying to get their heads around the possibility of a Trump victory. </p> <p>With all the drama and hoopla it\u2019s possible to lose sight of the fact that after eight years of Barack Obama, America may now be set for another milestone with the election of its first female president. The fact that it has achieved this later than many other western nations, amid a campaign seeped in misogyny and machismo, should not detract from the fact that it is happening. </p> <p>So this week I asked women in Muncie how they felt about the chance that Clinton might become president. The town is divided ideologically, generationally, racially and by party on the matter \u2013 but the bottom line seems to be that many will vote for her even if only a few are enthused by her. Some loathe her but most, including those who are not enamoured with her, are angry that she\u2019s being judged by a double standard and believe that this speaks to a broader problem in American society.</p> <p>You can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/ng-interactive/2016/oct/11/view-middletown-gary-younge-us-presidential-election\">catch up on the project in full here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/11/us-election-gary-younge-muncie-indiana\">send us your thoughts or recommendations here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/183617795414091/\">get involved on Facebook</a> here.<br></p> <p><strong>Gary Younge</strong><br>editor-at-large <br>The Guardian</p>",

Meanwhile, tensions between the Russia and the US are \u201cat their highest since the pre-Gorbachev period\u201d, according to Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of the journal, <a href=\"http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/\">Russia in Global Affairs</a>.</p> <p>Lukyanov, writing in the latest edition of the Daily Telegraph\u2019s supplement, <a href=\"http://rbth.com/\">Russia Beyond The Headlines</a>, argues that it is \u201cunderstandable\u201d that the situation has deteriorated because President Barack Obama \u201cdoes not think it necessary to build relations\u201d.</p> <p>He accuses Obama of a \u201clove of external effects and striking statements with little substance behind them\u201d. Unsurprisingly, he offers no view on President Vladimir Putin\u2019s relationship-building skills.</p> <p>But help may be at hand. In a separate article, Alexander Bratersky finds reasons to be cheerful in the possibility of Donald Trump entering the White House.</p> <p>In a piece headlined \u201cSo who would Russians vote for?\u201d he believes the Republican candidate as a better bet than Hillary Clinton to mend diplomatic fences. </p> <p>He quotes some eminent authorities to prove his point, such as Russian pop singer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Kirkorov\">Philipp Kirkorov</a> (no, neither have I). </p> <p>He was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37291290\">quoted by the BBC in September</a> as saying: \u201cIf Donald Trump becomes president, relations between our two countries will become better\u201d.</p> <p>Bratersky sees virtues in Trump\u2019s flamboyant, anti-establishment approach and writes: \u201cThe fact that Russian state TV has often given Mr Trump favourable coverage, while ridiculing Mrs Clinton, has also contributed to his popularity in Russia\u201d. </p> <p>But all is not lost should there be a Clinton victory: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a possibility that her husband, Bill, might be able to smooth relations between Mrs Clinton and Mr Putin...</p> <p>When Bill Clinton visited Russia in 2010, Mr Putin used the Russian form of familiar address <em>ty</em> rather than rather than the more formal <em>vy</em> when in conversation with Mr Clinton.</p> <p>It is known that Mr Putin uses this form only to address foreign leaders with whom he is on good terms.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then comes another revelation, courtesy of Mrs Clinton\u2019s emails: Hillary and Vladimir both like polar bears and tigers. Trump that, Donald!</p>",
  "<h2>Clinton campaign unleashes on FBI\u2019s Comey</h2> <p>The Clinton campaign, in full battle mode, is seeking to deflect attention from the latest email revelations by pointing to allegations that the FBI director, James Comey, sought to withhold evidence of Russian support for Trump for fear of influencing the election. Citing reports on CNBC and in the Huffington Post that Comey privately urged against naming Russia for allegedly meddling in the election, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, said the move was \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d and \u201cimpossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard\u201d.

The <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/28/a-closer-look-at-the-gender-gap-in-presidential-voting/\">gender gap</a> looks likely to be greater than in any previous election.

The most obvious difference is partisan. Like other Trump voters, women who are voting Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">can\u2019t bear her</a>. At last week\u2019s meeting of the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government (CDCGG), a conservative campaigning group where half of those in attendance were women, one woman asked: \u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d Another replied: \u201cLook at the kind of women who are standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Responses to Trump\u2019s statements also broadly divide on partisan lines.\u201cThey said he was sexist because he called that beauty queen who\u2019d put on weight Miss Piggy,\u201d said one of the women at CDCGG. \u201cBut women say that kind of thing about women all the time.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to Trump\u2019s assertion that he \u201cgrabs women by the pussy,\u201d Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and whose only previous presidential vote was for Obama in 2008, said: \u201cIt does bother me but personally I\u2019m not easily offended. I\u2019ve heard worse, I\u2019ve seen worse, I\u2019ve experienced worse \u2013 and all of a sudden these people haven\u2019t heard all these things before. You\u2019re kidding me. I think the outrage is overplayed for votes.\u201d </p> <p>Cathy Day, 48, an English professor at Ball State University who originally backed Bernie Sanders, says: \u201cSince Trump has started boasting about sexually assaulting women the importance of her being a woman has definitely started to speak to me more.\u201d</p> <p>But like many women here who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/20/middletown-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-muncie\">originally voted for Sanders</a>, Clinton still does not appeal to Day, who displays a sign for every other Democratic candidate in her front yard but the presidential nominee, even if she will vote for her. \u201cAs a woman it was kind of hard for me to hear some of the anti-Hillary stuff when I was campaigning for Sanders because I think a lot of it came from a place of misogyny,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes it was women saying it. But I identify as a working-class woman. My class identity is very important to me and her candidacy didn\u2019t really speak to me on that level.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan Aprill, 23, of the Progressive Student Alliance, backed Sanders and is now voting for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important that there could be a female president,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for us too and it\u2019s about time. Of course it\u2019s emblematic. I just wish it was a different woman. I\u2019m voting for another female candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Sousa, who says she is not a \u201crabid Hillary fan\u201d herself, believes a higher bar is being set for Clinton than her male counterparts of the past. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of women who detest her intensely,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for this statement but I heard someone say: \u2018We\u2019ve gotten used to voting for males we don\u2019t like. We\u2019ve held our nose and we\u2019ve voted for them for whatever reason. But we aren\u2019t used to doing that with a woman.\u2019 Our culture holds women to a higher standard. </p> <p>\u201cI always thought that was an excuse not to treat women equally. It hasn\u2019t been that long since women got the vote \u2026 not even a century yet. So you couldn\u2019t find the perfect woman to run for president any more than you could find the perfect African American to be the first African-American president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9/0_429_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Views are also shaded quite heavily by race. Sanders won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, but Clinton won handily in Whitely, the black part of town on the east side. \u201cI\u2019m 33 years old,\u201d says Monique Armstrong, the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.motivateourminds.org/about-us/\">Motivate Our Minds</a> which is based in Whitely and offers after-school and recreational activities to children and teens.</p> <p>\u201cI remember when Hillary was first lady. I\u2019m married but I have not changed my name [as Clinton didn\u2019t initially in her career]. I\u2019m a leader in an organisation. I\u2019ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to improving the lives of children. So when I think about the things they don\u2019t like about her as a candidate they are probably the same things they don\u2019t like about me.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, there seems to be a generational divide. For younger women, who are far more likely to vote for Clinton than older women, the historical relevance of her possible election may not resonate so much.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for women who are in their 20s or 30s to understand what women in their 60s and 70s went through when they were coming up that age,\u201d explains Sousa, who several readers suggested we spoke to. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women of my age who felt themselves passed over because they were female or were verbally harassed just in thoughtless ways rather than mean ways who do value what she has come through. Women who know that they can get into law school and medical school have a whole different perspective on our history as women.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the campaign season, the local LWV proposed a forum at which candidates from all the parties could explain their policies as it related to women, as they have often done in the past. The Republicans refused to participate.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the things we raise as being of concern to our members they are consistent,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cThey\u2019ve been there for decades. They are pretty mainstream. But now those positions have been identified by some on the far right as being too far left. So the Republican party chair said the candidates didn\u2019t have to participate in our forum and that meant the Democrats couldn\u2019t either. So it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Most women I\u2019ve spoken to in Muncie think the prospects for gender equality are improving both here and beyond, but there is still significant work to do. To that extent it is fairly typical of America.</p> <p>According to a recent poll, women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years by a ratio of almost two to one. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/president-poll-women-hillary-clinton.html\">three-quarters of women</a> think there\u2019s some or a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace and believe women doing similar work are getting paid less than men.

Since Shilts\u2019s death (itself related to Aids), his overwrought emphasis on Dugas has been widely criticized by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/anthony-petro-after-the-wrath-of-god/\">Aids historians</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=kZOso0FMsrMC&amp;q=and+the+band+played+on#v=snippet&amp;q=and%20the%20band%20played%20on&amp;f=false\">social scientists</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046389/\">public health researchers</a> \u2013 particularly for framing \u201cthe epidemiological spread of the epidemic as very much a <em tabindex=\"-1\">moral</em> failing on the part of this flight attendant,\u201d as scholar <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/anthony-petro-after-the-wrath-of-god/\">Anthony Petro puts it</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Indeed, those of us who study Aids have long known that long before common symptoms such as Kaposi sarcoma and pneumonia were showing up among hemophiliacs and gay men, they were likely affecting homeless people who lived off society\u2019s radar, people who used IV drugs and those who avoided medical treatment out of fear. As activist Betty Williams told the<a href=\"http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/bwilliams.pdf\"> Act up Oral History project</a> in 2008: \u201cI actually believe that Aids kind of existed among this group of people first, because if you look back, there was something called junkie pneumonia, there was something called the dwindles that addicts got, and I think this was another early Aids population way too helpless to ever do anything for themselves on their own behalf.\u201d</p> <p>What is newsworthy about the Nature study is that, by \u201cjackhammering\u201d the decaying RNA of decades-old blood samples, epidemiologists have proven that the strain of HIV Dugas had was already circulating before he was a carrier. The Times article also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html?_r=0\">poetically points out</a> an irony: Dugas was never supposed to be known as Patient Zero, but as Patient Letter O, for \u201coutside southern California\u201d.</p> <p>So why, then, did the myth of Patient Zero live on for so long? Why was he, or anyone, scapegoated in the first place?</p> <p>Both happened because we like to blame individuals (especially queer folks, women, immigrants and people of color) for diseases, particularly communicable ones that involve sex. Societally, it is far easier to blame them for disease rather than to deal with the complex medical, political and epidemiological causes \u2013 just as it has been easier to unfairly malign Dugas all these years.</p> <p>In white America\u2019s long, ableist history of considering itself well unless made unwell by those it considers <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/3560422/Technologies_of_Blood_Asylum_Medicine_and_Biopolitics\">sick outsiders</a>, Dugas was just one of many individually maligned as pariahs. </p> <p>They include <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Typhoid-Mary-Captive-Publics-Health/dp/0807021032\">\u201cTyphoid\u201d Mary Mallon</a>, an Irish immigrant blamed for typhoid transmission and kept in isolation for 26 years on an island in New York City; <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/notorious-h-i-v\">Nushawn Williams</a>, convicted for transmitting HIV to nine young women and \u2013 despite having long ago finished his sentence \u2013 kept in<a href=\"https://www.poz.com/article/hivpositive-convict-nushawn-williams-remain-civil-confinement\"> \u201ccivil confinement\u201d indefinitely</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/a-black-body-on-trial-the-conviction-of-hiv-positive-tiger-m?utm_term=.dyLKjPy6e6#.tul8rPXOJO\">Michael \u201cTiger Mandingo\u201d Johnson</a> (whom I have covered at length and is the subject of my doctoral dissertation), who was convicted of four people to HIV and transmitting the virus to one person despite there being no RNA evidence used to even see if Johnson and his sex partner shared the same strain of HIV. (Johnson is serving a 30-year prison sentence in Missouri, often in solitary confinement, in a state where the average sentence for second-degree murder is only<a href=\"https://doc.mo.gov/Documents/publications/Offender%20Profile%20FY14.pdf\"> 25 years</a>.)</p> <p>But while blaming diseases on individuals \u2013 or even criminalizing them, as people with HIV are in more than <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html\">30 US states</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hivjustice.net/news/new-report-shows-hiv-criminalisation-is-growing-global-problem-but-advocates-are-fighting-back/\">70 countries</a> \u2013 may make well people feel weirdly superior, it doesn\u2019t do much about curing or curtailing the transmission of communicable diseases. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/\">According to</a> the World Health Organization, Aids has killed about 35 million people, and about 37 million people are currently living with HIV globally. Threatening them for living with such a treatable disease only increases its stigma, forcing them into the shadows and decreasing the likelihood that others at risk will get tested.<br></p> <p>We would do well to look at the Nature study\u2019s new timeline and ponder if HIV was circulating among IV drug users in the early 1970s. Many such people avoided healthcare settings which they (rightly) believed could be punitive \u2013 which could have aided HIV\u2019s transmission. We as a society are in part to blame, then, for creating the condition in which the epidemic could take hold \u2013 just as we are now responsible for allowing punitive laws that specifically target HIV to continue letting it flourish. </p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that societies begin to understand that a disease exists and is worthy of treatment only when it begins to affect people (or animals) whose lives the society values. When Aids was only affecting homeless people and IV drug users in the US, there was not a critical mass of care about them to make it register. Aids began to come into some focus when it affected homosexual men, not because gay men\u2019s lives were valued by US society at large (they weren\u2019t), but because amongst them were some powerful, often closeted, white gay men who were raised to believe their bodies were important and infallible. </p> <p>When they believed that their bodies were unfairly giving out on them (and threatening to out them), these men \u2013 along with out lesbians and gay men and transgender people of all races \u2013 did something about it, founding groups like <a href=\"http://gmhc.org/\">Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/\">Act-up</a>. They applied so much pressure that scientific and political communities had to verify that Aids existed.<br></p> <p>Hastening this process was news that hemophiliacs and others receiving blood and organ transfusions were affected. These people \u2013 particularly children like Ryan White \u2013 were considered \u201cinnocent\u201d and worthy of protecting from the disease, unlike homosexuals like Dugas who were considered guilty for getting it and for giving it to others.</p> <p>Since the disease wasn\u2019t given public attention until it infected those with societal clout, is it ever right to out one believed to be \u201cPatient Zero\u201d? As a journalist, I understand the desire to do so to tell a story. Times story author Donald G McNeil Jr <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/sunday-review/the-ethics-of-hunting-down-patient-zero.html?_r=0\">defends</a> the practice epidemiologically, saying stopping such people is important in stopping epidemics. But he uses the term \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d, which sounds too much like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/25/hillary-clinton-race-crime-justice-reform\">super-predators</a>\u201d and is too pejorative for my taste, with both terms overburdening the individual rather than the conditions they inhabit.</p> <p>In her new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Not-Abuse-Overstating-Responsibility/dp/1551526433\">Conflict Is Not Abuse</a>, novelist and Aids historian Sarah Schulman writes about how the transmission of HIV to millions worldwide is a normative human experience unworthy of criminalization or stigma. Dugas was innocent not just because RNA now says so, but because <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/10002442/Statement_of_Ownership_An_Autethnography_of_Living_with_HIV\">all people who live with HIV or who die of Aids are innocent</a>. </p> <p>Let\u2019s allow Dugas\u2019s most recent exoneration to be his final one, and let\u2019s take this chance to retire the idea of the HIV/Aids scapegoat. Let\u2019s stop the shame and blame, so that we may move on the challenge of tackling the real, treatable and preventable ways HIV is transmitted.</p>",
  "<p>The spectacle of Donald Trump repeatedly demeaning and insulting just about every minority group in the US during his campaign for the presidency has been toxic and unprecedented. High up on the long list of ignominious behaviour was the contempt he displayed for people with disabilities in his mocking of a disabled reporter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video?CMP=edit_2221\">captured on video</a>.</p> <p>As with the battles disabled people have fought in Britain against austerity policies from the bedroom tax to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/21/work-programme-creates-48000-long-term-jobs-three-years\">work programme</a>, Trump\u2019s casual disdain is a potent reminder of how fragile inclusion and hard-fought-for disability rights can be.</p> <p>Beyond the media focus on the race for the White House a <a href=\"https://issuu.com/rudermanfoundation/docs/voting_accessibility_white_paper_fi\">new report</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.rudermanfoundation.org/\">Ruderman Family Foundation</a> explores evidence that, regardless of political rhetoric, people with disabilities in the US routinely encounter barriers within the broader electoral process.

Alternative options such as absentee ballots or assistance with casting a vote aren\u2019t adequate substitutes for a fully accessible, inclusive system it argues because, among other things, these can impede a voter\u2019s right to choice and privacy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/27/operation-disabled-vote-politicians\">Disabled people don\u2019t matter to politicians. To change that we must vote | Sharon Brennan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other hurdles it lists involve election materials and online voter registration (for example for people with visual impairments), poll workers who are poorly trained in disability access and limited resources to improve services. In 2013, the <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/654098.pdf#http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/654098.pdf\">US Government Accountability Office [pdf]</a> estimated that in 2008 73% of polling stations had \u201ca potential impediment\u201d, something this latest report rightly concludes is \u201cstunning and troubling\u201d. Almost three-quarters translates as millions of disabled voters possibly being denied their vote.</p> <p>The report also says stigma is a huge problem, especially for people with learning and mental disabilities. According to research, in <a href=\"http://www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1kgFTxMFHZE%3D&amp;tabid=315\">27 US states</a> large numbers of people in these groups are barred from or have <a href=\"http://disabilityjustice.org/right-to-vote\">restrictions placed on voting</a>.</p> <p>It might be tempting to think of voting access for people with disabilities as a predominantly US problem but as the last UK general election showed, it is far from alone. During that election activists including Operation Disabled Vote, which <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/election-2015-bus-tour-highlights-disabled-peoples-voting-power\">campaigned</a> on voter registration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/25/disabled-people-shut-out-lack-access-polling-stations\">highlighted the obstacles</a> in place across Britain. Meanwhile a report from the charity Scope, found two-thirds of polling stations had at least one significant barrier to access. <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/press-release/people-learning-disabilitys-passion-politics-thwarted-system-excludes-them\">Research</a> published in 2014 by Mencap revealed that 60% of people with a learning disability reported difficulties registering to vote.</p> <p>When it comes to mental health, charities including Mind and Rethink Mental Illness have argued for years that vulnerable people such as those who are homeless with mental health problems can face multiple barriers to voting. None of these problems, be they in Britain or the US, are universal or irreversible. During the 2016 presidential campaign it has been encouraging to see positive perspectives on disability. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly highlighted disabled people\u2019s employment rights and other areas where exclusion and underrepresentation are common.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/eu-referendum-push-to-improve-voting-turnout-for-psychiatric-inpatients\">EU referendum: push to improve voting turnout for psychiatric inpatients</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in the run-up to next week\u2019s election, activists in the US have been mobilising and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/22/a-political-profile-of-disabled-americans/\">political engagement is high. </a>The American Association of People With Disabilities launched a successful campaign in the summer promoting voting accessibility and registration among the millions of people with disabilities who are eligible to vote. Grassroots activism has also been spurred into action with networks such as <a href=\"http://signvote.org/\">SignVote</a>, for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, and <a href=\"https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/tag/crip-the-vote\">Crip the Vote</a>, an online campaign encouraging disabled people to participate in local and state elections as well as voting for president.</p> <p>The right to vote, and not being precluded from exercising that right, is fundamental to citizens in any society wishing to call itself democratic or inclusive. It is intolerable that people continue to face barriers to voting because of their disability.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2016 to add a reference to the Ruderman Family Foundation.</p>",

Soon after launching his presidential campaign, Trump said of the Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war John McCain: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d</p> <p>It later emerged that Trump had been granted four education draft deferments and one medical. The latter was due to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html\">bone spurs in his heels</a>.</p> <p>Cohen, who was McCain\u2019s best man, recalled: \u201cI was outraged about it. To this day John McCain can\u2019t lift his arm to shoulder level. To say that about what he went through being tortured, his sense of patriotism, from a man who avoided the draft with a bone spur? No, I don\u2019t think so. It turned me immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the Republican primary in which Trump dismissed rivals as \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb Bush, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/04/20/little-marco-lying-ted-crooked-hillary-donald-trumps-winning-strategy-nouns/\">\u201cLittle\u201d Marco Rubio</a> and \u201cLyin\u2019\u201d Ted Cruz.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone out of his way to demean, degrade, denigrate and delegitimise,\u201d Cohen said, \u201call the Ds you can think of.

It\u2019s one thing to diss John McCain but he\u2019s a big boy and can look after himself.

To the dismay of his party, Trump took the bait and talked about Machado for days, telling Fox News: \u201cShe gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sees the entire universe in terms of how it affects him,\u201d Galen said. \u201cHe simply doesn\u2019t have the temperament to be president of the United States.

  "<p>In April 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/22/thefarright.france\">stunned all of Europe</a> by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the French left \u2013 including communists, Greens and the Socialist party \u2013 threw their support behind the incumbent president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jacques-chirac\">Jacques Chirac</a>, a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen\u2019s Front National (FN), depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 5 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/france.thefarright2\">Chirac won the election</a> with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. \u201cWe have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country \u2013 but tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1969902.stm\">Chirac declared in his victory speech</a>. Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la R\u00e9publique, he lauded them for rejecting \u201cintolerance and demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties.</p> <p>Jean-Marie Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain \u2013 and his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than Jean-Marie Le Pen ever attempted to. And by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa/0_0_3824_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen addresses the Front National (FN) party\u2019s May day rally in Paris in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites \u2026 the Front National May day rally in Paris in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Le Pen\u2019s own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right: unlike her incendiary father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/06/front-national-wins-opening-round-in-frances-regional-elections\">upwards of 40% of the vote</a> in regions from Calais in the north to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in the south.

Europe\u2019s new far right is poised to transform the continent\u2019s political landscape \u2013 either by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years ago \u2013 the young, gay people, Jews, feminists \u2013 may join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac\u2019s historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/3\">was gunned down</a> by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as \u201cscapegoats\u201d. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn\u2019s eponymous party \u2013 the Pim Fortuyn List \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/16/eu.thefarright\">became the second largest in the Netherlands</a> with 17% of the vote.</p> <p>Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative.</p> <p>It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a \u201cbackwards\u201d and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/danish-peoples-party-triumphant-in-european-elections\">Danish People\u2019s Party</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/afd-leader-frauke-petry-criticised-comparing-migrants-compost-germany\">Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways.</p> <p>Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a US-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was \u201cdefending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,\u201d argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women\u2019s liberation and gay rights.</p> <p>Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in the late 1990s. The party\u2019s then-leader, Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. \u201cHe had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,\u201d said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I cold-shouldered him \u2026 He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garb \u2013 \u201ca form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,\u201d as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/beyond-tolerance\">a New Yorker profile</a> once described it \u2013 he redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93/128_291_1872_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pim Fortuyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pim Fortuyn was an electrifying figure in the Netherlands, a country known for its staid politics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nijhuis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\">Theo van Gogh was murdered</a> by a young Dutch-Moroccan, Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the Somali-born Dutch parliamentarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayaan-hirsi-ali\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> \u2013 a vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services.</p> <p>The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Geert Wilders</a>, to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein\u2019s VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the country \u2013 and has remained so ever since.</p> <p>For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac\u2019s trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn\u2019s assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People\u2019s Party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12% of the vote \u2013 transforming it into a kingmaker in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election\">Danish People\u2019s party leader demands border crackdown after election success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn\u2019s party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them.</p> <p>The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats \u2013 promising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: \u201cThey took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say.\u201d Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that \u201cthe best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence\u201d. He was wrong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/jean-marie-le-pen-fined-again-dismissing-holocaust-detail\">detail of history</a>\u201d into a genuine contender for the presidency.</p> <p>\u201cVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,\u201d Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. \u201cI fired them all \u2026 all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the FN\u2019s youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party\u2019s former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews\u2019 hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, \u201cyou will be attacked straight away,\u201d Rochedy said. \u201cThere is such self-discipline these days. They are so afraid they\u2019ll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the party\u2019s detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen. \u201cToday our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop\u201d old tropes about fascists and racists. \u201cAt a certain point this argument loses its force,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause voters see clearly that there\u2019s absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left \u2013 and other constituencies \u2013 who could never have imagined voting for her father\u2019s Front National.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb/0_242_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on a FN campaign office reading \u2018Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-racist graffiti on a FN campaign office \u2026 but Le Pen claims that \u2018this argument loses its force because voters see clearly that there\u2019s nothing in our platform that resembles fascism or racism\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Le Monde\u2019s Olivier Faye <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/12/l-attraction-en-hausse-du-front-national-aupres-de-la-communaute-gay_4900269_823448.html\">has written</a>, she is \u201ctrying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN \u2013 that of homophobia\u201d. And it is working:<strong> </strong>a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32% \u2013 up from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012.</p> <p>As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: \u201cFor a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the<em> banlieues</em>,\u201d Le Pen told me. \u201cIn a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that.\u201d</p> <p>Among French voters threatened by the country\u2019s new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across Europe. In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,\u201d the prominent philosopher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/right-wing-new-reactionaries-stir-up-trouble-among-french-intellectuals\">Alain Finkielkraut</a>, declared in January during <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/chroniques/juppe-finkielkraut-le-grand-debat-du-point-13-01-2016-2009511_2.php\">a debate</a> with the centre-right presidential candidate Alain Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 who has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that \u201cthe public good isn\u2019t in the clouds, it\u2019s made from tangible things \u2013 the French of Proust and Montaigne \u2026 the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy\u201d.</p> <p>Finkielkraut, a 67-year-old Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen\u2019s deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago \u2013 that the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac \u201csaved\u201d the republic from Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: \u201cThe future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,\u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2026 in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation \u2013 in the camp of respect, not that of rejection.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen years later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/why-does-france-keep-getting-attacked\">the terrorist attacks</a> on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. \u201cAnti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,\u201d he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it \u201cshould be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism\u201d. The French must, he insisted, \u201cavoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn\u2019t only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies.\u201d</p> <p>He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to \u201creconquer\u201d its \u201clost territories\u201d \u2013 by which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. \u201cIntegrating people is not telling them \u2018You are how you are and we are how we are\u2019 \u2026 Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he warned darkly, \u201cat best we\u2019ll have secession and at worst civil war\u201d. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the \u201cplanned demise of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of B\u00e9ziers, Mayor Robert M\u00e9nard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/algeria-insurrection-bombings-independence-france\">Algerian independence</a>. M\u00e9nard comes from a family of <em>pieds-noirs</em>, French settlers in Algeria. He regards the Evian accords that ended the Algerian war as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d, and those who tried to preserve French Algeria as heroes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7/0_271_4135_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine le Pen with young FN supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU, and the elderly voted to leave, in France it\u2019s the opposite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Pennant/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France \u2013 who dream of an era they never witnessed \u2013 than with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen\u2019s victory. \u201cThey are afraid of leaving the euro,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are afraid of huge changes.\u201d Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. \u201cThey just want to go back 30 years,\u201d he said of his erstwhile colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a discourse that doesn\u2019t at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right \u2013 the former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe.</p> <p>As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a Liverpool-born academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/france-power-elitism-peter-gumbel\">many of them</a> graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration \u2013 \u201care so disconnected from ordinary people\u201d that even former Marxists won\u2019t consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got a big political question here about who looks after you,\u201d Hussey said. \u201cThis is a very communist way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters \u201cused to be socialists, but they aren\u2019t any more\u201d, she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a socialist concept,\u201d she insisted \u2013 Le Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich.</p> <p>\u201cI defend fraternity \u2013 the idea that a developed country should be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks.\u201d And she has seen results. She points to the northern Pas-de-Calais region. \u201cIt was socialist-communist for 80 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI won 45%.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>At the same time as Marine Le Pen<strong> was</strong> working to \u201cde-demonise\u201d the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam.</p> <p>Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an \u201c<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-netherlands-idUSKCN0RA0WY20150910\">Islamic invasion</a>\u201d \u2013 the sort of comments that landed him in court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">on charges of inciting racial hatred</a>, which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression.</p> <p>The presence of \u201cmasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 across Europe\u201d, Wilders warned at the peak of last year\u2019s refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to \u201cour prosperity, our security, our culture and identity\u201d. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders\u2019s warning, attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/thousands-riot-in-small-dutch-town-over-plan-for-asylum-seeker-centre\">block the resettlement of asylum seekers</a> in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff\u2019s car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140/0_0_4308_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and Moroccan-born Dutch citizens became \u201cMuslims\u201d. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance \u2013 wearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan \u2013 became politically loaded.</p> <p>The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can\u2019t shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees \u2013 one of his latest memes is simply \u201cDe-Islamise\u201d \u2013 to win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away.</p> <p>By framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left \u2013 including anti-racism and anti-colonialism \u2013 have now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. \u201cIdealism has been bureaucratised,\u201d argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. \u201cAnd when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it.\u201d That\u2019s why there is such a strong anti-PC tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">Geert Wilders trial throws Netherlands' divisions in sharp relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Marine Le Pen\u2019s FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (\u201cNo Style\u201d), a popular Breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. \u201cIt is massively important,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Tilburg University\u2019s Merijn Oudenampsen, \u201clike a social movement\u201d. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn\u2019s murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of \u201creactors\u201d on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning.</p> <p>The right\u2019s newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and \u201cyou were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up\u201d. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. \u201cAs soon as you say anything other than \u2018immigration is a problem\u2019 or \u2018Islam is the cause of terrorism\u2019 \u2026 the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you.\u201d</p> <p>A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, \u201cthe economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture \u2013 but none of them have any idea about theology\u201d. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today\u2019s extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left \u2013 which does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh\u2019s killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a Marxist,\u201d the security official quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking hard to be a salafi.\u201d</p> <p>As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right\u2019s tirades about \u201cIslamisation\u201d. These days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives \u2013 the people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. \u201cThere is a sense that, \u2018We are welcoming and then they do this,\u2019 says Bas Heijne. \u201cThey have been terribly let down in their good intentions.\u201d And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened \u2013 and some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims.</p> <p>The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the Moroccan-born Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/parades-end-2\">first joined in Amsterdam\u2019s legendary gay pride parade</a>, he was, as he puts it, the \u201cfirst hetero-active Muslim\u201d to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, \u201cOh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,\u201d he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did.</p> <p>But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch\u2019s are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them.</p> <p>In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders\u2019s PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have new enemies and we need new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe\u2019s capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. \u201cAnne Frank wasn\u2019t betrayed by the Germans,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut by Dutch people. Regular Dutch.\u201d Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. \u201cThe trains for the Jews will always come,\u201d he added, ominously. \u201cI\u2019d rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains.\u201d</p> <p>He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. \u201cIf I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I\u2019d be very uneasy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It\u2019s the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. \u201cEvery Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,\u201d he told me menacingly. \u201cWilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands\u2019 centre-right VVD in the 1990s \u2013 and was briefly Wilders\u2019 boss when he was a young aide in the party office \u2013 the rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base: \u201cThey made a major mistake,\u201d he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with \u201cthe choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born \u2026 and they\u2019ve paid for it dearly\u201d. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10.</p> <p>Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. \u201cTheir message to the Labour party,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018You ignored us. You let it happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Danish People\u2019s Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats\u2019 traditional base \u2013 people who fear that the \u201cbread will be buttered more thinly\u201d, as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Kastrup/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DPP has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. S\u00f8ren Espersen, the DPP\u2019s deputy leader, doesn\u2019t think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. \u201cWhen one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,\u201d he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. \u201cAnd why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he\u2019s done it.\u201d</p> <p>The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The 41-year-old Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party\u2019s political misfortunes.</p> <p>For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant \u2013 or majority unemployed \u2013 he says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party\u2019s leaders: \u201cMayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change.\u201d But the party leadership \u201cshut their eyes\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammad-cartoons\">the Muhammad cartoons</a>. In 2005, the editors at Jyllands-Posten, Denmark\u2019s largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months \u2013 through a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams \u2013 the cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. Suddenly, the DPP\u2019s platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum.

Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. \u201cWe social democrats must accept that there is a clash,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help \u2026 but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state.\u201d Frederiksen continued: \u201cMy position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism \u2013 the sort of place that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/\">Bernie Sanders liked to mention</a> at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/danish-parliament-approves-plan-to-seize-assets-from-refugees\">jewellery law</a>\u201d, which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00a31,200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. \u201cThe goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,\u201d he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. \u201cMore important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,\u201d he added. And it wasn\u2019t just the DPP and government who supported it \u2013 the Social Democrats voted for it, too.</p> <p>Bent Melchior, Denmark\u2019s 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior\u2019s family paid the equivalent of \u201calmost a year\u2019s rent of a six-room flat\u201d just for his own passage. \u201cDenmark is not a poor country, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Melchior says. \u201cThere\u2019s food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>The road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor.</p> <p>Herlev\u2019s mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. \u201cWe have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,\u201d Petersen warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protest against denmark cartoons in iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper led to protests across the world in 2006, the DPP\u2019s anti-Islamic rhetoric gained more traction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government \u2013 one that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state\u2019s integration policy have failed to see. \u201cA lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,\u201d Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. \u201cIf your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,\u201d he argues.</p> <p>Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them \u2013 assuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have consequences for the politicians \u2026 because they don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u201d Either way, it plays into the DPP\u2019s argument. \u201cImmigrants can\u2019t do right,\u201d said Gyldal Petersen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re unemployed they\u2019re a burden to society. When they\u2019re in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year\u2019s French election or Wilders\u2019 PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties \u2013 and media institutions \u2013 has been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back.</p> <p>Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won \u2013 regardless of the outcome of next year\u2019s elections. \u201cThe PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate.\u201d</p> <p>If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits \u2013 and flaws \u2013 of their policies and counter their messages of fear.</p> <p>Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/brexit-vote-poor-elite\">one more thing nobody asked them about</a>. This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as Jean-Marie Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory.<strong> </strong>In a park near Calais\u2019 castle-like town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town\u2019s centre-right mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/1000-children-left-in-calais-refugee-camp-say-charities\">it was dismantled this month</a>. \u201cThose who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren\u2019t French, can do whatever they want,\u201d they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is \u201ctoo soft\u201d.</p> <p>If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. \u201cThey\u2019re sending them to all the little villages in France,\u201d says Samuel. After they start to open businesses and bring family members, \u201cin two years the village will be dead\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/birth-of-populism-donald-trump\">Us v Them: the birth of populism | John B Judis | The Long Read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About a mile down the road, the Calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire.

Calais depends on British tourism and revenues are down sharply. The result is crippling economic and social malaise: \u201cFind a doctor who wants to move to Calais. Find a surgeon who wants to move to Calais,\u201d Vercucque exclaimed. \u201cYou work your whole life, you pay off your house and you lose money.

This is the fast-forward button stuck on manual; Lazarus on steroids. It identifies Gove as a man with a brassy neck. But it also marks him out as a man of his time.</p> <p>Perhaps he is informed by the parallel&#xa0;refusal of his hero Tony Blair to accept his fate as one from whom much of the public demands reflection and silence. If Gove is brass-necked, Blair boasts solid platinum.</p> <p>The former premier will very publicly, without prompting and at any time of his choice, pronounce <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tony-blair-claims-labours-drift-8996440\" title=\"\">on the state of Labour</a>, on the Middle East, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04ddsrg\" title=\"\">on Brexit</a>, untroubled by the fact that every cause he espouses becomes weighted by his history and baggage. He must be on the stage, he cannot abide the circle, even at the front with a tolerable view, even when that seems most palpably appropriate. With charges still on file about a Labour party ruinously severed from its base, a war fought without justification, and a fortune amassed in unseemly fashion, Blair has proactively redeemed himself.</p> <p>And perhaps he is right to do so, for he is a relatively young man, and we obviously have no clear idea of what we expect from those who offend or fall from grace. Should there be a sin-bin for purgatory of short duration?

Successful business folk are culturally permitted to go bankrupt and to blithely start again, for the business of the United States is business. Other public figures, scandalous one day, relaunched the next in politics and showbiz, can do the same thing.

The IRS views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income - which would normally mean that after the floundering of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strategy - known among tax practitioners as a \u2018stock-for-debt swap\u2019 - relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.</p> <p>Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Trump campaign dismissed the Times\u2019 allegations, which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cYour e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\u201d Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks told the New York Times. \u201cYour thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe.

But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation.</p> <p>The Republican nominee has for months warned supporters of a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target.</p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters.</p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California and whose <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore arm bands that identified them as an unofficial \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d and erected posters warning against voting fraud. The RNC dismissed the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d last week.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s exit pollers, self-titled \u201cvote protectors\u201d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisation\u2019s website late last week. The organisation is still encouraging its volunteers to live stream video from polling stations.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Stone and the Trump campaign for a response to the recent lawsuits and is awaiting a response.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58179028e4b08d944ba4cb70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-roberts\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:40:57.738Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hillary Clinton sought to play down the impact at her first public event of the week.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this,\u201d she told a rally in Ohio. \u201cNow what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander-in-chief.\u201d</p> <p>But there was less direct criticism of the FBI than over the weekend and Clinton said they were welcome to look at the emails of her aide Huma Abedin.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and it\u2019s a good a question,\u201d she said to boos from the young crowd at Kent State University in Ohio.</p> <p>\u201cBy all mean they should look at them and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails: there is no case.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58178ba5e4b0219a00d3ab3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:31:29.225Z\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s companies have deleted thousands of documents and records from court proceedings, often defying court orders, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/11/donald-trump-companies-destroyed-emails-documents-515120.html\">according to a Newsweek investigation</a> - despite his anger at Hillary Clinton deleting emails from her private server.</p> <p>Journalist Kurt Eichwald explains the tactics Trump would use to hide documents: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the course of decades, Donald Trump\u2019s companies have systematically destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, digital records and paper documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders.

Because of security concerns, little information about this time has previously been made public:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>McMullin joined the CIA as a student trainee while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. He would alternate semesters between the university and training at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. During that time, he spent a year in Israel and Jordan learning Arabic. He also worked for a refugee resettlement program run by the United Nations.</p> <p>After graduating in 2001, McMullin joined the CIA\u2019s directorate of operations, which runs clandestine missions abroad. He was in a computer training class at Langley headquarters when the 9/11 attacks occurred. After that, McMullin\u2019s 18-month training to be an undercover operative was sped up, and he soon found himself in a southwest Asian country where the U.S. military was deeply engaged in the new war on terror. The specific country remains classified to protect his contacts there.</p> <p>The CIA station chief who supervised McMullin in his first overseas assignment told me that McMullin stood out among all the new case officers because of his insistence on going outside the safe confines of the embassy to meet and develop human- intelligence assets. As a Mormon, McMullin could not indulge in the vices that often help to build such bonds, so he used his piousness and his experience before college as a missionary in Brazil to his advantage.</p> <p>... McMullin served his later years as an undercover officer in Iraq while the U.S. military was battling a brutal Sunni insurgency and collecting intelligence on what was then called al-Qaeda in Iraq but is now the Islamic State. McMullin worked in Iraq until 2010, when the country achieved a degree of stability and the terrorist threat was temporarily minimized.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58177231e4b08d944ba4caa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:37:02.264Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CNN 'completely uncomfortable' with leaked Clinton debate question</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>CNN is \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d with news that acting DNC head Donna Brazile allegedly leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas released a statement on the revelations from today\u2019s latest Wikileaks release of emails supposedly from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, that show Brazile alerted Clinton that a question on the Flint water crisis would be asked during her debate with Bernie Sanders. </p> <p>Pratapas\u2019 statement reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile\u2019s resignation as a CNN contributor.

Recall that Mr. Comey\u2019s authority extends only to supervising the gathering of facts to be presented to Justice Department lawyers for their confidential determination of whether those facts justify a federal prosecution.</p> <p>Nonetheless, in July he announced that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would seek to charge her with a crime, although Mrs. Clinton had classified information on a private nonsecure server\u2014at least a misdemeanor under one statute; and although she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information such that it was exposed to hacking by hostile foreign nations\u2014a felony under another statute; and apparently had caused the destruction of emails\u2014a felony under two other statutes. He then told Congress repeatedly that the investigation into her handling of emails was closed.</p> <p>Those decisions were not his to make, nor were the reasons he offered for making them at all tenable: that prosecutions for anything but mishandling large amounts of classified information, accompanied by false statements to investigators, were unprecedented; and that criminal prosecutions for gross negligence were constitutionally suspect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former AG Eric Holder\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eric-holder-james-comey-is-a-good-man-but-he-made-a-serious-mistake/2016/10/30/08e7208e-9f07-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html?utm_term=.bb2886061c76\">Washington Post op-ed</a> today also points out Comey\u2019s previous public statements in July about Clinton\u2019s emails were problematic and against DOJ policy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This controversy has its roots in the director\u2019s July decision to hold a news conference announcing his recommendation that the Justice Department bring no charges against Hillary Clinton. Instead of making a private recommendation to the attorney general \u2014 consistent with Justice Department policy \u2014 he chose to publicly share his professional recommendation, as well as his personal opinions, about the case. That was a stunning breach of protocol. It may set a dangerous precedent for future investigations. It was wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the weekend, the Clinton campaign got nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and Department of Justice officials, including Holder and former Deputy AG Larry Thompson, to sign an open letter questioning Comey\u2019s behavior.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department\u2019s widely-respected, non-partisan traditions. The admonitions that warn officials against making public statements during election periods have helped to maintain the independence and integrity of both the Department\u2019s important work and public confidence in the hardworking men and women who conduct themselves in a nonpartisan manner.</p> <p>We believe that adherence to longstanding Justice Department guidelines is the best practice when considering public statements on investigative matters. We do not question Director Comey\u2019s motives. However, the fact remains that the Director\u2019s disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election.
