  "<p>A decade after its reputation was shredded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-katrina\">Hurricane Katrina</a>, Barack Obama praised America\u2019s federal disaster relief agency for embracing a \u201cchange of culture\u201d as he surveyed recovery efforts following the latest natural disaster to hit Louisiana.<br></p> <p>In 2005 former president George W Bush told Michael Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), \u201cBrownie, you\u2019re doing a heck of a job\u201d, in response to Katrina. Ten days later Fema had become shorthand for incompetence and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/09/hurricanekatrina.usa3\">Brown was forced to quit</a>, a setback from which Bush\u2019s standing never fully recovered.</p> <p>On Tuesday Obama toured flood-ravaged southern Louisiana and singled out the current administrator of Fema, <a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/william-craig-fugate\">Craig Fugate</a>, \u201cas somebody who I can\u2019t brag enough about, one of the best hires I made as president\u201d, crediting him with professionalising the organisation and turning it around.</p> <p>The president also shrugged off political criticism over his own response to the tragedy, which struck while he was on holiday last week, killing at least 13 people in the region and displacing thousands. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-louisiana-floods-supplies\">visited Baton Rouge last Friday</a>, handing out water and diapers.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I don\u2019t worry too much about politics,\u201d said Obama, wearing a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves and an unbuttoned collar, standing in front of piles of waterlogged debris. \u201cThe second thing I have seen historically is that, when disasters strike, that\u2019s probably one of the few times when Washington tends not to get political.</p> <p>\u201cI guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican. What they care about is making sure they\u2019re getting the drywall out and the carpet out, there\u2019s not any mould building, they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible. That\u2019s what they care about. That\u2019s what I care about.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-disaster-obama-baton-rouge-mississippi\">The storm and its flooding</a> have damaged an estimated 60,000 homes and forced thousands to seek temporary housing. More than 115,000 people have registered for federal disaster aid. Obama said federal support is at $127m so far. At least 40 state highways remained closed. </p> <p>Obama spoke of the resilience of Louisiana, recalling that he visited New Orleans as a senator in the aftermath of Katrina and as president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/barack-obama-new-orleans-hurricane-katrina\">for last year\u2019s 10th anniversary</a>. He indicated how far he believes Fema has come since that nadir.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing I just want to repeat is how proud I am of Fema because if you think about the number of significant natural disasters that have occurred since my presidency began, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a local official anywhere in the country, including those in the other party, who wouldn\u2019t say that Craig Fugate and his team have been anything less than exemplary and professional,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fugate, who took over in 2009, \u201chas done such an outstanding job not just in dealing with this particular incident but has really rebuilt Fema so that there\u2019s a change of culture, and everybody knows that when a disaster happens Fema\u2019s going to be there on the ground cooperating with state and local officials rapidly and with attention to detail and keeping the families who\u2019ve been affected uppermost in their minds,\u201d Obama added.<br></p> <p>The president met with a bipartisan group of officials, including Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, whose mansion flooded, and Republican lieutenant-governor Billy Nungesser. Republican senators Bill Cassidy and David Vitter also accompanied him.</p> <p>Obama walked past mattresses, appliances and heaps of clothing tossed out on the curb in a middle-class neighborhood in East Baton Rouge Parish, the Associated Press reported. Going door-to-door followed by TV cameras, he offered sympathy to residents as they took a break from the cleanup to talk about the damage.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I was coming at a better time,\u201d he told one resident, as he put his arm around her and walked into her home for a brief tour, according to the AP. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad to see everybody is safe, at least.\u201d</p> <p>Later Obama said how he had talked to a young widow whose daughter had been trying to rescue from her bedroom keepsakes that remind her of her father.</p> <p>\u201cThe prayers of the entire nation are with everybody who lost loved ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are heartbroken by the loss of life. There are also people who are still desperately trying to track down friends and family. We\u2019re going to keep on helping them every way that we can.\u201d</p> <p>He called for the nation to rally around a sustained long-term rebuilding effort long after the story has disappeared from the news. \u201cSometimes when these kinds of things happen, it can seem a little bit too much to bear, but what I want the people of Louisiana to know is that you\u2019re not alone on this, even after the TV cameras leave. The whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt. The reason I can say that with confidence is because that\u2019s what Americans do in times like this.\u201d</p> <p>Obama added: \u201cThis is not a one-off, this is not a photo-op issue. This is how do you make sure a month from now, three months from now, six months from now, people still are getting the help they need? I need all Americans to stay focused on this.\u201d</p> <p>A White House official said that, before his departure from Baton Rouge, Obama would meet the family of Alton Sterling, an African American killed by police on 5 July at a convenience store, and the families of three officers who were killed and three officers who were injured in an ambush in Dallas 12 days later.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s shifting political and business loyalties are laid bare in a new book that challenges his credentials as a conviction politician in often lurid detail.<br></p> <p>Despite a recent campaign focus on letting \u201cTrump be Trump\u201d, the 431-page biography instead charts the career of many Trumps: the showman, the womaniser, and a business partner who quickly ditches failing schemes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">Donald Trump: the making of a narcissist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book, the first of several expected on Trump, was compiled by a team of two dozen Washington Post journalists, led by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, during a three-month period earlier this year, in which they had some 20 hours of interviews with him.</p> <p>Challenged with evidence that he had changed party affiliation seven times between 1999 and 2012, the Republican candidate defended his political flip-flopping as a necessary expediency. \u201cI think it had to do more with practicality, because if you\u2019re going to run for office, you would have had to make friends,\u201d he told the authors.</p> <p>He declined to say whether he had voted for Hillary Clinton, for whom he once hosted a packed penthouse fundraiser and donated campaign contributions six times over a decade. \u201cI felt it was an obligation to get along, including with the Clintons,\u201d he once said, according to the book titled Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money and Power.</p> <p>But the team of reporters also reveal new accounts of business reversals, including interviews with some of the victims of a collapsed Florida property scheme who sued after discovering that he had little responsibility for it other than receiving income for the use of his name. </p> <p>Instead, reports the Washington Post book, one of the project\u2019s actual developers had pleaded guilty in a separate Wall Street fraud case involving mafia crime families.

A controversial clothing line, made mainly in low-wage factories offshore, is said to have netted Trump $1m with no money down.</p> <p>The self-proclaimed teetotaler, who doesn\u2019t like shaking hands for fear of germs, also emerges as a consummate master of media manipulation.</p> <p>NBC executive Jim Dowd is quoted saying Trump believed the Apprentice TV show provided him with the opportunity to run for the White House. \u201cHe told me \u2018I\u2019ve got the real estate and hotel and golf niche. I\u2019ve got the name recognition, but I don\u2019t have the love and respect of middle America.\u2019 Now he did. That was the bridge to the [2016 campaign].\u201d</p> <p>The book details Trump\u2019s parasitic, and at turns downright bizarre, relationship with the press. Trump even granted a reporter an in-person interview at the hospital on the day his daughter Tiffany was born. In another instance, it appears Trump, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html\">pretending to be a spokesman for himself,</a> leaked details of his first divorce from Ivana to People magazine. </p> <p>Early in his career, he employed a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach with reporters to both garner attention and pre-empt negative press. When Trump learned a journalist from the Village Voice was interested in digging into his business dealings, he called the reporter, Jack Newfield, and later referred to him as a friend. At one point he offered to help get Newfield an apartment in a more affluent neighborhood. But Trump also warned him, \u201cI\u2019ve broken more than one writer.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6793e4d1f8af82cb135aa86a9e736bc03075347e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6793e4d1f8af82cb135aa86a9e736bc03075347e/0_125_4248_2550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at his desk, where he likes to review everything written or said about him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at his desk, where he likes to review everything written or said about him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor decades, Trump\u2019s daily morning routine included a review of everything written or said about him in the previous 24 hours.

The four attended a meeting at Trump Tower in New York that ran longer than expected. Having missed their flight home, the men boarded another helicopter back to Atlantic City. A scrape on the rotor blades caused the helicopter to split apart in mid-air.</p> <p>Trump learned of the crash first, and called the three families to inform them, according to the book. In an interview with the Post, Trump compared that experience to when the military informs \u201csoldiers\u2019 families when they\u2019re gone\u201d. Later Trump would claim that he was supposed to be on the helicopter and changed his mind at the last minute. \u201cIt was, like, a fifty-fifty deal,\u201d he told CNN, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-fabricated-a-near-death-experience-three-biogra?utm_term=.igrAvPMyM#.nfM1QG2q2\">though this account has been disputed</a>. </p> <p>The book describes how Trump adopted the ethos of Roy Cohn, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/donald-trump-roy-cohn.html?_r=0\">a fearsome New York lawyer and former consigliere to Senator Joseph McCarthy</a>, who represented the builder for 13 years: \u201cAll press is good press\u201d.

Death&#xa0;squads claimed at least 1,000 lives during his term in Davao. He earned the nicknames The Punisher and Duterte Harry. He appears to like them.</p> <p>Now, having pledged the impossible \u2013 ending crime and corruption nationwide within six months \u2013 Mr Duterte is in a hurry.

One top Philippine official has described the crackdown as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d in pursuit of&#xa0;the greater good.</p> <p>On Tuesday the national police chief denied that there was a declared policy to kill users and pushers, but he acknowledged that about&#xa0;1,900 killings had been recorded since Mr Duterte took office seven weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-drug-police-idUSKCN10Y06P\" title=\"\">far more than previously believed</a>. About 800 of those took place during police operations, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/world/asia/philippines-duterte-drug-killings.html\" title=\"\">strikingly odd deaths in custody</a>. One father and son were shot dead after grabbing an officer\u2019s gun, officials said. An investigation by an independent government body said the two men had already been incapacitated by severe beatings.</p> <p>Mr Duterte gives short shrift to those with qualms, accusing prominent critics of being involved in the drugs trade themselves.

They included <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2793419.stm\" title=\"\">a nine-year-old boy shot dead as police chased his mother</a>. Thailand\u2019s drug trade has proved resilient.</p> <p>Such drives inevitably claim innocent lives and kill users as well as dealers. But the core objection is simply that no one should die like&#xa0;this. Extrajudicial executions undermine the rule of law. They make a country less safe, not more.</p> <p>Senators are investigating the killings, but&#xa0;so far Mr Duterte\u2019s stance appears highly popular \u2013 reflecting the toll that crime and violence has taken on Philippine society and the failure of the political class to get to grips with them. The US and others have expressed&#xa0;deep concern, but rights campaigners warn that it is hard to see an end&#xa0;in sight unless the US and EU nations make it clear that continuing will result in economic and diplomatic penalties. There&#xa0;is&#xa0;every sign that Mr Duterte will attempt to play them off against Beijing. They&#xa0;should stand firm.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s not an easy evaluation to pull off, \u201cworse than Hitler\u201d. It has proven impossible to match the extent of Hitler\u2019s destructiveness. In the absence of that, to say that anyone \u2013 Donald Trump, as a wild for-instance \u2013 is worse becomes an insult to the memory of Hitler\u2019s victims, since it asserts that the dictator\u2019s nature and his efficiency can be separated, and his true singularity lay not in evil but in administrative prowess. But if you approach it a bit more systematically and show your workings, you can get round that \u2013 which is what <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-08-presidential-candidates-psychopaths-good.html\">an Oxford researcher, the psychologist Dr Kevin Dutton, has done</a>.</p> <p>Dutton has ranked world leaders throughout history on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory \u2013 Revised (PPI \u2013 Revised), and awarded Trump a score of 171, two points more than Hitler. There\u2019s not much in it at that level, though it doesn\u2019t assure their capacity for genocide \u2013 Henry VIII trumped both at 178. Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t fare brilliantly in the test, scoring 152; that\u2019s between Napoleon and Nero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/20/how-psychopaths-can-save-your-life\">How psychopaths can save your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are 56 traits in the test, not all of them negative: social influence and fearlessness could go either way; even egocentricity has its uses. Cold-heartedness is harder to make a case for. Many of them are qualities that businessmen and women are admired for \u2013 ruthlessness, charisma, dishonesty, a lack of concern about the future. It has been a commonplace for years to note that psychopaths and highly successful people in business share a lot of characteristics. It is only relatively recently that this has become a field of academic inquiry \u2013 Joel Bakan, law professor at the University of British Columbia, and Jonathan Aldred, an economics fellow at Cambridge, have started to delve into the social effects of a corporate world that doesn\u2019t just accept amorality but positively valorises it. None of them are positive, but we probably didn\u2019t need the PPI to tell us that Donald Trump was not a force for good.</p> <p>Obviously, Dutton didn\u2019t conduct face-to-face interviews with the figures, and therefore contravenes the so-called Goldwater rule, a code of honour among psychiatrists whereby you don\u2019t diagnose people, especially in public, who you have never met. (Only psychiatrists sign up to this; psychologists don\u2019t, possibly with the defence that their diagnoses have less consequence \u2013 they couldn\u2019t have you sectioned without a doctor, for instance.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-campaign-news-polls-kellyanne-conway\">Trump manager says 'undercover voters' will deliver win in US election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, if we can turn a blind eye to that and pile in, with Trump I have always found the narcissism diagnosis more convincing. Simon Baron-Cohen, who developed the empathy quotient test, makes the distinction between cognitive empathy (you find it easy to intuit what other people are feeling) and affective empathy (you can\u2019t guess what other people are feeling, but when you know, you feel it too). People with autism score very high on affective empathy and low on cognitive empathy, and people with psychopathy are the opposite; put simply, they can read people easily but don\u2019t care about them. Donald Trump seems to lack any qualities of perceptiveness or insight that would allow him to read other people, even for nefarious purposes, and in that has the classic stamp of the high narcissist.

  "<p>One of the latest firestorms of the social media-driven presidential race are <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/16/clinton-foundation-should-stop-accepting-funds/W8JsNkBseYo6wIxWosNb5O/story.html\">calls</a> for the Clinton Foundation to shut down due to \u2013 as yet unproven \u2013 conflicts of interest. But these calls, like Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-calls-complete-shutdown-clinton-foundation-n636051\">demand</a> on Monday that it close, are missing an essential point about the foundation\u2019s work: if it disappeared, those helped by the work it supports could fall through the widening cracks of our unequal global society.</p> <p>Worldwide, the foundation, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">has raised</a> over $2bn, employs more than 2,000 people and had a 2015 budget of over $223m, focuses on initiatives that cut the costs of Aids and malaria drugs, supply pediatric drugs for Aids and for diarrhea (a more important initiative than people may know), test and distribute mosquito nets, help women and girls become entrepreneurs, provide seeds and equipment to farmers, replant trees and, in the United States, partner businesses with local government to help create health and wellness initiatives.</p> <p>What makes the foundation different from other charities is that, as a public foundation and not a private charity, they do the work themselves rather than funneling money to others, dividing their efforts between development, health access, health matters and climate change. The Clinton Foundation also implements programming for foundations that donate to them because they are able to do the work the other foundations don\u2019t have the infrastructure or international influence to do themselves.</p> <p>Whatever questions may be raised about the extent to which Clinton Foundation fundraising would become a conflict of interest should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, charity watchdog groups have put the operational finances consistently in the <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go\">80 to 89% range</a> for charity spending versus overhead, which is a highly rated percentage in the field. </p> <p>Does that mean the foundation shouldn\u2019t change anything it does if Hillary Clinton becomes president? It has been announced that it will stop accepting foreign or questionable donations, that Bill Clinton would cease to fundraise and resign from the board, and that there would be a firewall erected between family and foundation. These are all sound decisions.</p> <p>They may affect the foundation\u2019s finances anyway. The foundation has essentially leveraged the Clintons\u2019 popularity into a fundraising powerhouse for initiatives that span the globe. It\u2019s easy, therefore, in this environment of hyper-partisan politics, where often absurd and baseless accusations are thrown against the wall to see if they will stick, for Secretary Clinton\u2019s supporters to become concerned about an appearance of impropriety and call for change.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s important they remember, however, that real lives could be affected. If supporters call for the initiatives to be turned over to other NGOs, which ones should pick up the mantle? Which ones are working successfully on health, development, equality <em tabindex=\"-1\">and</em> climate change? What other groups can absorb and finance the programs, support the health workers, the educators, the partners on the ground, or show up to challenge drug companies as the Clintons, often through sheer force of will, have been able to do when they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">make the companies</a> drop prices to what someone in Africa can afford? </p> <p>Other presidents have had conflicts of interest. They\u2019ve managed them with blind trusts and financial firewalls. If the Clinton Foundation can do the same, there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t continue its work. If it cannot continue, however, whether due to political perception or more serious factors, time must be given for the diverse initiatives to find a home so that the vulnerable are not harmed in the interest of politics over the greater good. </p>",

Think of successful actors such as Judi Dench, Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith or Mary Berry, whose Great British Bake Off starts this week.</p> <p>And, of course, there are the men. We still enjoy the performances of Leonard Cohen and the Rolling Stones. We tolerate the Today presenter John Humphrys. And we marvel at David Attenborough, now aged 90.</p> <p>My own experience, and those of others, demonstrates to me that life \u2013 particularly working life \u2013 is a marathon, not a sprint. That is really important, especially for women. It is we who tend to bear the brunt of the responsibilities of caring for children or elderly relatives. Even though fathers are more hands-on today, who buys the shoes and makes the dental appointments? And as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/23/gender-pay-gap-average-18-per-cent-less-uk-women\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies report</a> this week shows, the gender pay gap balloons after women have children.</p> <p>Many of us choose to be mothers or carers, but we also want to succeed in our jobs. Yet in a society that promotes the cult of youth, that is hard. In so many fields of work, people are always on the lookout for the next generation of talent, the emerging youthful stars, the new and ever younger people whom they want to place on the top of a pedestal.</p> <p>So people who want to succeed in their paid jobs feel that they can\u2019t take time out for other things. The obsession&#xa0;with youth means too many believe that if they haven\u2019t made it in their career by the time they are 35, they have failed.</p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. At a time when we are living longer than ever, we are being written off earlier. Of course we should promote young flair and new ideas but we should also value experience \u2013 and delight in talent and innovation at all ages.</p> <p>The cult of youth must be matched by&#xa0;a celebration of the continuing energy and contribution of others. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/jul/14/snp-mhairi-black-britain-youngest-mp-maiden-speech-video\" title=\"\">Mhairi Black, the SNP MP who gave a barnstorming maiden speech</a> last year when she was only 20, has as much to offer as <a href=\"http://www.marierimmer.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Marie Rimmer, the Labour MP for St&#xa0;Helens South and Whiston</a>, who joined parliament in the same year at the age of 69 after a successful career in&#xa0;local government.</p> <p>And we should stop putting pressure on people to race to the top before a hint of a grey hair appears on their heads. This pressure makes young people feel they must decide on their career choices&#xa0;too quickly, and then stick to them. At a time when people are likely to work for longer, they are being compelled to decide their future jobs at an ever younger age, and in doing so they are narrowing their options and limiting their opportunities.</p> <p>For women, the societal pressures are particularly tough. The time when we tend to have our children coincides with the point when society tells us we should be climbing towards the top of the career ladder. What should be the very best years of our lives rapidly become the hardest as we struggle to marry two important ambitions and feel guilt about not fulfilling either role properly. Yet if life is a marathon, why can\u2019t you coast in your paid job for a few years, while your children are young, and return to the competitive fray when they become more independent? Those few years out of the race do not diminish your ability to contribute or succeed later, when you are a little older.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-gender-pay-inequality-its-not-just-a-tennis-racket\">The Guardian view on gender pay inequality: it\u2019s not just a tennis racket | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I chose not to try for a seat in parliament until I was 50, when the youngest of my four children was 13. I certainly got to parliament later than my contemporaries, such as Jack Straw and David Blunkett. And when my husband fell ill with cancer I took a year\u2019s compassionate leave from my job as arts minister. Coming back after that year was hard because I had lost Henry, but resettling into work helped me through that period of grief. Indeed, I feel that both the time spent parenting and the time spent caring influenced \u2013 and improved \u2013 my approach to my job. I was more focused, more balanced and more appreciative of others.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to be critical of women who drive forward their careers at the same time as caring for children or relatives. We need to do all we can in terms of childcare and flexible working to make that possible. And there are many who don\u2019t have children, for whom developing their careers is the primary focus. But choice matters. Those who choose to spend some years more focused on their children or elderly relatives should not be shut out of advancement in their careers a little later, simply because of society\u2019s fixation with youth.</p> <p>Enabling women \u2013 and men \u2013 to progress outside these parameters must not become an excuse for sidelining the battle against continuing gender discrimination in the labour market.</p> <p>And if we respond to looking older by subjecting our bodies to facelifts and Botox in the hope that we can then present our youthfulness to the world, we are avoiding the problem. The fact is that healthier lifestyles and medical advances mean that we can maintain physical energy and mental alertness for longer. We have just got to stop linking an ageing appearance to a loss of physical and mental capability.</p> <p>The journey I have been on will be different for others, as I am not involved in manual work. But recognising the differences should not justify ignoring the need to challenge entrenched attitudes, and to enable people to take a long view of their years in work.</p> <p>As the world of work is transformed by new technology \u2013 for example, the people who currently wear themselves out stacking shelves will in the future most probably be monitoring robots doing that heavy lifting \u2013 it will become possible for people to do those manual jobs for longer.</p> <p>Our approach to this thorny issue is full of contradictions. We want people to work for longer, yet we write them off&#xa0;at an increasingly young age. We want women to be equal yet we continue to implement policies that stop that. We want to encourage new ideas but we dismiss many of those who have them.</p> <p>I know I have been very lucky. I shall be publishing my first book on my time as chair of the public accounts committee next month, just after my 72nd birthday. I am planning a second book, on immigration. But I want my luck to become the norm, so that what I managed to achieve becomes available to others.

It is new, difficult to pin down, and hard to understand. But it\u2019s important to try to get a handle on who is involved, what they believe, and what their possible influence might be on the immediate future of rightwing politics.</p> <h2>A movement that lives and breathes \u2013 and taunts \u2013 online</h2> <p>The alt- (or alternative) right has surged as a (so far) mainly online movement, occupying positions beyond the pale of many conservatives. It has no centralised organisation or official ideology \u2013 it has been <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/what-exactly-is-the-alternative-right/article/2000310\">described</a> as \u201cscattered and ideologically diffuse\u201d.</p> <p>The alt-right has been involved in fleeting street protests, but its online activities are well-organised and relentless. It recruits by opposing progressive ideas about gender, sexuality, and especially race and immigration. Adherents congregate on message boards like 4chan and 8chan, comment on websites like <a href=\"http://therightstuff.biz/\">the Right Stuff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, and lurk on Twitter, where they taunt progressives (or \u201cshitlibs\u201d) and mainstream conservatives (\u201ccuckservatives\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15dbfa3e43ecf803331e39425ff01d361dec222d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15dbfa3e43ecf803331e39425ff01d361dec222d/0_128_4864_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen BannonFILE - In this Jan. 24, 2013 file photo, Executive Producer Stephen Bannon poses at the premiere of \u201cSweetwater\u201d during the 2013 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

At the height of his Twitter-driven notoriety, Yiannopoulos wrote a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/\">manifesto</a> introducing the tendency to mainstream conservatives. But are Breitbart and Bannon really a part of the movement? Some of its most hardcore activists say no. </p> <h2>Race realism and ethno-nationalism: what the alt-right believes</h2> <p>Richard Spencer, who coined the term \u201calt-right\u201d in 2008, says he intended the term to describe a diverse, heterodox group whose members were \u201cdeeply alienated, intellectually, even emotionally and spiritually, from American conservatism\u201d. </p> <p>They were disillusioned at the end of the Bush presidency by Republican policies on war and immigration. They sought to draw on currents like the European New Right to transform what they saw as a moribund conservative movement. He and others connected with the succession of websites he edited \u2013 such as Taki magazine and alternativeright.com \u2013 wrote extensively, focusing the alt-right into a more definite ideology, with increasingly hardline ideas about race.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The alt-right has been involved in fleeting street protests, but its online activities are well-organised and relentless</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Spencer says that the term is still flexible, but affiliation has some minimum requirements. \u201cSomeone who is really alt-right recognises the reality of race, and the fact that race matters, and that race is an essential component of identity.\u201d</p> <p>Shane Burley, a journalist and researcher who has covered the far right extensively, says that Spencer\u2019s orientation \u201cis clearly under the umbrella of what we would call fascism\u201d. Spencer\u2019s so-called \u201crace realism\u201d underpins theories of racial hierarchy, and the idea that it has a basis in biology. Related ideas of \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d attempt to buttress the notion that race is destiny, and the primary organising category of society and history. <a href=\"http://www.radixjournal.com/\">Radix</a> is full of articles that link race with IQ or crime. This revival of previously discredited scientific racism is another recurring feature of alt-right thought.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a4364882f7174ff22edb6f0490cafee43d17504\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a4364882f7174ff22edb6f0490cafee43d17504/0_157_4186_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milo Yiannopoulos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milo Yiannopoulos popularised the term \u2018alt-right\u2019 in a manifesto published on Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burley says that the very fact that these ideas were once so thoroughly discredited opens up a gap for them to be promulgated again. \u201cRight now the arguments against their race and IQ position are less well-known, so they have the ability to plant the seed in the public imagination. </p> <p>\u201cAlmost all of the studies that they cite are marginal, construct-sweeping theories on the basis of very little data, and don\u2019t demonstrate the causal links that they claim for them.\u201d</p> <p>Other adherents emphasise their desire for racial separatism. Mike Enoch, from the site the Right Stuff, a major hub for the dissemination of alt-right materials, says: \u201cThe core principle, in my view, is ethno-nationalism, meaning that nations should be as ethnically and racially homogeneous as possible.\u201d</p> <p>As for Breitbart, Enoch thinks that it \u201cis the closest thing to sympathetic to our position that is out there in the mainstream, and there may be some people that share our views that work there, but the official editorial line of Breitbart is not alt-right\u201d.</p> <p>Chip Berlet, a veteran researcher of the far right and the coauthor of Right-Wing Populism in America, says that the idea of ethno-nationalism is derived from the European New Right. It\u2019s the claim that \u201cevery ethno-religious nationalist group has the right to its own homeland\u201d. </p> <p>This willingness to make open racial appeals is reflected in another fundamental claim on the alt-right that, as Spencer puts it, is the preponderance of \u201cJewish power and Jewish influence\u201d. This antisemitism dovetails with other kinds of conspiracy thinking \u2013 in the last week, alt-right Twitter accounts have been pushing the claim that Hillary Clinton is hiding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HillarysLeaks?src=hash]\">serious health problems</a>.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Conspiracy theories make them into heroes who have exposed a plot.</p> <footer> <cite>Chip Berlet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berlet says antisemitism has \u201calways been a dividing line on the US right\u201d, separating the fringes from more mainstream groups, and \u201crightwing movements in the US have been obsessed with conspiracies since the Salem witch-hunts and the anti-Masonic scares. Nativist movements have always embraced the motif of subversion. It\u2019s normal for them: it makes them into heroes who have exposed a plot.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018A sense that white identity is under attack\u2019</h2> <p>Perhaps the most potent element of alt-right activism is the effort to build a sense of a specific white identity, and to claim that this identity is under attack. </p> <p>\u201cAnti-white animus in society at large is palpable,\u201d says Spencer. Demands for diversity in the workplace mean \u201cless white males in particular\u201d. More openly extreme alt-right accounts on Twitter talk about immigration in terms of \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhiteGenocide?src=hash\">white genocide</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This sense of injured white identity is what defines the alt-right, according to Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson University political scientist and the author of a new book on Fox News and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-American-Politics-Psychology/dp/1138900125/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">American politics</a>. \u201cThe founding myth of the alt-right is that the disadvantaged groups in American politics are actually running things through a combination of fraud and intimidation. By doing this, they\u2019re actually oppressing white men.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201coriginal sin\u201d of current American politics, according to Cassino, is that neither liberals nor conservatives have a very good answer to the question of what is to be done about \u201cthe people who get screwed over\u201d by economic policies. <br></p> <p>If these sentiments are growing, it may mean a larger and more receptive audience for the more radical message of the alt-right. Adherents claim that the movement is expanding. </p> <p>Spencer does not have solid figures, but claims to have seen many new faces at his events, including young people who have been \u201credpilled\u201d \u2013 or racially \u201cawoken\u201d \u2013 in the last year. Enoch claims that the Right Stuff\u2019s suite of podcasts gets more than 100,000 listeners a week. </p> <p>It may be that a growing audience for these ideas is pulling Breitbart in a more hardline direction. Spencer calls Breitbart \u201calt-right lite\u201d, and says that its fundamental populism has led them to tentatively begin to express ideas similar to his. </p> <p>Berlet says just because Bannon is not a card-carrying member of the alt-right does not mean that progressives should be relaxed about Trump\u2019s erratic and intermittently fascist-sounding campaign. </p> <p>Berlet does not think that American politics has been in such a dangerous place vis-a-vis the far right for almost a century. For him, the parallels between the Trump campaign and the alt-right are \u201cthe most important pushback against having a multicultural and pluralistic society since the 1920s Klan\u201d.<br></p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>Are the days of the globalised economy numbered? It\u2019s a question more widely pondered of late, particularly in the light of the UK\u2019s recent vote to leave the European Union.

He has promised to build a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d wall along the US-Mexico border paid for by Mexico. He tweeted a photo of himself eating a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo with the caption \u201cI love Hispanics!\u201d And he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\">questioned the judicial fitness</a> of Indiana-born federal judge Gonzalo Curiel, who presiding over the Trump University lawsuit, on the basis that he is of \u201cMexican heritage\u201d.<br></p> <p>Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, whose family is from Nicaragua, said she did not agree with some of Trump\u2019s views, especially his characterization of Latinos. But she said she tries to make clear to friends and family that the 2016 election is a \u201cbinary choice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you do? Do you go with the person who has a pandered to the Hispanic community, flip-flopping on immigration in so many ways that it\u2019s horrible \u2026 I would rather somebody who maybe does not speak so politely and maybe is rather blunt but says exactly what they say and feel,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Many prominent Latino leaders and activists have denounced Trump, and his comments have been used to spur voter registration and participation among Hispanics. Republican leaders and donors have expressed concern that Trump is alienating Latino voters.</p> <p>Just 15% of Latino voters say they hold a favorable view of Trump, compared with 82% who say they have an unfavorable view of the Republican nominee, according to a Fox News Latino poll <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/08/15/exclusive-fox-news-latino-poll-2016-presidential-election/\">released last week</a>. By comparison, 55% of Latinos say they have a favorable view of Clinton, compared with 41% who say they do not.</p> <p>In unspecific terms, the Republican nominee recently expressed regret for his \u201cwrong\u201d choice of words in expressing his views on a \u201cmultitude of issues\u201d, particularly instances when he had caused \u201cpersonal pain\u201d. Over the weekend, Trump met with Latino and faith-based leaders, leading to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/donald-trump-deportation-immigration-plan-meeting-latino-leaders\">conflicting reports and equivocations</a> on Trump\u2019s long-held, hardline stance on immigration.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question about it that we have a lot of work to do when it comes to Hispanic outreach and engagement, the way the Democrats do,\u201d Aguirre Ferr\u00e9 said. \u201cThey talk such a good storm. They\u2019re so great in explaining policies that really haven\u2019t worked when you look at the last eight years.\u201d</p> <p>As part of that effort, Republicans launched a social media campaign to engage Hispanic voters on a variety of different topics, beginning with a video on \u201cterrorism\u201d.

  "<h2><strong>Escaping to New Zealand</strong><br></h2> <p>Eleanor Ainge Roy asserts that care should be taken before deciding to emigrate to New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/trump-brexit-is-new-zealand-your-escape-route-too\" title=\"\">(12 August)</a>. Confusingly she says that New Zealand needs more people but urges them not to come. However, the real flaw in her commentary is the belief that discretionary migration is informed by the social merit of a particular country, when in reality it is more often based on a migrant\u2019s desire for change.</p> <p>She is correct in pointing out the darker social features of New Zealand. There are plenty more to add to her list. The real tragedy of these adversities is a nonchalance from central government about how such pressing issues should be addressed.</p> <p>We are different but we are not necessarily worse, and you should be entirely clear about that difference before you take such a big step. When you are sure, please come and you will be most welcome, but please keep your dog on a lead when walking in the bush. Our native species are under threat from canines. <br><strong>Patrick Alley</strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 I didn\u2019t choose to live in New Zealand. The majority of my fellow citizens didn\u2019t either. Our forebears inadvertently made the choice for us. Unlike Eleanor Ainge Roy we know that those who made this choice were not convicts. Her other fact-free assertion \u2013 that we Kiwis habitually keep asking if we\u2019re good enough due to our supposed ancestry \u2013 is double nonsense.</p> <p>When Roy has taken the trouble to learn some New Zealand history I hope she will also come to regret her colossal cheek in declaring New Zealand \u201cunderpopulated\u201d, and issuing an open invitation to the rest of the world to add to what is in ecological terms an overpopulation crisis. New Zealand has an ecological footprint of 7.7 hectares per person \u2013 the sixth-highest rate in the world. Intensive agriculture is a significant contributor to this sorry statistic, and probably to one of its latest manifestations \u2013 the awful outbreak of water-borne gastric illness that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/nz-town-gastro-outbreak-sent-e-coli-infected-water-council\" title=\"\">recently made over 4,000 people in one Hawkes Bay town very ill</a>.</p> <p>Anyone who emigrates to New Zealand as a lifestyle choice is likely to add to the problems of overconsumption and unsustainable production, and also to property price escalation that has taken home ownership beyond the reach of low- to medium-income earners. Those of us who didn\u2019t choose to live here have got enough trouble on our hands trying to engage others in working on solving these problems, instead of making them worse. We welcome new fellow workers, but freeloaders \u2013 please stay away.<br><strong>Christine Dann</strong><br>Christchurch, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 Eleanor Ainge Roy talks a lot of sense in her article about why moving to New Zealand is not a panacea and, more important, should not be thought of as an escape. My family came to live here 18 years ago with very young children. It was a kind of safe adventure, not exactly a journey into the unknown. Maybe a bit like going to live in a second cousin\u2019s house: you recognise some of the furniture but it is in different places.</p> <p>It is a small place in terms of population but as big geographically as the UK. People tend to be friendly because there aren\u2019t so many people to go round: there is, while acknowledging casual and unpleasant racism \u2013 especially towards Maori \u2013 a greater respect toward other people, though society\u2019s blights \u2013 poverty and youth suicide among them \u2013 are apparent. It would, however, be impossible to imagine New Zealand doing a Brexit and voting to leave its economic ties with Australia or China because of a xenophobic resentment about the numbers of Australians or Chinese who come here to live and work.</p> <p>Most important, New Zealand even has a gentler Tory party: the likes of the not very lamented David Cameron or his awful successors vanished 20-odd years ago here. The&#xa0;electoral system is light years more advanced and democratic than&#xa0;the sclerotic British system.<br><strong>David Townsend</strong><br>Wellington, New Zealand</p> <h2><strong>Leaders must learn to listen</strong><br></h2> <p>I find it hard to discern the underlying message of Anne McElvoy\u2019s 12 August piece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/elites-listen-to-noises-on-street\" title=\"\">Elites must start listening to the people</a>. Is it simply a plea for centrists or moderates to heed the voice of the neglected masses? But what should her amorphous \u201ccentre-ground liberals\u201d be embracing as their guiding philosophy in an era when nothing is certain, whether due to the cumulative effects of rapid climate change, the loyalties of voters to established parties or, the elephant in the room, the demonstrated inherent instability of the global economic system?</p> <p>As a senior editor of The Economist, and judging by her evident support for Hillary Clinton, may we assume that McElvoy relies on the received wisdom of the power of market forces, that a steady hand at the helm is all that is needed to steer the vessel of most major economies into safer waters? If so, she stands accused of the same fault that she levels at the elites: failing to heed the voice of reality.</p> <p>In addition, her predicated new left is in fact just the remnant of the old left, exemplified by Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, a plaintive cry to return to the certainties of a bygone age. McElvoy\u2019s oversimplification of the phenomenon she calls the rebellious right is equally blinkered, and ignores the very different social and economic crises being experienced in countries such as France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Greece, Italy, the US and the UK.</p> <p>The one really hopeful prospect comes out of Austria, where the dispute for the presidency between a flexible and forward-looking Green candidate and a representative of the extreme rightwing, scared isolationists has yet to be resolved. Our best chance is go with the Green answer, rather than stubbornly attempt to stick with the failed would-be centrists or social democrats.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Selling the science of cute</strong><br></h2> <p>Awww: the new science of cute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/kumamon-the-new-science-of-cute\" title=\"\">(5&#xa0;August)</a>: a new academic field?

So why don\u2019t we simply resolve to just say \u201cNo\u201d to everything that contributes to climate change?</p> <p>We could say \u201cNo\u201d to cars, to long-haul trucks and to unlimited shipping; to planes, to excessive packaging and to air-conditioning. And, while we are at it, why not say \u201cNo\u201d to pesticides and to the routine feeding of antibiotics to animals too?</p> <p>Damaging activities should be made expensive and unattractive: we really don\u2019t need unfettered, private indulgence, do we? And a \u201cNo\u201d need not be draconian or negative: as trucks and long-haul shipping are phased out, so local economies blossom with creative jobs for everyone. And surely a local holiday is significantly more fulfilling than a weekend in Las Vegas?

The account leaves unanswered questions of how the military knew the wounds were fatal, and how it could be so specific about a shoulder injury when the attack came from the air.</p> <p>In a speech in the north-western city of Sokoto, Kerry did not mention Shekau or the military commanders supposedly killed, and cautioned against the military cracking down on \u201ceveryone and anyone\u201d in the wake of militant attacks.</p> <p>Boko Haram transforms \u201cthe most vulnerable among us into killers\u201d, Kerry said, describing how in its quest to destroy knowledge, the group destroys schools, burns books, murders teachers and kidnaps students. \u201cMake no mistake, we do not have to be prisoners of these extremists, they can be eliminated,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cWe have to strike at the root of violent extremism.

She said that as a result, she could reach these undercover voters \u201cin many different ways\u201d. She said: \u201cWe go to them where they live, literally.\u201d</p> <p>Conway\u2019s statement echoes what in American politics is known as<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/trailhead/2008/01/08/did_n_h_voters_lie_about_supporting_obama.html\"> the Bradley effect</a>, a phenomenon that describes the willingness of some white voters to tell pollsters that they are voting for an African American candidate while preferring the white candidate in the voting booth.</p> <p>It is named for former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, who was favored in polls in California\u2019s 1982 gubernatorial election over his white Republican opponent, George Deukmejian, before suffering a narrow shock loss on election day. However, while its existence is disputed, anecdotal evidence for the phenomenon is mostly concentrated in the 1980s and 1990s. Conway\u2019s argument is that something fundamentally similar is happening in the US in 2016. </p> <p>Speaking to Channel 4 earlier this month, Conway buoyed her claims by citing the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">UK\u2019s experience of the EU referendum vote</a>.</p> <p>Polling suggested the UK would remain in the European Union, but it became clear on election night that the vote was going the other way.</p> <p>Conway said: \u201cVoices are silenced in polls that really should be included because people are too reliant on lists, and they\u2019re excluding people who maybe feel so passionately about that issue, Brexit, or so passionately about this candidate, Donald Trump, that they\u2019re going to vote for the first time ever in many, many, many cycles.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the past week, Trump has begun to ditch his previous unscripted style, using teleprompters on stage at every rally. That is despite repeatedly bashing the technology in the past, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-teleprompter-224039\">saying in August 2015</a>: \u201cI say we should outlaw teleprompters \u2026 for anybody running for president.\u201d </p> <p>The shift toward making Trump a more predictable candidate came as Conway took control of the campaign. The top aide outlined the message she thought Trump should continue to emphasize: \u201cThe best Donald Trump is the Donald Trump who is talking about national and homeland security, economic growth and prosperity, ethics and why so many Americans dislike and distrust Washington and all its adjuncts, its consultants, its donors, its lobbyists, its politicians, its way of doing business.\u201d </p> <p>However, despite his adoption of teleprompters, Trump still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-democrat-run-inner-cities-more-dangerous-than-war-zones-video\">veered badly off script</a> in a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night. The Republican nominee said: \u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to claim that if he were elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <p>Just as there may be a cohort of undercover Trump voters waiting to emerge in November, it seems that despite Conway\u2019s best efforts, there is an undercover candidate who won\u2019t let a teleprompter keep his penchant for controversial statements hidden. </p> <ul> <li>President Trump: Can He Really Win? airs on Channel 4 in the UK at 9pm on Tuesday 23 August<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul>",

It was a harsh, illuminating and ultimately cheering battle, fought out against the backdrop of London\u2019s rapid change, soaring growth and anxieties about Islamist terror, which the Goldsmith campaign tried to exploit at the Muslim Khan\u2019s expense. </p> <p>I wrote the book in parallel with my Guardian reports, sometimes refashioning and augmenting the journalism to fit the book\u2019s long-form flow, but mostly writing fresh material that wouldn\u2019t have been right for my columns. The more I wrote, the more I felt the book should be a fast, easy read of around 50,000 words that put narrative before analysis.</p> <p>It seemed to me that the story\u2019s meanings became evident mainly through the telling. Simply describing the events, the settings and the contrasting characters, together with the atrocious output of some in the media, largely provided its own commentary. There wasn\u2019t much need for me to explain things. Although I witnessed, and often participated in, every scene that I described, I purged the first person singular.</p> <p>Lacking the time or expertise to design it myself, I asked <a href=\"https://www.iamselfpublishing.com/\">I Am Self-Publishing</a> \u2013 what it says on the tin, etc \u2013 to turn the text around for me as fast as possible, first as an ebook and then a paperback. They were patient with my serial post-submission tweaking and have enabled me to fix my smattering of proofing errors in the initial ebook version, the majority resulting from too much late-night haste.</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned a lot about self-publishing, mostly from making lots of mistakes: I delivered my manuscript 10 days after the election, but would have saved time in the end by giving myself 20; I discovered that if I set a recommended retail price of \u00a35, as planned, I would actually lose money each time someone bought one through Amazon (which is why it\u2019s ended up at \u00a36). Only now am I grasping the bleeding obvious relationship between the size of the book\u2019s font and its production cost.</p> <p>These errors have had no deterrent effect. Having contrived the imprint name Double Q Books \u2013 it\u2019s a play on my east London postcode \u2013 I seem to have started work on another short volume, exploring Boris Johnson\u2019s legacy as mayor. This time, I\u2019ll need to do the numbers with more care. I\u2019ve never expected to make money from Zac versus Sadiq, at least in the short term, but it would be nice not to make too much of a loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/100-days-of-sadiq-khan-london-mayor\">100 days of Sadiq Khan: 'I feel a sense of relief that we have a sensible mayor'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It will be clear by now that as a business enterprise, Zac versus Sadiq has been, to put it mildly, haphazard.

London Citizens is a multi-faith social action group, originating in the East End. The fervour and high emotion of the Mayoral Assembly can both exhilarate and unnerve even seasoned politicians, as formidable clerics and youthful idealists politely but sternly invite them to sign up to the Citizens\u2019 goals and work with them to see they are achieved.</em></p> <p><em>It was an occasion made for Khan. The 6,000 mostly young people banked round the hall gave him a big welcome as he mounted the stage constructed at its centre and added a Muslim greeting to his general big hello. The Citizens\u2019 Assembly offer is one that candidates refuse at the cost of a polite but very public dressing down. Khan\u2019s 50% affordable policy on housing and his stridency on low pay fitted his hosts\u2019 list of requirements more precisely than those of Goldsmith, who had no option but to finesse his less compliant policies as best he could.</em></p> <p><em>After young refugees had spoken of their yearning to remain in the city where they had grown up, Khan said to loud cheers that in his role as Tooting MP he had just the other night helped try to change the government\u2019s Immigration Bill so that Britain could help more unaccompanied young refugee children stranded in mainland Europe. That was the reason given for his missing an important National Housing Federation hustings held on the same evening as the Commons vote. Goldsmith hadn\u2019t been at the housing debate either, but his excuse, according to his stand-in, was that he had to meet someone in Hillingdon.</em></p> <p><em>At the end, Goldsmith left quietly in the company of [his campaign chair] Nick de Bois and almost no one else. He had the air of lost stork trying to find its way back to Kew. Meanwhile, on the other side of the venue, the diminutive Khan disappeared into a crush of well-wishers, camera crews and selfie-seekers. He\u2019d empathised. He\u2019d rocked the house.</em></p> </blockquote> <p></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>To order a copy of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Zac Versus Sadiq by Dave Hill</a> for \u00a36, go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Nevertheless, Matt Frei examines the chances of the people of the United States \u2013 the wealthiest, most powerful nation ever gathered beneath one flag \u2013 electing the orange reality show host. Frei meets members of the perplexingly numerous cohort who like the idea of entrusting Trump with launch codes, as well as Republicans openly unkeen on their nominee. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Vice Principals </strong><br>9.35pm, Sky Atlantic<br></h2> <p>Many of the great fictional schools are noted for an uncompromising approach to discipline. Think Mr Bronson-era Grange Hill or The Simpsons\u2019 Ayn Rand School for Tots. As the US college drama continues, Gamby\u2019s attempts to bring North Jackson High into that pantheon aren\u2019t proving to the liking of Principal Brown, with the pompous pedagogue instructed to provide a forum where students can talk through their feelings. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones </em></p> <h2><strong>Beauty and the Baker </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>This irreverent Israeli comedy-drama centres on Amos, a 28-year-old baker who finds his life flipped upside down following a chance encounter with Noa, the richest and most beautiful celebrity in the county. Their budding, odd-couple romance is put to the test by her jet-set life, an overbearing agent and Amos\u2019s meddlesome family. It\u2019s been a huge hit in Israel, with record ratings and a second series already on order. But only the first of this 10-part series will be shown on Channel 4 before the rest ends up on the on\u2011demand service All 4. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>BBC Proms 2016: Jamie Cullum Prom </strong><br>10pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Six years ago he brought the house down, in a sell-out Proms gig featuring jazz standards such as Just One Of Those Things and It Ain\u2019t Necessarily So, alongside some improvised jams. Now the broadcaster and performer is back, Heritage Orchestra in tow, to wow them all over again, this time accompanied by conductor Jules Buckley. Other performances this evening come from the Remi Harris Trio and London\u2019s Roundhouse Choir. <em>Ali Catterall </em></p> <h2><strong>Wasted </strong><br>10pm, E4<br></h2> <p>A Spaced for generation Snapchat, in which a group of friends attempt to find themselves by drinking \u201cYeovil martinis\u201d and going to Comic-Con. With half the cast hailing from Devon, the accents are as on-point as its handle on mid-20s lethargy. In the last of the series, Morpheus is told by his spirit guide Sean Bean (yes, really) that it\u2019s finally time to lose his V-plates, so him and the gang pop off to a sex party where he bumps into an old teacher. Nightmare. <em>Grace Rahman</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>White Oleander</strong> (Peter Kosminsky, 2002) 11.20pm, BBC1</p> <p>British documentary-maker Kosminsky\u2019s first Hollywood feature stars an impressive Alison Lohman as teenager Astrid, farmed out to a series of foster homes and orphanages when her mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is jailed for the murder of her cheating lover (Billy Connolly). Astrid\u2019s carers tend to the stereotypical, but the troubled mother-daughter relationship is an absorbing one.</p> <p><strong>Man On Fire</strong> (Tony Scott, 2004) 11.25pm, Film4</p> <p>A violent thriller from Scott, with trusty Denzel Washington lending the predictable story some credibility. He\u2019s a professional bodyguard with a drink problem who sobers up to redeem himself by wiping out the kidnappers of his young charge (Dakota Fanning). \u201c[His] art is death, and he\u2019s about to paint his masterpiece,\u201d warns old buddy Christopher Walken.

  "<p><strong>Sunday 24 July 8.43am.</strong> In the midst of the US presidential election, news breaks that WikiLeaks plans to release 20,000 hacked Democratic Party emails that will likely damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances, and enhance Donald Trump\u2019s. I read the relevant passage aloud to my wife, before adding my own searing commentary: \u201cI would\u2019ve thought Assange and Co would have the intelligence to realise ...\u201d I suddenly pause. </p> <p>A ripple of panic pulses through me. Am I complaining?</p> <p>Over the past five months that question is one that has developed the ability to paralyse me. Why? Because I\u2019m in the throes of what has turned out to be an epic challenge. I am trying to go 21 days without complaining. A self-imposed abstinence from grumbling of any kind: no slander of public figures, no whining about the weather. Nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s an exercise that I first heard of while listening to a podcast by Tim Ferriss, the productivity expert and quasi self-help guru. Ferriss in turn discovered it after it was popularised by a new age pastor from Kansas City by the name of Will Bowen. And while I identify neither as a member of the self-help set nor the god squad, I was instantly fascinated by the mission.</p> <p>The rules are ostensibly simple: put an elastic band on one wrist. Every time you complain, switch it over to the other wrist. Repeat, until the band has remained on one wrist for three weeks.</p> <p>The simplicity is compelling, but the moment you start it becomes awfully complex. It turns out that \u201cAm I complaining?\u201d can be a very hard question to answer, because what<em> is </em>a complaint? There\u2019s obviously the dictionary definition: an expression of discontent about a person or state of affairs, something like that. But in practise it gets murky. Consider the following three phrases.</p> <ol> <li>\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cDamn it\u2019s cold.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cDamn this cold.\u201d</li> </ol> <p>I think we could all agree that (1) is probably not a complaint. Assuming the weather is actually cold, it\u2019s just a statement of fact. And we could reach a similar consensus that (3) definitely is a complaint. But what about (2)? What about (1) said in a slightly whiny tone of voice? What if someone else says (3) and you agree with them? </p> <p>Or how about this: \u201cI would\u2019ve thought Assange and Co would have the intelligence to realise that a Trump government will not be good for people like him.\u201d Is that a complaint, a pointed observation, or merely the expression of a dashed expectation? </p> <p>On that particular Sunday morning, I decide it is not a complaint. I turn the page and leave the worn-out hair elastic clinging to my left wrist. </p> <p><strong>Monday 25 July 11.19am.</strong> The following day I meet my wife for coffee. As we approach the cafe, I spot a former colleague waiting at the counter. Let\u2019s call him Gary. I\u2019m not a fan of Gary\u2019s. I mean, I wish him no specific harm. He\u2019s not a bad person \u2013 he just has an awful sense of humour. Dad jokes and cries of \u201cTaxi!\u201d when a glass breaks are the cornerstones of his comedic oeuvre. Now I\u2019ll have to endure some of it and, worse, my sweet wife will be subjected to it. For a moment I forget myself. As I spot The Gazmeister I let out a big sigh and two words slither out after it: \u201c<em>This </em>idiot.\u201d</p> <p>That sentence isn\u2019t even a sentence. It doesn\u2019t have a verb. But the moment I utter it, I know the truth. It\u2019s a complaint. I change the elastic band over and brace myself for some punny pleasantries. It stings, because at that point I was into my fourth consecutive day without complaint. And in five long months of trying, the longest I have gone is six days.</p> <p>Not complaining is really, really hard. Until you try to stop, you\u2019ve no idea how often you do it. It\u2019s not a question of whether you\u2019re an inherently positive person or a negative one. Complaint is a pivotal part of all conversation \u2013 it can be used for good as well as evil. A lot of the time, we complain as a way to connect. A shared moan is a time-honoured technique for relating to a co-worker, fellow traveller or life partner. Who hasn\u2019t felt the warm rush of catharsis that occurs when you discover that someone else hates that thing you hate? Bellyaching is bonding.</p> <p>So it\u2019s wrong to say that complaints are wholly negative. In fact, some can be extremely positive. In a certain light, you could even view the whole of human progress as the result of complaints. Complaints about slow horses, or polio. Complaints about apartheid, or gender inequality.</p> <p>We need complaints, and we need negativity. But for me at least, this challenge is not about disputing that fact. Nor is it about worshipping at the altar of positivity. The reality is you can perform some verbal gymnastics that allow you to express negative sentiments without complaining. \u201cThis traffic sucks\u201d can become \u201cI would love it if this traffic would clear.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/five-of-the-best-meditation-apps\">Five of the best meditation apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in order to do that you\u2019ll need to pause and really think about your choice of words. This is where the challenge becomes fascinating, because you start to realise how little thought we give to what comes out of our gob. The words just tumble out, like goods being looted from a supermarket. By focusing the mind on complaints, you employ someone to work the checkout. And why is that of any benefit? Well, it becomes a sprawling and highly effective exercise in mindfulness.</p> <p>Mindfulness, in case you missed it, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/26/mindfulness-craze-schools-university-near-you-cambridge\">approaching the status of full-blown fad</a> \u2013 pretty impressive for something that is a few millennia old. One description is that it\u2019s the practice of being present in any given moment. If that smells a bit too much like smouldering sandalwood for your liking, try \u201cbeing aware of what you\u2019re doing and what\u2019s happening around you\u201d. </p> <p>Buddhists long ago observed what they call the \u201cmonkey mind\u201d, the idea that the mind is inherently a bit restless and fidgety. If you don\u2019t give it a clear task, it will either keep a running commentary, or wander off on tangents. Your head becomes filled with an endless, meandering chatter \u2013 a din that has been blamed for everything from anxiety to insomnia. The solution, say the Buddhists, is to give the monkey a job. It could be watching your breath come and go (meditation), or it could be keeping a keen eye on what you\u2019re doing (mindfulness).</p> <p>The claimed benefits are as varied as they are numerous: improved focus, anger management, treatment of depression, lower blood pressure, stress relief, general wellbeing. It\u2019s a laundry list of advantages that has seen mindfulness teachings adopted by everyone from captains of industry to captains of football teams. All sorts are trying to experience the benefits of silencing their simian. There are countless ways to do it, but I\u2019ve found one of the best ways to shut him up is to have him monitor your moaning.</p> <p><strong>27 July.</strong> Mid-morning a colleague and I travel to a meeting in his 2006 Toyota, a vehicle he calls Sonia Kluger, after the Australian media personality. I ask him how he feels now that his people mover has become associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/18/tv-host-sonia-kruger-calls-for-end-to-muslim-migration-to-australia\">calls to ban Muslim immigration</a>. He says there\u2019s not much he can do about it. But our conversation has taken a turn, and we make some very pointed observations about Isis and the state of the world. I come dangerously close to complaining, but stop just short.</p> <p>It\u2019s not until later that evening that things fall apart. Over dinner a family member tells us she\u2019s recently discovered that her former boss underpaid her entitlements. The business is no longer trading, so she\u2019s unlikely to see the money owed. I simply can\u2019t participate in the conversation without making negative comments about the person in question. It occurs to me that if I have any chance of making it to 21 days, I\u2019ll need to recognise these situations immediately, and turn mute.</p> <p>It\u2019s that recognition that is the hard part though. That\u2019s what makes it so different from other abstinences. When someone breaks their commitment to Dry July, they do so consciously. I\u2019d imagine very few people get halfway through a beer and suddenly remember that they\u2019re meant to be off the sauce. But that is exactly how it is with complaints. By the time you realise a gripe is in the vicinity, it\u2019s usually too late.</p> <p><strong>5 August. </strong>Seven days and counting, a new record. I call the bank about two errors it has made, and manage to correct both without complaining. Instead, I simply state that I \u201ccan\u2019t understand\u201d why these things occurred when I was led to believe they would not occur. Sure I sound like a robot, but who cares? I\u2019ve completed a task with a high degree of difficulty. If not complaining were figure skating, the bank call would be equivalent to a triple axel. I might not have shown much grace through the air, but I stuck the landing. </p> <p><strong>12 August. </strong>It\u2019s at this point that I could veer off on a tangent about the general level of whingeing in the world. I could note that social media has amplified gripes about everything from overpriced avocados to sluggish Wi-Fi. I could write about how millennials are profuse whingers, surpassed only by non-millennials when you get them on to the topic of those wretched millennials. I could do all that, but I won\u2019t. That would be a meta-whinge, and I\u2019m 14 days without complaint. I\u2019m into the home stretch and I\u2019m not about to slip up now.</p> <p><strong>19 August. </strong>I took on whining, and I won. Were there some 50/50 calls that went in my favour? You bet there were. But when it\u2019s all said (or weirdly bottled up) and done, I achieved my objective. Thrust into all manner of less-than-stellar scenarios, I summoned the strength to stifle my disapproval. I came, I saw, I concurred. Not only that, I did it at a time when the Pok\u00e9mon GO frenzy was at its peak.</p> <p>So how do I feel? Well, unsurprisingly, there\u2019s not some powerful benefit that is unlocked on the 21st day. Rather there is an accumulation. I definitely think my focus has improved, along with general calmness. But perhaps the most noticeable benefit is a greater sense of control. You might think your level of control is just fine as it is \u2013 I certainly did \u2013 but it can be much better. If you try to stop complaining you\u2019ll see what I mean. </p> <p>Turning off autopilot is hard to do, and you\u2019ll find those muscles that steer the plane have atrophied. But if you pump them up for a few weeks, the flight becomes more interesting and engaging. </p> <p>How do I feel? Can\u2019t complain.</p>",

And unlike a lot of women, conservative and otherwise, she\u2019s been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/conway-all-issues-are-women-s-issues-746954819988\">recently telling MSNBC</a> \u201cI think you should judge people by their actions, not just their words on a political campaign trail\u201d. Whether Trump will be able to listen to and learn from Conway\u2019s guidance, however, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Listening to women has never exactly been Trump\u2019s strong suit, but now his entire campaign may hang in the balance of his ability \u2013 or more likely, lack of ability \u2013 to do just that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/kellyanne-conway-is-donald-trumps-last-chance-winning\">Kellyanne Conway is Donald Trump's last, best chance | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bb672ce4b0377cf11192aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T20:57:30.736Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>The Clinton campaign is really pushing this new campaign advert:</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/767827749063057409\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In times of crisis, America depends on steady leadership, clear thinking, and calm judgment. <a href=\"https://t.co/Tpo3Sp7Ri1\">https://t.co/Tpo3Sp7Ri1</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/767827749063057409\">August 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bb608ce4b0b7e6490021a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T20:35:28.093Z\">9.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump postpones immigration speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s highly anticipated speech on immigration, originally set to take place on Thursday in Denver, Colorado, has been postponed.</p> <p>A Trump campaign spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/08/22/donald-trump-immigration-plan-aspen-colorado/\">told the Denver Post</a> that although the candidate will be appearing in at a big-dollar fundraiser in Aspen, Colorado, the trip will not be accompanied by a much-ballyhooed policy address on Trump\u2019s signature issue: immigration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/trump-now-says-he-plans-to-legalize-some-undocumented-immigrants\">Rumors flourished this weekend</a> that Trump had softened his stance on deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, including openness to creating a pathway to legal status, after a meeting with Latino leaders in which Trump reportedly admitted that deporting millions of US residents \u201cis neither possible nor humane\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with Fox &amp; Friends this morning, a defiant Trump dismissed the reports, but did not come out and say that he would, as he\u2019s previously suggested, implement a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to hunt down undocumented immigrants living in the United States,</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not flip-flopping,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want to come up with a really fair, but firm answer.

I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.</p> <p>\u201cIn times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before. That is what we must do now in Louisiana, and I am committed to standing with Louisianans every step of the way.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f6555c9458d3aa66d18d003eb4d9051b1f62d10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f6555c9458d3aa66d18d003eb4d9051b1f62d10/0_0_3500_2450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump sign on flood dross in St. Amant, Louisiana, U.S., August 21, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump sign on flood dross in St. Amant, Louisiana, U.S., August 21, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bae06be4b0b7e649001f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T12:58:15.626Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Former secretary of state Colin Powell has accused the Hillary Clinton cabal of trying to \u201cpin\u201d her email scandal on him, after the revelation last week that Clinton brought up Powell in discussing the issue with the FBI. </p> <p>\u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me,\u201d Powell <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-pinning-email-scandal-on-him\">told</a> People magazine at a fundraiser for the Apollo theater in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday night. \u201cThe truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Powell told NBC News <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-recommended-private-email-sources-n634136\">last week</a> he sent a memo to Clinton \u201cdescribing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department\u201d. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-advised-her-to-use-private-email.html?_r=1\">reported</a> last Thursday that Clinton told the FBI that Powell had \u201cadvised her to use a personal email account\u201d. The report was based on a leak by Congress of notes from a classified interview. </p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Powell, 79, told People. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK; I\u2019m free.\u201d </p> <p>It doesn\u2019t bother Powell. Will it bother voters? </p> <h2>Big Clinton ad buy</h2> <p>The Clinton campaign has reserved $80m in air time in eight competitive states for the fall, bringing their total spending on TV ads to $150m, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:6c8cf18968e6478d907eda2cdab1e0db\">reports</a>.

  "<p>Donald Trump veered off script on Monday night to claim that \u201cinner cities run by the Democrats\u201d were more dangerous than countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The Republican nominee was meant to be delivering a speech calling for Hillary Clinton be investigated by a special prosecutor. However, once again he veered off message in an attempt to appeal to minority voters in apocalyptic terms. </p> <p>\u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats,\u201d Trump said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has made increased appeals for support from African Americans in recent days. Despite that, a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-clinton-jumps-nine-point-lead-over-trump-n623131\">recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll</a> showed Trump receiving the support of only 1% of African American voters, a historically low total. The poll did have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. The Republican nominee has repeatedly argued that African American voters should support him in the past week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/what-do-you-have-to-lose-donald-trump-appeals-for-black-vote\">saying</a>: \u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d In contrast, the New York real estate developer has railed against what he called \u201cthe bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\u201d</p> <p>The intended focus of Trump\u2019s message on Monday was his call for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton\u2019s leadership of the state department. Trump claimed that the FBI and Department of Justice could not be trusted to investigate \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s crimes\u201d. The FBI in July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">decided not to pursue</a> criminal charges against Clinton for her use of an unsecured private email server while secretary of state. However, in doing so, FBI director James Comey rebuked Clinton for the \u201cextremely careless\u201d way in which she handled her emails.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-release-election-day\">Hillary Clinton emails recovered by FBI to be released just before election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the speech, Trump also said he was \u201cfighting for peaceful regime change in our country\u201d and warned gravely of potential election fraud. \u201cYou got to go out and watch. You know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he said. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/trump-recruits-election-observers-voter-intimidation-fears\">has long made</a> unsubstantiated claims about \u201ca rigged election\u201d and warned of in-person voter fraud recently at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. However, an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">exhaustive investigation</a> of in-person voter fraud in the United States found only 31 cases since 2000 out of more than 1bn ballots cast. </p> <p>Trump spoke in the blue collar city of Akron, Ohio. The Buckeye State has 18 electoral votes, and no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio. According to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_trump_vs_clinton-5634.html#polls\">data complied by Real Clear Politics</a>, Clinton has not trailed in a single statewide poll of Ohio since April. However, despite these sagging poll numbers and cryptic warnings about election fraud, Trump was still confident of victory: \u201cI just get the feeling that we\u2019re going to win in a landslide.\u201d</p>"
