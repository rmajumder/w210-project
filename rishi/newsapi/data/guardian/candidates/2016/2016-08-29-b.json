  "<p>Anthony Weiner\u2019s latest sexting scandal could hardly be worse if it were scripted to maximally embarrass Huma Abedin and her employer, the Clinton campaign. And on Monday, following a New York Post report that included a cringe-worthy photo of Weiner in bed beside his and Abedin\u2019s young son, Abedin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal\">announced</a> that she and her husband would be separating.</p> <p>No sooner did the news of her decision break on Monday than the predictable happened: Donald Trump started <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/anthony-weiner-sexting-huma-abedin.html\">politicizing it for personal gain</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/did-anthony-weiner-want-to-get-caught-sexting\">Did Anthony Weiner want to get caught sexting? | Jamieson Webster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After condescendingly opining about how Abedin \u201cwill be far better off\u201d without her husband, Trump proceeded to extend his political smearing of Abedin to her boss in a statement to the New York Times. \u201cI only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,\u201d he wrote in a statment. \u201cWho knows what he learned and who he told? It\u2019s just another example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s bad judgment.\u201d</p> <p>Never mind that a reaction from Trump should be irrelevant here \u2013 that none of this should reflect on the Clinton campaign at all. This is not a story about the 2016 presidential race. But it will be made into one.<br></p> <p>We knew this would happen, and specifically, that Trump would lead the way to politicizing the failings of a campaign staffer\u2019s husband, because it\u2019s something he\u2019s done before. Exactly a year ago, he suggested that Abedin had leaked sensitive state department information to Weiner, whom he referred to as a \u201cperv\u201d, a \u201csleazebag\u201d and generally a \u201cbad guy\u201d simply because the pair was married. Speaking at an event in suburban Boston last year, Trump suggested there\u2019s a less than \u201c5% chance that\u2019s she\u2019s not telling Anthony Weiner now of a public relations firm what the hell is coming across\u201d her desk, as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/28/donald-trump-clinton-huma-abedin-anthony-weiner\">the Guardian reported</a> at the time.</p> <p>But we also knew this would happen, because it\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s guilty of this narrative spin, as Rush Limbaugh made clear on Monday with a particularly odious line conflating Abedin\u2019s personal life with her political one: \u201cPresumably she\u2019s going to be Hillary\u2019s chief of staff. But she has not been chief of her husband\u2019s staff,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2016/08/limbaugh-blames-huma-abedin-she-has-not\">he said</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a long history and rich culture of blaming women in American politics for their husbands\u2019 bad behavior. And nobody is a better poster woman for that particular sexist affliction than Abedin\u2019s boss, whose personal life has been the target of more public vitriol than perhaps any other political figure in history. This despite the fact that, like Abedin, Clinton had engaged in zero sexual misconduct herself.</p> <p>Even now, in the supposedly enlightened year of 2016, when Trump is attacked for being bad on women, his defenders often respond by blaming Clinton for her husband\u2019s actions. Trump surrogate Heidi Harris <a href=\"http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/08/09/watch-trump-spokeswoman-defends-track-record-women-eviscerating/\">did this recently</a> on MSNBC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy\">AM Joy</a>. Asked about Trump\u2019s treatment of women, Harris responded with an attack on Clinton: \u201cWhat I think hilarious is Hillary Clinton is no example for any woman. This is a woman who stood next to a guy for decades who has embarrassed her, humiliated her, cheated on her, chased every skirt he could possibly chase,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy/watch/trump-s-problems-with-women-affecting-polls-739397187711\">Harris said, adding, </a>\u201cShe\u2019s no example for anyone\u2019s daughter.\u201d </p> <p>Bill Clinton\u2019s bad behavior is not and never was his wife\u2019s fault, but she will continue to be blamed as long as sexism is alive in America. </p> <p>Similarly, Abedin would have been attacked for her husband\u2019s behavior no matter what she did.</p> <p>After the news of Abedin\u2019s decision to leave her marriage broke, many, including a senior New York Times reporter on the Clinton beat, were already making comparisons between Abedin and Steve Bannon, the recently appointed chief executive officer of the Trump campaign who\u2019s been accused of domestic violence. \u201cThe problem for Clinton team \u2013 after Democrats repeatedly pointed to Bannon personal past, going to be hard to argue Weiner is off limits,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/770274286552682496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted the reporter</a>.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s infinitely easier to argue that Abedin\u2019s husband\u2019s sexual behavior should be off limits. For one thing, he did nothing illegal. For another, Anthony Weiner is not the CEO of Clinton\u2019s campaign; he has no role in it whatsoever.</p> <p>Whatever your feelings about his failure to redeem himself even having been given not just a second chance, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/01/25/a-long-hard-look-into-anthony-weiners-downfall/\">but a third</a>, this is a heartbreaking result for Abedin and her young son, who opened up their personal life<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-the-movie-weiner-tells-us-about-huma-abedin/2016/06/02/142b67b0-27ee-11e6-ae4a-3cdd5fe74204_story.html\"> once again this past year</a> in the hope that a documentary about their lives post-scandal would make personal redemption possible for the father of their family.<br></p> <p>Blame Weiner for all this, mock him, or feel sorry for him, but don\u2019t blame Huma Abedin. She did nothing wrong, and any attempts to blame her here and insinuate Hillary Clinton into the equation are worse than purely political: they are blatantly sexist. </p> <p>A man who cheats on his wife does not reflect a shortcoming in his spouse \u2013 or in the woman who would hire her. If anything, the fact that these women have been able to withstand so much personal hardship in the face of unyielding political attacks is a testament to their character. We should respect them more for what they\u2019ve been able to endure despite the sexually dysfunctional men in their lives, and despite whether they ultimately chose to stay with their husband, or not.</p>",

There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick has gone on to say that he will continue to sit out the anthem until he sees change in the way black people are treated in the US.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/30/colin-kaepernick-stay-seated-national-anthem-until-racial-oppression-ends-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xj9x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690983\"            data-video-name=\"Colin Kaepernick: I'll stay seated for national anthem until racial oppression ends \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5476ce4b09fcabd06d277\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/30/160830Kaepernick2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/30/160830Kaepernick2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/30/160830Kaepernick2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/30/colin-kaepernick-stay-seated-national-anthem-until-racial-oppression-ends-video\">Colin Kaepernick: I\u2019ll stay seated for national anthem until racial oppression ends</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The 49ers issued a statement saying that Americans have the right to protest or support the anthem.</p> <p>\u201cThe national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pregame ceremony,\u201d the team said. \u201cIt is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose to participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick\u2019s stand has proved divisive within the NFL. His former coach at the 49ers, Jim Harbaugh, was critical of the decision. \u201cI acknowledge his right to do that. I don\u2019t respect the motivation or the action,\u201d said Harbaugh, who is now head coach at Michigan. Harbaugh later said he had misspoken and said he supported the quarterback\u2019s motivation but not his \u201cmethod\u201d.</p> <p>Other NFL players believe that Kaepernick\u2019s actions are disrespectful towards the military. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me, because my brother was a Marine, and he lost a lot of friends,\u201d Kaepernick\u2019s former team-mate Alex Boone <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/vikings/2016/08/28/alex-boone-rips-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-49ers/89514450/\">told USA Today Sports</a>. \u201cThat flag obviously gives [Kaepernick] the right to do whatever he wants.

  "<p>Two days after Facebook announced it was replacing the humans that write the Trending Topics descriptions with robots, a fake article about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-fires-trending-topics-team-algorithm\">appeared in its list of trending stories</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, Facebook announced that in a bid to reduce bias it would make the Trending feature more automated and laid off up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/facebook-trending-news-team-curators-toxic-work-environment\">26 contractors hired to write and edit the short descriptions</a> that accompanied each trend. <a href=\"http://qz.com/769002/after-replacing-human-editors-with-an-algorithm-facebook-ended-up-with-a-fake-trending-news-story/\">On Sunday</a> a story headlined \u201cBreaking: Fox News Exposes Traitor Megyn Kelly, Kicks Her Out for Backing Hillary\u201d found its way into the list of trending stories \u2013 despite the fact that it\u2019s not true.</p> <p>Facebook hasn\u2019t completely replaced humans with robots. There are still people involved in the process to \u201cconfirm that a topic is tied to a current news event in the real world\u201d, says the social network. As the Megyn Kelly episode shows, there are clearly flaws in that process.</p> <p>The case illustrates how Facebook has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/in-its-fight-against-fake-news-facebook-found-a-resiliant-fo\">lost its battle with fake news</a>. </p> <p>In January 2015, the social network <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/01/news-feed-fyi-showing-fewer-hoaxes/ \">updated the news feed</a><a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/01/news-feed-fyi-showing-fewer-hoaxes/\"> </a>to \u201creduce the distribution of posts that people have reported as hoaxes\u201d. The problem is that people are easily fooled by fake news too, and a plethora of tricky-to-distinguish fake news sites have emerged. Facebook\u2019s hoax detection system relies on user-submitted notifications that a link is fishy; if users don\u2019t spot a story is a dud, neither does Facebook. </p> <p>This problem becomes more pernicious as it leaks out into the real world. In the past month, there have been two cases of mass panic at airports \u2013 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/chaos-new-york-jfk-airport-reports-possible-shooting-evacuation\">JFK on 14 August</a> and at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/panic-at-los-angeles-airport-lax-after-noise-mistaken-for-gunfire\">LAX on 28 August</a> \u2013 where false reports of gunmen were whipped up by social media in the absence of official information or instructions. </p> <p>Compounding the issue is the news that Facebook will soon allow users to trigger the Safety Check setting during emergencies. The feature was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101699265809491\">launched in October 2014</a> to allow users to flag to their loved ones that they were safe during major natural disasters. It has since expanded to cover terrorist attacks as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe next thing we need to do is make it so that communities can trigger it themselves when there is some disaster,\u201d said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/29/12692468/facebook-safety-check-community-trigger-emergency\">speaking at at town hall meeting in Rome on Monday</a>.</p> <p>Moving from a top-down disaster alert model to a bottom-up one should, in theory, help Facebook counter some of the criticism it received for being biased towards western nations. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/facebook-clickbait-algorithm-change-newsfeed\">Facebook wants to stop clickbait. (And you won't believe how they're doing it)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the company activated the Safety Check tool after the terror attacks in Paris in November, critics argued that it should have activated the tool in places like Lebanon, where terrorists <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-safety-check-paris-beirut\"> killed twice as many people on the same day</a>.</p> <p>While it makes sense to try to bring more balance to the Safety Check system, allowing anyone to trigger it themselves could add legitimacy to the kind of chaotic herd behaviour seen at JFK and LAX.</p> <p>Zuckerberg insists that Facebook is a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-zuckerberg-idUSKCN1141WN\">technology company and not a media company</a>, building tools instead of creating content. However, as Facebook\u2019s algorithm \u2013 which, after all, is built and maintained by human beings \u2013 decides which content people see in their news feeds, it is arguably irresponsible for the company to allow misinformation to spread unfettered when it is now so influential in the daily distribution of news. </p> <p>\u201cMachines think in black and white,\u201d said Mandy Jenkins, head of news at Storyful, which specialises in verifying and distributing social news. \u201cI don\u2019t think verification can be automated yet. What something means to be real and verified is not black and white.</p> <p>\u201cA judgement call has to happen. It\u2019s about asking questions and seeing how a story adds up against other facts we know. What is the background of the source or site? Who is the person who wrote this story? Where does it come from? These are too many questions for a robot to answer on its own.\u201d</p> <p>Trained humans with fact-checking and journalism skills, such as those fired from the company last Friday, aren\u2019t 100% foolproof, but they can intervene to keep algorithmic wildfire at bay. Perhaps it\u2019s time for Facebook to rehire them?<br></p> <p>Facebook did not respond to requests for comment. </p>",
  "<p>Sometimes we don\u2019t have a choice about the people in our lives. Plenty of Americans know what it\u2019s like to have a family member who is racist or sexist, and most of us don\u2019t have the privilege of choosing who we work with or for.

The trusted Hillary Clinton aide decided to separate from the scandal-plagued former congressman.

Why?</p> <p>We could chalk this up to fallacies inherent in male sexuality, which often seem to be more evident in the powerful and famous. We could describe his behavior through the model of addiction \u2013 and the immediacy of cellphone technology and the anonymity of the online universe that makes us all so vulnerable. But I think there is more at work here. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/10/weiner-documentary-review-anthony-weiner-sexting-scandal\">Weiner review \u2013 a political scandal in slow motion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anthony Weiner wanted to be caught, and caught and caught. It isn\u2019t enough that he sent out the pictures himself in 2011. The latest rendition is revealing on a whole number of levels if we look closely.<br></p> <p>First, he was apparently sexting with someone who is in the opposing political camp. His lady-friend supports the opponent of his wife\u2019s boss \u2013 she couldn\u2019t have more reason to want to turn him in. <br></p> <p>In the direct messages published by the New York Post, Weiner allegedly sent a photo of himself with bulging underwear while his child lay beside him. \u201cSomeone just climbed into my bed,\u201d the text reads. She replied: \u201cYou do realize you can see you[r] Weiner in that pic??\u201d <br></p> <p>This act seems to bring on a moment of conscience, and Weiner appears to become scared that he accidentally posted the message publicly online. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time \u2013 that\u2019s why he was forced to give up his seat in Congress in 2011, in his original sexting scandal. He writes: \u201cOoooooh \u2026 I was scared. For half a second I thought I posted something.\u201d This is then followed by him writing \u201cStop looking at my crotch\u201d. <br></p> <p>It should also be noted that since Weiner tends to send pictures of his penis concealed by his underpants, they are appropriate for worldwide distribution and need not be censored or blurred. One might wonder whether, on some level, that is a deliberate choice.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhatever you did it on purpose\u201d, his texting partner replies. She quickly corrects herself \u2013 of course he did it on purpose \u2013 with: \u201cO I see, you thought you posted on your TL [timeline] not DM [direct message]. S--t happens be careful\u201d. In hindsight, these misunderstandings seem oddly prophetic. He is doing this on purpose, making the same mistakes, not being careful, so that he can confirm for himself that everyone wants to see his stuff. </p> <p>Still when he says \u201cstop looking\u201d, there is something genuine about that request. Anthony Weiner, I think, wants to stop these scandals. He wants to find a way for us to stop looking at him. Why does anyone try to get caught \u2013 if not to be stopped from carrying out a destructive behavior? The strange thing is that even public humiliation and scorn cannot stop him, which is what fascinates us and keeps the cycle going. <br></p> <p>In Freud\u2019s last published paper, The Splitting of the Ego in the Process of Defense, in 1938, he writes about sexual impulse and what happens when we are faced with prohibition that can result in danger. He found that, when presented with the choice between stopping or going ahead despite danger, some people do not decide either way. They keep both positions and split their mind in half, so to speak \u2013 inhabiting an untenable, split reality. </p> <p>Who displays this contradiction better than Weiner? Is this not what we see in the play-by-play of his sexting, to say nothing of his entire life? Fascinatingly, Freud goes on to talk about the fact that this symptom of splitting often appears in someone\u2019s relationship to his genitals. <br></p> <p>This strange thing that Freud calls \u2018castration anxiety\u2019 is the contradiction between \u2018I have it, this penis of all penises\u2019 and \u2018I have nothing, nothing to show for myself\u2019. This is precisely what we see Weiner play out before our eyes, as he seemingly begs us to put some limit on his compulsive display of his genitals to the public.</p> <p>Very Freudian, of course, but how can we bypass this when it comes to thinking about Anthony Weiner?<br></p>",

  "<p>When Theresa May calls the cabinet to order on Wednesday morning, amid the chintz of Chequers, the roses will be past their best and the lawn covered with dew. After Britain\u2019s mad summer, the May administration will convene in Buckinghamshire finally to face the chill autumn reality: Britain voted for Brexit without a plan and the Europeans intend to shaft us.</p> <p>They may not have actually used the word \u201cshaft\u201d when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ventotene-summit-france-italy-germany-eu-brexit-vote\">they met on the Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi last week</a>, but German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi know they hold all the strongest cards. French civil servants are trained at the <em>grandes \u00e9coles</em>, like diplomatic special forces, to spot and ruthlessly attack the weakness of negotiating partners. And May\u2019s administration goes into this critical negotiating process with an obvious weakness. It does not know whether it wants to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to want \u201cpartial\u201d single market access, to keep the City\u2019s passporting arrangements into the eurozone. If, in order to get it, Britain has to soft-pedal on immigration controls, that would be no disaster for the Treasury, whose growth projections in this year\u2019s budget relied on the impact of a million EU migrants over the next five years.</p> <p>Brexit minister David Davis and international trade secretary Liam Fox are champing at the bit to begin the article 50 process \u2013 naturally they have drawn up rival timelines \u2013 but have so far failed to produce any kind of blueprint for their preferred outcome, which is to quit the single market and end free movement. This leaves May struggling to assert control over the process of even coming to a negotiating strategy \u2013 hence Wednesday\u2019s away day \u2013 and in severe danger of floundering once she has to deliver her Brexit plan to the other EU heads of government.</p> <p>It is a real, serious and material split in the government of a major country. And it is backed by rival forces in society. Those for whom Brexit became a religion in the spring of 2016 do not care about the niceties of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. They voted to leave all of it and to \u201ctake control\u201d of migration. But the economic elite of Britain, which has the strongest voice both in the Conservative high echelons and in the civil service, simply does not want Brexit. Above all it wants to maintain market access for the City, and for the major global service firms headquartered in London. For them, it is logical to hope that Europe stonewalls all May\u2019s requests for flexible market access, and that \u2013 by the end of the process, and with the economy suffering \u2013 the public will be ready to accept staying in the EU, with some minor variations on migration.</p> <p>Labour, too, is racked by the same dilemma. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/01/john-mcdonnell-brexit-will-end-free-movement-of-people\">John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d on Europe</a> do not, and cannot, include keeping free movement, but do include keeping the City\u2019s financial passport and single market \u201caccess\u201d. For Jeremy Corbyn the additional problem is that the European left wants Britain out of the EU pronto, before it can negotiate any dilution of the social chapter.</p> <p>Both main parties, then, are trapped between what is possible and what the British people voted for. Owen Smith may be wowing his rallies with talk of a second referendum, but the party leaderships are beginning to realise this will only be sorted out in parliament. It will be complex, messy and reputations will be minced. The only democratic way of doing it is to say \u2013 if necessary with May, Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon standing shoulder to shoulder somewhere symbolic \u2013 that Britain\u2019s aim is to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Until the delusion of the giant flounce-out is killed off \u2013 and until Liam Fox and David Davies are told to stop dreaming about it \u2013 those negotiating with Britain from the other side will have a massive incentive to force us into it. If they think it is our secret desire, or our plan B, for Britain to quit the single market cleanly, Europe will not take seriously any UK government demands for variations to single market rules, designed to keep us on the inside the market, though outside the EU itself.</p> <p>May should seek cabinet agreement for a baseline request: to remain as part of the EEA, with a humane, time-limited restriction on free movement as Britain\u2019s one demand, and then get on with it. She should make a statement to the commons that rules out leaving the single market. Any confusion that is allowed to fester over this will corrode her own authority as the Europeans sensibly deploy every trick in the book \u2013 a book going back to the era when <a href=\"http://www.hyperhistory.com/online_n2/people_n2/persons6_n2/metternich.html\">Prince Metternich</a> ran rings round Britain in post-Napoleonic Europe \u2013 to make her squirm.</p> <p>There will be uproar in Ukipland \u2013 but there always is. Not only is there no clear mandate for leaving the single market, but the negotiating positions of our major partners are now clear. They have not said \u201cgo ahead, pick and mix\u201d from the EU goodie-bag: they have said the single market plus free movement or get lost. The British negotiators\u2019 job is to prise that position apart \u2013 not rubberstamp it, which is what Fox, Davies and other hardcore Brexiters want.</p> <p>May wants to serve a full term. But both logic and principle dictate that were she to give in to the \u201cclean break\u201d brigade within the cabinet, she would have to schedule an election and fight for a mandate to lead Britain into this particularly stupid form of economic suicide. If so, whoever leads Labour should be salivating at the prospect. The Brexit moment caused many in the City to question the long-term direction of centre-right politics. By finessing May into power without a vote, and surrounding her with the grey men and women of provincial Toryism, the grandees of the party restored the impression that they could \u2013 just about \u2013 hold the line for the City, the big law firms, the service giants and big pharma.</p> <p>But if Tories want to go into an election promising to destroy 30 years of European financial integration in order to assuage the xenophobes and climate deniers of Ukip, that would be a different prospect.</p> <p>For the opposition parties, if they can recover their nerve, any confusion coming out of Wednesday\u2019s cabinet \u2013 still better any open revolt \u2013 will be a big opportunity. They should state, simply, that they will seek a vote in parliament to veto any Brexit strategy that tries to remove Britain from the single market. That principle \u2013 which needs no further elaboration since these are opposition parties, not a parallel government \u2013 could become the rock upon which Theresa May\u2019s soaraway ratings are broken, and her majority ground down.</p>",

The Democrat enraged conservatives when he recently designated three new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/12/obama-doubles-protected-land-california-desert\">national monuments</a> in the west, sparking criticisms that he was orchestrating a massive \u201cland grab\u201d.</p> <h2>Tensions between cowboys and feds</h2> <p>The Bundy family\u2019s fight officially began in March 1993 when, after nearly 40 years, Cliven abruptly stopped paying grazing fees and applying for BLM permits. </p> <p>Grazing fees had <a href=\"http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/grazing/pdfs/CostsAndConsequences_01-2015.pdf\">increased</a> in the previous decade by around 30%, though the prices fluctuated each year, and by 1993 it cost Cliven roughly $2,000 a year to have 85 cattle graze on the federal lands by his property. </p> <p></p> <p>The family was also furious that the US Fish and Wildlife Service had classified the <a href=\"http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=C04L\">desert tortoise</a> as a \u201cthreatened\u201d species and was moving forward with further efforts to <a href=\"http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/federal_register/fr2390.pdf\">restrict</a> land access.</p> <p>\u201cDad ... fired the BLM,\u201d said Arden Bundy, 18, Cliven\u2019s youngest son.</p> <p>The BLM, however, saw it differently. </p> <p>That year, Cliven sent repeated letters to the government saying he intended to graze cattle \u201cpursuant to my vested grazing rights\u201d and claiming that the BLM had not<strong> </strong>produced documents showing it had jurisdiction over the public lands.</p> <p>Within months, the BLM informed Cliven that he was trespassing, ordering him to remove his cattle. Tensions between the cowboys and federal regulators quickly escalated.</p> <p>On 24 January 1994, BLM agents placed a copy of a \u201cdemand for payment\u201d notice on Cliven\u2019s car. According to the BLM\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115323/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-1998\">account</a>, Cliven got out of his truck, accused the federal agency of harassment, and threw the document out of his window before driving off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8938842ab286d85d377ce22dac2467bdb817b6c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8938842ab286d85d377ce22dac2467bdb817b6c0/344_0_4632_3645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bundy family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bundy family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Hawkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Cliven\u2019s sons then picked it up and tore it into pieces in front of the government workers. </p> <p>On 3 March 1994, Cliven sent a check for $1,961.47 to Clark County for grazing fees \u2013 his way of making a statement that he was willing to pay taxes to local governments, but not to the feds. The county refused to cash the check. </p> <p>Four years later, a federal court <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115323/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-1998\">ordered</a> Cliven to remove his livestock from public lands. He refused.</p> <p>Federal officials fined Cliven for every day he refused to pay, but his cattle continued to graze \u2013 and multiply. By 2011, the BLM <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/2011.7.26_IntenttoImpoundNotice.pdf\">told</a> Cliven that it intended to impound his cows.</p> <p>In response, Cliven publicly <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115646/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-2016\">stated</a> his family motto \u2013 that he \u201cwould do whatever it takes\u201d to stop the BLM. </p> <p>In March 2014, the agency told him it would soon proceed with its mass seizure operation. Cliven responded by saying he was \u201cready to do battle\u201d.</p> <p>By then, BLM said Cliven <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/info/newsroom/2014/april/national_office__statement.html\">owed</a> more than $1m. </p> <p>The next month, his 14 children, living throughout Utah and Nevada, returned to the Bundy ranch to stand up to the BLM. </p> <p>They were prepared for death, said Mel, Cliven\u2019s 42-year-old son. He and his wife Briana went so far as to write up a last will and testament. </p> <p>\u201cIf it means losing my life, then yes, I am willing,\u201d Mel said. Briana, 30, said her husband wanted her to stay away for her safety, but she said she felt obligated to help \u2013 even if it meant she and her husband would be killed, leaving their four kids without parents. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it means losing my life, then yes, I am willing</p> <footer> <cite>Mel Bundy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nothing will stop the Bundys, Briana added: \u201cThey\u2019ll have to kill every one of us.\u201d</p> <p>More than 400 people from across the US showed up to the ranch to defend the man who had become their cowboy hero. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest things that inspired us was everybody coming to our aid,\u201d said Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife. \u201cWe had people from all over the country that came out and knew what the consequences could be, and yet they came anyway.\u201d </p> <p>The supporters camped out, pitching tents in the family\u2019s back yard and waiting for the government to arrive.</p> <h2>\u2018Taking our land back\u2019</h2> <p>More than 20 snipers, some carrying assault rifles, positioned themselves behind concrete barriers high above on highway bridges and aimed their weapons at the officers below them. Some were dressed in military-style tactical gear, while others hid behind unarmed supporters, using them as shields to mask their movements.<br></p> <p>This was the dramatic scene that the government <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115646/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-2016\">says</a> it faced on the morning of 12 April 2014 when, two decades after Cliven had stopped paying grazing fees, law enforcement officials attempted to take away the rancher\u2019s cows. </p> <p>The standoff unfolded on a desolate desert range near the Bundy house. </p> <p>Early in the morning, the BLM managed to corral about 400 cattle into an \u201cimpoundment site\u201d. But Cliven had hundreds of supporters at his back, and he and his sons quickly orchestrated a plan. </p> <p>Cliven told a crowd of followers that \u201cGod [is] going to be with us\u201d and that it was time \u201cto take our land back\u201d. He then commanded a group to travel about three miles down a dirt road by horse and meet near where the cattle were being held.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e781702c192c1702d0425512d4ad9c69c0b3f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e781702c192c1702d0425512d4ad9c69c0b3f83/0_341_5184_3114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cliven Bundy told a crowd of followers that \u2018God [is] going to be with us\u2019 and that it was time \u2018to take our land back\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cliven Bundy told a crowd of followers that \u2018God [is] going to be with us\u2019 and that it was time \u2018to take our land back\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By around 11.50am, Ammon and a group of protesters were 150 yards from the cattle, which were protected by a makeshift metal gate guarded by two officers.</p> <p>Sixty yards from the gate, the cowboys formed a \u201chuman line\u201d that stretched across the site, and Mel, Ammon\u2019s older brother, soon after <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322159388/Cliven-Bundy-Indictment\">brought</a> a separate group of about 40 protesters on horseback.</p> <p>Agents called for backup, but the FBI and the BLM were hugely outnumbered \u2013 50 officers against roughly 400 protesters.</p> <p>Officers used loudspeakers to order the crowd to disperse.

Meanwhile, some of the police started spotting the gunmen above them on bridges and within the crowd.</p> <p>The officers said there were too many protesters and \u201ctoo many guns to count\u201d, and they had nowhere to hide if someone started shooting. They were surrounded. </p> <p>The government retreated and the Bundys celebrated victory.</p> <p>\u201cI remember looking down gun barrels right in my face and just thinking I wasn\u2019t scared,\u201d recalled Arden, Cliven\u2019s youngest son, who was then 16 years old and helped organize cowboys at the ranch. \u201cThey\u2019re looking right at you with a gun in your face, and you\u2019re feeling strength.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re looking right at you with a gun in your face, and you\u2019re feeling strength</p> <footer> <cite>Arden Bundy, Cliven's youngest son</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The cows were released and agents left the compound, some traumatized by the experience. \u201cMany of these officers, some of them combat veterans, remain profoundly affected emotionally by this event to this day,\u201d prosecutors later said.</p> <p>With the FBI gone, Cliven said his ranch and the surrounding Bunkerville area became \u201cthe freest part of the land\u201d.</p> <p>For the following 22 months, he and his sons faced no consequences for the armed conflict or his family\u2019s continued refusal to pay fees or move his cows. When I sat with him in his living room in February, Cliven said he remained proud of that victory.</p> <p>\u201cHere on the Bundy ranch <strong>...</strong> we the people, the public has had access to this area,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a rancher, I have enjoyed freedom.\u201d</p> <p>Ten days after our meeting, the US government took him into custody, leveling felony conspiracy charges against him that could condemn him to die behind bars.</p> <h2>\u2018Racism is alive and well\u2019</h2> <p>One week after the FBI retreated from the 2014 standoff, Cliven\u2019s celebrity status came crashing down.</p> <p>Most of the media circus had left Bunkerville, but Cliven was still holding regular press conferences at his ranch where a few supporters lingered. </p> <p>On 19 April 2014, wearing a cowboy hat and short-sleeve white button down, Cliven, speaking to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6X8bkv8E8\">conference</a> that drew a total of one reporter and photographer, went on a meandering rant about abortion, abuses of welfare and race.</p> <p>In comments reported by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html\">New York Times</a>, he said: \u201cI want to tell you one more thing I know about the negro. </p> <p>\u201cBecause they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I\u2019ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\u2019t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\u201d </p> <p>The backlash was swift and brutal. US senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada, who had expressed support for the Bundys\u2019 cause, were forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/25/cliven-bundy-saga-republicans-far-right-rand-paul\">dissociate themselves with the rancher</a>. Cliven lost allies in the conservative media, too: Fox News host Sean Hannity <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/24/sean-hannity-cliven-bundy-fox-news_n_5206516.html\">said</a> his remarks were \u201cbeyond repugnant\u201d, and radio host Glenn Beck <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/glenn-beck-cliven-bundy-unhinged-105991\">called</a> him \u201cunhinged from reality\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"305ade462790c66715a8ba528542ae335d08ec75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/305ade462790c66715a8ba528542ae335d08ec75/0_613_4991_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cliven Bundy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cliven Bundy lost allies in the conservative media after ranting about abortion, abuses of welfare and race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Hawkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many saw the remarks as a direct manifestation of the deeply embedded racism of rural white conservative westerners. </p> <p>\u201cIf you went and did a study of the people who live where they are, I think you would find racism is alive and well,\u201d said Terri Robertson, a <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/water-environment/conservationist-has-lifetime-secrets-worth-sharing\">conservationist</a> and cousin of Cliven who lives in Las Vegas and has <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/cliven-bundy?printable=true\">spoken out</a> against the family. </p> <p>Ammon said the \u201cwhite media\u201d was the only group angered by his father\u2019s comments, and that the remarks were \u201cone of the best things that ever happened\u201d because it showed the family who their true supporters were. </p> <p>Since being locked up in a city prison, Ammon said he has come to better understand the plight of African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve created a lot of friends in here that are black people,\u201d Ammon said, with a smile. A fellow inmate recently told him: \u201c\u2018Bundy, you know, I see what they did to you.

Cliven\u2019s cousin, Kim Bundy, who records show is based in Ruth, Nevada, owns 120 acres of land that he <a href=\"http://images.water.nv.gov/images/Protests/81065/kim%20g%20bundy.pdf\">calls</a> the \u201cNigger Abe\u201d place.

He briefly worked construction in Las Vegas but soon after moved to Cedar City, Utah, for college.</p> <p>After a few semesters, Ammon dropped out and started a small repair business, which he ran when he met his now wife, Lisa.</p> <p>\u201cHe was really flirtatious,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had dated lots of boys, but none of them were men. This guy was a man. He was mature.\u201d</p> <p>Ammon and Lisa married in July 2001 and eventually moved to Arizona, where he ran Valet Fleet Service. But after the 2014 Bunkerville standoff, the family relocated to Idaho, in part because they \u201cwere hoping to get away from the spotlight\u201d, Lisa said.</p> <p>But in 2015, Bundy supporters began sending the family stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/oregon-militia-standoff-occupation-dwight-steven-hammond\">Dwight Hammond and his son Steven</a>, two Harney County, Oregon, ranchers convicted for multiple arson <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/eastern-oregon-ranchers-convicted-arson-resentenced-five-years-prison\">offenses</a> that federal prosecutors said they committed on public lands.

If Trump cannot win North Carolina, something is going badly wrong.</p> <p>Keith, who like many Trump voters was reluctant to give his surname, echoed the very issue that the campaign is most worried could alienate voters in increasingly diverse states like this come November.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Saying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea</p> <footer> <cite>Mark, 35, from Connecticut</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way he deals with certain things worries me,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is a big thing. You can\u2019t just ban a certain race from coming into the country. It doesn\u2019t work that way, especially as it\u2019s the land of the free.\u201d</p> <p>For core supporters, Trump\u2019s intolerant views and loud mouth matter less. For example, Keith\u2019s friend Kaycee, an accountant from Great Falls, Montana, was less worried: \u201cI would vote for Trump even though his social game isn\u2019t so hot. He is an incredible businessman and I really think that\u2019s what America needs right now. Sometimes he has no filter, but sometimes that\u2019s not a bad quality.\u201d</p> <p>But among floating voters, particularly in states without a tradition of voting Republican but where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/trump-clinton-kaine-rust-belt-pennsylvania-ohio\">Trump\u2019s economic message is resonating</a>, people are easily turned off by the billionaire\u2019s brash style.</p> <p>\u201cFrom where I come from, they call him a bullshit artist,\u201d said Neil, a 63-year-old self-employed heating and air-conditioning contractor from Providence, Rhode Island, who was also visiting the Nascar Hall of Fame on the day Trump landed in town.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a big fan. I just don\u2019t trust what he says. He\u2019s got that very pushy attitude. From a political standpoint, I don\u2019t think he is doing that well. He just squirts off what\u2019s off the top of his head. I don\u2019t think he spends a lot time thinking about what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p> <p>The younger voters get, the bluer the state they come from, the more Trump\u2019s style is a turn-off. Even, it turns out, for white dads at the Nascar shrine.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s thin on policy, big on broad-based authoritarian statements,\u201d said Mark, a 35-year-old engineer from Connecticut. \u201cSaying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea or something.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is very popular in a very narrow strip of America. That works well in a Republican primary, but not in a general election.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to capture states like North Carolina would kill Trump\u2019s hopes of winning the White House. Worse, for Republicans, the mood among potential voters here speaks to the party\u2019s concern about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">losing the control of the Senate</a> that was gained two years ago with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/north-carolina-midterm-elections-thom-tillis-obamacare\">victories like that of Thom Tillis</a>.</p> <p>Senate seats last for six years, so Tillis is safe for now, but his North Carolina colleague Richard Burr is up for re-election.

  "<p>Last week, the California state senate passed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AJR43\">Assembly Joint Resolution 43</a>, urging the federal government to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>WHEREAS, A national carbon tax would make the United States a leader in mitigating climate change and the advancing clean energy technologies of the 21st Century, and would incentivize other countries to enact similar carbon taxes, thereby reducing global carbon dioxide emissions without the need for complex international agreements; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to enact, without delay, a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels; and be it further Resolved ... That all tax revenue should be returned to middle- and low-income Americans to protect them from the impact of rising prices due to the tax<br></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Copies of the Resolution were sent to President Obama, Vice President Biden, House Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, and to all members of Congress representing California. The document specifically calls for the type of revenue-neutral carbon tax advocated by the grassroots organization <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby</a>. Studies have shown that a rising carbon tax with all revenue returned to taxpayers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">would have a modestly beneficial impact on the economy</a>, while cutting carbon pollution at faster rates than current policies.</p> <h2>California exerts its climate leadership<br></h2> <p>California has become the US leader in tackling global warming. 10 years ago, the state passed <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm\">the Global Warming Solutions Act</a>, requiring that its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 be no higher than 1990 levels. California achieved that goal in 2010, 10 years early, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions\">among the lowest per-capita carbon polluting states</a>. <br></p> <p>On the same day last week, the state legislature also <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article97383292.html\">passed a bill expanding the Global Warming Solutions Act</a>, requiring a 40% cut in California\u2019s carbon pollution from 1990 levels by 2030. In other words, California isn\u2019t just calling on the federal government to take action on climate change; the state is leading the way.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether any climate legislation can survive in the current toxic partisan political climate of Washington DC. However, a revenue-neutral carbon tax has the best chance due to <a href=\"http://www.carbontax.org/conservatives/\">its bipartisan appeal</a>. Its requirement that carbon polluters pay for the costs of their pollution appeals to the political left, while its free market, small government approach appeals to the political right. <br></p> <h2>Revenue-neutral carbon tax is hard to dislike<br></h2> <p>By returning 100% of the taxed revenue to American households, the policy blunts the rising costs of energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In fact, studies project that <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/household-impact-study/\">a majority of Americans would receive a rebate larger than their increase in energy bills</a>; only those who use the most fossil fuel energy would see costs rise more than the rebate.</p> <p>It\u2019s a policy that\u2019s hard to dislike. It makes polluters pay, goes a long way toward tackling the immense threat of human-caused global warming, results in cleaner air and water by reducing the burning of dirty fossil fuels, and has a modestly beneficial overall economic impact. However, many in the fossil fuel industry oppose the policy for obvious reasons, and through campaign donations they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">a solid grip on the Republican Party</a>. In fact, pressure from fossil fuel lobbyists convinced House Republicans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">pass their own Resolution condemning a carbon tax</a> less than three months ago.</p> <p>Thus it\u2019s difficult to see California\u2019s urging having much impact on Congress. Perhaps if the 2016 elections are a disaster for the Republican Party, they\u2019ll change direction away from extreme partisanship and climate denial. <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/ccls-promise-we-will-pass-a-carbon-fee-bill-by-the-end-of-2017/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby is optimistic</a> that with enough grassroots lobbying, they can convince Congress to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2017.</p> <p>It may take more states following California\u2019s lead in calling on Congress to address the climate threat. California is certainly influential - it has the world\u2019s 6<sup>th</sup>-largest economy, on par with that of France. The state put a price on carbon pollution via a cap and trade system in 2012, and since then <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=CARGSP,\">its economy has continued to grow</a> while <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000_2014/ghg_inventory_trends_00-14_20160617.pdf\">emissions have fallen</a>. <br></p> <h2>An opportunity the GOP must take<br></h2> <p>It would certainly behoove Republican Party leaders to reverse their climate denial platform. This is an issue on which - as with civil rights and gay marriage - they\u2019re on the wrong side of history, and the electorate is quickly moving in the opposite direction. Climate denial is <a href=\"http://thebulletin.org/climate-change-generation-gap9351\">predominant among old, white men</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2921195/young-conservatives-to-gop-on-climate-hello-are-you-listening/?utm=share_twitter\">young conservatives want the government to take climate action</a> to preserve their future.</p> <p>In 2012, the GOP published <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/\">an \u2018autopsy report\u2019</a> that concluded young voters are \u201crolling their eyes at what the party represents.\u201d Focus groups called them \u201cscary,\u201d \u201cnarrow minded,\u201d and an \u201cout of touch\u201d party of \u201cstuffy old men.\u201d The report perfectly encapsulates the party\u2019s stone-age stance on climate change.</p> <p>Of course, the report also concluded that \u201cmany minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country,\u201d and the party proceeded to nominate Donald \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">ban all Muslims</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/backing-wall-republican-donald-trump-gop\">build a wall</a>\u201d Trump for president. <br></p> <p>In other words, the Republican Party correctly identified its problems in 2012, and has since proceeded to make those problems even worse. But it\u2019s only a matter of time until they\u2019re forced to shift away from the current extreme, including on climate denial, or risk permanently alienating a majority of American voters. <br></p> <p>California\u2019s Resolution is urging them to move in that direction. Don\u2019t be surprised if more states follow suit and turn up the heat on GOP climate denial.<br></p>",

Turnbull is dividing supporters of marriage equality over the process \u2013 plebiscite vs. parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the difference: Howard was not a republican. It\u2019s hard to judge him too harshly. A scorpion does what a scorpion does. A politician using political tactics to defeat his political opponents is not new.</p> <p>But Turnbull tells us he is in favour of marriage equality. Yet now that he is the prime minister he\u2019s using Howard\u2019s tactics with little thought for the consequences. No one \u2013 including Turnbull \u2013 should be surprised when marriage equality ends up in the same place as a republic: defeated at the ballot box in a plebiscite and off the agenda for years.</p> <p>This is most likely exactly what certain Coalition MPs had in mind when proposing a plebiscite on same sex marriage.</p> <p>Turnbull is all over the shop when it comes to relying on a public vote to deliver significant legal and social change. On the one hand, he is incredibly alive to challenges: publicly and in conversations with the Referendum Council advising on constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians, Turnbull is constantly reminding that success is difficult and should not be taken for granted. <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/fairfaxipsos-poll-85pc-of-voters-back-indigenous-recognition-20150705-gi5jpi\">Polls</a> indicate that upwards of 85% Australians support constitutional recognition \u2013 and yet Turnbull is rightly quite concerned that Australia only holds a referendum if and when it can succeed.</p> <p>As Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHAys0HnLP0\">says</a>, the only successful referendums have been ones that were \u201cuncontroversial and had little to no opposition.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, Turnbull seems an absolute Pollyanna when it comes to a same sex marriage plebiscite \u2013 despite the fact that the issue is controversial and does have opposition. On Sunday he <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2016/s4528077.htm\">told</a> the ABC Insiders program: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no question that the fastest way, the way you guarantee that there is a vote in the parliament on gay marriage \u2013 in this parliament \u2013 is to support the plebiscite. Personally I have no doubt the plebiscite will be carried, and the same sex marriage legislation will sail through the parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>Technically speaking, the fastest way to guarantee a vote in the parliament on gay marriage is if the prime minister brought forward a bill on the subject and let his party room have a free vote. No plebiscite is needed to give the parliament permission to have a vote.</p> <p>I have previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/25/a-plebiscite-on-same-sex-marriage-might-kick-our-politicians-into-action\">supported</a> a plebiscite, if for no other reason than there seemed to be no other way to advance the cause.</p> <p>But the longer the debate drags on, the more difficult it becomes.

Yet the longer it takes the more out of reach the goal seems. Expectations are raised and frustrated, opposition becomes entrenched, and events overtake the original idea.</p> <p>If we\u2019d had a marriage equality plebiscite within a year of Tony Abbott\u2019s original proposal, I think there would have been less angst and fear, more hope and momentum, and (maybe) more civility. But now the issue is growing more politically charged and the same infections that beset constitutional recognition \u2013 expectations, fear, weariness, anger and other events \u2013 risk contaminating the debate on marriage equality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/marriage-equality-plebiscite-i-take-this-barrage-of-bigotry-dressed-up-as-debate-personally\">Marriage equality plebiscite: I take this barrage of bigotry dressed up as 'debate' personally | Kerryn Phelps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull, of all people, should not be so sanguine about succeeding with a \u201cyes\u201d vote at a marriage equality plebiscite. There\u2019s a lot of support for same sex marriage, but there\u2019s a soft middle in that support that will be vulnerable to a \u201cno\u201d campaign.

Those efforts lasted well into the Obama administration, involving former senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/george-mitchell\" title=\"\">George Mitchell </a>as special envoy until 2011 under Clinton\u2019s command, and sporadically Kerry himself after he took over the state department, in 2013. But it has become the graveyard of diplomatic ambition. Agreement has never seemed so far off, and it is unlikely Kerry will devote his last months in office to trying to change that.</p> <p>Syria is likely to take up most of his remaining days and energy. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/omran-picture-turning-point-syria-war-aleppo-david-nott\" title=\"\">ever deepening catastrophe</a> is the greatest political failure of the 21st century, and the spectacle of besuited statesmen huddled in Geneva hotel rooms while the slaughter and chaos gather pace on the ground has raised serious questions about the efficacy of diplomacy, shuttle or otherwise.</p> <p>Three veteran UN envoys have tried in turn to find a political solution: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kofi-annan\" title=\"\">Kofi Annan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lakhdar-brahimi\" title=\"\">Lakhdar Brahimi</a> and currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/staffan-de-mistura-man-with-toughest-job-in-world-syria\" title=\"\">Staffan de Mistura</a>. But their missions have led nowhere. In the past few days, De Mistura was forced to suspend the UN humanitarian taskforce, as none of its aid convoys were being allowed through to besieged areas.</p> <p>To a large extent, the failure has been&#xa0;a consequence of a cold war-style deadlock \u2013 Russia and Iran on one side, and the west and most of the Arab world&#xa0;on the other \u2013 over the fate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\" title=\"\">Bashar al-Assad</a>, a negotiating gap kept open by force in the shape of massive Russian and Iranian military support to keep the Syrian regime in place.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Besuited statesmen huddle in Geneva hotel rooms while the slaughter and chaos gathers pace on the ground in Syria</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the roots of the impasse in Syria are both new and old. It is also a symptom of the disconnect between the traditional capital-shuttling model of diplomacy in an age when non-state groups, with the proliferation of ever more extreme militias in Syria, are driving the course of events.</p> <p>Shuttling between capitals, and convening meetings in Geneva or Vienna, looks more and more detached from the brutal and complex diplomacy on the ground. Getting on a plane, issuing a statement, and chairing high-level negotiation has become a displacement activity for influencing events on the ground.</p> <p>The old-school nature of UN diplomacy may be a generational problem. Since the first UN mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte, was dispatched to Palestine in 1948, the average age of UN special envoys appointed to resolve global conflicts is 64. Brahimi was nearly 80, and De Mistura is approaching 70. Of&#xa0;the 52 envoys in that period, only three have been women. The rationale, if any, is that elder statesmen win the respect and face-time needed in often patriarchal states, but the relative success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/catherine-ashton\" title=\"\">Catherine Ashton</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/30/portrait-federica-mogherini-eu-foreign-policy-chief\" title=\"\">Federica Mogherini</a> in the role of EU foreign policy chief casts doubt on such blanket assumptions.</p> <p>Fielding a younger generation of mediators with more women in their ranks, however, is not going to overcome the challenge of seeking peace on battlefields where the main protagonists are extremists with a vested interest in violence and chaos. Efforts at engagement are likely to be both pointless and a trigger for moral repugnance, as Owen Smith found in the Labour leadership debate when he raised the possibility of Isis sitting at the negotiating table.</p> <p>But the fact that a task has become harder and more complex is not the same as saying it should not be done. In the field of diplomacy, it means the opposite. There needs to be more of it, in the knowledge that most of the effort will end in failure. On Syria\u2019s borders, UN officials are having to talk to shifting alliances of shadowy groups in order to negotiate deliveries of humanitarian aid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/syria-crisis-first-aid-convoy-enters-besieged-daraya-since-2012\" title=\"\">besieged cities</a>, and at the same time their colleagues have to keep making the rounds of the Middle Eastern capitals where the militias go for their funds, as well as keeping the pressure up on Damascus and its backers in Moscow and Tehran to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/syrian-rebels-suffer-intense-air-attacks-after-breaking-siege-of-aleppo\" title=\"\">murderous aerial bombing</a> of cities.</p> <p>Such work often seems futile, and is undoubtedly dangerous. The UN secretary general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/dag-hammarskjold-un-secretary-general-crash\" title=\"\">Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld</a>, was killed in a mysterious air crash while flying between the warring parties in Congo in 1961. The circumstances of his death are still being investigated by the UN.</p> <p>A decade or more ago, in the Middle East, the Balkans and Africa, the effective mediators would mostly have been Americans, with US economic and military clout held in reserve in case sweet reason failed. In a more multipolar world, the peacemakers more often come from the continents in turmoil, under multilateral flags of the UN or the EU. The more powers that have a say in the outcome of conflicts, the more diplomatic travel there is to do.</p> <p>We may not see another US secretary of state as willing to jump on a plane as Kerry, but there is a strong argument that the next UN secretary general should be as indefatigable in their willingness to get to the nub of conflicts, even at the expense of frustration and humiliation.</p> <p>It may be a paradox of the age that, despite the multiplicity of small-scale actors and the proliferation of secure and efficient ways to communicate electronically, the need for face-to-face diplomacy seems only to grow. Whatever the technology, the decisions to go to war or make peace are made by people, and people are best judged and cajoled in the flesh.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to figure out what is the other guy\u2019s bandwidth,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/joe-biden-interview/497633/\" title=\"\">Biden told the Atlantic last week</a>. \u201cYou have to figure out what is realistically possible ... so that you can begin to make more informed judgments about what they are likely to do or what you can likely get them to agree not to do.\u201d</p> <p>Foreign policy, Biden added, is \u201ca logical extension of personal relationships, with a lot less information to act on.\u201d The price of giving up is not always obvious, but it can be severe. A report by the <a href=\"http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">European Leadership Network</a>, a thinktank led by former ministers and generals from the old east and west, shows how a lack of personal experience of adversaries can have severe consequences. It argued that \u201cthe deep lack of empathy between Nato member states and Russia\u201d could lead to miscalculations as grave as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/02/nato-war-game-nuclear-disaster\" title=\"\">Able Archer</a>, a cold war incident in 1983 when Moscow mistook a Nato exercise as preparations for an all-out attack.</p> <p>Diplomacy, with all its many wasted air miles and protracted hotel stays, always looks expensive, but the costs are tiny compared to what is spent every day on military campaigns. Look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/us-promoting-war-crimes-yemen-saudi-bombing-obama\" title=\"\">Yemen</a>. A diplomatic initiative would not be an instant panacea, but the absence of a serious effort to engage Saudi Arabia and Iran and their Yemeni allies is appalling, in the face of the daily human suffering. In a darkening world, to persist in dialogue and reason is to rage \u2013 politely and diplomatically \u2013 against the dying of the light.</p>",
