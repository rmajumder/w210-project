There are still <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ri2KEiXlNk\">stadium-ready rock songs</a> and chant-friendly choruses. Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s familiar well-weathered vocals tell stories of living in dreams, walking through hard rains and occasional ending up \u201chigher than a rocket\u201d. However, walls of guitars have been replaced by a brasher, more keyboard-based pop sound, and not all the post-Sambora tunes land as they should. The ghastly Knockout, with any nearby kitchen sink hurled in, sounds as if the singer is trying hard to convince himself that such over-egged nonsense is, well, \u201cknockout\u201d. But elsewhere there\u2019s an intriguing new vulnerability. Labor of Love \u2013 reminiscent of, of all things, Chris Isaak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtfHk2hSlqA\">Wicked Game</a>&#xa0;\u2013 is beautiful and sincere; and the country-tinged Scars On My Guitar, a love song to the instrument, is more touching than daft. There are recurring themes of change and new beginnings, although Reunion says, \u201cStart your revolution, I\u2019ll see you&#xa0;at the reunion.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ri2KEiXlNk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Ri2KEiXlNk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">The polls tighten</a>. The fear rises. And there could hardly be a more urgent or relevant film than this. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/youve-been-trumped-too-film-donald-trump\">You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too: it\u2019s the film Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want you to see | Anthony Baxter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five years ago, British director Anthony Baxter made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/youve-been-trumped-review\">a Michael Moore-esque documentary</a> about the obnoxious arrogance of Donald J Trump, who was vandalising a coastline of natural beauty near Aberdeen to build a golf course, in so doing making promises on job creation and finding a useful idiot in Alex Salmond, who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/20/alex-salmond-donald-trump-scotland\">rolled over with the necessary political permissions</a>. In the course of all this, Trump\u2019s building workers had cut off the water supply to an elderly, courageous widow, Mrs Molly Forbes, and her son Michael. The Forbes family had refused to sell up. Now, five years later, Baxter has returned to find this water supply has still not been restored.</p> <p>The point about Trump\u2019s grisly Scottish adventure is that it\u2019s a very real dummy run for what he would be like as an international statesman in the arena of politics and diplomacy. Of course he is a mendacious sociopath, and he has far too easily coerced forelock-tugging UK officials into doing his bidding. When Trump talks about bringing the private business style into politics, this is what he means: corporate lawyers attacking local communities; and breaking promises on jobs, supposedly the cornerstone of what passes for Trump\u2019s political vision. What on earth is Nicola Sturgeon doing about this? Or Scottish Secretary David Mundell? Whatever happens in the US presidential election, it is time for them to stand up for Mrs Molly Forbes.</p>",

  "<p>Thousands had gathered in an outdoor field on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, braving the sweltering sun for hours ahead of what was likely Barack Obama\u2019s final visit to the area as president.</p> <p>With less than a week remaining until election day, Obama\u2019s speech campaigning for Hillary Clinton was marked by a palpable sense of urgency amid a tightening race. But as the US president delivered what has become his routine stump speech for Clinton on Wednesday \u2013 branding Donald Trump a threat to democracy and attacking the judgment of Republican lawmakers who support their nominee \u2013 he invoked a lesser known name before the fervent crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI want you think about a woman named named Grace Bell Hardison,\u201d Obama said.</p> <p>Hardison was a 100-year-old black woman who had lived in the same town in North Carolina her entire life. Last month, her voter registration was challenged in her home of Beaufort County in what officials called an effort to \u201cclear up\u201d the voting rolls. Of the list of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wnct.com/2016/10/18/106-beaufort-co-residents-have-voter-registration-challenged-weeks-before-election/\">138 purged voters</a> that included Hardison, 92 were black and registered Democrats. </p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen by accident,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere was a time when systematically denying black folks the right to vote was considered normal as well.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, he noted, was calling on supporters to monitor \u201ccertain areas\u201d at the polls. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just out in public saying we\u2019re going to try and suppress the African American vote on election day, or the youth vote on election day.\u201d</p> <p>This was a seeming reference to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go\">a Bloomberg story</a> from last week in which an unnamed Trump official was quoted as saying: \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d aimed at idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans.</p> <p>The critical battleground of North Carolina is in many ways the ground zero of concerns over access to the ballot among black voters. </p> <p>Republicans in the state have purged thousands of voters from the rolls, the majority of whom are black Democrats. The NAACP filed a lawsuit this week, stating that the practice of purging voter rolls up to 95 days before an election was a violation of federal law. The US justice department also issued a sharp warning to the election boards in the relevant counties of Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland.</p> <p>Penda Hair, an attorney representing the the North Carolina NAACP, said the counties in question were allowing \u201cindividual private vigilante residents\u201d to challenge voters based on mailings that were unregulated by the state. The private citizens were sending mailings that would come back as undeliverable, which they would then use to challenge the residence of the voters they wanted the county to purge from the rolls. </p> <p>To those in North Carolina, the pattern of purging voter rolls is reminiscent of efforts to curtail the black vote through strict voter ID laws struck down by a federal court earlier this year for targeting African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d.

What\u2019s our excuse?\u201d Obama asked, after revisiting the civil rights struggles of the past that included registered black voters being beaten Mississippi.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not that long ago that folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar, or bubbles on a bar of soap, or recite the constitution in Chinese in order to vote.\u201d</p> <p>An Associated Press analysis of early voting data in North Carolina found that black voters have cast 111,000 fewer ballots than at the same time in 2012. Democrats cited voter suppression tactics by Republicans as part of the challenge, noting an initial reduction by the GOP-led election board in the number of early voting sites.</p> <p>More voting sites have since opened, prompting turnout to \u201cskyrocket\u201d, according to a memo distributed by the Clinton campaign on Wednesday.</p> <p>The field report noted that 15,000 African Americans had voted in Guilford County over the last three days, where new early voting sites opened late last week, marking a 60% higher turnout among black voters than during the same three-day period in 2012. One of every three ballots cast in the county were by black voters, Clinton\u2019s campaign noted.</p> <p>Both Trump and Clinton returned to North Carolina on Thursday, while Obama took his pitch to Jacksonville, Florida, where early-voting returns pointing to an apparent loss of enthusiasm among black voters are fueling similar Democratic fears within that Trump could yet snatch victory in another crucial swing state.</p> <p>Exit polls from 2008 and 2012 showed 95% of Florida\u2019s black voters backing Obama. But they have not offered the same level of support for Clinton in the numbers expected, according to an analysis of early in-person voting data, angering a prominent African American Democratic congressman who said he had been \u201cscreaming for months\u201d for the Clinton campaign to spend more money on the black community in the state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not doing enough in the black community. I have been screaming for months about this and nothing changed and now look what\u2019s happening,\u201d said congressman Alcee Hastings, whose south Florida district incorporates almost all of the majority black precincts of Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, told Politico.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s staff has escalated its presence in the Sunshine State in the campaign\u2019s final days, with several appearances by the Democratic nominee as well as prominent surrogates in areas with significant black populations. They include Obama\u2019s appearance on Thursday in Duval County, where one in three registered voters is African American, and two addresses in three days by Clinton to overwhelmingly black crowds at a Baptist church and a civil rights memorial park in Fort Lauderdale, focused on themes such as reform of the criminal justice system and gun control.</p> <p>\u201cThe black vote is very important for Clinton\u2019s chances; the higher the turnout the better her chances are,\u201d said Matthew Pietryka, associate professor of political science at Florida State University.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to be rallying the troops and African Americans are historically and consistently strong supporters of Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cMobilization through churches is particularly effective, so being short on time and with early voting underway, it\u2019s an effective way to get out the vote.\u201d</p> <p>The worry for Clinton, who has seen her four-point lead over Trump <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">in Real Clear Politics\u2019 Florida average of polls</a> turn into a dead heat in only 10 days, is reflected in a comparison of this year\u2019s early-voting returns so far with those from 2012.</p> <p>While the official state figures, analysed by elections expert Dan Smith of the University of Florida, do not show which candidate the voter supported, they indicate that only 16% of early in-person votes cast in Florida by Sunday night, after seven days, were by African American voters. In 2012, after only two days of early voting, the figure was 25%.</p> <p>Although the makeup of Florida\u2019s electorate has changed since 2012, Smith believes the lower than expected turnout \u2013 which matches a downturn in the early black vote in at least seven other states \u2013 is particularly worrying for Democrats in a state where recent polls suggested African American voters favoured Clinton over Trump by a 93 to 4 margin. Obama\u2019s victory over Romney in the state was by fewer than 75,000 votes and a 0.88 point margin.</p> <p>Henry Crespo, president of the Democratic Black Caucus of Florida, told the Guardian he was also concerned, noting that Obama\u2019s intensive ground strategy and black voter outreach paid dividends in 2012.</p> <p>\u201cWe are lagging based on some numbers of black early vote participation, so going into these areas is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe church has always been a bedrock of engaging people outside of other more traditional activities. That helps the word get out. That grandmother or that aunt or that granddad is a traditional churchgoer; if you engage that population they will ultimately engage their grandchildren, their nephews and so forth. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s a good approach given that we\u2019re lacking in certain areas.\u201d</p> <p>At a symbolic night rally on Tuesday at the Rev Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park, named for one of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s first black policemen who later became a civil rights leader, Clinton displayed no outward signs that she was concerned about the black vote, urging supporters: \u201cFor the next seven days focus on what is important. Don\u2019t get distracted, don\u2019t get diverted.\u201d</p> <p>For some black supporters in the crowd, however, the early voting figures were an alarm call. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re all concerned about, that\u2019s why we\u2019re all doing our best to get the word out, that we need to come together, stand together and move forward together,\u201d said Lakisha Smith, 43, a customer service representative who attended with a small group of friends and colleagues.</p>",

I\u2019ll get on stage with him and I\u2019ll do everything I can to support him,\u2019\u201d says Dave Moody, member of the country group the Moody Brothers and current president of an independent record label in Nashville.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always seen the political as a two-way street,\u201d says Moody, whose group has campaigned for Democratic governors, toured the campaign trail with George HW Bush and played at Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House.</p> <p>\u201cThe politicians are using the performers and getting the endorsements, but at the same time it\u2019s an opportunity for the artists to showcase themselves in front of a bigger audience than they would on their own,\u201d he says. In 2016, perhaps for the first time in the history of country music, the risks of merely supporting a presidential candidate firmly outweigh the rewards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9114fc06905b1d78a071dff77d185286594eb48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9114fc06905b1d78a071dff77d185286594eb48/8_114_2826_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radney Foster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radney Foster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Gwinn/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nashville\u2019s long been a Democratic stronghold in deep-red Tennessee, but despite the city\u2019s liberalism many estimate that the country music industry still slightly favors Trump. A recent informal survey conducted by the trade publication Country Aircheck showed that 46% of the industry professionals who participated favored Trump compared to 41% who supported Clinton, with 13% supporting Gary Johnson.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing is that even with the reservations about Trump, the male members of the industry still feel that he\u2019s one of us,\u201d says Don Cusic, professor of country music history at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University. </p> <p>Trump presents a specific paradox for country music. On one hand, he represents the genre\u2019s historic party of choice, and has found a unique way to effectively communicate with the country demographic. \u201cTrump sticks to one-to-two-syllable words, like a country song,\u201d says Cusic. \u201cHe speaks the language of the country audience.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, Trump, a billionaire New Yorker whose campaign has harshly alienated women \u2013 the majority of country music fans \u2013 presents himself as one of the least country music-friendly presidential candidates of all time. \u201cMost country fans don\u2019t have a billion dollars, and haven\u2019t lost a billion dollars,\u201d says Cusic.</p> <p>Clinton has largely avoided any appeals to the country music world during her campaign. Her tenuous relationship with the genre dates back as far as 1992, when she gave an interview with 60 Minutes in response to her husband\u2019s rumored infidelities.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DZyE41T56w\">I\u2019m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette</a>,\u201d she said, referencing the 1968 classic Stand By Your Man. (\u201cI happen to be a country-western fan,\u201d Clinton said in a subsequent apology to Wynette.)</p> <p>Country legend and former Reaganite, Merle Haggard, endorsed Clinton\u2019s bid for president during the primaries in 2007, releasing a song called Hillary. The chorus went as followed: \u201cThis country needs to be honest/ Changes need to be large/ Something like a big switch of gender/ Let\u2019s put a woman in charge.\u201d</p> <p>One of the only interactions Clinton\u2019s candidacy has had with country music came in late 2014, when a Super Pac called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25XKa3YzBk\">Stand With Hillary</a> released a transparently pandering country song meant to highlight Clinton\u2019s working-class appeal. </p> <p>The harshly divisive nature of the current election presents particular problems for an industry that, over the last decade, has worked to mainstream its national image and attract an increasingly younger demographic that expands the genre\u2019s historically rural, southern conservative base. (<a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/country/1177554/new-statistics-about-country-music-fans-revealed-at-billboard-country\">A 2011 study</a> revealed that nearly half of all country music\u2019s estimated 95 million fans in the US are under 44 years old.)</p> <p>\u201cCountry music has become publicly apolitical,\u201d says Braddock. \u201cTen or 12 years ago, you\u2019d hear a lot of super patriotic, rightwing subject material on the radio. You don\u2019t hear that now. There are a lot more young people listening, and I no longer think of the music as conservative or ideological.\u201d</p> <p>When major stars have expressed any degree of political opinion, near immediate blowback has ensued. \u201cWhether you love him or hate him, he says what he thinks, and he has proven that you don\u2019t always have to be so afraid,\u201d Blake Shelton said of Trump in Billboard, before adding: \u201cI probably wish there was another option, but there\u2019s not.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cHillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has,\u201d Dolly Parton said to the New York Times in June.

Why would you want to alienate essentially half of your fan base?\u201d </p> <p>With not a single mainstream country star expressing unambiguous support for Clinton, the genre appears to publicly lean slightly towards Trump at first glance. Blake Shelton, Justin Moore, Loretta Lynn, Kenny Rogers, Larry Gatlin and Aaron Lewis have all expressed admiration for the candidate.</p> <p>Country music\u2019s relationship to national politics can be traced to George Wallace\u2019s third-party campaign in 1968. Country mainstays Hank Snow, Tammy Wynette and Minnie Pearl all opened for the Alabama governor throughout his political career. \u201cThey were thrilled to be part of the whole political process. Finally, a politician was paying attention to them,\u201d says Cusic.</p> <p>Although Cusic notes that many country stars quieted down after \u201cfalling on the wrong side of history\u201d with Wallace\u2019s segregationist campaign, Jimmy Carter, George HW Bush and George W Bush enjoyed strong connections to country music throughout the next several decades. </p> <p>During the height of country\u2019s kinship with George W Bush in 2003, the Dixie Chicks stirred controversy when singer Natalie Maines protested the Iraq war by claiming onstage that the group was \u201cashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas\u201d. Before long the group\u2019s music had been pulled from country radio, effectively derailing their mainstream success for good.</p> <p>Nearly everyone interviewed for this article cited the Dixie Chicks as a primary reason so many singers are still scared to speak their minds politically. \u201cThe one thing the Dixie Chicks taught the industry is boy, you go against the prevailing political belief and you\u2019re off the radio,\u201d says Cusic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/nov/03/beyonce-surprise-country-music-awards-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5ak8c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2868843\"            data-video-name=\"Surprise Beyonc\u00e9 appearance at Country Music Awards \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Clips courtesy of the Country Music Association and American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. \u00a9Country Music Association Inc., all rights reserved\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581b5179e4b07ceadb3a2145\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/03/161103beyonce_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/03/161103beyonce.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/03/161103beyonce_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/nov/03/beyonce-surprise-country-music-awards-video\">Surprise Beyonc\u00e9 appearance at Country Music Awards</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The biggest country star to release socially conscious music during this election season is Eric Church, whose current single, Kill a Word, is a subtle condemnation of hate speech. \u201cWe thought it would be a crime not to put that song out with what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d says Arturo Buenahora, who\u2019s served as executive producer on each of Church\u2019s five albums.</p> <p>The song also features vocals from singer Rhiannon Giddens, a committed activist-musician whose origins are in traditional roots and folk music. \u201cGiven what the song is trying to say and what the climate of the country is right now, having a black female singer on the song is a strong choice, because that\u2019s part of what the song\u2019s trying to do: it\u2019s trying to tear down walls,\u201d says Giddens.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m normally not a very political boy,\u201d says Radney Foster, who recently released All That I Require, a historical critique of fascism that might be country\u2019s most directly political take this election.<br></p> <p>Foster admits that being an independent artist who no longer gets played on country radio makes it much easier to speak out, but he\u2019s also experienced firsthand the consequences of being outspoken in country music.

  "<p>Even though my protocol droid is fluent in more than six million forms of communication, it has drawn a blank with some of the utterances Lindsay Lohan made on the steps of her new Athens nightclub, LOHAN.</p> <p>But so what? Lost in Showbiz is excited that Lindsay that should have followed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhtq1ObGHy8\">former England manager Steve McClaren into the muddy waters of cod-European accents</a> \u2013 and, heaven knows, we\u2019ve all ended up being able to speak only broken English on nightclub pavements. Usually on the way out, rather than the way in, but still.</p> <p>By way of a recap, Lindsay has put her name, and supposedly some investment, to a fancy new nightclub in the Greek capital, and used an appearance there this week to explain \u2013 with the smiling staccato of someone feeling their <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3896028/Lindsay-Lohan-breaks-silence-reveals-new-accent.html\">heavily accented way in the unfamiliar American tongue</a> \u2013 how this was just the start of the brand rollout. \u201cThere\u2019s bigger things to be done with the LOHAN club,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThere is spas, there is refugee camps.\u201d</p> <p>Well, quite. Actually, hang on \u2013 what?</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid the answer to that question is slightly unclear. According to Lindsay, an unspecified percentage of profits from the club may be going to charity \u2013 at least, she says haltingly \u201cwe can make it a good purpose\u201d, and \u201cwe can create charity from the club\u201d. The nature of the charity in question is also fairly broadbrush \u2013 Lindsay claims it will fix \u201cbad things in the world\u201d, seemingly focused on refugees from Syria. An energy-drink brand ambassador, she recently talked about <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/28/entertainment/lindsay-lohan-refugees/\">handing out cans of the stuff to refugees after her visit to a camp in Turkey</a>. \u201cWe have to help people,\u201d she goes on, \u201cand if we can do it with a nightclub, or with a spa, or with refugee camps, or with containers \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the Rosetta Stone to all this is in one of the containers? Until we locate it, however, we have only Lindsay\u2019s business plan/wellness-driven moodboard. \u201cWe create peaceful locations where we can all be happy,\u201d she goes on. \u201cAnd we start with the refugees, and then we open nice places, and maybe one of the refugees will open a place with us \u2026 I want LOHAN to be a celebration of everybody coming together, in the European nations.\u201d</p> <p>It is a hell of an ask of a nightclub, in the circumstances. But certainly worth a shot. Certainly a shot of the aforementioned energy drink, which is sold at the bar.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lohan completists will know that has she long aspired to use her celebrity to the generalised benefit of troubled regions. In 2006, Lindsay announced plans to visit Iraq. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton for so long,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/actress-lohan-wants-to-visit-iraq-with-sen-clinton.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=actress-lohan-wants-to-visit-iraq-with-sen.-clinton-2006-08-10\">she explained</a>, with the apparent failure to be able to synchronise diaries likely to have been of equal if not greater frustration to the current Democratic nominee for the US presidency.</p> <p>\u201cHillary was trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous.\u201d Or as Hillary\u2019s spokesman put it: \u201cIt was suggested to her that if she wanted to go, she could pursue doing so through the <a href=\"https://www.uso.org/\">USO</a>.\u201d Look, whatever. Lindsay had a clear plan: \u201cI wanted to do what Marilyn Monroe did, when she went and just set up a stage and did a concert for the troops all by herself. It\u2019s so inspiring seeing that one woman just going somewhere, this beautiful sex kitten, who is basically a pin-up, which is what I\u2019ve always aspired to be.\u201d</p> <p>Still, God love Lindsay, who has added to the gaiety of various nations since her horrendous parents pushed her on stage far too young. If, as entertainment cliche holds, you are frozen in development at the age at which you become famous, then Lindsay will for ever be preserved at the age of 11, when she made her name in Disney\u2019s The Parent Trap remake. Looked at this way, her latest venture is no more sweetly clueless than a child being admonished for not eating its egg at breakfast on the basis that there are people starving across the world, and asking worriedly if it can post the remains of the egg to them.</p> <p>As for her accent, the extensive WTF-ery that has attended its debut has caused Lindsay to respond with details of its genesis. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of the languages I can understand or am trying to learn,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI\u2019ve been learning different languages since I was a child. I\u2019m fluent in English and French, can understand Russian and am learning Turkish, Italian and Arabic.\u201d As for what this pending creole should be called, Lindsay declared: \u201cWe should let the people decide.\u201d</p> <p>Odd to see her coming round to the idea of referendums. After all, she was less enamoured during a lengthy series of tweets posted in conjunction with the BBC\u2019s coverage on the night of the European referendum itself, at one point issuing the dismissive inquiry: \u201cSorry Kettering but where are you?\u201d (I think they\u2019re south of the river somewhere, but probably best to get them to come to you). Following a defensive mention of this in the House of Commons by the local MP, Philip Hollobone, Lindsay later apologised to the town, and agreed to switch on its Christmas lights. Thereafter, it all went a bit quiet.</p> <p>Indeed, last week Hollobone was raising the spectre of a no-show, telling the BBC: \u201cShe said she would come and switch on the Christmas lights at Kettering but, despite everyone\u2019s best efforts, it\u2019s simply not been possible to track her down.\u201d Yet since then some progress appears to have been made. On Thursday, a spokesman for Kettering borough council revealed: \u201cWe have made direct contact with Lindsay\u2019s publicist. We get the impression she is genuinely really interested. It just depends on whether or not she can fit it in.\u201d</p> <p>Surely it all flows together? Energy drink, exclusive nightclub, spas, refugee camps, containers, Kettering \u2026 I\u2019ll let you know when I guess the next one in the sequence. In the meantime, let\u2019s just accept that Lindsay\u2019s new accent would be the most eye-catching festive curiosity in Kettering since Neil and Christine Hamilton gave us their Fairy Godmother and Baron Hardup in the town panto in 2011, and cross our fingers accordingly.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton appears to have rebounded in popularity according to a new ABC/Washington Post poll, which shows her leading 47%-45% against Donald Trump. However, another poll from the LA Times shows Trump ahead by five percentage points, so the overall <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a> support for each candidate has remained unchanged since yesterday at a 1.7 point lead for Clinton. Clearly, measures of national opinion are poles apart.</p> <p>Those top-line horse-race figures are important, but they ignore two groups of voters: the undecideds and those who plan on voting for a third candidate. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll look at the Americans who are planning to vote for someone other than Clinton or Trump. Today, I\u2019ll take a look at the undecideds.</p> <p>Back in March, in the midst of primary season, there were a lot more Americans who seemed to be still making up their minds \u2013 one in 10 likely voters said they were undecided. Since then, that figure has slowly (but not so steadily) declined to about one in 20 likely voters, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s polling <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=25&amp;mindate=2014-01-01&amp;maxdate=2016-11-03&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=yes&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A - D,A - R,A - i,RV - D,RV - R,RV - i,LV - D,LV - R,LV - i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=undecided&amp;fudge=1&amp;except_questions_with=johnson\">averages</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/undecided-voters/\" data-alt=\"Undecided voters\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/undecided-voters/\">Undecided voters</a> <figcaption>Undecided voters</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nationally, the 5% of voters who claim to be undecided seem capable of swinging the election \u2013 if they all vote for Clinton, she would win the popular vote, according to polls; if they went for Trump, he\u2019d win. Although they won\u2019t all swing in the same direction, it\u2019s worth considering the intentions of these Americans.</p> <p>As a group, undecideds arouse <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/undecided-voter/n27698\">cynicism</a> (how could anyone in this election possibly be undecided?) and/or skepticism (are they keeping their <em>real </em>voting<em> </em>intention secret?). The Brexit result, where undecided respondents in the UK seemed to make a last-minute decision to leave the European Union, has only deepened suspicion of these voters.<br></p> <p>Broadly speaking, there are three possibilities here: 1) the undecideds truly don\u2019t know who to vote for; 2) the undecideds don\u2019t know whether to vote at all; and 3) they know exactly who they will vote for but don\u2019t want to disclose it with nosy pollsters. I\u2019ll briefly examine each of these.</p> <p>1) If individuals haven\u2019t made up their own minds, it\u2019s pretty difficult for analysts to anticipate their actions. Some electoral theory suggests that when people aren\u2019t sure, they opt for the safer option of preserving the status quo \u2013 as was the case in the 2014 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#/media/File:Scottish_independence_polls_graphic.svg\">Scottish independence referendum</a>. That would work in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor as she would preserve her vote share in states like Pennsylvania that have been Democrat for decades but which now appear to be <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">leaning</a> increasingly Republican.</p> <p>But voters in 2016 might break with history. A <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/18/most-americans-trust-the-military-and-scientists-to-act-in-the-publics-interest/\">majority</a> of US adults don\u2019t trust elected officials (or the media for that matter). The rise of Donald Trump, with his anti-establishment rhetoric, suggests that many Americans may now consider the status quo a worst-case scenario. </p> <p>2) Turnout will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">crucial</a> in this election and there is a real chance that many of these undecideds will simply not show up. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/08/31/can_undecideds_help_trump_win_the_election_131660.html\">August</a>, survey firm YouGov changed their respondent group to better understand undecideds \u2013 14% of their respondents said they would not vote. </p> <p>Though YouGov did not find a substantial partisan divide among these non-voters, current campaign strategies would seem to suggest that low turnout will work in Trump\u2019s favor. Clinton has been repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-aiming-to-boost-turnout-clinton-warns-1478129300-htmlstory.html\">trying to boost turnout</a>, particularly among minority voters, whom she will need in several swing states. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign advisers have <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">claimed</a> the Republican\u2019s strategy is now to suppress Clinton\u2019s turnout rather than encouraging potential undecideds to vote Trump. </p> <p>3) There\u2019s also mixed evidence when it comes to understanding whether undecideds are actually secret Trump voters who are hiding their intentions from pollsters. In the primary season, polling averages <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-probably-arent-lying-to-pollsters/\">matched</a> pretty closely with final results in most states. But voting in the primary season and the national election are <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/primary-turnout-means-nothing-for-the-general-election/\">pretty different</a> \u2013 partly because the individuals who show up to pick a nominee are more politically engaged voters. </p> <p>In reality, respondents who say they\u2019re undecided are some mix of all of these three groups. For example, early voting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">suggests</a> that some black undecideds might decide not to show up on election day. But the geography of being undecided also matters. That\u2019s why Barack Obama visited North Carolina on Wednesday, where he told a crowd: \u201cThe fate of the republic rests on your shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>North Carolina is worth 15 of the 270 electoral college votes required to win the White House and voters here are deeply split about which way the state should go. Current polling averages show Trump beating Clinton by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">0.2 percentage points</a> \u2013 a meaningless lead because these numbers could be wrong by a few percentage points in either direction.</p> <p>Only 2% of 992 likely voters in North Carolina said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d who they would vote for in a YouGov <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/329404956/CBS-News-Battleground-Tracker-North-Carolina-Oct-30-2016#from_embed\">poll</a> conducted on 26-28 October. But that\u2019s a pretty crude measure of intention. Polls often force respondents to pick a side by starting the question with the words \u201cIf the 2016 presidential election were held today \u2026\u201d A later question in the same survey asked voters how certain they were about their choice of candidate; 5% said they might still change their minds and 17% said they \u201cprobably\u201d wouldn\u2019t change their minds. Early ballots in the state have promising news for Clinton though \u2013 they <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/north-carolina-early-vote-tracker.html\">suggest</a> voters in North Carolina are choosing Clinton over Trump. </p>",

The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England\u2019s inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view.</p> <p>Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in the near term.

Ahead of the November MPC meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers.</p> <p>We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England on growth but see inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking around 3.5% around spring 2018.</p> <p>It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be adjusted.

class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England abandoned plans for further cuts to interest rates as it conceded the economy had stood up to the shock of June\u2019s Brexit vote without the sharp slowdown Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted.</p> <p>The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u2019s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u2019 time is slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook.</p> <p>The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u201cin either direction\u201d to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation. The Bank also said \u201cthere are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2bd0e4b029b92ca451d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:23:36.660Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England</strong> fears that the uncertainty over Brexit will push unemployment higher, from its current rate of 4.9%</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[There is a ] risk that UK-based firms\u2019 access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5.5% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2a02e4b029b92ca451ce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:17:26.217Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoE: UK is doing better than we expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England admits that the UK economy has outperformed its expectations in the three months since it slashed rates.</strong></p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations [reminder: it was 0.5%, not 0.1%].</p> <p>These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago.

That\u2019s a tricky calculation, as we don\u2019t know what kind of deal the UK will end up with.</p> <p><strong>The Bank may also hike its inflation forecasts</strong>, as the slump in the pound since June continues to push up the cost of imports. That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year. If that happens, how long will the Bank be prepared to ignore the rising cost of living?</p> <p>And of course, Carney can expect several questions about his decision to extend his term by an extra 12 months, to summer 2019.

I\u2019ve posted vast amounts of commentary on this already, but here is what it means in six key points.</p> <p><strong>1 - The court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected. </strong>(See, for example, David Allen Green at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a#block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a\">4.10pm.) </a>The government is appealing to the supreme court, but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again.</p> <p><strong>2 - Unless the government does win at the supreme court, parliament will get to legislate on invoking article 50.</strong> And that means a proper bill, passing through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs and peers getting the chance to amend it. Theresa May has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit because, once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0#block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0\"> 8.49am)</a>, the prime minister loses some control. The key point about today is that MPs and peers have, for the first time, got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process.</p> <p><strong>3 - The chances of Brexit being overturned are still very minimal.</strong> It is just about possible to conceive how the UK could stay in the EU (parliament votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 Brexit bill, and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018) but you would be unwise to bet on it. Most MPs and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured.</p> <p><strong>4 - But the chances of Brexit being \u201csoft\u201d not \u201chard\u201d have increased significantly. </strong>There is a majority for a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit in parliament and, if there is a bill, it will now have the chance to exercise leverage.</p> <p><strong>5 - There is now a real possibility that Theresa May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March. </strong>The government says it still intends to meet this deadline, but the need to legislate could lead to a delay.</p> <p><strong>6 - An early election, though by no means inevitable, now does look more likely than it did this time yesterday.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today. I had been intending to cover other stories, but I\u2019m afraid this one took over.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:34:35.049Z\">at 5.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b6d57e4b029b92ca45368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:03:33.973Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The votes of Northern Ireland MPs in the House of Commons could prove critical if Theresa May and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article 50.</p> <p>All eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs are guaranteed to back Brexit in the Commons given that they were the only major political force in the Stormont Assembly to active back a leave vote in June\u2019s referendum.</p> <p>However, the position of the two Ulster Unionist MPs - Fermanagh/South Tyrone\u2019s Tom Elliott and Danny Kinahan in South Antrim - is interesting. In June UUP leader Mike Nesbitt called for a remain vote.</p> <p>The UUP has now switched position and said its MPs will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented. The party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the UK has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the Commons.</p> <p>The switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the DUP especially given a number of recent defections from the UUP to the Democratic Unionists. In essence the UUP is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the DUP.</p> <p>All three SDLP MPs will definitely vote to block Brexit given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last week\u2019s failed legal action in the Belfast High Court to declare Brexit null and void in Northern Ireland only.</p> <p>Sinn Fein will not vote in the Commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the Remain voices in the chamber that could scupper Brexit.</p> <p>Yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the House of Commons.

It was made unanimously by three experienced appeal judges, sitting exceptionally at first instance: they are the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the leading public law judge at the court of appeal. It is reasoned and detailed. At one point, the court appears to hold that the government\u2019s case was too weak to win on its own terms, regardless of the claimants\u2019 case.</p> <p>Why did the government lose? It seems that the crucial issue is the impact on the rights of citizens. If the Article 50 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/946c95fc-34bb-31f6-855f-ea21d58249c2\">notification is irrevocable</a> then the argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course. This cannot be done, other than by an Act of Parliament.</p> <p>The government could have side-stepped this difficulty by not accepting that the notification was irrevocable (and many, including Lord Kerr who wrote Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, say a notification must be revocable). But it saw this legally sensible move as politically unacceptable. Looking at the judgment, the impression is that the government\u2019s concession on this crucial point determined the outcome of the case.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/11/03/2178734/after-the-high-courts-brexit-decision-forget-about-activating-article-50-in-march/\"><strong>Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and legal writer, says in a Financial Times article that if the government loses its appeal, Theresa May will not be able to trigger article 50 by the end of March as she hopes.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Imagine this. It is November 2018. The promised trade deals have failed to appear. Unemployment and inflation are on the rise. The public mood towards Brexit has turned ugly, and so have negotiations with our biggest and nearest trading partner. In that world, any rational MP would wish that, back in November 2016, she had left ajar the door to remaining in the EU. Why make the decision now, with modest evidence, if you have the opportunity to make it later with more?</p> <p>These points will be debated in the Commons and they must also be debated in the Lords.</p> <p>And, in practical terms, it is difficult to contemplate that these steps \u2013 drafting a Bill, debating it in the Commons, voting on amendments, placing it before the House of Lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the Upper Chamber in the Commons again \u2013 can sensibly be taken after the result of the Supreme Court appeal is known but before March.</p> <p>So, whatever else the decision means, unless the Supreme Court overturns the High Court\u2019s decision, Theresa May\u2019s March deadline will be ancient history.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14858/the-high-courts-ruling-v-the-governments-plan-to-trigger-article-50/\"><strong>Hannah White at the Institute of Government has a Q&amp;A on what the ruling means.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Will MPs and Lords vote to pass the bill?</strong></p> <p>This will of course come down to politics. Both the Commons and Lords have a majority of members who argued for the UK to remain a member of the EU. But politically, they may not wish to vote against the decision of UK voters taken through the referendum, particularly as most constituencies outside the Scotland, Northern Ireland and the major cities voted against remaining in the EU.</p> <p>Nonetheless, they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger Article 50 receives an appropriate <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14358/parliaments-role-in-the-brexit-negotiations/\">degree of parliamentary scrutiny</a>. Depending on how the bill is drafted \u2013 and it is likely to be very short \u2013 there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the Government before it can trigger Article 50. These could take the form of timing or process requirements \u2013 for example, a requirement on the Government to provide Parliament with information about its negotiating position <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14819/what-the-government-needs-to-demonstrate-before-it-pulls-the-article-50-trigger/\">before triggering Article 50</a>.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.howtocrackanut.com/blog/2016/11/3/why-an-appeal-of-the-high-court-parliamentary-brexit\"><strong>Albert Sanchez-Graells, a law lecturer, says on his EU economic law blog that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the European Court of Justice (or the Court of Justice of the European Union - CJEU) getting involved.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, in case of an appeal of the High Court\u2019s decision before the UKSC, in my opinion, the referral to the CJEU is legally unavoidable (I will not deal for now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the UKSC\u2019s likely course of action). Even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the UKSC\u2019s consideration the matter of the (ir)reversibility of and Article 50 notification, it is a logical given that the UKSC needs to take a stance (even if implicit) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case. If it quashes the High Court\u2019s decision, it needs to clarify the points of law which the High Court would have gotten wrong--one of which concerns the irrevocability of an Art 50 notification. if it upholds the High Court\u2019s decision, it is (implicitly) accepting the assumption that an Art 50 notification is irrevocable. Either way, the UKSC cannot escape a substantial (implicit) consideration of the interpretation of Article 50.</p> <p>In my view, this engages the UKSC\u2019s obligation to request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU under Article 267(3) TFEU and not doing so triggers a risk of infringement of EU law by the UK due to the acts (or omission, in this case) of its highest court.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://semipartisansam.com/2016/11/03/high-court-brexit-article-50-ruling-parliament-vote-leave-eu/\">Sam Hooper at Semi-Partisan Politics says leave campaigners should not worry too much about the judgment.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t really remember the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots\">Poll Tax riots</a> toward the tail end of Thatcher\u2019s government. I mean, I remember seeing stories about it on the news, but since I was only eight years old the political ramifications of what I was seeing rather eluded me. But despite my hazy memory, I think it is safe to say were MPs (and it would have to include many Labour MPs representing constituencies which voted to leave the EU) to vote against giving the government authority to invoke Article 50, the resulting conflagration would make the Poll Tax riots look like a summer picnic on Hampstead Heath.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1723987487925989\"><strong>Robert Peston, the ITV political editor, says on Facebook that Brexiteers are guilty of hypocrisy.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is spectacularly delicious that leading Brexiteers are arguing that the High Court today got it wrong today in ruling that we cannot leave the EU without the assent of Parliament - in that almost their entire campaign to get us out of the EU was that British courts and Westminster must be sovereign, and no longer subjugated to Brussels.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/11/03/high-court-article-50-ruling-explained/\">Jo Murkens at the LSE blog says the ruling was a \u201cproper drubbing\u201d for the government.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The High Court\u2019s decision is exemplary in its clarity and reasoning. Anyone interested in a tutorial on the UK constitution should read the first 56 paragraphs. The legal challenge was not supposed to be a major obstacle for the government.

Those who campaigned for leave in the name of wrestling power from Brussels to Westminster went strangely quiet when it came to the question decided by the court today: who has the power to trigger article 50?

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The high court ruling is extremely clear - the UK government cannot trigger article 50 using the Crown prerogative. Indeed, this is consistent with many of the arguments made by the leave campaign themselves about parliamentary sovereignty. It is a mistake, in my view, to challenge such a clear ruling and we should now try and move ahead to develop a fuller understanding of the UK government\u2019s position.</p> <p>The position of the Welsh government has been consistent throughout \u2013 we accept the decision made by the people and will not work against the referendum result - we are working hard to get the best possible exit terms for Wales. However, it is important that votes take place in all four nations to endorse the UK negotiating position.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Welsh Conservative Leader, <strong>Andrew RT Davies</strong> \u2013 the only leader of a mainstream political party in Britain to back a vote to leave the EU \u2013 sees it very differently. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A clear majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union in June, and parliament\u2019s job is to enact that decision \u2013 not to subvert it. The people have spoken and their decision must be respected.</p> <p>Parliament had its say when the referendum was approved by an act of parliament. There is no basis for a further vote in parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.</p> <p>Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.</p> <p>This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours.</p> </blockquote> <p>Plaid Cymru\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong>, welcomed the ruling.

This is a pure question of law. The court is not concerned with and does not express any view about the merits of leaving the European Union: that is a political issue.</p> <p>2- It is accepted by all sides that this legal question is properly before the court and justiciable: under the UK constitution, it is one for the court to decide [5]. It turns on the extent of the Crown\u2019s powers under its prerogative [explained at 24-29]. The Government accepts that neither the European Union Referendum Act 2015 nor any other Act of Parliament confers on it statutory authority (as distinct from the Crown\u2019s prerogative power) to give notice under Article 50 [67-72, 76 and 105-108].</p> <h2> <em>Background</em></h2> <p>3 - On 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom joined what were then the European Communities, including the European Economic Community. Parliament passed the European Communities Act 1972 (1972 Act) to allow that to happen since it was a condition of membership that Community law should be given effect in the domestic law of the United Kingdom and primary legislation was required to achieve this [1 and 36-54]. The European Communities have now become the European Union.</p> <p>4 - Pursuant to the European Union Referendum Act 2015 a referendum was held on 23 June 2016 on the question whether the United Kingdom should leave or remain in the European Union. The answer given was that the UK should leave [2].</p> <p>5- The process for withdrawal is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that once a Member State gives notice to withdraw there is a two-year period in which to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. If no agreement is reached in this time then, subject only to agreement on an extension of time with the European Council acting unanimously, the EU Treaties shall cease to apply to that State. The Government accepts that a notice under Article 50 cannot be withdrawn once it has been given. It also accepts that Article 50 does not allow a conditional notice to be given: a notice cannot be qualified by stating that Parliament is required to approve any withdrawal agreement made in the course of Article 50 negotiations [9-17].</p> <p>6 - Therefore, once notice is given under Article 50, some rights under EU law as incorporated into domestic law by the 1972 Act would inevitably be lost once the Article 50 withdrawal process is completed [57-66].</p> <h2> <em>The constitutional principles</em></h2> <p>7 - The most fundamental rule of the UK\u2019s constitution is that Parliament is sovereign and can make and unmake any law it chooses. As an aspect of the sovereignty of Parliament it has been established for hundreds of years that the Crown \u2013 i.e. the Government of the day \u2013 cannot by exercise of prerogative powers override legislation enacted by Parliament. This principle is of critical importance and sets the context for the general rule on which the Government seeks to rely \u2013 that normally the conduct of international relations and the making and unmaking of treaties are taken to be matters falling within the scope of the Crown\u2019s prerogative powers. That general rule exists precisely because the exercise of such prerogative powers has no effect on domestic law, including as laid down by Parliament in legislation [18-36].</p> <p>8 - In the present case, however, the Government accepts, and indeed positively contends, that if notice is given under Article 50 it will inevitably have the effect of changing domestic law. Those elements of EU law which Parliament has made part of domestic law by enactment of the 1972 Act will in due course cease to have effect [76-80].</p> <p>9 - The central contention of the Government in the present case is that Parliament must be taken to have intended when it enacted the 1972 Act that the Crown would retain its prerogative power to effect a withdrawal from the Community Treaties (now the EU Treaties), and thereby intended that the Crown should have the power to choose whether EU law should continue to have effect in the domestic law of the UK or not [76-81].</p> <h2> <em>Conclusion</em></h2> <p>10 - The Court does not accept the argument put forward by the Government. There is nothing in the text of the 1972 Act to support it. In the judgment of the Court the argument is contrary both to the language used by Parliament in the 1972 Act and to the fundamental constitutional principles of the sovereignty of Parliament and the absence of any entitlement on the part of the Crown to change domestic law by the exercise of its prerogative powers [82-94, 97-104]. The Court expressly accepts the principal argument of the claimants [95-96].</p> <p>11 - For the reasons set out in the judgment, we decide that the Government does not have power under the Crown\u2019s prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T11:57:31.937Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b1394e4b029b92ca45104\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:39:22.137Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has also said the government will appeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/794126273786298368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Government says it is &quot;disappointed&quot; by court ruling on Article 50 and will appeal, expecting Supreme Court hearing on December 7</p>&mdash; Jessica Elgot (@jessicaelgot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/794126273786298368\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b119ae4b029b92ca450fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:35:20.074Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/summary-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf\">the summary of the judgment (pdf).</a></p> <p>And here is its conclusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"939710052c8514fb2fd2fb6bf01fbdf181d28160\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/939710052c8514fb2fd2fb6bf01fbdf181d28160/0_0_716_293/500.jpg\" alt=\"Conclusion of summary of article 50 judgement\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conclusion of summary of article 50 judgement</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Court service</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b11eae4b07ceadb3a1f99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:33:24.611Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">International trade secretary Liam Fox says government will appeal to supreme court</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the Commons<strong> Barry Gardiner</strong>, the shadow international trade secretary, asks <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the international trade secretary, says the government should accept that the Commons will vote for article 50 to be triggered.

This is the film he doesn\u2019t want you to see. And here\u2019s why we think you should see it \u2026</p> <p>Ten years ago, when several residents whose homes are located on the picturesque sand dunes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">Balmedie in Scotland</a> refused to sell their land to Trump for his new luxury golf course resort, the billionaire began a campaign of bullying and intimidation that continues to this day. Most well-known among these residents is farmer Michael Forbes, whose modest croft sits right in the middle of where Trump wanted to build \u201cthe greatest golf course in the world\u201d. Michael\u2019s mother Molly (now aged 92) lives in a caravan across the farmyard from her son. The home has a handmade carved sign on it, reading \u201cParadise\u201d. That was, until Trump arrived.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s first attempt at being a great neighbour was to go on national television and slam the state of Michael Forbes\u2019s farm. The farm was \u201ca slum\u201d, and Michael \u201clived like a pig\u201d, fumed Trump. How could he possibly build his hotel for millionaires if the windows were to look out over \u201cthis horrible, horrible slum\u201d?</p> <p>The hotel was part of Trump\u2019s master plan for the Menie estate\u2019s shifting sand dunes that would create \u201c6,000 jobs\u201d, see the building of 1,500 houses and the construction of a skyscraper hotel. Trump promised to get \u201cAberdeen booming\u201d. His claims were lapped up by local politicians, eager to find an economic wand to wave for when North Sea oil runs dry. No problem if the residents refused to sell. Next up was his threat of eminent domain \u2013 or under UK law, compulsory purchase.</p> <p>So concerned was I at the lack of scrutiny of Trump\u2019s plan and the devastating effect it would have on people and the rare sand dunes where he wanted to build his gated golf resort that I began making my film, You\u2019ve Been Trumped.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his salmon-fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water. Trump\u2019s workers had apparently cut through a pipe leading from the spring that serves the Forbes\u2019s well. The result was that Michael, his wife Sheila and Michael\u2019s mother, Molly, were without running water. This had been going on for a week. And what had Trump done about it? Nothing, according to the Forbes.</p> <p>I went immediately to speak to the man in charge of Trump\u2019s building work at the time to get the other side of the story. He confirmed that there was nobody trying to sort the problem out. He explained they had to \u201cassess it first\u201d so that it \u201cwould be a jewel of a system and sustain itself. It\u2019ll be the best water system he\u2019s ever had\u201d.</p> <p>A short time later I was arrested along with my producer Richard Phinney, and we were thrown into an Aberdeen police cell. There we sat for hours while the police \u2013 apparently acting as a private security force for Trump \u2013 dreamed up some ludicrous charge. The charges were eventually dropped, and the police issued an apology. But still the Forbes\u2019s water supply ran dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">'Whoever wins the US election needs to address the rage out there': the view from Middletown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the years that followed I went back to the Forbes\u2019s house. I made another film in 2014 called <a href=\"http://www.adangerousgamemovie.com/#watch-now\">A Dangerous Game</a>, for which Trump granted me an on-camera interview about the residents\u2019 plight. When I filmed that interview in early 2013, I had no idea that Molly was still without a proper working water supply. She is a private person, a former land girl (member of the Women\u2019s Land Army) during the second world war, and used to hardship.</p> <p>Throughout this extraordinary presidential campaign, countless articles have been written about the outrageous things that Donald Trump has said. But lesser known is what he has done. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to get You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too out to US voters. It is a rare document of the impact on the lives of ordinary people of Trump\u2019s actions.</p> <p>Mexico-style border walls? Check. Mistreatment of women? Check. Failure to deliver on promises? Check. And as for the Forbes\u2019s water? When Trump announced he was running for the presidency in the summer of 2015, I was dumbfounded to discover Molly was still collecting water from a nearby stream because her water supply wasn\u2019t working \u201call because of Trump\u201d.

  "<p>With the presidential election less than a week away, my once-composed optimism has given way to panic. Sheer, stomach-churning panic. You see, up until now I had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the unimaginable: Donald Trump winning. But as election day looms closer, and the racism and sexism that infects Trump\u2019s campaign is ratcheted up, it\u2019s hard not to be terrified.</p> <p>In the past week, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/01/the-kkks-official-newspaper-has-endorsed-donald-trump-for-president/\">endorsed</a> Trump and white supremacists <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/suppress-black-vote-trump-campaign-230616\">announced</a> their plan for widespread voter intimidation.

The US election inspires projectile vomiting | Barbara Ehrenreich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t a political divide between left and right, Democrats and Republicans; it\u2019s an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why it\u2019s been easier for many horrified by Trump to simply pretend there\u2019s no way that he could actually win the presidency. Imagining the hatred underlying his campaign and politics being emboldened in this way is just too much to bear. </p> <p>If Trump wins \u2013 a possibility, even if it is unlikely \u2013 what will our country look like? What will happen to women\u2019s rights, not just at a policy level, but in schools and in homes? How much more afraid will immigrants and people of color have to become that they\u2019ll be ripped from their homes or killed on the street by the very people tasked to protect them? Part of the problem is that we already know the answers to these questions: we\u2019ve been living them.</p> <p>This election has uncovered something vile about America. That so many people would support a despicable candidate is not news to those hurt every day by racism, sexism and xenophobia; we know it\u2019s alive and well in our country. We\u2019ve been dealing with it our whole lives. But to see this hatred on such flagrant, unapologetic display is something else entirely. </p> <p>Even if Trump loses, this isn\u2019t simply a bad dream that we\u2019ll awaken from on 9 November.<br></p> <p>A common refrain I\u2019ve heard from Clinton supporters is that we\u2019re better than this \u2013 the hatred, the harassment. But if this race has shown us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re not better than this. The bigotry and misogyny \u2013 that\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what this country was built on. And even if Clinton wins next week, that\u2019s who we will remain. </p> <p>As wonderful as it will be to watch the first woman win the presidential election, it can\u2019t undo the truth of who we are. The deplorable people who feel they no longer need to hide their hatred aren\u2019t going anywhere after election day, no matter what happens.</p> <p>So I suppose my panic wasn\u2019t about the possibility of a Trump win, after all. It\u2019s about the reality of the moment we\u2019re in, win or lose. It\u2019s about the slime that\u2019s risen to the top, the stink we can\u2019t wash off with one election or one president. We don\u2019t need to panic about the future, because the present already contains more horror than we can handle.</p>",

  "<p>If you need a distraction ahead of Tuesday\u2019s potentially cataclysmic US election, imagine a world in which all Britons and Americans knew about each other came from popular TV drama imports.</p> <p>US viewers would envisage a place in the iron grip of a monarch with presidential powers over law and war (Victoria and, from tomorrow, The Crown), who rules with the help of the aristocracy (Downton Abbey) and cerebral super-detectives (Sherlock). </p> <p>Brits would imagine over there to be overrun with doctors (ER, House), cops (NYPD Blue), lawyers (The Good Wife, LA Law) and flatmates (Friends) who have a standup\u2019s knack for one-liners. Such savvy chat even comes from the chemistry teachers turned drug barons (Breaking Bad) and the pathologists (Dexter) who are secret serial killers.</p> <p>The TV overview of Britain that Americans are given is nostalgically positive, while the image of Americans transmitted in the UK perhaps exaggerates the sense of humour of the average citizen.</p> <p>But in documentaries made about the other country, a very different picture emerges. American factual TV largely ignores Britain (and most other countries), except for reports on Princess Diana and her sons or profiles of showbiz hit-Brits such as Adele. </p> <p>Failing to return the compliment, British docs about the US tend to represent America as what the novelist Saul Bellow called in 1990 (adopting a phrase from Wyndham Lewis) \u201cthe moronic inferno\u201d. Such films \u2013 representing an attitude that ranges from \u201cOnly in America!\u201d to, at its most extreme, \u201cEven in America!\u201d \u2013 show a nation of morbidly obese racist evangelical Christians, waving a weapon in one hand and voting for Ronald Reagan or George W Bush \u2013 or now Donald Trump \u2013 with the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fcdbd3b01b1aa5096852fd3b2f6ee1fe08de1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fcdbd3b01b1aa5096852fd3b2f6ee1fe08de1a1/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eye-popping \u2026 Jadin, aged 9 fires a gun in a firing range as his mum Courtney films him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eye-popping \u2026 Jadin, aged nine, fires a gun in a firing range as his mum Courtney films him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rogan Product/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the eve of what will bring either the Trump presidency, or four years of resentment from his thwarted fans, comes another trio of examples of this. Two of them compete in the 9pm slot tonight \u2013 The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier (BBC2) and The Gun Shop (Channel 4) \u2013 while the third-party candidate is American High School (iPlayer).</p> <p>Although one aim of documentary is to explain a foreign culture to outsiders, The Gun Shop presents an aspect of America that, however good the film, will remain inexplicable to most outsiders. Shot at Freedom Firearms, a weapon-and-ammunition store in Battle Creek, Michigan, it works for a Channel 4 audience as weirdo TV. In the most eye-popping scene, a mother films proudly as her nine-year-old son has his first gun lesson at the shop\u2019s firing range.</p> <p>But far more than most offerings on the topic, this film sometimes twists its pointing finger to scratch its chin. Customers\u2019 backstories show them to be not merely gung-ho, but traumatised. The mum of the son with the gun was the victim of an armed car jacking, while other first-time gun buyers are shown to have been motivated by a random mass shooting nearby or the killing of an African-American driver by police. </p> <p>That man was shot after telling police he had a gun, so tooling up could be seen as a poor insurer of personal safety. But a logic has taken hold that is sharply expressed by a Freedom Firearms client: \u201cIf everyone\u2019s going to carry a weapon, I don\u2019t want to be the one without one.\u201d This logic may ensure more deaths, but the father of one shooting victim acknowledges that there is no possibility of the US becoming \u201canti-gun.\u201d Those who think an armed population is a bad idea will have to settle for \u201canti-carnage.\u201d</p> <p>A similar check to idealism from realism can be found in American High School, a six-part series filmed in South Carolina at Orangeburg-Wilkinson, an academy with a majority African American and \u201chigh poverty index\u201d student body. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de5b9fafa563fcb2720f7a1170895ce24c1cea3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de5b9fafa563fcb2720f7a1170895ce24c1cea3e/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bigger test than most \u2026 Dr Stephen Peters, the principal of American High School.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bigger test than most \u2026 Dr Stephen Peters, the principal of American High School.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Swan Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conceit of a charismatic headteacher trying to reform a failing school is familiar here from series such as Educating Yorkshire, but Dr Stephen Peters, the new principal at O-W, is sitting a bigger test than most. In a key scene, he is dealing with the use of a weapon in a corridor when news comes that two cars filled with gang-members are heading towards campus to avenge the honour of the suspended student.</p> <p>Liberalism and sentimentality tend to encourage educational documentaries towards the most hopeful case studies and American High School has one of those (the story of a star student raised by a single father), but it doesn\u2019t flinch from the painful fates likely to claim many of her classmates.</p> <p>In both The Gun Shop and American High School, the impending election is a constant subtext \u2013 through the issues of racial and social division \u2013 but it is most directly addressed in The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier, which has been re-edited up to the last minute to reflect the latest twists in Trump\u2019s problems with females and Hillary Clinton\u2019s with emails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11de77b575f4b3af221f2ca386e9f1416c105f96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11de77b575f4b3af221f2ca386e9f1416c105f96/113_302_3387_2032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier reflect the latest twists in Trump\u2019s problems with females and Hillary Clinton\u2019s with emails.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier reflects the latest twists in Donald Trump\u2019s problems with females \u2013 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s with emails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The thrust of John O\u2019Kane\u2019s film is that Trump has shaped his campaign around unproven or disproven conspiracy theories: Republican rival Ted Cruz\u2019s dad may have helped to kill JFK, Barack Obama faked his US birth certificate, the Clintons had White House aide Vince Foster murdered.</p> <p>Carefully presenting evidence from forensic experts and \u201ccitizen investigators\u201d on both sides of such matters as alleged typographical discrepancies on Obama\u2019s paperwork or disparities in Foster\u2019s supposed suicide note, the film will inevitably be seen by anyone who disagrees with its conclusions as part of the conspiracy (BBC-Establishment-pro-Clinton.) But \u2013 more profitably \u2013 it explores the creation of an American political climate in which there is no such thing as facts, and even the democratic process is constantly questioned.</p> <p>An odd omission in an otherwise exhaustive film was the absence of Clinton\u2019s claim, as First Lady, that her husband was the victim of a \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d to bring him down. This is significant because Hillary\u2019s belief that Washington was not to be trusted seems likely to have played a part in her unwise decision to secrete and delete emails while serving as Secretary of State.</p> <p>What The Conspiracy Files didn\u2019t state \u2013 but may lead many viewers to conclude \u2013 is that, if Clinton does win, she will become the third Democratic President in succession (after her husband and Obama) whose occupancy of the office has been relentlessly contested by conspiracy theorists and other \u201ccitizen investigators\u201d. And, as a Trump presidency would be viewed with horror in half of the US and much of the world, there should be no shortage of material for more \u201cEven in America!\u201d documentaries.</p>",

The commercial aimed to target, in particular, married women in the suburbs of swing states Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>As the sexual assault tape came to light, Clinton intensified her pitch against her opponent\u2019s treatment of women.</p> <p>Addressing a \u201cWomen for Hillary\u201d a conference call, one week before the election, Clinton appealed to supporters on a personal level.</p> <p>\u201cI know that parts of this election have been painful to many women, especially hearing about Donald Trump\u2019s behavior towards women over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cHe relishes making women feel terrible about themselves in every possible way.

It is extraordinary that this woman, as our own president says, has more experience, more preparation to go into the Oval Office than anyone we can remember, and it was just always going to be hard.\u201d</p> <p>But the gendered circumstances of Clinton\u2019s battle, according to Richards \u2013 from the focus on her clothes to her speaking style to whether she smiles enough \u2013 is what motivates women voters to make their voices heard on 8 November.</p> <p>\u201cWomen feel this is about much more than Hillary, this is about work that has been going on for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women feel an enormous sense of pride and ownership in this election.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps few moments crystallized that sentiment better than when Trump leaned into his microphone during the final presidential debate and snarled: \u201cSuch a nasty woman.\u201d</p> <p>Women supporting Clinton immediately reclaimed the phrase and turned it into a rallying cry, and it became a recurring theme at campaign events to see women with \u201cNasty Women\u201d shirts.

Clinton has emphasized her commitment to such issues since launching her campaign, and also focused on raising the minimum wage, an issue inextricably tied to gender in that women make up two-thirds of minimum wage earners.</p> <p>Jess O\u2019Connell, the executive director of Emily\u2019s List, said Trump was simply vocalizing in politically incorrect terms what Republicans have long advocated in more veiled language.</p> <p>\u201cSingle women are afraid the Republicans are going to turn back the clocks on them,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIgnoring the gender gap in wages or wanting to punish women for having an abortion shows a real lack of understanding about women and their lives today.</p> <p>\u201cThis is when women\u2019s voices are going to be heard.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Fifty-four years later, one might suppose that the famous dress came on to the stage of its own accord, as if it had life as well as destiny. But yes, in 1962, there was a warm body inside it. This was 19 May 1962, and Marilyn Monroe was bringing happy birthday wishes to the president of the United States. She was 10 days early: the actual birthday of John F Kennedy, his 45th, would not be until 29 May. So what? The Democratic party wanted to have a super fundraiser at Madison Square Garden in New York City, so they needed not just JFK himself, but a hook and bait. The birthday was a pretext until the breathy song, \u201cHappy birthday, Mr President ...\u201d</p> <p>That was Marilyn Monroe. But did the Dems ask her or did the president himself arrange it? Sometimes a president can be an instrument in his own PR. Marilyn would be 36 on 1 June, which would prove to be her last birthday. On 5 August, she was found dead in her bed in Brentwood with just a sheet around her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqolSvoWNck\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EqolSvoWNck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Happy Birthday Mr President feels so directed an incident, you have to wonder who was running the show. Was it Peter Lawford, the president\u2019s brother-in-law, who seems to have been the onstage host for the event, dapper in his tux, looking off into the wings, waiting for a bright light, calling for her but she never shows, until at last he can welcome \u201cthe late Marilyn Monroe\u201d \u2013 does he hear what he\u2019s saying?</p> <p>Or was it Marilyn\u2019s own doing? There is a thought now, decades later, that says she was the victim of her time, that she was a wistful actor who wanted to play Chekhov or O\u2019Neill. But still, you have to note how, time and again, hanging on to what was called her career, she did these far-fetched things that catered to male dreams \u2013 such as playing Sugar Kane in Some Like it Hot, kissing Tony Curtis and being the dumb blond in a dirty joke for us.</p> <p>You can say that only demonstrates her victimhood and makes her wishing more wistful. But then you have to see the plain delight with which she did these preposterous things, these moments, as if she could not resist or do without the comfort that came with the gasps and the whistles at Madison Square Garden when she came into the platinum light, shrugged off her wrap and stood there, with her massed blonde waves jutting off to one side, like the control on tower an aircraft carrier, in a dress that could have been painted on her. And she did not seem like the hesitant neurotic of fame and constant lateness when she broke into the birthday song. Just take a look. She seems happy, and an actress is hired to give us some sort of good feeling. This is maybe her greatest moment \u2013 the most reckless \u2013 and she knows it, even if the summer of 1962 is her hell.</p> <p>That dress didn\u2019t just happen. It was the work of Jean Louis. Born in France in 1907, he had come to the US as a fashion designer and then got into the movies. He did work for the Duchess of Windsor, and he also created the black satin dress worn by Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946). Hayworth does a restrained striptease (drawing off her elbow-length gloves) in the Put the Blame on Mame number, which was thought daring in its day. After the war, a pressure grew in movies (it was censorship fighting desire) in which we were asked to imagine what a woman would look like without clothes. It was as if there was a cultural blooming that had to break out of its sheath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8749e0b45810439cf78aef06eb200075d6597ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8749e0b45810439cf78aef06eb200075d6597ae0/0_180_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dress on display at Christie\u2019s in Los Angeles, in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dress on display at Christie\u2019s in Los Angeles, in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Nelson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Louis was an important figure in that history: he also did the black bathing suit that Deborah Kerr wears on an Hawaiian beach in From Here to Eternity, when she\u2019s rolling in the surf with Burt Lancaster. That scene looks charming now, but in 1953 it was close to the outrage audiences were urging. There was a silly British gangster film in 1960, Too Hot to Handle, where Jayne Mansfield wore such a dress, and about which the story was promoted that the movie was so risque a few extra sequins had had to be painted on to the film to protect (or fetishise) Jayne\u2019s nipples. But the Happy Birthday Mr President dress was the climax of this quest.</p> <p>That summer was a frenzied time for Marilyn, and there are signs of how far she yearned to break out of not just a dress, but every setup that imprisoned her. Twentieth Century Fox put her in a new picture, Something\u2019s Got to Give, for which she shot a promotional nude swimming scene \u2013 though censorship would not have allowed the sequence.

The details are not clear, but you do not really want clarity. She was dead in just over a week, and that death (ahead of JFK\u2019s) <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1299496/Marilyn-Monroes-weekend--told-time-eyewitnesss-account-row-Frank-Sinatra-friends-fear-signed-death-warrant.html\">would have so many stories told about it that we\u2019ll never know</a>.</p> <p>The dress remains, and I daresay it has provenance, although we are accustomed to be wary with such relics.

In 1999, it was sold for $1.3m (then \u00a3790,000), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/07/marilyn-monroes-happy-birthday-mr-president-dress-for-sale\">and now it is up for auction again, with some other Monroe mementoes</a>.

A spokesperson for Anderson did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>To educate voters and encourage them to head to the ballot box, #VotingWhileBlack has taken inspiration from some of the successful outreach tactics of the Bernie Sanders campaign, including the use of text messaging.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve bought the access to black folks\u2019 cellphones through the voter file and then coordinated that through the voter file to be able to identify registered black voters in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and also adding in the Harris County district attorney race,\u201d Robinson said.</p> <p>He said the initiative has sent more than 2.2m text messages and attracted nearly 1,500 volunteers for events such as \u201ctext-a-thons\u201d, where attendees try to engage possible voters in text conversations.</p> <p>The ultimate aim is to take a data-driven approach that will harness the kind of energy seen in the Black Lives Matter movement to achieve political change in local communities.

  "<p>It\u2019s almost six months since Sadiq Khan became London mayor and opinion polls suggest that Londoners are <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khan-given-poll-boost-after-first-two-months-in-office-a3292706.html\">pleased with him</a> so far. He\u2019s had a high public profile, addressing the capital\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/252475/london-security-six-things-sadiq-khan-considering-tackle\">security concerns</a>, making friends with <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/sadiq-khan-backs-hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a> and even being <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/sarah-sands-sadiq-khan-has-shown-he-s-the-mayor-our-city-needs-now-a3337981.html\">lauded by the Evening Standard</a>. Khan has allied with London business groups and others to lobby national government for infrastructure investment and stronger devolved powers. Brexit, which he and most London voters opposed, has added <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-sends-welcome-message-to-the-world\">edge and urgency</a> to this campaign. He\u2019s also made starts on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/londoners-overwhelmingly-back-sadiq-khans-air-pollution-crackdown\">tackling London\u2019s harmful air quality</a>, sizing up <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khans-social-integration-chief-matthew-ryder-wants-londoners-to-live-side-by-side-a3340791.html\">barriers to social inclusion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/sep/23/sadiq-khans-new-tfl-boards-first-meeting-hopping-inclusive-and-refreshed\">recalibrating Transport for London</a> to meet some of his bolder policy goals.</p> <p>But his biggest challenge is what is now routinely called the London housing crisis. This is the issue Londoners are most concerned about. Accordingly, Khan dubbed the <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/double_q_books/2016/08/one.html\">mayoral election</a> a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/sep/30/sadiq-khan-london-mayoral-race-is-referendum-on-tory-housing-policy\">housing policy referendum</a>. A large part of his approach to this complex policy area will be trying to increase the delivery of homes that are affordable for people on low and middle incomes. Khan has so far not set a target for the absolute number of what he calls \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes to be built in his four-year term, but he has committed to a long term goal of 50% of all new London dwellings meeting that definition. How well is he doing so far? What progress is he making towards honouring other housing pledges in <a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\">his manifesto</a>?</p> <p>A lot of the work on housing has been hard graft behind the scenes. There is a widely shared view that Khan\u2019s deputy for housing and residential development, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/james-murray\">James Murray</a>, has applied himself to the vast task with an energy, an intelligence and a political will that was lacking in Boris Johnson\u2019s time as mayor. He has been nurturing the broad consensus that unless London makes a better job of building the kinds of homes it and its people most need, everyone stands to lose - including the rest of the country. The goodwill of housing associations, boroughs of all political complexions, employers and commercial property developers has been sought. A dinner Murray had with new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/19/a-quick-guide-to-new-housing-and-planning-minister-gavin-barwell\">housing minister Gavin Barwell</a>, who is also <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/gavin-barwell\">minister for London</a> and MP for a <a href=\"http://www.gavinbarwell.com/\">marginal London constituency</a>, appears to have gone swimmingly.</p> <p>Khan has repeatedly stressed that altering the London housing equation so that it generates better results won\u2019t happen quickly or easily. Sooner or later, though, Londoners will want to start seeing solid results. What follows is a round-up of Khan\u2019s housing policy progress so far and some pointers to important things to come.</p> <h2>A trade-off with property developers</h2> <p>Later this year, after the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/autumn-statement-2016-date-confirmed\">autumn public spending statement on 23 November</a>, City Hall will issue its long-brewing <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance\">supplementary planning guidance</a> (SPG) designed to encourage higher \u201caffordable\u201d housing yields from planning deals struck between boroughs and property developers across the city. Like it or not, London depends heavily on private sector companies to finance and deliver buildings it needs - including much of its affordable housing. Inviting them to take a hike might get you a round of applause but, the ways things are now, won\u2019t help put roofs over people\u2019s heads.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s SPG will effectively offer developers an incentive to ensure that the proportion of affordable homes agreed for larger schemes meets a minimum level, expected to be 35%. London mayors have considerable powers to intervene in planning arrangements being worked out at borough level. The SPG will show Khan willing to give a fair wind to plans enshrining the desired percentage, but take a long, hard look at those that don\u2019t. The trade-off is that developers will benefit from the certainty this approach provides \u2013 they may have mastered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/oct/16/earls-court-questions-of-viability\">dark arts of viability</a>, but the attendant aggravation costs them time and money too. The SPG will also set out what types of home called \u201caffordable\u201d by national government meet Khan\u2019s more stringent definition of being \u201cgenuinely\u201d so.</p> <h2><strong>Increasing \u201caffordable\u201d supply with public money</strong></h2> <p>Khan has spent some of what\u2019s left of the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/mayor%E2%80%99s-housing-covenant-2015-18-programme\">\u00a31.25bn provided to Boris Johnson for 2015-2018</a> to increase the \u201caffordable\u201d housing component of housing planned for the <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/khan-intervenes-to-increase-affordable-housing-on-old-oak-site/7016350.article\">first section of the vast Old Oak and Park Royal regeneration project</a> in west London (whose overall stewardship under Johnson he\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/old-oak-common-regeneration-is-branded-a-mess-in-sadiq-khan-review-a3383996.html\">described</a> as \u201ca mess\u201d). He will soon produce a successor to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_mayors_housing_covenant_2015-18_programme_prospectus.pdf\">Johnson\u2019s funding prospectus</a>, outlining to housing associations and boroughs what it will take for them to secure grants from him. This will be published following the autumn statement. City Hall is lobbying for further funding for affordable homes. </p> <h2><strong>Building \u201caffordable\u201d homes on public land</strong></h2> <p>Prior to Khan\u2019s election, Transport for London (TfL) had named a panel of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/feb/04/transport-for-london-names-partner-companies-for-land-development-drive\">developer partners</a> to work with on jointly profiting from building on over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/oct/20/transport-for-london-picks-first-300-acres-for-property-development-drive\">300 acres</a> on 75 sites in its large land portfolio. Its prime objective was to make as much money as it could for the city\u2019s transport systems. Khan, though, wants an overall <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35465056\">50% of homes built on these sites </a>to be \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d. His manifesto<a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\"> specified</a> that these would be part-buy, part-rent shared ownership dwellings prioritised for first-time buyers who\u2019ve been renting for five years, especially in Outer London. It is another key strand of his drive to increase affordable housing supply.</p> <p>Since the election, Khan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/23/london-housing-tfl-land-set-for-affordable-homes-as-sadiq-khan-picks-expert-team\">put in place</a> arrangements for 200 out of 400 homes he wants built on TfL land at Kidbrooke station to meet his requirements and urged the transport body to prioritise some of its smaller sites elsewhere. An <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-fast-tracks-more-land-for-affordable-homes\">announcement</a> earlier this week concerned two of these. One is called Landmark Court near London Bridge station, which has been lined up for more than 100 homes, of which \u201cat least 35%\u201d will be affordable. The other is called Fenwick South, which is actually owned by Lambeth Council. The building of 55 social rented homes already planned for it as part of the agreement that will extend the Northern Line into Nine Elms will now begin early next year - sooner than expected. TfL will be responsible for delivering the homes, which will be owned and managed by Lambeth.</p> <h2><strong>A best practice guide for estate regeneration</strong> </h2> <p>Another way Khan could increase the supply of affordable homes would be by helping boroughs to add to the number on council-owned housing estates. Recent <a href=\"http://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/estate-densification/\">research</a> has emphasised that many of the biggest Inner London estates have already been rebuilt or replaced, but that the potential exists to \u201cdensify\u201d others to the tune of an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 homes a year. The problem is that such \u201cregenerations\u201d have the potential to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/10/london-housing-improving-the-theory-and-practice-of-densifying-estates\">contentious, contested and to go very wrong</a> \u2013 not least for people living on them. One positive route through this difficult terrain is to find ways of \u201cdensifying\u201d without extensive demolition and temporary rehousing, with current residents directly benefiting from the results. When he was Islington Council\u2019s housing lead, James Murray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/aug/07/estate-regeneration-the-king-square-solution\">firmly favoured</a> the latter approach. A \u201cbest practice\u201d document, setting out the mayor\u2019s principles for getting estate regeneration right, is expected to be published by the end of this month.</p> <h2><strong>Introducing the London Living Rent </strong></h2> <p>Khan\u2019s plan to bring in a new private sector tenure with rents set at one third of average local household incomes \u2013 thereby fitting his definition of \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d - was a major element of his housing manifesto. In September, he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37405991\">said</a> London households typically earning between \u00a335,000 and \u00a345,000 a year - which would cover couples each earning substantially less than the average London incomes - would qualify for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37405991\">these new homes</a> and be able to rent a two-bedroom flat for less than \u00a31,000 per month, compared with the London average of \u00a31,450. Subsequent <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/renting/london-living-rent#acc-i-41302\">published details</a> indicate that the eligible household income range could be as wide as \u00a325,000 to \u00a360,000, depending on the area of London. </p> <p>The mayor\u2019s intention is that this <a href=\"http://londonist.com/2016/09/mayor-announces-london-living-rent-to-help-blunt-the-housing-crisis\">new form of tenure</a> would enable tenants to save for mortgage deposits and <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/london-living-rent-confirmed-as-homeownership-product/7016863.article\">move on to home ownership</a>. It best described as \u201crent-indexing\u201d rather than rent controlled according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f432c7aa-16bd-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e\">one housing expert</a>, though at City Hall they prefer to describe it as a form of rent regulation applied to a specific type of affordable home. Housing providers have said they would be able to supply London Living Rent properties, though some political debate has centred on how far they\u2019d be affordable to renters earning the London Living Wage. The tenure period under <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/renting/london-living-rent#acc-i-41303\">London Living Rent terms</a> will be \u201cgenerally of up to five years\u201d, says City Hall. Hackney Council, which is eager to help young, middle income residents remain in the borough as well as sustaining its social housing delivery, has pledged to be the first to see 500 London Living Rent homes built. It is thought that the very first London Living Rent homes could start to be built next year.</p> <h2><strong>Understanding the impacts of foreign buyers</strong></h2> <p>Much blame for London\u2019s high housing costs is routinely aimed at foreign buyers investing in absurdly expensive \u201cprime central\u201d flats, but the true impacts of such finance and the use to which resulting properties are put are varied and unclear. Khan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors\">commissioning independent research</a> into the phenomenon, hoping to get a fuller picture so that housing policy can be developed accordingly. Significantly, the remit for this research recognises that, for good or ill, overseas buyers continue to play a big part in enabling development in London to happen. Khan wants the final report delivered next spring.</p> <h2>Lessening the ill-effects of the Housing and Planning Act</h2> <p>During the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">mayoral election campaign</a>, Khan\u2019s Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith made much of an amendment to a piece of legislation that even fellow Tories thought very bad for London and which Goldsmith claimed would enable the forced sale of council homes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/11/what-will-zac-goldsmiths-2-for-1-housing-bill-amendment-achieve\">result</a> in twice as many \u201caffordable\u201d homes being built in the capital as would be lost. But the true impact of the Act in London cannot be fully assessed until its accompanying regulations are published, interpreting the various elements that leave room for discretion. The EU referendum and its turbulent aftermath have meant progress on this task has been slow. The appointment of Gavin Barwell as housing minister (see above) and his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/09/13/government-edging-away-from-home-ownership-focus-says-housing-mi/\">suggestion</a> of a shift away from controversial \u201cstarter homes\u201d, thought largely useless as an \u201caffordable\u2019 product in London, towards supporting a wider range of relatively low cost homes, including for rent, have raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/oct/05/conservative-party-conference-hope-housing-crisis\">tentative hopes</a> that the worst aspects of the Act as they could affect the capital might be reduced.</p> <h2>Protecting the green belt</h2> <p>Housing supply <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/major-programmes/london-housing-commission\">analysis</a> <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/report_when_brownfield_isnt_enough\">published</a> during the election campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/29/which-london-mayor-candidate-will-fix-the-capitals-housing-crisis\">underlined</a> how difficult it will be to increase the number of homes built in London to the overall 50,000 a year it is generally held to need - a figure Khan has acknowledged but not committed to - without boroughs bringing forward some of their green belt land for building on. But the issue is politically explosive and Khan has gone to considerable lengths not to ignite it, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/apr/23/london-mayor-race-zac-goldsmith-is-being-slippery-about-the-green-belt\">during the campaign</a> and since, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/sadiq-khan-pledges-support-for-green-belt\">making much</a> of his rejection of Tory Bromley Council\u2019s plans for a football stadium and flats to go on green belt land in Chislehurst.</p> <h2>A not-for-profit lettings agency</h2> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\">manifesto</a>, Khan promised to set up \u201ca London-wide, not-for-profit lettings agency for good landlords, building on the work that councils have started, and ending rip-off fees for renters\u201d. Word is that work has begun on this at City Hall, but it is at an early stage. </p> <h2>Stopping \u201caffordable rent\u201d conversions</h2> <p>A policy introduced by the Tory-led coalition government encouraged housing associations and councils to convert social rented homes to new, more expensive \u201caffordable rent\u201d tenures when they became vacant and were re-let to new people on waiting lists (with the strain often taken by housing benefit, the bill for which the government is actually trying to reduce). This was <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2014/12/does-affordable-rent-really-mean-the-end-of-social-housing/\">correctly seen</a> as a threat to social housing numbers at a time when more, not fewer, are needed. Khan, committed to protecting social housing in London as \u201ca vital asset\u201d, has moved to block these conversions. City Hall says that under Boris Johnson\u2019s\u2019s 2011-2015 affordable homes programme, a total of 19,000 were approved (see \u201cnotes to editors\u201d <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-london-living-rent-for-new-homes\">here</a>) with 14,000 of those now completed. The rate of conversions has slowed recently, but Khan <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-london-living-rent-for-new-homes\">says</a> he will work with housing associations through his affordable homes programme to put an end to them. </p> <h2>Homes for Londoners team</h2> <p>Khan promised to set up a \u201cnew and powerful team at the heart of City Hall\u201d to pull together all the mayor\u2019s housing powers and resources and \u201cbreak the homebuilding logjam\u201d. So far, a Homes of Londoners governance board has been formed, chaired by Khan - it will meet for the first time next month, after the autumn statement - a \u201cskills and capacity audit\u201d is underway and an in-house team of experts on development viability is being assembled with a view to making the provisions of the supplementary planning guidance stick (read more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/23/london-housing-tfl-land-set-for-affordable-homes-as-sadiq-khan-picks-expert-team\">here</a>). Perhaps the \u201cHomes for Londoners\u201d title is best understood as a banner flying above various forms of co-ordinated action. </p> <h2>Preparing for a new London Plan and housing strategy</h2> <p>Mayoral housing policy has to be in line with those enshrined in the London Plan, the name given to the mayor\u2019s statutory \u201cspatial development strategy\u201d for the capital. The current London Plan is Boris Johnson\u2019s. That doesn\u2019t mean Khan is totally hamstrung by it, but it does mean he needs to put it through a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/london-plan-full-review\">full review</a> which will result in a new version in up to three years\u2019 time. That review is underway with the launch of a consultation document called <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/have-your-say/all-consultations/city-all-londoners\">A City for All Londoners</a>. In this, Khan sets out the challenges posed by the capital\u2019s rapid growth and some of the ways he hopes to meet them, including in housing. Themes include some of those mentioned above and homelessness, including rough sleeping. The mayor will also be producing a specific housing strategy to replace Johnson\u2019s. It will come out some time next year. </p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The essential difference between Khan\u2019s approach to housing policy and that of his Tory predecessor is that the Labour mayor is, as you\u2019d expect, taking a more interventionist approach to shaping and regulating the huge, unruly beast that is the London housing market. He appears to be demonstrating far greater drive for getting more homes across the \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d spectrum built. His mayoral team and City Hall officers are of a high calibre and have demonstrated the pragmatic, consensus-building approach that is fundamental to mayors getting things done. </p> <p>London\u2019s housing problems might be characterised as a combination of its booming successes over more than two decades and a consequence of successive national governments\u2019 inadequate responses to the failure of the market to respond in the right way to its demands. Housing shortages and other problems aren\u2019t new to London, and the current ones are beyond the power of any mayor to completely solve alone. But the hope is that Khan can provide strong, successful examples of how to make a start. </p>",
  "<p>Friends with a nine-year-old came to stay last week and I resolutely flunked the one question their child asked me. I don\u2019t know about nine-year-olds; I know about two-year-olds, in comparison to which nine looks roughly 18. I\u2019m making excuses for myself, but the fact is that when she asked her question \u2013 a good one: \u201cHow much money does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/jobs-journalism-careers\" title=\"\">a writer</a> make?\u201d \u2013 I wasn\u2019t thinking about giving an age-appropriate response. I just responded and now I feel terrible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/02/motherhood-10-years-on\">Ten top tips from 10 years as a parent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, the correct answer to this question, when asked by a child, particularly one who wants to be a writer, is apparently: \u201cYou do what you love and don\u2019t think about the money.\u201d What I said was something along the lines of how sensible she was to be thinking about it this early, because although, yes, it is good to do what one loves, one also has to earn a living. The pragmatic thing, I said, is to find someone to pay you to write while you figure out what you\u2019re&#xa0;doing.</p> <p>I know. Not my finest hour. And very unfair given that, when I was her age, I guess someone must have given me the right answer because until I had mortgage costs, I never did think much about the money.</p> <p>Her mother looked on with horror before interjecting, \u201cThat is terrible advice\u201d, and I came to my senses and answered again. Too late, probably. Even at two, if I put a foot wrong with my own children \u2013 last week, a carelessly uttered \u201cshit\u201d when I dropped something \u2013 they don\u2019t forget, but repeat it all morning.</p> <p>Now I have my own question: is it really that terrible, as advice goes? What if she had expressed a desire to be a banker? What then?</p> <p>Should I have run from the room screaming? What exactly are the rules, so I get it right next time?</p> <h2><strong>Baby steps</strong></h2> <p>My campaign to get Mr Steve, who runs a music class my children attend, to express himself in adult form progressed this week, although not from anything I did. The baby gym has hoops suspended by scarves along the wall and, in the free-play period between bubble time and a jolly round of The Grand Old Duke of York, one of my toddlers put the hoop round her neck and pulled upwards.</p> <p>There was no danger. The supervision in the class is too intense and, besides, the hoop was too wide to close around her neck. But it would not have been a relaxing visual, say, for the baby gym\u2019s underwriters.</p> <p>Mr Steve\u2019s voice dropped three octaves to a pitch I had never heard before. \u201cOh, that\u2019s not good,\u201d he said. I tried to roll the conversation on, to no avail. But it felt like an important&#xa0;breakthrough.</p> <h2><strong>The Starbucks stop here</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/nov/10/starbucks-christmas-cup-mug-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4e4tq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2404754\"            data-video-name=\"Storm in a coffee cup: has Starbucks really ruined Christmas? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56421ef0e4b0ddf11c1fbdf2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/10/151110starbucks1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/10/151110starbucks1_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/10/151110starbucks1_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/10/151110starbucks1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/10/151110starbucks1_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/nov/10/starbucks-christmas-cup-mug-video\">Storm in a coffee cup: has Starbucks really ruined Christmas 2015?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With Halloween gone, the only big occasion left in the US calendar this year, aside from the election and Thanksgiving, of course, is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/11/conservatives-should-blame-capitalism-war-on-christmas\" title=\"\">war on Christmas</a>, that fun annual event during which atheists, Muslims, gay people and the rest of them&#xa0;conspire to bring down&#xa0;Christianity.</p> <p>This year, once again, they are sure to be joined by the socialist agents at Starbucks, whose failure last year to issue their Christmas-themed cup in good time caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/nov/10/starbucks-christmas-cup-mug-video\" title=\"\">Donald Trump to issue a terrifying threat</a>: not only to boycott the chain, but to toss it out of Trump Tower.</p> <p>Or, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/starbucks-exceed-quarterly-sales-red-cup-christmas\" title=\"\">he put it</a>: \u201cI have one of the most successful Starbucks, in Trump Tower.

  "<p>Today we bring you two updates from Muncie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">in part eight of our series</a> \u2013 a video in which Gary asks whether the deep divides revealed by this election can be reconciled afterwards, and interviews with residents about the electoral issues they consider crucial. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks we\u2019ve been asking people who live and work in Muncie to help guide and shape the Middletown series. They have been sharing the issues they think are important, and suggesting who Gary should meet in the city.<br></p> <p> Collaboration is important for a project like this because the community provides nuance and insight that is difficult to uncover when you\u2019re only in a place for a short time. We would not have known to contact some of the people interviewed for this project had readers not told us about them. It\u2019s my job to support Gary\u2019s reporting by managing those callouts and working with people who\u2019ve got in touch. </p> <p>When we report on a place, it\u2019s essential to give the people who live there a voice, which is why this article is a little different. The issues that the contributors have discussed in this piece are reflected in the wider community. Many identified everyday challenges such as drug addiction, racism and class divide, however they also spoke of Muncie as a very special place to live. This is a city where there is positive change, new development, a vibrant arts scene \u2013 but it\u2019s also a place where community matters and people like to help each other.</p> <p>This series is about how people in Muncie experience politics during this election \u2013 most striking when I was interviewing them for this piece was a sense of how voters felt let down by both presidential candidates. Nearly everyone I spoke to was trying in some way to unify Muncie, and that gets so much harder when the vicious political discourse fuels divisiveness. As one contributor, Cornelius Dollison, put it: \u201cMuncie is getting better, but we as a country have a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">Read part eight here</a>.

Here, residents tell us about the issues that matter most to them when it comes to voting, and their experience of living in Muncie. As with Middletowns everywhere, the city faces difficulties, but it seems these are matched by a strong and active community willing to take them on. </p> <p><strong>Lauren Bishop-Weidner</strong>, who taught English at Ball State University for 15 years, told us: \u201cYour first impression of Muncie is probably going to be inaccurate. Most people come in on the east or west side on McGalliard Avenue and you just see box store after box store. But if you go through the neighbourhoods you see diversity and spirit, especially downtown. You need to go all the way through Muncie before you decide what you think.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/muncie-community-image-three/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Jason Donati family photo 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/muncie-community-image-three/embed.html\">Jason Donati family photo 2016</a> <figcaption>Jason Donati family photo 2016</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jason Donati, 36, </strong>has four children, grew up in Muncie and returned eight years ago. He lives in downtown Muncie and is an environmental educator for the Muncie Sanitary District. He is also the co-founder of Race Muncie, which stands for Reconciliation Achieved Through Community Engagement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are jobs in Muncie. I know people in economic development and there are a lot of jobs which don\u2019t have enough qualified people. It\u2019s easy to say we haven\u2019t got jobs, that we\u2019ve been screwed over by Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement]. We have all felt the effects of losing the automotive industry, that\u2019s true, but what working-class white people have to deal with here is the issue of addiction. I\u2019ve been to a lot of funerals of my friends. The drugs are so much stronger, people in their mid-30s with small children are now dying through recreational use. It\u2019s doubling and tripling and heroin is catching up with meth. There\u2019s a lack of resources in the community for mental health, counselling and healing.

He owned a gas station, and spun a long tale of opportunities lost and grievances mostly voiced at government, many of them arcane and petty. </p> <p>He was obtuse about whom to blame, other than a vague \u201cthem\u201d, but he was emphatic about the solution: \u201cWe need to get this country straight again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55701cd3d470607e23f92e9d5ddc0b2d2e0e08b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55701cd3d470607e23f92e9d5ddc0b2d2e0e08b1/0_48_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence Johnson, 69.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Johnson, 69.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While I was hearing a rising euphoria for Trump from many white voters, I was also hearing an equally loud and growing disbelief from the media. </p> <p>Most journalists ensconced in their New York or Washington offices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/13/liberal-media-bias-working-class-americans\">refused to accept</a> that someone as louche and crass as Trump could appeal to voters. Trump supporters, in many of their minds, were simply dumb or racist, overshadowing any notion that these voters might also have some valid concerns.</p> <p>As Trump started winning primaries, the outrage and disbelieve increased. I continued my drives around the US and saw a feedback develop: the loud distaste voiced against Trump by who they saw as \u201cthe establishment\u201d only added to his appeal.</p> <p>Florence Johnson, 69, was like that. She was shopping in the Goodwill in Natchitoches, Louisiana, buying a vacuum cleaner and an electrical stuffed parrot (\u201cI have always like birds\u201d). She wasn\u2019t shy about her situation. \u201cI am poor,\u201d she said. She also wasn\u2019t shy about her support for Trump, or why. \u201cHell yes I am voting for Trump. Tired of politicians. He is putting on a great show, pissing them other bastards off. They deserve it!\u201d </p> <p>Natchitoches was like many other towns with their share of enthusiastic Trump supporters. It had suffered a devastating economic downturn in the 1970s and 1980s when the cotton gin mills closed. Other than jobs related to the state university, it has since offered little opportunity. Those in town whose lives were not connected to the university lifeline were the Trump voters. </p> <p>Well, the white people in town. Natchitoches, like the US, has long been divided along racial lines, with black residents confined to a lesser choice of jobs, homes, and schools. And Trump was dividing them further.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107d970635a7a2062102f7377300a505654f0719\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107d970635a7a2062102f7377300a505654f0719/0_36_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Thompson, 54.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Thompson, 54.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Linda Thompson, 54, was shopping in a small store down the road from Florence.

The jobs requiring muscle decreased (many going overseas) while the jobs requiring school increased. Compounding the pain from this, we started giving the winners a much larger share of the profits.</p> <p>The early Trump voters I met were the losers from these changes. Their once superior status \u2013 based only on being white \u2013 was being dismantled, while their lack of education was also being punished. They lived in towns and communities devastated by economic upheaval. They were born in them and stayed in them, despite their fall. For many, who had focused on their community over career, it felt like their entire world was collapsing.</p> <p>As Trump gained momentum, as he marched towards the GOP nomination, his message started to resonate with these entire communities \u2013 including those that were doing well economically. Many solidly middle-class Americans have friends, relatives, or congregants who are suffering. </p> <p>More than that, supporting Trump has become a way of showing support for their failing communities.

Why we got to keep invading countries.

Life for many has become a constant anxiety over upcoming bills. They are also dealing with social problems that always follow economic loss, such as families broken apart, children struggling with little support, eroded institutions, and substance abuse \u2013 a quick salve to either forget or numb the pain.</p> <p>Compounding the anxiety, and helping to morph it into humiliation, is the false national narrative that the US is a meritocracy where anyone can advance with the right education, and hence failure is because of being dumb or lazy.</p> <p>But in communities I visit, the right education is often beyond most people. Many residents often fail to go beyond high school, and if they do, it is an education cobbled together by night classes and community colleges, together with a concoction of loans, programs and overwhelming debt. </p> <p>All of this is humiliating and painful, and has made the perfect setting for populist politics built on blaming minorities and immigrants. And that is what Trump has exploited. He has come into these communities with white identity politics, a message that is both simple and loud: He will make America great again.</p> <p>It is a message that resonates, because viewed from these places, America no longer seems a great country.</p>",

  "<p>On 12 May 2014, just after 5.15pm, two well-dressed, middle-aged women walked purposefully up the ramp of a footbridge over the Bernesga river in the historic city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3n,_Spain\">Le\u00f3n</a> in north-western Spain. First came Isabel Carrasco, the most powerful politician in the city, who was heading to the local headquarters of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). A minibus was waiting to take her to an election campaign rally with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. After numerous corruption scandals, his party was tanking in the polls, and he needed the support of one of his most successful vote-winners. At barely 5ft tall and 59 years old, Carrasco was a bold and colourful dresser. She was wearing a purple jacket with pink cuffs, black Chlo\u00e9 jeans and fuchsia platform shoes.</p> <p>The woman who walked up the gentle arc of the bridge a few metres behind Carrasco was overdressed for a sunny afternoon \u2013 in a designer parka, baseball cap and leather gloves \u2013 but seemed otherwise unremarkable to Pedro Mielgo, a retired police officer who passed them both. Perhaps that is why, when the first shot rang out, he thought it was a firework.</p> <p>When Mielgo looked back, however, he could see Carrasco sprawled on the ground. The other woman was leaning over her, a pistol in her gloved hand. She fired three more shots at Carrasco\u2019s head \u2013 which bounced violently against the ground \u2013 and then turned around. After putting the gun in a shoulder bag, the woman pulled a scarf over her mouth and walked calmly past Mielgo before heading towards the centre of this placid and charming provincial city.</p> <p>The assassin quickly melted into the sluggish afternoon street life of Le\u00f3n, crossing the narrow riverside park and turning into a street of four-storey apartment blocks with shops and bars at ground level. Mielgo followed at a discreet distance, phoning the police as he went. He lost her by the Col\u00f3n market, but then rounded the corner of the Gran V\u00eda de San Marcos and saw a woman who \u2013 although she was now wearing a white jacket \u2013 he thought he recognised as the killer.</p> <p>Mielgo waved down a passing police car. By now, the woman had got into the passenger seat of a parked, silver-grey Mercedes SLK 200 sports car, although there was no one in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThat\u2019s her. Be careful, she has a gun,\u201d he shouted. The police officers approached the car and asked the woman for her identity card, which revealed that she was 58-year-old Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez. Moments later, a younger woman approached them, explaining that she was Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s 34-year-old daughter, Triana Mart\u00ednez. Triana said her mother had been with her the whole afternoon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/dec/02/the-shocking-of-spains-most-flamboyant-politician-podcast\">The shocking murder of Spain\u2019s most flamboyant politician \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quick search of the car turned up no weapon. The home address on the back of the women\u2019s identity cards was the Plaza de los Marqueses in the hilltop town of Astorga, 30 miles away. That square is best known as home to the city\u2019s police headquarters. The women explained that the police station was their registered home, since Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s husband, Pablo Mart\u00ednez, was Astorga\u2019s chief of police. Mart\u00ednez was one of the half-dozen most senior officers in Le\u00f3n province. Despite this strange twist, Montserrat and Triana were immediately taken to Le\u00f3n\u2019s main police station for questioning as murder suspects.</p> <p>While Mielgo was following the mysterious killer, Le\u00f3n\u2019s emergency services were dealing with something they had no experience of \u2013 a cold-blooded assassination in the middle of the day in a public place. Carrasco had been shot in the back and, as she slid to the ground, grabbed hold of the bridge\u2019s handrail, twisting to see her attacker. Two more .32 calibre bullets had then been fired into her head, killing her instantly.</p> <p>The victim, who presided over the powerful provincial government, or <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em>, from her office in a cloistered 16th-century bishop\u2019s palace, was known to everyone in Le\u00f3n. The murder had been committed at one of the most dramatic sites in the city. \u201cIt was almost like a ceremonial killing,\u201d recalled \u00c1ngela Dom\u00ednguez, the former editor of the local edition of El Mundo newspaper. Emergency service radio recordings reveal one shocked ambulanceman blurting out a phrase that many would have recognised: \u201cShe\u2019s the one who had 12 jobs, and 12 salaries!\u201d It was a reference to the number of official and semi-official posts Carrasco had accumulated during her five years as <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>president. With her multiple jobs, incomes and perks, she had become a symbol of how politicians were milking public funds while other Spaniards struggled to cope with the recession that had devastated the country since the 2008 financial crisis. In a country with 25% unemployment, here was a woman with 12 jobs.</p> <p>Many people in Le\u00f3n recall exactly what they were doing when they heard the news. Miguel \u00c1ngel Zamora, a reporter at the Diario de Le\u00f3n, was talking to a policeman after his car had been damaged by another vehicle. \u201cI heard the victim\u2019s name over his radio. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told me. He rang his news editors, who thought he must have got it wrong. Confirmation arrived with the first photographs.

You didn\u2019t hear people saying: \u2018Poor her\u2019,\u201d said Zamora. The list of her enemies was so long, some joked, that the police would never find the killer. It had sometimes been said that the only way to unseat Carrasco would be to murder her. Nobody had meant it seriously, but now it seemed that someone had taken it that way.</p> <p>By the time of her death, and despite her party\u2019s repeated successes at elections in Le\u00f3n, Carrasco had become one of the most controversial and feared politicians in Spain. In her lifetime, people had gossiped viciously about her, often looking over their shoulder to make sure they were not overheard. Some saw her as a sort of praying mantis, seducing and devouring her victims, or as a despot who delighted in destroying her enemies. And as Le\u00f3n and the rest of Spain slipped ever deeper into recession and angry pessimism after 2008, resentment towards her had grown.</p> <p>Carrasco could be vulgar. \u201cI remember having to explain to her in a restaurant that you can\u2019t just pick your teeth with a yoghurt top in public,\u201d said one friend who asked to remain anonymous. She was constantly in and out of cosmetic surgery clinics and was unabashed about it \u2013 showing off the stitches and scars behind her ears while proclaiming that \u201cthe time comes when we all have to do this\u201d. When she became head of Le\u00f3n\u2019s <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em>, she refused to follow tradition by hanging her predecessor\u2019s portrait in the palace\u2019s cloisters. Instead, she became the first to hang her own picture.</p> <p>Carrasco had come a long way. She was a railwayman\u2019s daughter, raised down the tracks from Le\u00f3n in a small, poor village called Campo y Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez. She was part of a generation of Spaniards who entered adulthood just as the country was leaving behind the right-wing Catholic dictatorship of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/francisco-franco\">General Franco</a> and embracing democracy, progress and optimism. Women, who had previously needed their husband\u2019s signature to open a bank account and could not legally get a divorce before 1981, were finally free to pursue their ambitions outside the home. Yet such opportunities were still largely restricted to those born into privilege. Carrasco was from a humble background, but she was clever and pushy. She studied law and passed the ferociously competitive civil service exams, to become one of Spain\u2019s youngest tax inspectors. As a young woman, her energy and charisma were already legendary, as was her temper. \u201cI even remember her being angry on her wedding day,\u201d a childhood friend recalled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was young, uninhibited, clever and capable. It was like planting a bomb in a world full of men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A brief marriage produced a daughter, Loreto, when Carrasco was 25, before she left her husband and began a rapid rise through the PP. In 1987, at the age of 32, she became the provincial delegate of the regional government of Castilla y Le\u00f3n. \u201cLe\u00f3n had never seen a woman in power,\u201d Susana Vergara, a local journalist, told me. \u201cShe was young, uninhibited, clever and capable. It was like planting a bomb in a world full of men.\u201d</p> <p>In 1991, Carrasco returned to the tax office to run the team investigating large companies and wealthy individuals. When one well-off Le\u00f3n family protested against the fines levied on them and insulted Carrasco personally, the fines were tripled. Carrasco enjoyed power, and knew how to impose it on others. \u201cShe could walk into a meeting full of men, and five minutes later be completely in charge,\u201d said her friend (and lawyer) Carlos Rivera. He saw her as a gutsy, capable woman set on taming a city traditionally run by conservative men. \u201cShe was quick, impatient, fast-talking and liked to win.\u201d</p> <p>Local party leaders were impressed, and in 1995, Carrasco returned to politics as the finance minister in the regional government of Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Eight years later, she became a senator in Madrid. Finally, in 2007, she was appointed head of Le\u00f3n\u2019s <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em> \u2013 a powerful position that gave her control over a budget of \u20ac130m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ae68c7958862f31a2b126e7bc74a5fcc226e1ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ae68c7958862f31a2b126e7bc74a5fcc226e1ad/0_0_1944_2664/730.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m a free woman\u2019 \u2026 Isabel Carrasco in 2013.\" width=\"730\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m a free woman\u2019 \u2026 Isabel Carrasco in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J. Casares/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The press had taken to Carrasco when she first appeared in Le\u00f3n, though her brash, open manner shocked some people. She refused to bow to expectations about how a woman should dress, speak or behave. \u201cI once heard her say loudly at a public event: \u2018I\u2019ll got to bed with whoever I want, because I\u2019m a free woman,\u2019\u201d recalled Vergara. Everybody in Le\u00f3n recalls one photograph in particular, when Carrasco turned up to a 2003 campaign event wearing a diamante choker that spelled out the word \u201cSEX\u201d. If they did not like it, Carrasco seemed to be saying, that was their problem. \u201cThey can suck my pussy!\u201d was one of the cruder phrases occasionally heard ringing around the <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em> palace when Carrasco was angry, which was frequently the case.</p> <p>When she took office in July 2007, Carrasco\u2019s first target was the cosy and corrupt business community that dominated Le\u00f3n. She waded into this world with reformist glee, according to Rivera. \u201cHer biggest enemy was the business community of Le\u00f3n. To them, she had three defects. She was a woman, she was clever and she didn\u2019t forgive people who stole.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Carrasco\u2019s efforts to curtail corruption were only ever partial, and constrained by her own love of power. Speculative, get-rich-quick deals involving real-estate developers, local politicians and savings banks helped push Spain into its dramatic double-dip recession in 2008. Even today, the country\u2019s GDP has yet to return to pre-crash levels. At Le\u00f3n\u2019s local savings bank, Caja Espa\u00f1a, the board \u2013 many of them politicians, with Carrasco as vice-president \u2013 handed out risky loans to fellow directors in 2008, including the bank\u2019s president. When the loans were not repaid, the bank lost \u20ac60m. Had she lived, Carrasco would, like the rest of the board, now be under criminal investigation.</p> <p>Rather than take people to court, Carrasco built dossiers that gave her power over them. \u201cWhenever we broke a scandal in the paper, I would go to see her, and she would open a drawer full of files and say: \u2018Is that all you have on them? You don\u2019t know half of it,\u2019\u201d said her friend \u00c1ngela Dom\u00ednguez.</p> <p>Carrasco was also a formal suspect in the irregular hiring of 40 clerks who were given jobs for life at the <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em> in 2007, shortly after she arrived. Many of those handed the jobs \u2013 after getting such impossibly high marks in the exams that the local ombudsman concluded they must have seen the questions first \u2013 had links to politicians. The only surprising thing about the story was just how blatant the cheating seemed to be.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how <em>diputaci\u00f3nes</em> work in cities like Le\u00f3n,\u201d says Rosa Seijas, a temporary clerk who sat the exams and sued after failing to win a place. \u201cI remember the first time I worked there [as a temp], people kept asking me: \u2018Who do you belong to?\u2019\u201d The implication was that she owed her job to one of the local politicians.</p> <p>Rivera claimed the scandal of the 40 clerks, which was eventually thrown out of court on a technicality, caught the newly appointed Carrasco by surprise. She had regretted letting it go through and set about cleaning up the regional government. \u201cAll cronyism came to an end,\u201d he said. There were angry meetings at which Carrasco demanded to know who had put whom on the list. As Carrasco accumulated power, she made what Rivera calls \u201cintimate enemies\u201d inside her own party. She did not bargain or take prisoners. Le\u00f3n\u2019s power brokers never forgave her.</p> <p>Over time, her style became as bullying and confrontational as that of her worst male predecessors and rivals. She would bawl and swear at her subordinates, humiliate her staff in public and squash journalists or political rivals who dared challenge her. \u201cShe hated it if you got ahead of her,\u201d admitted Rivera. \u201cAnd she was rudest when she got lost on a subject.\u201d But that happened rarely, and she respected anyone who stood up to her. Friends found her loyal, but admit she could come across as hard and cold. \u201cShe didn\u2019t show affection or approval in a normal way,\u201d said Rivera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/woman-confesses-killing-spanish-politician-isabel-carrasco\">Woman 'confesses to killing Spanish politician Isabel Carrasco'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the province\u2019s villages \u2013 where she felt most at home, and to which she allocated significant public funds for infrastructure projects \u2013 people loved her. In the city, apart from among a group of faithful friends, Carrasco was increasingly feared and scorned, even by fellow members of her party. She did not build teams, because she distrusted people and thought she could do better by herself. She governed with imperious disdain, expecting others to rubber-stamp her decisions.</p> <p>She grew more and more paranoid about her enemies, both inside and outside the PP. She took on posts that previous <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>presidents had delegated to others \u2013 hence her \u201c12 jobs\u201d (she actually held 13), on the boards of local institutions or presiding over public-private consortia such as the city\u2019s airport and tourism board. Most had attendance pay or perks attached. Yet no one was ever able to pin corruption charges on Carrasco. For some, that is proof that, whatever her failings, she was first and foremost a dedicated public servant. Others claim she was simply too clever to get caught. At the time of her death, she was being investigated for only one alleged infraction \u2013 of claiming twice for mileage. By the standards of Spanish politics, that is a minor offence.</p> <p>Although her notoriety was concentrated within the province of Le\u00f3n, Carrasco\u2019s murder was headline news across Spain. A solemn funeral was held at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3n_Cathedral\">Le\u00f3n\u2019s 13th-century Santa Mar\u00eda cathedral</a>, known as the \u201chouse of light\u201d for its spectacular gothic stained-glass windows. Prime Minister Rajoy and his socialist predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jose-luis-zapatero\">Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero</a>, both of whom had lived in Le\u00f3n as children, were among the mourners. Jes\u00fas Ramos, an architect and one of Carrasco\u2019s most intimate friends, stood at the door awaiting the coffin. \u201cShe was one of the most honest and loyal people I have known,\u201d he told me. Her 33-year-old daughter, Loreto, and Carrasco\u2019s live-in boyfriend of over a decade, Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez, were inconsolable.</p> <p>Some days later, graffiti appeared on the concrete tiles of the footbridge, almost in the exact spot that had been stained by Carrasco\u2019s blood. \u201c<em>Aqu\u00ed muri\u00f3 un bicho</em>,\u201d it read. \u201cAn animal died here.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez and her daughter, Triana Mart\u00ednez, were unlikely murder suspects. Triana\u2019s father was a senior policeman. Her mother was a 58-year-old housewife who wore Hugo Boss and drove a Mercedes sports car. Slight and pale, Montserrat looked younger than her years. Both women were also members of the PP and had become familiar faces at party conferences, rallies and the annual Christmas dinners at the 16th-century monastery of San Marcos, which had been converted into Le\u00f3n\u2019s classiest hotel. Perhaps most shocking of all was that Triana had been one of Carrasco\u2019s protegees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2742f0a467d4800ce141124ca94c1d5f3c3f83d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2742f0a467d4800ce141124ca94c1d5f3c3f83d/0_0_4288_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez in court in January 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez in court in January 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Casares/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mother and daughter had always been close. \u201cThey are one and the same,\u201d said a friend, Julia Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cWhatever one thinks, the other one thinks. If Montserrat says something then Triana says: \u2018Exactly Mama, you\u2019re right.\u2019\u201d Friends joked that Triana\u2019s husband \u2013 when she found one \u2013 could expect to share his marriage bed with his mother-in-law.</p> <p>Montserrat\u2019s life had long revolved around Triana, who attended a private school and acquired a degree of small-town sophistication that her mother \u2013 raised in a country village \u2013 could never match. Triana Mart\u00ednez was a brilliant, if spoiled, schoolchild. \u201cShe always had top grades,\u201d her father, Pablo Mart\u00ednez, told me when we met in Gij\u00f3n, the Atlantic port city where Triana grew up.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez seems to have played a relatively minor role in Triana\u2019s childhood \u2013 either excluded by her tight bond with her mother or, as he told me, because he worked so hard. In 2003, he and Montserrat moved to Astorga, where he had been appointed police chief. He was delighted with the move, but Montserrat disliked the town. Local people thought she had delusions of grandeur. \u201cShe never greeted people in the street,\u201d said Jacinto Bardal, a local PP councillor.</p> <p>Triana had left home<strong> </strong>to study telecommunications engineering at university in Santander, 200 miles away, and when she did an Erasmus year at Ulm in southern Germany, her mother visited frequently. After graduation, Triana moved to Le\u00f3n, to the delight of her mother, who would eventually move into Triana\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>The pair shared a fascination with luxury that was mostly beyond their means, and could be seen together window-shopping, or trying perfumes and brand-name clothes. Montserrat acquired expensive bags and boots, though friends wondered where she got the money. One year, she and Triana took a holiday at Villa Padierna \u2013 a five-star spa hotel in Marbella which had hosted, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama\">Michelle Obama</a>. \u201cThey are fantasists, who want the finest things in life,\u201d said Julia Rodr\u00edguez, who went on holiday to Prague with them while Triana was a student, but found them more interested in their hotel and its little luxuries than the city.</p> <p>Triana had come to Le\u00f3n in search of a job. Spain\u2019s economy was still booming and in June 2007 she began working on telecommunications projects at the <a href=\"http://www.spain.info/en_GB/que-quieres/arte/monumentos/leon/palacio_de_los_guzmanes.html\">Palacio de los Guzmanes</a> \u2013 the<strong> </strong><em>diputaci\u00f3n</em><strong> </strong>headquarters, where visitors are greeted by a mounted medieval knight in armour. She had been given a contact by her friends in the PP, which helped her secure the first of a series of temporary contracts. Fellow workers remember her as cheerful and competent, if a little superior.</p> <p>When Isabel Carrasco took over as president the following month, she soon became Triana\u2019s friend and protector. She called Triana at all hours, even requiring her to go to her apartment to help install cable TV. Carrasco, in turn, used her influence at the tax office to resolve Montserrat\u2019s problems with her imported Mercedes.</p> <p>The ambitious young woman felt like Carrasco\u2019s protege and began to dream of two things. First, she wanted a job for life at the <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em>, of the kind enjoyed by established civil servants. A recent poll by the AXA Foundation showed that this is the career ambition for a quarter of Spanish students. Second, and against her father\u2019s wishes, Triana wanted a parallel career in politics. She was popular with senior PP officials and, since candidates for elections in Spain must find patrons to put them on the lists presented by each party, well-placed.</p> <p>By December 2009, Triana\u2019s future was looking bright. She was a PP candidate for councillor in Astorga, and that month Carrasco decided to turn her job into a permanent position. This required the <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>to set exams, which are obligatory for any permanent public job. Anyone could apply, but Triana expected the preferential treatment given to favourites.</p> <p>Suddenly, however, Carrasco and Triana fell out. Triana would later claim that this was the result of a scene allegedly played out on the sofa at Carrasco\u2019s apartment in January 2010. \u201cShe came up close to smell my perfume, and then she kissed me on the mouth \u2026 I was scared, but she tried to touch me and put her arm around me to stop me moving away,\u201d Triana testified later in court. \u201cI managed to get away and say that I was leaving.\u201d Carrasco\u2019s friends vigorously deny this. \u201cShe had no sexual interest in women,\u201d said Ramos.</p> <p>The two women also argued at work later that year, according to some witnesses, with Carrasco warning Triana that she could either be an ally or an enemy. When exams for the new job were finally held, Triana sent an urgent text message to Carrasco. \u201cSorry to bother you, but the exam is tomorrow and I need your help to pass,\u201d it read. In other words, she was asking for the exam questions \u2013 but there was no reply. Instead, a second candidate appeared from out of town and was supposedly seen wandering off with the examiner. Triana filmed them with her phone, but did not formally challenge the appointment when the job was handed to her rival. Like many other people, Montserrat was convinced that Carrasco had brought in another candidate with the intention of denying her daughter the job. It was early 2011; Spain had fallen into a catastrophic recession three years earlier and unemployment was now 24%. Triana was out of favour, and out of work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c038320216bb158e1fdc811163cfb03144ffddc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c038320216bb158e1fdc811163cfb03144ffddc2/0_0_3600_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Triana Mart\u00ednez during the trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Triana Mart\u00ednez during the trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Casares/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carrasco then pursued her daughter with blind hatred, Montserrat later claimed, blocking her attempt to take up a council seat in Astorga after another councillor resigned, demanding the return of \u20ac11,000 allegedly overpaid to Triana by the <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>and getting the tax office to send claims totalling \u20ac6,000. She was convinced Carrasco also prevented her daughter finding work elsewhere in the city.</p> <p>Triana became clinically depressed, and lost weight. Her father advised her to leave Le\u00f3n and take her skills elsewhere. \u201cBut she wanted to be near her mother,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was her priority.\u201d So Montserrat moved in with her daughter. Her husband, who stayed behind in Astorga, did not complain. He insists that his wife and daughter barely spoke to him about Carrasco. \u201cThat was something between the two of them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A year before the murder, Montserrat approached Carrasco at a party and called her a \u201cshameless daughter of a whore\u201d. \u201cWhat are you doing to my daughter?\u201d she demanded. The normally sweet-natured Triana had also lost her temper when told by local councillor Bardal that she could not stand as a PP candidate again. She and her father, she said, would make sure the PP lost the next local election. Carrasco complained that Triana was turning out to be \u201cwicked and rebellious, though the mother is worse\u201d. By this time, Montserrat had decided Carrasco had to die. \u201cIt was my daughter, or her,\u201d she said later. \u201cBad weeds must be torn out.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Police were under intense pressure to solve one of Spain\u2019s most shocking recent murders quickly and efficiently. The victim was a senior politician from the country\u2019s ruling party and television news shows \u2013 enjoying a respite from corruption scandals and unemployment \u2013 were speculating wildly. The alleged perpetrators, meanwhile, were part of the wider police family and needed careful treatment. Le\u00f3n was not used to being at the centre of national events. It had a force of experienced investigators headed by the capable new <em>comisaria provincial</em>, Mar\u00eda Marcos \u2013 but two veteran detectives were also sent from the bigger city of Burgos. It was they who interviewed Montserrat and Triana the following morning.</p> <p>The footbridge and the spot where Montserrat had been arrested were only 500 metres apart, yet trawling through rubbish bins and dredging the river bed produced nothing. All they had was Mielgo\u2019s eyewitness report and, in the boot of the Mercedes, they had found a Hugo Boss parka that resembled the one seen on the murderer.</p> <p>The evidence, however, soon built up against Montserrat. A search of the Le\u00f3n apartment revealed that she owned a small pistol \u2013 not the one used in the crime \u2013 and an array of ammunition, including .32 calibre bullets. She also had two-thirds of a kilo of marijuana. A photograph found on a laptop showed a smiling Montserrat and her daughter beside a towering cannabis plant. This was one of several that grew beside the chicken run in her own mother\u2019s village backyard. The police chief\u2019s wife, it turned out, was an enthusiastic consumer and cultivator of cannabis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The murder had been committed at one of the most dramatic spots in the city. It was like a ceremonial killing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It did not take long for Montserrat to confess. She must have known, in any case, that forensic tests would prove that she had recently fired a weapon. She had acted alone and out of hatred, she claimed. She would explain everything if they promised to release her daughter.</p> <p>Montserrat claimed that she had heard many tales from her husband about the Gij\u00f3n underworld and that she knew where to get hold of a pistol in that city. She had bought one from a drug trafficker and rapist who, conveniently, had since been murdered. She had been trying to kill Carrasco for more than a year, frequently waiting outside her apartment building with a pistol in her pocket, but had stopped after a neighbour became suspicious and confronted her. On the day of the murder, she had walked past the building again and, she said, got lucky. Carrasco was, unusually, on her own. They knew the rest. And she was not sorry.</p> <p>The murder weapon was finally discovered late on the day after the crime. A 39-year-old municipal police officer, Raquel Gago, rang a colleague to say she had seen a suspicious bag hidden among the mess on the back seat of her own car. It must have been placed there, she said, by Triana Mart\u00ednez. Inside the bag, police found a snub-nosed .32 calibre Taurus pistol with its identity numbers filed off.</p> <p>Gago was, apart from Montserrat, Triana\u2019s best friend. She had stopped by their flat for coffee after lunch on the day of the murder. The policewoman had seen her friend again some 10 minutes after the shooting, when Triana walked past her as she chatted to a traffic warden beside her parked Volkswagen Golf. Triana had asked if she could leave something in the car while she went to buy fruit, but never came back.</p> <p>Police began to suspect that Montserrat had had an accomplice as she plotted what was meant to be a perfect crime: her own daughter. Triana now had to explain how she got hold of the weapon \u2013 and disposed of it \u2013 so quickly.</p> <p>Triana told investigators that she thought she had quashed her mother\u2019s fantasy of killing Carrasco long before. On the day of the murder her mother had called her, hysterical, saying she had sighted Carrasco and planned to shoot her. Triana had told her to stop and then ran towards the bridge. She arrived in time to see her mother walking back into town and throwing a bag down the garage ramp of an apartment block. They did not speak, but Triana realised that the bag might contain a gun, and so retrieved it. She had then bumped into Gago, put it in her car and gone on to find her mother being arrested.</p> <p>\u201cThat was when she called me,\u201d her father \u2013 an outwardly modest, conservative man with a policeman\u2019s trademark inscrutability \u2013 told me later. \u201cIt was like being immersed in cold water and then having an electric charge shot through me.\u201d Lying to protect your own family \u2013 even in a court of law \u2013 is not a crime in Spain. Triana claimed that, believing her mother had used her father\u2019s gun, she had lied in order to protect both her parents.</p> <p>Investigators were not convinced. They had found a search for pistols on Triana\u2019s laptop and notebook jottings on guns that were for sale in her handwriting. Even Gago\u2019s story did not add up. Why had it taken her 30 hours to report that the murder suspect had placed something in her car? The case was strange enough already, but when the police officer was formally accused of conspiracy, it become even more bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18dafc705af9e3620e84ace6f681d8a32e714a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18dafc705af9e3620e84ace6f681d8a32e714a62/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrasco\u2019s funeral in the Santa Mar\u00eda cathedral in Le\u00f3n, May 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrasco\u2019s funeral in the Santa Mar\u00eda cathedral in Le\u00f3n, May 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Montserrat claimed the police had promised that, if she confessed, her daughter could walk free. But that did not happen. By the time mother and daughter went to trial for murder in Le\u00f3n\u2019s central court in January 2016 \u2013 with snow on the hills and a damp, penetrating chill on the streets \u2013 both women had spent 20 months on remand in jail. (Gago, facing the same charges, had been bailed.)</p> <p>Formally, the nine-person jury had to decide on the guilt or innocence of the three women (with Montserrat now claiming temporary insanity). But the victim\u2019s own guilt was also being debated, with public opinion as the jury. Le\u00f3n itself had already turned its back on Carrasco. Few people attended the events commemorating the first anniversary of her death. The local PP, now run by what Rivera called her \u201cintimate enemies\u201d, tried to pretend that she never existed. \u201cDuring her life she provoked terror and panic,\u201d explained Susana Mart\u00edn, a local journalist who interviewed Montserrat and Triana in jail. \u201cBut now she still provokes fear.\u201d</p> <p>Both mother and daughter appeared convinced that Triana would be found not guilty. They were wrong. The judge gave Montserrat and Triana sentences of 22 and 20 years, but when Mart\u00edn visited them in prison a few months later they had not lost their capacity for fantasy. They were sure that Triana would be released on appeal, and even asked the journalist to wait to take photographs until then. \u201cI am an engineer,\u201d Triana scoffed. \u201cWhat kind of a genius plans a murder in the middle of Le\u00f3n at five in the afternoon?\u201d Yet that appeal failed and, like Gago (who was deemed an accomplice and handed a 12-year sentence), they now await a final supreme court decision. Montserrat, who is also appealing, remains unrepentant. \u201cI just want to get out so I can tell everyone the truth about Carrasco,\u201d she told Mart\u00edn.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s first Twitter hate-crime arrest was that of a 19-year-old student in Valencia who greeted Carrasco\u2019s death with the tweet: \u201cThat\u2019s the way! Kill them all.\u201d The applause that greeted the murder in certain quarters owed much to the mindset of Spaniards who were fed up with politicians lining their pockets while they themselves scrabbled for jobs, had homes repossessed or coped with dramatic falls in income, according to \u00c1ngela Dom\u00ednguez. Carrasco\u2019s tyrannical reputation \u2013 and the corruption rumours \u2013 had helped make her a target. \u201cPart of society saw it as an almost necessary ritual,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a shared responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Although people in Le\u00f3n complained privately about Carrasco, few had dared to confront her. Perhaps they feared that, without a pistol in their hand, they were always bound to lose. Rosa Seijas, who sued over the fixed exam system, sees a cowed society that has accepted cronyism as inevitable. \u201cEveryone complains, but nobody does anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just say that this is the way things work. In fact, all they want is to find a way to get their own offspring a civil service job.\u201d Carrasco\u2019s architect friend, Jes\u00fas Ramos, says that the poisoned atmosphere in Le\u00f3n reflected what he calls Spain\u2019s \u201cfamilist\u201d society \u2013 where a weak welfare state provides no real safety net. \u201cHere, your family looks after you,\u201d he said. That makes cronyism inevitable, even virtuous. In this case, it primed a mother to kill.</p> <p>The woman who pulled the trigger, however, acted out of revenge for her daughter, hurt pride and frustrated grandeur \u2013 not from moral or political indignation. After all, her daughter\u2019s desire to land a job for life, funded by taxpayers, through rigged exams was a further example of corruption. An assassin who drives a Mercedes and wears Hugo Boss does not represent the jobless rage of Spain\u2019s new poor. If anything, she represents a society where the corrupt distribution of public wealth is so widespread that some feel they have a right to demand their share \u2013 and, in this case, if they do not get it, a right to kill for it.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the Long Read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism like the Long Read is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

Legal and ethics experts contacted by the Associated Press said the government lobbyist should be subject to the same ethics rules as rank-and-file state employees, which generally prohibit such double-dipping. A separate prohibition against moonlighting bans Indiana state employees from accepting outside employment or undertaking activities that are not compatible with their public duties, would impair their independence or judgment, or pose a likely conflict of interest.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said Pitcock is exempt from most such rules because the Pence administration treats Pitcock as an independent contractor. It considers his contract for \u201cprofessional services\u201d different than contracts for \u201cpersonal\u201d services, which treat contractors as employees.</p> <p>Pence defended the arrangement late Wednesday. \u201cThe arrangement that the state of Indiana has with a firm in Washington DC has been a great, great success for our state,\u201d he told television station KDVR in Denver in an interview. \u201cThat individual and his team have worked very effectively advocating Indiana\u2019s interest. But it\u2019s an individual firm, an individual contractor.\u201d</p> <p>Pence said there was no conflict of interest. \u201cHe\u2019s not a state employee and so he\u2019s entitled to have other clients and I\u2019m grateful to have his support and assistance for the state of Indiana,\u201d he said in the interview.</p> <p>Pitcock continues to collect monthly lobbying fees \u2013 a total of nearly $1m since Pence won election in 2012 and took office in 2013. Since August, after Pitcock also began working as Pence\u2019s policy director for the election, Trump\u2019s campaign has paid Pitcock\u2019s firm $32,374 for event consulting, according to the latest financial records from the Federal Election Commission. Pitcock told AP that he refunded to Trump\u2019s campaign $15,612, which he described as an overpayment caused by an accounting error.</p> <p>Pitcock said he was working diligently for both his employers and there was no conflict or violation of state employment rules.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy firm has a contract with the state of Indiana to perform certain duties related to federal affairs, including lobbying,\u201d Pitcock said in a statement. \u201cThose duties have been and continue to be performed fully and completely. I am not a state employee. My firm\u2019s contract with the state does not preclude working with other clients.</p> <p>\u201cThe Donald J Trump for President campaign engaged my firm for services related to federal policy for the vice-presidential nominee. There is no conflict in performing services for both clients.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581aa0c7e4b0d073c27d0e50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T02:28:37.238Z\">2.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Perhaps the Trump hotels are all booked out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/status/793999972840521728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump campaign announces they&#39;ll hold &quot;victory party&quot; on election night at...

An <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average of six different polls</a> shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But there\u2019s still a lot of variation \u2013 one poll finds that Clinton is three points ahead, another finds that she is six points <em>behind </em>Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to Clinton\u2019s emails, before which her lead was already shrinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df/0_101_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That variation between polls isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, includes one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">19-year-old black male</a> respondent who consistently said he\u2019ll vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">weighting</a> (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters).</p> <p>So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? Historically, the answer is \u201cnot bad\u201d, although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton\u2019s email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an \u201c<a href=\"http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/\">October surprise</a>\u201d, a last-minute news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html\">which have included Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 2000</a> \u2013 typically don\u2019t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the morning of with the final voting outcome.</p> <p>The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn\u2019t just ABC and the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win \u2013 polling averages also showed the Republican <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/\">three points</a> ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular vote, that\u2019s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=2000\">48.4%-47.9%</a>. Bush ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in his favour \u2013 he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are needed to win).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/election-polls-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-october-surprise\">Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls \u2013 but will it affect election day?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a672ce4b07ceadb3a1cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicky-woolf\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T22:23:12.872Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A white nationalist has apologized for robocalls in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah\">Utah</a> calling independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin a \u201ccloset homosexual\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c/0_0_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan McMullin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evan McMullin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>William Daniel Johnson is a Los Angeles-based lawyer and self-described white nationalist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">originally meant to be a delegate for Donald Trump</a> at the Republican national convention.</p> <p>On Monday, Johnson announced that he was putting out an automated call to Utah voters attacking McMullin, an independent conservative candidate who has become the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/independent-presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-leads-in-utah--new-poll.html\">unexpected frontrunner</a> in the heavily Mormon state, according to recent polls.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is William Johnson.

It was the highest-rated Game 6 since the New York Yankees\u2019 2009 clincher against Philadelphia drew a 13.4/22 and the most-watched since Cleveland\u2019s win at Florida in 1997 was seen by 23.7 million.</p> <p>The game drew 425,000 for Spanish-language coverage on Fox Deportes and 151,000 for digital coverage on Fox Sports Go, for a total audience of 24 million.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Series entered Game 7 averaging an 11.3/20 and 20 million viewers, the most watched since Boston\u2019s four-game sweep of St. Louis in 2004.</p> <p>The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a program, and the share is the percentage showing a broadcast among those homes with TVs on at the time.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a79cee4b0d073c27d0dd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:45:15.622Z\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Email</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a little numerology from reader Mark Wagner.

Remember Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 of the NLDS coming out of the bullpen to get the last two outs of the clinching game for the Dodgers? It feels like about four months ago. Both managers tonight have that same dilemma but in different ways.</p> <p>Cleveland\u2019s Terry Francona has a reasonably-rested ace reliever Andrew Miller to use tonight if he needs. Francona gave no indication about how long he will pitch Miller \u2013 if at all \u2013 but he talked about how he has brought Miller into games in the fifth inning in the past and left open the idea that he would again in this game.</p> <p>Cubs manager Joe Maddon talked to Game 5 starter Jon Lester after last night\u2019s game and suggested that Lester could pitch at least an inning or two if the Cubs needed him.</p> <p>\u201cJon\u2019s able,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put him into a dirty inning, I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate. But being that it\u2019s on his regular workout day, he\u2019s probably got a solid two in him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Maddon also said he did not regret using his closer Aroldis Chapman for long stretches in the last two games, potentially weakening Chapman\u2019s effectiveness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about winning now,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cYesterday that was a real clear-cut decision for me, how to work (the 7<sup>th</sup> inning when Chapman came in) the threat there was that had we not done it then Aroldis would have had a mores stressful 1- 1 2/3 innings in the eighth and ninth.\u201d</p> <p>END - David here again...</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting about Lester - and remember, his entering the game also means a switch at catcher, a move that means less in the American League. David Ross has caught all but three of Lester\u2019s innings this season. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:43:21.517Z\">at 11.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581a777ee4b07ceadb3a1d00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:38:15.282Z\">11.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tito Francona</strong></p> <p>He is one of the more successful big game managers in recent history, and tonight, he\u2019ll have the luxury of a reasonably rested big-game bullpen. The airwaves were buzzing all day long about a possible formula for Francona - four innings from starter Corey Kluber, three from Andrew Miller and two from Allen. That\u2019s a best case scenario of course, and is likely if the Indians manage to get on top of Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. </p> <p>Just a quick note about his benching of Tyler Naquin - in an era of cagey coaches and managers, it was refreshing to hear his candid comments, where he said that he was \u201cpressing a little bit. During the regular season you might kind of let him get through it, but with one game left and with [Corey] Kluber pitching, we\u2019re trying to put a premium on catching the ball.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s just Tito, a tremendous managerial talent, who also is also cool enough let the world in on how he fell asleep eating pretzels and peanut butter last night, waking up now and then to take another bite. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a70a2e4b0d073c27d0db9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:18:32.697Z\">11.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A big night ahead...</strong></p> <p>David Lengel here...</p> <p>If a certain iconic baseball broadcaster were writing this live blog, perhaps he would start off with \u201cHello everybody and a very pleasant evening to you wherever you may be.\u201d </p> <p>And actually, it\u2019s much more than a pleasant evening, or morning or afternoon for baseball fans, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re about an hour away from what is unquestionably the most highly anticipated finish to a season in recent memory. </p> <p>Personally speaking, I\u2019ve been jumping out of my skin all day long waiting for first pitch, waiting to watch what happens right along with what will be a mammoth global baseball audience. </p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps less pleasant for fans of the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians: their supporters have been tortured for decades, and are agonizing about what may or may not happen right up until the very end of one of their age-old title droughts.

I think that we\u2019ve all really enjoyed ourselves. I think we can take a lot from the way we approached it, and not treating it more than just each game is another game and trying to go out and win that day. Not trying to look too far ahead or things like that. I think there\u2019s value to taking that approach throughout the course of a season, too.</p> <p><strong>For years and years, the regular routine was to have starters pitch on three days\u2019 rest, and then in seven days it became four days. For you, what is the difference now that you\u2019ve come back once on three days and might do it again tomorrow?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I mean, I guess for me personally I spend a little more time doing the different methods of recovery and stuff like that that we have available to us.</p> <p>But I still get in the same amount of work in between, it\u2019s just a little bit more condensed. I haven\u2019t, for me personally, I haven\u2019t found much of a difference yet in the way I feel when I go out there on three days\u2019 rest as opposed to four. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just doing the extra recovery stuff to where you get as close to normal as you can possibly get. But that\u2019s really the only difference for me is spending more time trying to recover on those three days instead of having four days to do it.</p> <p><strong>All season long you knew when you were going to pitch, and tomorrow obviously you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to pitch. So what is your mental frame thinking about tomorrow as of right now?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I mean, doing all my work in between the last start, and if it gets to tomorrow, that start. In doing all my work it was the same trying to get myself prepared. I\u2019ll be rooting as hard as anybody for us to win tonight. But I think that my mindset was I\u2019d rather be prepared and not have to pitch than try to will us to not get to a Game 7 and then not be ready when it comes.</p> <h2>Kyle Hendricks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3934c814c91622ae71377a6f490547d04e7400a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3934c814c91622ae71377a6f490547d04e7400a5/0_0_4096_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"557\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kyle, knock on wood, there\u2019s a Game 7 for you tomorrow, what would it mean? It\u2019s the ultimate in baseball to pitch a Game 7.</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: Exactly, this is the ultimate dream. You dream of getting to the World Series, winning the World Series. When you\u2019re out in your backyard as a kid, playing Little League at the field with your friends, this is the moment you dream about, Game 7, 3-2, two outs, something like that, bottom of the 9th. But it\u2019s always Game 7 of the World Series.</p> <p>So when we get there tomorrow, I\u2019m just going to embrace the opportunity like I have the rest of this postseason, honestly. Approach it like any other game, simple thoughts, the same old thing.</p> <p><strong>You have a guy on your team who won a Game 7 in 2002 and won a Game 6 three years ago in John Lackey. Has he imparted any wisdom on you about how to handle tomorrow?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: Not particularly in regards to tomorrow, but I\u2019ve learned so much from John already. I think the way he approaches every single game, you know, I think that\u2019s what prepares him for those big games and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned watching him, and I\u2019ve tried to implement some of that into my routine, just taking that same ruthless approach, every day, every single start, even the regular season. So that when you get to these big moments, it\u2019s basically like it has been the whole year, I think.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your take on a team having a guy starting games 1, 4, and 7 and Kluber in particular?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: You know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many guys that could do it to start, so obviously he\u2019s a special guy. But Kluber, you can just see it. The way he takes to the mound, he\u2019s always locked in.
