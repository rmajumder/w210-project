  "<p>Reno police are investigating reports of a pickup truck plowing into a group of Native American rights demonstrators after dramatic video emerged showing the vehicle\u2019s occupants arguing with activists, revving the engine and then speeding into the crowd. </p> <p>Police chief Jason Soto said the 18-year-old male pickup driver and 17-year-old passenger contacted police three minutes after Monday evening\u2019s incident beneath the famous arch with the Nevada city\u2019s slogan, Biggest Little City in the World. The driver stopped several blocks away, and both he and a passenger in the truck are said to be cooperating with police.</p> <p>A 59-year-old woman has been hospitalized with injuries that are not life-threatening, and three others were hurt. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Police say about 40 people were blocking Virginia Street in front of the city\u2019s famous arch on Monday night. A Facebook Live video of the protest shows a pickup truck revving its engine in front of the crowd. Several protesters confront the driver and the passenger before the truck drives through the crowd. </p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/SNCYc8MzKR4?t=62\">Footage</a> obtained by the Associated Press shows a group of protesters surrounding the truck, including a person holding a baby. Some were shouting \u201cStand your ground\u201d as protesters explained to the driver that the vehicle had to go in a different direction. </p> <p>One man shouted \u201cHey, hey, hey\u201d as the driver sped ahead, causing many in the crowd to scream as some appear to be knocked over. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Quanah Brightman, executive director of United Native Americans Inc, told the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rgj.com/story/news/crime/2016/10/10/driver-plows-through-reno-protesters-under-arch/91883894/\">Reno Gazette-Journal</a> the incident was a \u201chate crime\u201d. </p> <p>Soto said investigators were still combing through a great deal of video that witnesses shot mostly on cellular phones. He is urging others to come forward with any video or photographs they might have.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Soto would not say on Tuesday whether the case is being investigated as a hate crime but described some of the footage as \u201cvery horrifying\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The driver was not immediately arrested after the Monday evening incident. </p> <p>\u201cThey drove by once as we were walking toward the arch, yelling obscenities,\u201d said Taylor Wayman, 27, who said he was not an official member of the sponsoring groups but decided to attend the rally.</p> <p>\u201cI heard the driver ask one of the protesters, \u2018Do you want me to kill your homies?\u2019 and that really set everybody off,\u201d Wayman told the Associated Press on Tuesday. </p> <p>Mike Graham, founder of the Oklahoma-based United Native American Association, which held the rally, said he planned to meet with Reno police on Tuesday to find out more about the incident and why the driver has not been arrested. </p> <p>The activists were protesting about Columbus Day and some held signs criticizing the Dakota Access Pipeline, a project that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-judge-denies-construction\">poses a threat</a> to its water supply and could damage its cultural heritage in North Dakota.</p> <p>Reno\u2019s mayor, Hillary Schieve, said in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reno.gov/Home/Components/News/News/15913/576\">statement</a> on Tuesday: \u201cThis incident is troublesome and saddens us deeply. I take these matters very seriously, and I believe they must be investigated thoroughly and promptly.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband\u2019s former vice-president Al Gore to urge America\u2019s voters not to risk sending a \u201cclimate change denier\u201d to the White House.</p> <p>In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">hoax initiated by the Chinese</a>.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is real, it\u2019s urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it,\u201d Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.</p> <p>\u201cWe can transform our economy, we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet. Just remember what is at stake. My opponent is a guy who denies science, who denies climate change every day.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it was Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/\">less than 500 votes</a> in Florida, who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign, and why he believes Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"597bdc1dc9bd1998dc47a43e38a4e515457ddaf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/597bdc1dc9bd1998dc47a43e38a4e515457ddaf2/0_120_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Al Gore campaigning in 1999.

Instead, she stuck steadfastly to themes of climate change and her policy proposals to \u201caccelerate the transition\u201d towards clean energy in the US.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see 500 million more solar panels installed in America by the end of my first term,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s generate enough clean energy to power America.\u201d</p> <p>Building more energy-efficient buildings and cutting the country\u2019s reliance on oil by one-third would also bring massive economic benefits, the Democratic candidate said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do all of this and create millions of good paying jobs as we do. The clean energy solutions are being created right here in America. And while we do that, make sure communities are ready for the effects of climate change that are coming right at us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That comment referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/hurricane-matthew-death-toll-shooting-north-carolina-florida-georgia\">the recent impact of Hurricane Matthew</a> on the Caribbean, where the storm killed hundreds, and in the US, which has seen more than 30 deaths, most of them in North Carolina, which is still suffering from significant flooding.</p> <p>Gore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/12/climatechange.internationalnews\">who won the 2007 Nobel peace prize</a> for his efforts to tackle manmade climate change, highlighted in his movie An Inconvenient Truth, blamed the severity of recent hurricanes on global warming.</p> <p>\u201cMatthew went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours, and that\u2019s unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Nowhere are the effects of global warming more evident than Florida, Gore said. </p> <p>Just yesterday there were six more cases of Zika in Miami-Dade County. Changing climate conditions shift the places where these diseases become endemic. Mosquitoes incubate faster and bite more often.</p> <p>\u201cThese and many other consequences are really wake-up calls for us.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, too, referenced the threat to Florida, a key swing state. \u201cThe impact of climate change goes beyond severe events like hurricanes, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article70145652.html\">it\u2019s a daily reality in Miami</a>. In streets in Miami the ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. If you need proof climate change is real, there you go,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She warned: \u201cAt the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century.\u201d</p> <p>Global warming, she said, had also been cited by the Pentagon as a threat to national security, posing as an example flooding at the US navy base in Norfolk, Virginia, affecting the operations and readiness of the service.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford a candidate who doesn\u2019t accept climate change,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our security.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a president who believes in science and can lead America in fighting this threat, creating jobs and, yes, saving our planet.\u201d</p> <p>The final word, however, belonged to Gore, who Clinton said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait\u201d to have as a White House adviser on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans have the ability to bring about such a big and important change, the will to change and build a brighter future is itself a renewable resource,\u201d he said, drawing a loud: \u201cThat\u2019s a great line, I love that!\u201d from Clinton beside him.</p>",

As with much else, Cookson was left to deal with the consequences. It is rapidly becoming apparent that any honeymoon is long since over. Where we may have expected leadership and transparency after the questions raised by the recent Fancy Bears hack, there has been only silence and more questions.</p> <p>For almost three weeks Cookson felt unable to respond to the furious debate that was raging about the ethics of TUE applications and the extent to which certain teams and riders may have pushed the limits of the existing rules.</p> <p>In Doha, Cycling News caught up with him. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, as far as I can see, that no rules have been broken here. If the rules have been followed and applied, that\u2019s the end of the matter, in effect,\u201d Cookson said, before adding that perhaps there could be a longer\u2011term debate over the rules but only if the World Anti-Doping Agency agreed.</p> <p>It was too little, too late. Cookson, a softly spoken Lancastrian who insists he is mending cycling\u2019s broken culture by consensus rather than conflict, was not so reticent when he was asked about the issue in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should take note of what is being told us by CIRC [the Cycling Independent Reform Commission]in respect of cortisone and potentially other medical and quasi-medical abuses,\u201d he told CyclingTips then. \u201cAgain, this ties up with our ethical processes and so on.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cI am anxious to look at the TUE regulations, for instance. TUEs are allowed under the Wada Code, as you know. If we have a set of particular circumstances that are facilitating the use of substances which are in the rules but perhaps ethically challenging, then I think we ought to try to exceed the Wada Code if we can.\u201d</p> <p>When asked in 2016 whether the TUE system should be looked at again, the UCI could only respond: \u201cThe management of therapeutic use exemptions in cycling is robust and fully safeguarded.\u201d It also indicated it would not be looking into past cases.</p> <p>Go back a little further to the interviews he gave before winning the top job in a closely fought and brutal contest and Cookson boasts of being instrumental in the setting up of Team&#xa0;Sky. \u201cWe had a very strong anti-doping ethos and a no-needles policy at British Cycling for 25 years. One of the things I wrote into Dave Brailsford\u2019s contract was that we should seek to develop our own professional team. OK, there have been some mistakes made with recruitment but, by and large, people have confidence in Team Sky,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/17/head-british-cycling-brian-cookson\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian then</a>.</p> <p>Until 2013 Cookson was not only president of British Cycling but also on the supervisory board that oversaw the new professional team, along with the current British Cycling chief executive, Ian Drake. None of this is to imply that he has dealt with the issue anything other than properly.</p> <p>But in not coming out strongly and considering whether that there has been a longstanding problem with the TUE system and other related issues around the use of substances that are not on the banned list but do confer an advantage \u2013 as many in the sport believe \u2013 he has allowed suspicion and cynicism to&#xa0;fester.</p> <p>On taking office, one of the first things that Cookson did was establish the Cycling Independent Reform Commission process. Raised from the ashes of the shambolic attempts at \u201ctruth and reconciliation\u201d that had gone before under McQuaid, the CIRC report was a serious attempt to come to terms with what had gone before.</p> <p>That CIRC report was at the time hailed as a brave new dawn for the sport when it was published in March 2015. A chance to face its troubled past in the face and confront its demons. It had some interesting things to say about the TUE system.</p> <p>\u201cOne team doctor stated that he believed the TUE system had been regularly abused, particularly as previously mentioned, in the area of corticoids. Today there appears to be concern among riders about the way in which TUEs are used for corticoids and insulin in particular, and the extent to which they are being abused,\u201d it said. One rider put the number of applications seeking to gain an advantage at an extraordinary 90%.</p> <p>In that Guardian interview before he became UCI president for a four year term that he will look to renew in 2017, Cookson also said: \u201cIf I look back at all of the history every time there has been an opportunity for something positive to have been done about doping in cycling it\u2019s been fudged. On every occasion when there\u2019s been an opportunity to do something about this and a real need to do something about it, the UCI has fudged it and lost the plot.\u201d</p> <p>Three years on, he must prove that he is not going to repeat those mistakes.

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook.

In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse.

First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad.

And he was trounced by Hillary Clinton not least with her catalogue of things done \u2013 from 9/11 reconstruction, to improved child adoption and 400 bills carrying her name. The&#xa0;pitiful Donald Trump must, we hope, rediscover something more meaningful within himself so that after this humiliating experience (and he will be humiliated) he can live comfortably with the children Clinton had good cause to praise. <br><strong>Ian Flintoff</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am appalled to see that three women who claim they were assaulted by Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\" title=\"\">are prepared to stand alongside Donald Trump</a>. It is about time that decent Republicans disowned him (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\" title=\"\">Top&#xa0;Republican turns back on Trump as outrage intensifies</a>, 11 October). I wonder what took them so long? Right from the start, even before Trump was nominated, they knew he was an arrogant and nasty person, so why did they let him get this far? They weren\u2019t blinded by all his (untaxed) money were they?</p> <p>But we must all be worried that even now, after his vileness has been repeatedly exposed, Hillary Clinton only just has a double-digit lead over him, and two-thirds of those polled thought Trump did better than expected in Sunday\u2019s \u201cdebate\u201d. It&#xa0;may be \u201clocker-room talk\u201d, but it\u2019s OK by many of his supporters, Nigel Farage included. Too many alpha males, not enough intelligence or decency.<br><strong>David Reed</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 With reference to your article \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/trumps-banter-what-is-locker-room-chat-really-like\" title=\"\">What is locker room \u2018banter\u2019 really like?</a>\u201d (Shortcuts, G2, 11 October), I would suggest that the damning evidence isn\u2019t to be found in the locker rooms of professional sportsmen \u2013 by definition achievers in their particular fields. The Trumpish attitudes will more likely be found in those last bastions of resistance to female members, ethnicities other than white and resenters of the disabled for having to waste money building those pesky wheelchair ramps into the clubhouse (I have heard this one first-hand). That is, the golf clubs. This is the environment where the various Trumpers are most likely to be found, festering away with their amateur ability levels and disliking the intrusion of anyone who isn\u2019t of the tribe. And no prizes for guessing the sports environment Trump is most familiar with.<br><strong>Clint Backhouse </strong><br><em>Carlisle </em></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-presidential-debate-trumps-anger-against-women\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (11 October), which says that \u201cRarely \u2026 can the \u2026 debate have been so low, so dark, so personal and so damaging as \u2026 in the US race\u201d, has clearly forgotten <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rove\" title=\"\">Karl Rove</a>, the prince of darkness and innuendo. In 2004, John Kerry\u2019s campaign was derailed by a smear operation said to have been orchestrated by Rove. Similarly, in 2014 Rove said of Hilary Clinton: \u201c<a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/05/19/real-cause-for-worry-facts-on-hillarys-concussion/\" title=\"\">Thirty days in the hospital?

Thus Al Gore fudged the truth; John Kerry was an elitist; Barack Obama wasn\u2019t fully American and Mitt Romney didn\u2019t care about ordinary people. Once public suspicion about opponents is kindled, it\u2019s easy to keep throwing logs on the fire.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is abundantly clear to anyone not invested in the Republican party that it should be preparing for a much-needed split. Parliamentary parties form voting coalitions after their elections; in the US we form them before. How else can we describe the GOP but as an increasingly untenable coalition between a socially moderate party of business and high income, and a socially hard right, religiously oriented party that has now revealed itself to be far less inclined to business and wealthy interests than we had thought.</p> <p>These two wings \u2013 call them the Trump and the Ryan parties \u2013 should stand for election on their own terms and, once elected, form voting coalitions with each other or the Democrats as they see fit on each issue.

When he meets Arianne Zucker | Jessica Valenti</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been queasy all day, Donald (I\u2019ve heard you hate being addressed by your first name, but hey, it\u2019s just words, right?). I know what it feels like to have a man seize my body against my will. To know that you think that makes him more of a man makes me literally sick. I have so many friends who are also survivors. We\u2019re all sick from this, Donald. You say you want to make us safe, but your words are hurting us.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe you when you say you didn\u2019t do the things you bragged about. You\u2019ve demonstrated a jaw-dropping willingness to lie about even observable facts, like whether you said climate change was a Chinese hoax (you did), and whether you supported the invasion of Iraq (you did that, too). </p> <p>Men who boast about hurting women have a sense that their own masculinity is so fragile it can be shattered by a light breeze. Or a strong sniff. Men who boast about hurting women don\u2019t often even recognize that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, because they see women as instruments for male pleasure and power, not as fully independent human beings. Anything but that. </p> <p>Let me tell you about an experience I just had. I was sitting in a window seat on a flight last night, literally writing this to you. The man next to me had been drinking and agitated the whole flight. With about an hour to go, he offered me some Tic Tacs. (I know, but he really did.) </p> <p>When I politely declined, he said, \u201cOnly two or three of them are roofies, so you\u2019re probably OK.\u201d I recoiled and turned away. But he wasn\u2019t done. \u201cYou\u2019re not very friendly, are you?\u201d Staring at the seat back in front of me, I told him I just didn\u2019t appreciate rape jokes. That\u2019s when he got belligerent and defensive. And I fly coach, Donald. He was close enough that our legs sometimes touched accidentally. I trembled in my seat the rest of the flight, frantically planning for what I would do if he followed me out of the airport. </p> <p>Let me tell you about the experience of a friend of mine. Some years ago, a man she was doing business with put his hands down her pants. She told another man, a colleague, and he waved it away \u2013 this guy was just like that. She struggles to call what the man did to her \u201cassault\u201d because she thinks if she says the word out loud, people will tell her she\u2019s overreacting. </p> <p>Your words confirmed that her fear is true. You confirmed to the man who grabbed her that he should keep violating women. Your \u201clocker room talk\u201d told that man on my flight he could threaten to drug me while I was physically trapped by him, and expect it to be treated like a joke. You told me my safety, my trauma, my right to my own body is a joke.</p> <p>Words matter. Choosing to speak is an action. You made the decision to speak those words. Billy Bush made the decision to laugh along. When you treat pussy-grabbing as a masculinity merit badge, you\u2019re telling men that sexual assault is fine with you. That hurting women is something to brag about. </p> <p>You\u2019re also telling judges and juries, cops and prosecutors that they shouldn\u2019t bother taking sexual violations seriously. Rape is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=240972\">already</a> vastly under-reported and under-prosecuted. Your words just helped it stay that way.

  "<p>We British are a sorry lot. Our apology-addiction is a point of national pride and one area in which we have always outstripped the rest of the world. According to a recent YouGov poll, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/07/01/oh-sorry-do-british-people-apologise-too-much/\" title=\"\">Brits say sorry up to 50% more than Americans</a>. But for a couple of hours on Sunday night, the contrition tables turned. As the presidential election moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">from debate to debacle</a>, Americans flocked to Twitter to apologise to the world for Donald Trump. A parody Jill Biden account, for example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JillBidenVeep/status/785288664255434752\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSorry, rest of the World. We\u2019re embarrassed too. #debate\u201d, and got 45,000 likes.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long, however, before the UK was apologising back to the US about Nigel Farage. As if Trump hadn\u2019t ruined our Sunday evening enough, you see, the outgoing leader of Ukip decided to continue the damage. Farage appeared in the spin room following the debate to praise Trump\u2019s performance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\" title=\"\">Likening Trump to a silverback gorilla</a>, Farage said: \u201cHe looked like a big gorilla prowling the set. He is that big alpha male \u2013 that\u2019s who he is.\u201d At the end of this soliloquy, a bewildered reporter inquired, <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/please-read-this-incredibly-horny-description-of-donald-1787618973\" title=\"\">\u201cSir, can I just ask: what are you doing here?\u201d</a></p> <p>The short answer to this is: continuing the damage. If Trump is a gorilla, then Farage is, as memorably described by the actor Christoph Waltz, \u201cthe head rat leaving the sinking ship\u201d. Having \u201cliberated\u201d Britain, Farage was quick to remove himself from the actual work of Brexiting. Rather, he headed over to the US to continue inspiring popular revolt alongside Trump. Farage has become something of a rock star to conservative Americans. The rightwing talkshow host Steve Deace called him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/nigel-farage-cpac-american-conservatives\" title=\"\">\u201cprobably the global politician not named Netanyahu most adored by American conservatives\u201d</a>. He makes regular appearances on Fox News. He also seems to have become Trump\u2019s personal fluffer. He was at the debate at Trump\u2019s request and also attended the Republican national convention as well as a Trump rally in Mississippi in August. While many in Trump\u2019s own party have distanced themselves from the increasingly indefensible nominee, Farage is resolutely standing by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/06/nigel-farage-donald-trump-calls-himself-mr-brexit-heres-why-hes-right/\" title=\"\">Donald \u201cJust Call Me Mr Brexit\u201d Trump</a>.</p> <p>Farage\u2019s stateside trumpeting may not seem like much of a big deal, but it is. Farage has an international platform; his animal analogies were written up by a number of American outlets, including Time, CNN, the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek. This reflects back on Britain. It doesn\u2019t just say to America: this is what Nigel Farage thinks. It says, to some degree: this is what the UK thinks. It aligns Brexit Britain with Trump\u2019s values (or dearth thereof). And this gets to the heart of what Farage is really doing in America: claiming Brexit as a victory for his brand of racism and intolerance. Telling the US that Britain feels just like him. Acting as a sort of anti-ambassador.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56z7a\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2792998\"            data-video-name=\"Nigel Farage: 'Donald Trump was like a big silverback gorilla' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb5465e4b05c2f1e953e4a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\">Nigel Farage: \u2018Donald Trump was like a big silverback gorilla\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In an August speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/brexit-vote-nigel-farage-making-uk-laughing-stock-abroad-tim-farron\" title=\"\">warned that the UK has become a \u201claughing stock abroad\u201d</a> and identified Farage as one of the \u201cmalevolent forces\u201d tarnishing the country\u2019s image after the EU referendum. Farron told the Guardian that the rest of the world was increasingly associating the UK with figures such as the interim Ukip leader and stressed that we mustn\u2019t allow the likes of Farage, Boris Johnson, David Davis, and Liam Fox to represent Britain. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>No, they don\u2019t. But if we\u2019re not careful then Farage and BoJo are going to become the smug, smirking faces of Britain to the outside world. So how does Britain wrest back control of its international image? What\u2019s needed, I think, is a squad of Brexit-busters. Celebrities who actually represent modern Britain and are tasked with working together to counterbalance malevolent forces such as Farage. A sort of 2016 Captain Planet, tasked with taking political pollution down to zero.</p> <p>First three spots on the squad go to Adele, JK Rowling and Zadie Smith. Obviously. The next goes to Zayn Malik. He may have broken a million hearts with his One Direxit but he is one of the most positive ambassadors of Britishness abroad. Indeed, the poor guy is routinely held up as Modern Muslim British Man Who is Good Role Model by the media. As well as helping to spread the message that not all Muslims are Isis, Malik is telling the world that not all British food is awful. Apparently he\u2019s working as the UK\u2019s unofficial cultural ambassador and helping his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, get \u201csuper into British foods\u201d. The model told ES magazine: <a href=\"http://www.elleuk.com/fashion/news/a31882/gigi-hadid/\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m loving Heinz baked beans in the morning.\u201d</a> If Malik can get Hadid to wax lyrical about baked beans, then anything is possible.</p> <p>James Corden\u2019s recent runaway success in America is another example of overcoming the odds. While most British personalities presenting on American TV have played into the evil Brit trope (think: Gordon Ramsay, Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan), Corden has proved you can be genuinely nice and still get good ratings.</p> <p>The final opening goes to John Oliver. The host of HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight, watched by 4 million Americans, has become a cult figure in the US, where he is far more famous than he is at home. Oliver has turned British sarcasm into something of a superpower; his jokes are helping to change America for the better, something Time magazine termed the <a href=\"http://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/\" title=\"\">\u201cJohn Oliver effect\u201d</a>. His takedown of proposed changes to net neutrality laws, for example, has been credited, in part, with pushing the Federal Communications Commission to vote for regulations against internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d. Who knows, Oliver\u2019s segment on the EU referendum, in which he pleaded with Brits to vote remain, might have had an effect on the British electorate. However, due to British media impartiality rules, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/eu-referendum/britain-television-john-oliver/\" title=\"\">it was never shown there on TV</a>.</p> <p>Which sums up 2016 in the UK: a British politician gushing about gorillas to show his support for a man who says he likes to grope women is just regular news.

Johnson famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon the the ultra-hawkish Labour MP <strong>John Woodock </strong>urged Johnson to adopt a Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98#block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98\">2.56pm.)</a> As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson\u2019s language was probably a bit more condemnatory than Hammond\u2019s would have been in a debate like this. But if you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May\u2019s views than Johnson\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-the-chilcot-report-is-finally-coming-but-we-already-know-we-havent-learned-the-lessons-of-iraq.html\">(Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is on record as saying foreign policy should \u201cvalue stability, \u201crespect sovereignty\u201d and avoid ideological crusades.)</a> But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead was more Stanley Baldwin.</p> <p>Here are the key points from his speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated for war crimes by the international criminal court</strong>. But he played down prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every hospital in eastern Aleppo is believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been successfully prosecuted decades after their offences.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also expressed some support for <a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20161010084755-l2s3l/\">the French bid to get the ICC to launch an investigation into Syria and Russia,</a> saying he was \u201cpersonally very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the international criminal court\u201d. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, Downing Street sounded a bit less keen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/785863360227250176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris &#39;personally attracted&#39; to pursuing Syria war crimes through ICC.

Johnson said he had \u201cevery sympathy\u201d for what they were proposing and that he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending troops to Syria, he added:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone. We need to think very carefully about the consequences.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour MP <strong>John Woodcock</strong> read his comments as a move towards no-fly zones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Foreign sec says all options being considered in Syria bar UK boots on ground - including no-fly zone or no bombing zone. *some* progress</p>&mdash; John Woodcock (@JWoodcockMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But the Independent\u2019s <strong>John Rentoul</strong> probably has a more realistic interpretation of Johnson\u2019s words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris Johnson didn&#39;t use these precise words, but his message on Syria was: I am not going to start WW3 by shooting down Russian planes.</p>&mdash; John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he would like to see people protest about Syria outside the Russian embassy.</strong> The Labour MP <strong>Ann Clywd</strong> proposed this earlier (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444#block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444\"> 2.27pm)</a> and Johnson said he agreed with her.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I agree with [Ann Clywd].

If President Putin\u2019s strategy is to restore the greatness and the glory of Russia, then I believe he risks seeing his ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is happening in Syria.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But he said the \u201cbest hope\u201d was to persuade Russia to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. </strong>Johnson said the UK had urged the EU to adopt a tough line on sanctions against Russia, but he pointedly refused to commit the UK to pushing for tougher sanctions. He also declined to back a call from Labour\u2019s <strong>Toby Perkins</strong> for the international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ... </p> <p>Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine ceasefire. That is the way.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of Syria\u2019s civil war over five years ago.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724/66_0_662_397/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in the Commons.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson in the Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:29:41.200Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcfedce4b01d9dd2c8ff08\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:10:09.982Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia defends its record in Syria</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Russian embassy in London has been using Twitter today to defend its record in Syria.

She is working on the assumption that the country voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true \u2013 a majority of people were against a hard Brexit.</p> <p>There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas hardest of all. Great effort will be expended to protect the financial sector and the City of London, which, while understandable, could lead to trade-offs that will damage other sectors.</p> <p>These issues need to be openly debated and that is why I am asking the prime minister to establish a Brexit committee of the nations and regions, with places for the devolved governments and the elected mayoralties.

But Osborne did not explicitly say the Laws account was wrong. Osborne said that he and David Cameron always thought the \u201cbest of the Conservative tradition\u201d combined the interventionist views of people like Heseltine with the economic rationalism of people like Nigel Lawson. Heseltine said that if Osborne was initially opposed to his plans in 2012, that would not surprise him because \u201cthere has been a growing understanding of the potential [of decentralisation]\u201d. But he also said that he thought the Laws account was simplistic because Cameron and Osborne knew what to expect when they commissioned Heseltine to write his report.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Osborne played down claims that Theresa May was pursuing a new industrial policy, saying her approach was \u201cvery similar\u201d to the Cameron\u2019s government.</strong> When he was asked about May\u2019s claim that she wanted a proper industrial strategy, implying the last government did not have one, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whenever you get new politicians in post, they always want to announce new things. Broadly, the approach I can see them pursuing in energy, regional policy and the like is very similar. </p> <p>It is human nature that new people in new jobs want to do new things. But the key is to look at is what is essentially the agreed strategy adopted by the new team. </p> <p>The agreed strategy that has been adopted by the new team is that we should have an industrial strategy, that certain sectors should receive active government support, that government should be pro-business, that devolution should continue, that the Northern Powerhouse should be supported. </p> <p>I would look behind the blizzard of press releases to the continuity of the policy, and I see a lot of continuity.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said governments in the past had been too slow to build new airports.</strong> Asked if the last government should have acted more quickly to expand Heathrow, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our country has collectively over 60 years dragged its heels on airport expansion.

Laws was a Lib Dem minister in the coalition, and when he was writing the book he had access to Nick Clegg\u2019s private notes. As a result, the book is well-sourced.</p> <p>And the book reveals that Osborne was a) initially sceptical about devolving powers to the region and b) opposed to Heseltine\u2019s No Stone Unturned report.</p> <p>Here is the key extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of October [2012], the Heseltine report was published, urging the government to devolve more economic powers from the centre to the regions. George Osborne didn\u2019t seem very impressed. At a meeting, he described the Heseltine report as a \u2018very personal\u2019 report, and a \u2018bid to steal every department\u2019s capital budget\u2019.</p> <p>David Cameron joked that the whole thing sounded like a \u2018fourth-term priority\u2019. The ever-sharp George Osborne added: \u2018Yes, a fourth-term priority - but for a different government!\u2019</p> <p>The prime minister urged that we should be diplomatic in responding to the Heseltine report as \u2018Michael is a very big beast in the political jungle. Upsetting him over this would be as risky as interrupting a silverback while he\u2019s mating.\u2019 It was an interesting and vivid image.</p> <p>Later in the parliament, George Osborne seemed to become a belated supporter of more localism. For now, he certainly seemed rather sceptical. Even in early 2013, when the chancellor first started to advocate the devolving of money from central government to local areas, one seasoned government adviser told me: \u2018George\u2019s view is that the money will either be wasted by central government or by local government. He thinks the only advantage of devolution is that you can slice 10% off the money as you devolve it, so that the Treasury pays out less.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fcb722e4b088a03a67d5ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T09:56:30.622Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Should you have gone quicker in government on airport expansion?</em></p> <p>Osborne says the country collective has dragged its feet on this.

When elevated to the altitude of ministers or heads of state, the culture of British politics \u2014 sectarian, raucous, aggressive \u2014 is inimical to the kind of painstaking, often painful, deliberation in Brussels.</p> <p>The centralised British state, with a weak legislature and strong executive, lends itself to intense public debate in an excitable national press, followed by last-minute decision-making and quick implementation. In the EU, the dispersed nature of power means policies have to trudge wearily between the commission, national capitals and, increasingly, the European and national parliaments before being adopted.</p> <p>Neither is necessarily superior. The eurozone\u2019s inept handling of its sovereign debt crisis was an object lesson in what happens when iterative processes do not match the realities of 21st-century capital markets.

Finally, and most importantly in this context, the United Kingdom must aim to maintain the best possible open access to European markets and vice versa. If we can achieve all that, there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the Treasury is not so optimistic. This morning the Times is splashing on the leak of a Treasury paper saying that, if the UK leaves the EU without negotiating a trade deal, and has to rely on World Trade Organisation rules for trading with Europe, the government could lose up to \u00a366bn a year in tax revenue. This is based on forecasts in the Treasury paper on Brexit published before the EU referendum. But the Treasury reportedly is standing by its analysis from earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/785590430712885248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tuesday&#39;s Times front page:<br>Hard Brexit could cost \u00a366bn a year<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jOb8RRZXAE\">pic.twitter.com/jOb8RRZXAE</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/785590430712885248\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s version of the story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/hard-brexit-treasury-66bn-eu-single-market\">Hard Brexit will cost Treasury up to \u00a366bn a year, ministers are told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By a happy coincidence George Osborne, the former chancellor, is giving evidence to a Commons committee this morning, and so we may find out what he has to say about this.

  "<p>Today\u2019s Republican party makes no sense.</p> <p>It spent decades as the party of national security before nominating a man who both defends Russia and pretends to know nothing about the place.</p> <p>If it is the party of small government and constitutional liberty, it\u2019s not clear why its members feel so good about locking up political opponents like Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>To cap it all, the party is currently led by a reality TV star who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-women-comments-groping-apology\">destroyed his own campaign</a> with a TV interview.</p> <p>But all those contradictions look simple compared to the pretzel shape that now passes for the strategy of its leadership.</p> <p>House speaker Paul Ryan was a reluctant endorser of Donald Trump. Now he is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">reluctant non-endorser</a> of the same.</p> <p>Ryan told his own Republican caucus on Monday that he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him. He urged all the rats to leave the sinking ship, telling them \u201cto do what\u2019s best for you\u201d to save their House majority. He said his own mission was to stop Clinton controlling the House and Senate, as well as the White House.</p> <p>But there is no escape from this shipwreck, as Trump himself made clear on Twitter. \u201cPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, job and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,\u201d said the same nominee.</p> <p>Ryan is indeed wasting his time. He and his House Republicans cannot run away from their own nominee. They have said too many nice things about a man who brags about sexual assault. Just one nice thing would be one too many for the suburban female voters who decide general elections.</p> <p>At the same time, Ryan and his crew cannot run away from their own Trump-loving base. If they do, they run the very real risk that Trump voters will mark their ballots for the presidential candidate and simply skip their down-ballot votes. Even a small protest vote would hand every battleground district to the Democrats.</p> <p>Those battlegrounds are already leaning a long way away from the GOP. According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-support-falls-in-wake-of-lewd-video-new-poll-says-1476115225\">poll</a>, Clinton enjoys an 11-point lead among likely voters. Barack Obama took control of the White House and Capitol Hill with a seven-point win in 2008. A mere defeat threatens to turn into a full-blown rout.</p> <p>To make matters worse for the Trump campaign, after squandering a year without a real organization, it has no voter turnout operations of its own. Instead it is reliant on the RNC\u2019s ground game, which is now either ambivalent about its presidential candidate or shifting decisively towards the House contests.</p> <p>That might help explain the ominous <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/kellyanne-conway-accuses-congressmen-of-lewd-behavior/?client=safari\">statements</a> issued by Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, who warned that Ryan was booed by Trump fans in his home state over the weekend. She went on to say that she knew of GOP lawmakers who forced themselves on young women and were hypocrites for shunning Trump.</p> <p>This Republican civil war is what you might call a lose-lose proposition. It might be a great reality TV show if it didn\u2019t affect the selection of the next leader of the free world.</p> <p>Of course, Paul Ryan and his fellow GOP leaders already know who the next president will be, and she\u2019s not colored orange. Their real contest is not about the House or the Senate. It\u2019s about the next Republican leader to guide the party out of the wilderness.</p> <p>That Moses vacancy is currently unfilled. Ted Cruz blew it with his perfectly timed endorsement just days before the Billy Bush video emerged. Mike Pence will forever be stained by putting his name on the Trump ticket. Jeb Bush will be 67 at the next election, trying to unseat another Clinton on behalf of his family.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Paul Ryan, a relatively youthful leader with not only impeccable conservative credentials but also an anti-poverty plan. Compared to Donald Trump, he is a Desmond Tutu of peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>That\u2019s where Ryan\u2019s current strategy buckles under its internal contradictions. If the Republican party is to return to power any time soon, it needs to clean house of the crazies who invaded it under the Tea Party banner in 2010.</p> <p>There is no hedging your way into the mainstream after so long on the fringes of birtherism, Islamophobia, nativism and sexism. There are no baby steps back from a flat tax and protectionism. There is nothing easy about erasing the cheap talk of undermining Nato and defending Russia. At this rate, the next Republican president has not yet been elected to a governorship or the US Congress.</p> <p>To one half of his own party, Ryan will forever be the man who betrayed Trump. To the other half, he will forever be the man who stood aside while Trump wrecked the place.</p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when Republicans lampooned a Democratic presidential candidate for taking both sides of the most important issue facing the country.</p> <p>His name was John Kerry, and he suggested, at one campaign rally, that he voted both for and against funding the war in Iraq. For that act of doublespeak, the man who is now secretary of state was pursued by giant flip-flops at every campaign event.</p> <p>The GOP united in its scorn for the Democrats, the party of cheese-eating surrender monkeys, who had nominated the French-speaking, windsurfing candidate who was clearly as unmanly as he was indecisive.</p> <p>Republicans have traveled a very long way in the last decade. They are both for and against their own nominee. They oppose his character but they favor his policies. Unless they think he can win, in which case his character is something they can live with. They surrendered their moral compass and now find themselves lost in a sea of indecision.</p> <p>The flip-flops are now on the other feet.</p>",
  "<p>When is a news story just a news story? And when does it become a \u201cdebate\u201d? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer, particularly for harried researchers and editors on tight budgets, and tighter deadlines. But the answer matters, because it dictates how any given topic is framed for an audience and, consequently, the way in which the public engages with it.</p> <p>When I first heard <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">Donald Trump\u2019s taped comments</a> that surfaced last week, I was most struck by the complacency with which he boasted about being able to commit sexual assault because of his status as a powerful, famous man. It was a hierarchy with which many women are familiar. So, too, are we horribly accustomed to the \u201charmless talk\u201d excuse he tried to use in the aftermath of the tapes\u2019 release. </p> <p>But, this time, the excuses didn\u2019t seem to be working. Even men famous for their own misogyny, men who had turned a blind eye while Trump made sexist, racist and Islamophobic comments in the past, seemed to have decided that his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/outrage-over-the-trump-tape-is-more-dangerous-and-repugnant_us_57fac20fe4b0d786aa52b6b7?\">words were indefensible</a>. </p> <p>So it was something of a surprise to be asked to take part in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07x2zcr#play\">conversation on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme</a> that ended up responding to the tapes by asking whether men need space to discuss women in sexual terms, and whether certain types of \u201ccompliments\u201d are acceptable. Those are valid questions in their own right. But to frame a discussion of Trump\u2019s remarks in those terms risks downplaying and mitigating the very serious nature of what he said, playing right into the hands of his own <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/trumps-banter-what-is-locker-room-chat-really-like\">\u201clocker room\u201d banter</a> excuse. Indeed, it even required the presenter to ask at one point that we set aside the most serious element of Trump\u2019s words in order to focus on the rest:</p> <p>\u201cIf you put that on one side though, the specific part of what he was taped saying that was obviously to you about assault, and you take the rest of it, is the rest of it acceptable?\u201d I asked the presenter which bits he meant by \u201cthe rest of it\u201d \u2013 perhaps Trump\u2019s description of a woman as a bitch, or his graphic and misogynistic description of her breasts? He responded: \u201cSo it\u2019s all the same, any description that objectifies a woman is an assault?\u201d</p> <p>Later he said: \u201cThe serious issue \u2026 is whether or not in 2016 it\u2019s acceptable for men together to talk about women in a sexual manner without feeling guilty about it.\u201d It boiled down to the question: calling a woman sexy \u2013 acceptable or not? I would argue that perhaps that wasn\u2019t, in fact, the serious issue at hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a5e96e242d7f7acb624553410fb98cbae5cc67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a5e96e242d7f7acb624553410fb98cbae5cc67/0_0_2560_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Bates on the Today programme on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Bates on the Today programme on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comments as shocking as Trump\u2019s require a less sympathetic media response, especially in light of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales\">reality of sexual violence </a>\u2013 400,000 women are sexually assaulted in the UK annually, with one in five women experiencing some form of sexual offence in their lifetime. And, in a country where <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales\">sexual violence is enormously underreported</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11409210/Drunk-or-flirty-rape-victims-often-to-blame-says-survey.html\">victim-blaming is rife</a>, the framing of debates such as these not only sends a strong message to survivors about how their experiences are viewed, but also risks inadvertently validating those who hold views like Trump\u2019s. Broadcasters have a power over public opinion, and presenting something as \u201cup for debate\u201d leads listeners to believe there are two equally valid sides to the story. Sometimes there aren\u2019t.</p> <p>This is not to suggest that debate isn\u2019t healthy, or that difficult topics shouldn\u2019t be openly tackled. Of course they should. But this can be done in a way that doesn\u2019t imply equal validation of those inciting and opposing something like sexual assault. There are certain serious events and issues simply reported as news stories, or condemned in the media without the need for a \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate\u201d argument. The question is, who decides what is \u201cbeyond debate\u201d? It often feels as if issues around sexism and sexual violence are presented as even, two-sided questions even when what is discussed is extreme. And sometimes \u201cdebate\u201d is artificially manufactured for the sake of creating a more controversial news item.</p> <p>In August, the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/half-of-women-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-at-work-tuc-study-everyday-sexism\">released a piece of research</a> revealing that more than half of all women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. About one in eight women reported unwanted sexual touching or attempts to kiss them \u2013 which could be defined as sexual assault under UK law.</p> <p>But the day the research came out, I was repeatedly asked to go on radio or television shows to \u201cdebate\u201d whether women were making a fuss about nothing, or whether the harassment and assault the report described was just \u201coffice banter\u201d. These discussions had little to do with the facts of the report, and risked undermining its message, giving audiences an inaccurate impression of the news story. Usually, I refuse these invitations and try to explain why I think it is problematic to frame the conversation in this way, but that invariably results in the \u201cdebate\u201d going ahead anyway while I listen in frustration at home, so this time I raised the issue when it arose on the programme instead.</p> <p>Such misinformation is similarly perpetuated by news outlets that frame issues such as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat/status/781496508613099530\">Is it OK to grab a woman on the street?</a>\u201d as questions, when <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/contents\">the law already tells us the answer</a>. This isn\u2019t a problem restricted to any one programme or media outlet \u2013 and it is complicated by the real need for balanced reporting. But there are many ways to achieve balance, such as debating the different ways to tackle a problem, which don\u2019t have to involve undermining the problem itself. And there are times when, at victims\u2019 expense, it feels as if \u201cbalance\u201d is a thinly veiled euphemism for controversy, clickbait or catfight.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s hard to say which was worse, the appetizer or the main course.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking, of course, about the second presidential debate and its prelude, that bizarre tableau of Donald Trump flanked by the Clintons\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">female accusers</a>. It was meant to distract voters from the killer tape of Trump\u2019s unspeakable misogyny and to distract Hillary Clinton. So far, it doesn\u2019t seem to have worked.</p> <p>Trump was attempting to take advantage of the false equivalencies that have riddled this presidential campaign, almost always to Hillary Clinton\u2019s detriment. Here are some of them: Donald Trump not releasing his tax returns is no worse than Clinton not releasing her Wall Street speeches; the Trump Foundation doesn\u2019t stretch the law as much as the Clinton Foundation; and, on display Sunday night, Hillary\u2019s intimidation of Bill\u2019s accusers from the 90s is just as unspeakable as the assault on women Trump described on that Access Hollywood tape.</p> <p>These casual and pernicious comparisons have been endlessly recycled and loudly echoed in what my friend, the journalist Robert Parry, has called the mighty wurlitzer of rightwing talk shows and social media.</p> <p>I\u2019ve previously reported in the Guardian that Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/09/hillary-clinton-enabler-bill-donald-trump-presidential-campaign\">cheerleaders for Trump</a> long before their canned, pre-debate endorsements of him, which, watched with bad sound on Facebook Live, resembled a Soviet show trial. (I haven\u2019t reported on the case of Kathy Shelton, whose allegations about Hillary Clinton stem from her legal work on a rape case in which Shelton, then 12, was the victim. They are different from the other three involving Hillary\u2019s supposed attempts to cover up for Bill in what Trump insists \u2013 but never proves \u2013 is \u201chorrible mistreatment\u201d of her husband\u2019s accusers by Hillary.)</p> <p>The facts that follow are somewhat tangled, so please be patient (facts are stubborn things). I am not judging the underlying accusations against Bill Clinton by the women, just Trump\u2019s insistence that Hillary Clinton has enabled and covered up her husband\u2019s sexual misconduct.</p> <p>I\u2019ll begin with Willey, who says Bill Clinton groped her in 1993. Before and after she testified in the Paula Jones case in 1998, she says, the Clintons have carried on a campaign of intimidation against her involving the vandalism of her car, the theft of her recent book manuscript and a cat skull on her porch. No evidence has surfaced linking either Clinton to these nefarious deeds.</p> <p>Nonetheless, she\u2019s a convenient weapon for Trump because of her ties to the alt-right. She\u2019s been featured on WND.com, headed by Joseph Farah, a radical rightwinger who embraced the birther movement and suggested secession if gay marriage was legalized. WND also published her book, which sells for 99 cents on its website. In January, Willey went on a popular Sunday radio show, Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, to demand that Hillary Clinton take a lie detector test to answer questions about whether she\u2019s tried to silence or intimidate her husband\u2019s female accusers. (Klein is also Breitbart News\u2019 Jerusalem bureau chief). Willey\u2019s also been spokesman for Rape Pac, a fundraising group set up by Trump adviser Roger Stone, author of The Clintons\u2019 War Against Women. (The Pac has raised $240.) These activities don\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying, and her supporters complain the leftwing media won\u2019t cover her. But they do show she\u2019s pretty deep in with Trumpworld.</p> <p>Juanita Broaddrick says Bill Clinton raped her when she was a volunteer in his Arkansas campaign. She interprets a brief encounter with Hillary Clinton 38 years ago at a state political event as an attempt to silence her. Their conversation, which Broaddrick says left her in shock, took place soon after the alleged rape. Here\u2019s what she told the Drudge Report in an interview in 1999: </p> <p>\u201cShe came directly to me as soon as she hit the door \u2026 She caught me and took my hand and said: \u2018I am so happy to meet you. I want you to know that we<br>appreciate everything you do for Bill.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Broaddrick says she found these comments \u201cscary\u201d, especially after Hillary repeated them a second time when her \u201csmile faded on the second thank you\u201d. The former nursing home worker said she was \u201cin state of shock ... nausea went all over me\u201d.</p> <p>It takes a lot of reading between the lines to interpret these words as a threat to stay quiet. It also assumes that Hillary Clinton knew about what her husband allegedly did to Broaddrick, something she has denied about his womanizing generally until he confessed to his affair with Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>Jones has leveled no personal allegations of being threatened by Hillary. Also appearing on the Aaron Klein show, she said, \u201cShe don\u2019t care nothing about women. Because if she did she would believe what I had to say. She would believe what the other women had to say.\u201d Jones then said Hillary Clinton \u201ctried to discredit all of these women that her husband abused and sexually harassed\u201d.</p> <p>Seriously, this is the bill of particulars that prove Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201chorrible mistreatment\u201d of the three women.</p> <p>Their sudden appearance just an hour before the debate had to be jarring for Clinton, even though Trump had threatened to invite Jones to the first debate. Whether this, or Trump looming over her onstage like the Incredible Hulk, or something else rattled her, I don\u2019t know, but she was not at the top of her debate game.</p> <p>Looking back, Clinton herself may have helped lure these women on to the 2016 campaign stage by tweeting last fall that every victim of sexual assault or harassment deserved to be believed.</p> <p>That tweet represents the prevailing view these days, but not in the 1990s, when this history unfolded. (Think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/hbo-confirmation-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-jill-abramson\">Anita Hill</a>.)</p> <p>The assumption of truth-telling should extend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>, whose allegations of sexual assault against Trump in 1993 were detailed in the Guardian in July. Trump has denied the charges.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that Bill Clinton assaulted Willey, Broaddrick and Jones during that same era. </p> <p>But that isn\u2019t the equivalent of wrongdoing by his wife.</p>",
  "<p>Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton now has an 11-percentage-point lead over her Republican opponent Donald Trump, according to a <a href=\"http://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PRRIThe-Atlantic-Survey-Topline-Oct.-9.pdf\">poll</a> released by PRRI and the Atlantic on Tuesday. If that weren\u2019t already reason enough for Trump supporters to worry, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/327067170/161027-NBCWSJ-October-N-500-Poll\">poll</a> from NBC and the Wall Street Journal released on Monday put Clinton\u2019s lead at 14 percentage points. But why the difference in numbers?</p> <p>If you want to follow polls in the 28 remaining days before the US votes, I strongly recommend you ignore the date that the poll was published \u2013 and focus instead on the dates that the poll was conducted. That PRRI/Atlantic poll was based on landline and cellphone interviews that took place on 5-9 October while the data for the NBC/WSJ poll was gathered on 8-9 October.</p> <p>Those dates are potentially significant given that on 8 October, a 2005 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">recording</a> was released of Trump saying that, thanks to his fame, he was able to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s highly likely that a larger proportion of respondents were interviewed <em tabindex=\"-1\">after</em> the Trump recording was made public in the NBC/WSJ poll compared with the PRRI/Atlantic poll. That could mean a 14-percentage-point lead is a more accurate indication of Clinton\u2019s current position in the race.</p> <p>But the crucial question is whether Clinton\u2019s lead is temporary or permanent. We\u2019ll need to keep an eye on numbers in the days ahead to understand that.</p> <p>In the meantime, though, it\u2019s worth looking beyond the horserace numbers that appear at the top of the survey and digging a little further. In the PRRI/Atlantic poll, I was curious about a question that provided the statement: \u201cThese days society seems to punish men just for acting like men\u201d \u2013 36% of respondents agreed. Another 41% agreed with the statement: \u201cSociety as a whole has become too soft and feminine.\u201d Those attitudes could provide useful information for understanding <em tabindex=\"-1\">why </em>voters might support their respective candidates.</p>",

It ranked 19th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for turnout that year.</p> <p>In the US overall, 58% of the <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/faq/sold\">voting-eligible population</a> cast a ballot for president.</p> <p>Differences in state-by-state turnout can be attributed to several factors, including a state\u2019s battleground status, demographics and laws, according to Michael P McDonald, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida.<br></p> <p>Explore how voter turnout has changed in every state over the past 30+ years below. For more information on voter-registration deadlines, <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-deadlines\">check here</a>.<br></p> <p><strong>What determines turnout?</strong></p> <p>Battleground states such as Florida and Ohio tend to see higher-than-average voter turnout because campaigns invest more time and money there, holding rallies and town halls, buying TV ads, and running extensive voter-mobilization drives.<br></p> <p>McDonald, who runs the United States Election Project, an online repository of election statistics and laws, said that residents of battleground states may also feel their votes matter more, which encourages them to turn out.<br></p> <p>The character of a state\u2019s electorate also influences participation; age, income, and especially education are good predictors of voter turnout. In short, \u201colder people tend to vote more, wealthier people tend to vote more, and more highly educated people tend to vote more\u201d, McDonald said.</p> <p>Such demographics help explain why some northern and midwestern states, which have higher educational attainment overall, have consistently high turnout rates. But McDonald noted that many of those states also have political climates that encourage voting in other ways.</p> <p>As McDonald put it: \u201cTurnout is higher in states that make it easier for people to vote than in states that make it harder for people to vote\u201d \u2013 which means that laws matter.</p> <p>Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have sought to make it easier for people to vote through <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">same-day voter registration</a>. Three more states \u2013 California, Hawaii and Vermont \u2013 have passed similar laws that are not yet in effect.</p> <p>Same-day registration helps boost voter participation by allowing residents to both register and vote on the day of the election. Most other states require voters to register at least seven to 30 days ahead of time in order to vote on election day. Same-day registration increases voter turnout by 5%-7% \u201cwithout any reported increase in voter fraud\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/election-day-registration\">according to</a> the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>In 2012, four out of the five states with highest turnout allowed same-day registration. Minnesota \u2013 which has topped the list of states with highest voter turnout in every presidential election but one since 1980 \u2013 has had same-day registration since 1974. (The state also has a <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-state-state-college-attainment-numbers-show-progress-toward-2020-goal\">highly educated</a> and <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/median-annual-income/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Median%20Annual%20Household%20Income%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">relatively wealthy</a> population.)</p> <p>More recently, several states have begun <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/automatic-voter-registration\">automatically registering residents to vote </a>when they interact with the department of motor vehicles, unless they specifically opt out.<br></p> <p>States that make it harder for people to vote \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/north-carolina-voter-id-law-struck-down\">or tried to</a> \u2013 include Mississippi and North Carolina, which enacted tough voter ID requirements and <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/expand-early-voting\">curtailed early voting</a>.</p> <p>Only a few studies have examined the effects of the most recent and onerous wave of voter restrictions, which began to gain momentum after the 2010 election. But such studies have found evidence that identification requirements suppress turnout.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634\">analysis from the Government Accountability Office</a>, which examined the effects of new voter ID laws in Kentucky and Tennessee between 2008 and 2012, found that such requirements decreased voter participation by 2%-3%. Another <a href=\"http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/voterIDhajnaletal.pdf\">study, published in February by a team from the University of California, San Diego</a>, found larger effects. That analysis estimated that strict photo ID laws decrease turnout among Democrats by 7.7%, and among Republicans by 4.6% \u2013 with disproportionate effects on minorities.</p> </noscript> </figure>",

  "<p>When asked by Ellen DeGeneres what her spirit animal is, Hillary Clinton had a surprising answer: the elephant. </p> <p>Although the symbol of the GOP, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWAJQEuYbTA\">spoke</a> on the Ellen DeGeneres Show this May with rare passion about the need to protect real elephants from a poaching crisis that has killed at least 110,000 of them over the past decade, pushing the world\u2019s largest land animals \u2013 especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jul/23/forest-elephants-evidence-science-species-ivory-crisis\">forest elephants</a> \u2013 closer to extinction. </p> <p>\u201cI love the way\u2026the matriarch of the family looks for everybody, I just have such a sense of connection to elephants and it just breaks my heart that they are being poached and murdered and babies being left to fend for themselves,\u201d Clinton said on a portion of the show that only aired on Facebook. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s affinity for elephants is not widely known or reported. But during her tenure as Secretary of State in the Obama Administration, she helped bring the issue of global wildlife trafficking out of obscurity. <br></p> <p>\u201cInternational criminal syndicates are orchestrating the slaughter of many of the world\u2019s iconic wildlife species and profiteering by marketing ivory, rhinoceros horn, and other wildlife parts in the U.S., Asia, and Europe,\u201d said Jorge Silva, a spokesperson for the Clinton Campaign. \u201cMany of the criminal syndicates have ties with, and are helping to fund, terrorist groups around the world, and also are engaged in human, drug, and arms trafficking.\u201d <br></p> <p>Experts believe that groups like the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, Al-Shabaab and even ISIS may be in part <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2015/aug/30/case-proven-ivory-trafficking-funds-terrorism\">funded</a> by the illicit sale of ivory and other wildlife parts. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s personal love for elephants springs out of a trip to Tanzania in 1997 as first lady. Her daughter, Chelsea, accompanied her, and since then mother and daughter have shared a passion for pachyderms. During the period, Bill Clinton\u2019s administration opposed any opening of the ivory trade. Despite this, Cites began approving one-off trades in elephant ivory in 1999, 2002 and 2008. Experts have linked the current poaching crisis to the approval of these trades, especially the last one.</p> <p>Clinton has also worked to combat elephant poaching through the family\u2019s foundation. In 2013, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton brought together various conservation groups to partner on a new $80 million programme to fight elephant poaching through the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI).</p> <p>Silva said that if elected president Clinton would amp up the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. </p> <p>\u201c[She will] forge partnerships with the private sector and non-profit community to shut down the U.S. market for illegal wildlife products; deploy U.S. intelligence and enforcement assets to catch and imprison the kingpins that are controlling this multi-billion dollar criminal enterprise; raise the legal penalties for illegal wildlife traffickers; and impose trade sanctions when appropriate on nations that fail to crack down on the illegal killing and marketing of wildlife and wildlife products.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jul/23/forest-elephants-evidence-science-species-ivory-crisis\">Scientists: we are 'condemning' forest elephants by ignoring evidence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such a global crackdown may be necessary to save the world\u2019s largest land animals from extinction. This year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">the Great Elephant Census </a>\u2013 a thorough, groundbreaking survey across 18 countries \u2013 found that populations of savanna elephants have fallen by 30% in just seven years. The news was even worse than many conservationists feared. But the situation is even more dire for forest elephants. <br></p> <p>Inhabiting the thick jungles of Central and West Africa, forest elephants are more difficult to survey. But last year, scientists estimated that 65% of forest elephant have been slaughtered for their ivory since 2003. A number of recent studies have also argued that forest elephants are indeed a distinct species based on genetic, physical and behavioral differences. </p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to repeated requests for its position on elephant conservation or the global wildlife trade, but its website mentions neither. This is not surprising given the website lists very few positions regarding any environmental issues, including making no mention of climate change \u2013 although Donald Trump has claimed that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese. <br></p> <p>In 2012, media leaked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">photos</a> of Donald Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, taken during a big game hunt safari in Zimbabwe.

Cutting off an elephant\u2019s tail is traditional in some African cultures where the hair is made into a bracelet. </p> <p>A longtime trophy hunter, Donald Trump Jr. has stated that he would be interested in working in the Department of the Interior if his father is elected president. </p> <p>\u201cThe way our society treats animals is a reflection of our humanity,\u201d reads the Clinton campaign website.

  "<p>In 2012 I recall hosting an event in Washington DC during which columnist Ana Marie Cox, a former Guardian colleague, insisted she could cover the election from the couch. I remember being shocked by that admission-cum-brag at the time but the more I thought about it, the more I came to believe she was on to something. US elections are made-for-TV events. The conventions, rallies, polls and pundits are all essentially spectator sports. The process is built for consumption rather than engagement. It\u2019s big business. In 2012, Republican spending on ads in Florida alone <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidential-campaign-ads-2012/\">was almost double</a> the total spent by the six main British parties combined during the UK 2015 election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/middletown-timeline/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The view from Middletown timeline\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/middletown-timeline/embed.html\">The view from Middletown timeline</a> </figure>  <p>That does make covering elections in a substantive way very difficult. The mainstream narrative is driven not by what will change but who will win; not by what people are thinking but against which of those two crude boxes they will put their name. It\u2019s as though the whole process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/younge-america-return-roanoke\">takes place on a split screen</a> with the debate analysis, gaffes and ads on one side and the place where people work, love, and live on the other. When Barack Obama came out for gay marriage in 2012 the first question on cable television was not \u201cWhat will this mean for gay people?\u201d but \u201cWhat will this mean for Obama\u2019s re-election prospects?\u201d</p> <p>This new, twice-weekly series marks my sixth presidential election as a journalist and, as someone who prefers the road to the couch and ordinary people to TV pundits, I\u2019ve always found it tough to cover the process in a way that both satisfies the reader\u2019s need for a steer on the big picture and my desire to try to shift the framing of our coverage away from the horse race. Readers of course want to know who is likely to be the next president, and what headline issues they should look out for but I\u2019m also interested in what the whole thing can tell us about how American society is evolving \u2013 particularly in an election as extraordinary as this, where a character as bizarre as Donald Trump and another as experienced as Hillary Clinton are candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa1ac6732555681a6745c0560aee4e4cab184868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1ac6732555681a6745c0560aee4e4cab184868/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge is reporting for a month from Muncie, Indiana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Younge is reporting for a month from Muncie, Indiana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/02/uselections2004.usa4\">I drove from John Kerry\u2019s hometown</a> in Boston to George W Bush\u2019s former hometown in Midland, Texas, stopping in swing states along the way. I can\u2019t vouch for what it was like to read, but I found it enthralling to write. I found myself at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/23/uselections2004.gayrights\">a drag show</a> in a small town in Missouri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/09/uselections2004.usa\">breaking bread with Christian fundamentalists</a> who\u2019d lost their son in Iraq in Pennsylvania, and watching the presidential debates with students in Iowa.</p> <p>In 2008 I went to Roanoke, Virginia \u2013 a swing town in a swing state with a sizeable enough African American population that I could gauge the excitement around the potential election of America\u2019s first black president. It was only by sticking around that I discovered that the town had a thriving arts scene that was politically engaged, or that the local courts set aside one whole day a week to deal with people with healthcare debts.</p> <p>This time I\u2019m going to Muncie, Indiana. Ahead of the election, I\u2019ll be publishing articles twice a week \u2013 on Tuesdays and Thursdays \u2013 about what I discover here, who I\u2019ve met, before writing an extended report after the vote. I chose Muncie, population 70,000, as my destination for two reasons. First of all it sits in Delaware County, <a href=\"http://www.delawarecountyelectionday.com/\">which voted for</a> both Donald Trump (53%) and Bernie Sanders (56%). In an election year when Americans appear to be enamored with neither of the nominees \u2013 Clinton has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">a net favourability rating</a> of -11 while <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">Trump\u2019s is -20</a> \u2013 I\u2019m hoping that this trip will give some insight into what Americans appear to find alienating about their political establishment. I also want to ask: what is peculiarly American about this moment? How many similarities are there between here and Brexit Britain, or a France where the Front National is a serious contender for the presidency?</p> <p>Indiana is a reliable Republican state \u2013 though Obama did win it in 2008 \u2013 but Delaware is a swing county. Both <a href=\"http://dcelectionday.com/20082General/Html/DelawareElecSumm.htm\">Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2000&amp;fips=18035&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">George W Bush</a> won it twice. Once <a href=\"http://dcelectionday.com/20122General/Html/DelawareElecSumm.htm\">narrowly</a> and once with <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2004&amp;fips=18035&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">double figures</a>. But I\u2019m also heading to Muncie because it has an iconic place in American social science as the subject of major sociological case study in the 1920s called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aRFcRFNUNQ\">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/video/2016/oct/11/view-from-middletown-us-election-2016-presidential-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57xny\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2796357\"            data-video-name=\"The view from Middletown: get involved in this US election project \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fcbd19e4b0eaaafbc951fa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/video/2016/oct/11/view-from-middletown-us-election-2016-presidential-election-video\">The view from Middletown: get involved in this US election project</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The authors, Helen Merrell Lynd and Robert Staughton Lynd, who were married, were seeking a fairly typical American town in which to conduct extensive field research. They described Muncie, which they only ever referred to as Middletown, as \u201ca community as small as thirty-odd thousand ... [in which] the field staff was enabled to concentrate on cultural change ... the interplay of a relatively constant ... American stock and its changing environment.\u201d Having first visited during a period of relative prosperity in the 1920s, they returned a decade later to write Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts during the Depression.</p> <p>I want to hear from people who live in Muncie or nearby in Indiana: we intend that this project should be guided by readers. Let me know if there are issues you think I am missing or questions I\u2019m not asking. Do you know smart people I should talk to? Put us in touch.</p> <p>The question of political alienation and political parties losing their grip on their bases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jan/06/dont-let-trump-fool-you-rightwing-populism-is-the-new-normal-video\">is not, however, unique to America</a>. Look across Europe and you will see that there is nothing uniquely American about the rise of Donald Trump. In Britain we\u2019ve seen the grassroots of the major parties rebel against their own leaderships with the double election of the leftwing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and the Conservative revolt over Brexit. So while I\u2019m staying in Muncie I hope readers from across America and elsewhere let me know if they are seeing similar themes emerge and if so how they are manifesting themselves. Every country has a Middletown \u2013 and most of them are hurting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"726521c763e8b2350c5b94c244e4df8ccf7efb8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726521c763e8b2350c5b94c244e4df8ccf7efb8f/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House in the downtown are of Muncie, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houses in the downtown are of Muncie, Indiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have been to Muncie before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/11/september11.usa3\">13 years ago</a>, to write about the second anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Back then, the political mood was tender with the political polarisation prompted by the Iraq war in particular and the Bush presidency in general. \u201cThe day when you would go out of your way to make a political statement are gone,\u201d Joseph Losco, chairman of the town\u2019s Ball State University political science department, told me at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gone for ever but it\u2019s gone for now.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call Muncie typical \u2013 what place truly is? \u2013 but it certainly showcased America as a complex place. True, the sign for the local mosque was destroyed and one local preacher held a memorial service in which he refused to share the pulpit with Muslims, Jews or any other religion. But following the mosque incident a local Muslim man held a barbecue and 200 neighbours showed up; an alternative interfaith service attracted twice the number of participants as the Christian-only one.</p> <p>So I\u2019m back in Middletown in the hope that I will once again find that level of complexity and nuance in this volatile moment. I want to visit the food banks, gun ranges, churches and gay bars to talk to its teachers, preachers, cops and kids. To find out not just how people will vote but what they are thinking, and not just who will win but what, if anything, might change. <br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 October 2016.

  "<p>In public spaces across central Florida \u2013 from schools to churches, restaurants to supermarkets, fairgrounds to DMV car licensing offices \u2013 a massive scramble is drawing to a close to register Puerto Ricans to vote in what could prove to be a tipping point in next month\u2019s presidential election.<br></p> <p>The cut-off for voter registrations in Florida is this week and as the deadline has approached, efforts to cajole hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans to sign up for a ballot have reached fever pitch. (On Monday, a federal judge extended the 11 October deadline by one day to allow for the disruption of the hurricane.) Volunteers mobilized by a new coalition of Hispanic groups called Que Vote Mi Gente \u2013 my people vote \u2013 have been stationed for weeks now outside favored gathering spots accosting newcomers from the island about their civic duty.</p> <p>\u201cAre you registered to vote? Are you ready to vote?\u201d is the battle cry, and even the most superficial of glances at the statistics tells why. Florida is famously the swing state to end all swing states, ever since George Bush squeaked past Al Gore in the 2000 race for the White House with a disputed 500 votes.</p> <p>Within Florida, the rapidly expanding Puerto Rican community along the I-4 corridor that runs from Orlando to Tampa has become the ultimate swing vote within the ultimate swing state in the 2016 campaign. \u201cThis is the new mecca for Puerto Ricans and it\u2019s changing the electoral map,\u201d said Betsy Franceschini, Florida director of the Hispanic Federation, which is participating in the voter drive.</p> <p>Every day, about 100 Puerto Ricans relocate from the island to central Florida, pushed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/01/puerto-rico-debt-repayment-default-financial-crisis\">financial crisis back home</a> and pulled by the lure of jobs in Disney World and the other theme parks that pepper the area. There are now 1.1 million \u201cboricuas\u201d, as the newcomers are known in Florida, a demographic that is on the verge of toppling Cubans from their perch as the state\u2019s dominant Hispanic bloc.</p> <p>With at least 200,000 boricuas having arrived in Florida since the last presidential election in 2012 \u2013 all of whom are eligible to vote at the age of 18 as US citizens \u2013 they have the potential to be a major, and possibly even decisive, political force in a state that gave Barack Obama the nod four years ago by only 74,000 votes. Which is in large part why both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are pummeling central Florida with TV ads \u2013 the Tampa region with an ad spend of $21m and the Tampa area with $17m occupying both the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-s-morning-clips-it-s-nev-addd-ah-n660776\">top two slots</a> in the league table of presidential ad markets in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>Which is all very well, but first you have to get the new arrivals to register to vote \u2026 </p> <p>\u201cAre you registered to vote?\u201d comes the cry outside the DMV licensing office in Kissimmee. That\u2019s the ground zero of Puerto Rican voter registration this year: Kissimmee has a <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/1236950\">majority Latino population</a> and is one of the fastest-growing towns in the state as a result of the boricua exodus. </p> <p>And within Kissimmee the one place that new arrivals can surely be found is the DMV. Try living in Florida without a car.</p> <p>The staff of the Hispanic Federation have spent weeks patiently waiting outside the DMV offices to pounce on boricuas such as Narciso Rey, 55, a retired shop supervisor who arrived in the town from Puerto Rico barely two weeks ago. \u201cI\u2019m ready to vote,\u201d he said compliantly as he was being collared by the volunteers and encouraged to fill out a voter registration form. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the family, and for me, to take part in deciding who will be the next president.\u201d</p> <p>On paper, the growing number of registered Puerto Ricans in Florida looks like an electoral gift for Clinton. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/press/release/2016/10/05/162807/release-new-poll-shows-florida-puerto-rican-voters-will-have-major-impact-on-2016-elections/\">latest poll</a> of Puerto Ricans in Central Florida conducted by Latino Decisions for the Center for American Progress Action Fund found that 61% of those surveyed, all of whom are already registered, said they were certain to back Clinton while only 12% definitely support Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/09/puerto-ricans-florida-election-immigration\">Puerto Ricans in Florida: the 'outsiders' with a powerful swing vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not quite up to the stellar ratings of Obama in 2012, who according to exit polls gained 87% of the Puerto Rican vote in the state compared with 13% for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, but it\u2019s getting there. So much so that Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, a Democratic Congress member for Chicago who is of Puerto Rican descent, dared to interpret the poll results as a solid indicator that \u201cDonald Trump is going to lose Florida and lose the electoral college, and Puerto Ricans in particular will be a huge part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory.\u201d</p> <p>But there is no room for complacency on the Democratic side, judging from the comments of the boricuas the Guardian talked to in Kissimmee. Narciso Rey, completing his registration form outside the DMV, said he was totally unclear about whether to back Trump or Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m still studying, watching, trying to work out which way to go. I\u2019m going to have to eat, drink and relax before I decide,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At Melao Bakery, a classic Puerto Rican restaurant that serves quesitos, cream-filled doughnuts and a popular dish of fried green plantain called mofongo, several of the customers were also still wavering between the candidates. Ileana Rivera, 36, said that though she is registered to vote she knows next to nothing about either of them.</p> <p>Her friend dining with her, Jackie Hernandez, 41, said she was more up on the race, but not in a good way. \u201cI don\u2019t like either of them. If they are my only choices, I would say I go more towards Trump.\u201d</p> <p>A married couple, Yolanda Quiles, 37, and Carlos Baez, 40, who came from the island two years ago to give their kids a better chance of a good school, said they have been confused by all the attacks and counter-attacks flying between the two candidates. At the end of the day, they both expect to vote for Clinton, but only as she\u2019s the non-Trump option. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b8f02bce6747e4ae56b6faf141e65b8fe2b046e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8f02bce6747e4ae56b6faf141e65b8fe2b046e/0_57_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Baez, 40, and Yolanda Quiles, 37, expect to vote for Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Baez, 40, and Yolanda Quiles, 37, expect to vote for Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed PIlkington/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like politicians, I don\u2019t like them in Puerto Rico and I don\u2019t like them here,\u201d said Quiles. \u201cTrump insults Mexicans and Latin Americans, and that\u2019s us too,\u201d said Baez.</p> <p>This fundamental lack of joy about either presidential candidate chimes with the struggles that the leaders of Que Vote Mi Gente have had this year in registering people. Despite the herculean efforts of the coalition, there remains an engagement gap with only 60% of Puerto Ricans registered compared with 80% of all Floridians.</p> <p>Newly arrived boricuas are often too preoccupied settling in, finding a home and a school for their children, to care about an election in a country that is still unfamiliar to them. Skepticism toward politicians runs deep in Puerto Rico and has been carried by many migrants like Quiles with them to their new homes. </p> <p>There also remains a disconnect between the rapidly growing community of boricuas and the candidates who are so eager for their votes yet understand little about their culture or priorities. The millions of dollars of TV ads that are being flung at central Florida merely disguise what Franceschini of the Hispanic Federation calls the \u201ccultural incompetence\u201d of their campaigning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t like politicians, I don\u2019t like them in Puerto Rico and I don\u2019t like them here</p> <footer> <cite>Yolanda Quiles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Puerto Rico, electioneering is a matter of song and color and noise, with motorcades, or <em>caravanas</em>, trailing after candidates and crowds filling the streets waving flags and dancing to <em>la plena</em> folk music. In Florida, about the most exciting sight is a bank of lawn signs and a flyer or two pushed through the door often printed in English.</p> <p>\u201cIt applies to both Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Franceschini said. \u201cUnless they figure out how to address Puerto Ricans, to campaign in a way that is culturally competent, then they are both missing an enormous opportunity as this vote could decide everything.\u201d</p> <p>The Latino Decision poll underlined the gap between potential and reality. Some 84% of the 500 Puerto Ricans who participated in the survey said they definitely intended to cast a ballot next month, yet only 37% said that they had been contacted by anyone from a presidential campaign, political party or community organization to discuss their intentions.</p> <p>\u201cPuerto Ricans have not heard enough from the campaigns,\u201d said Congressman Guti\u00e9rrez. \u201cYou would expect them to be among the most highly sought after voters in the country \u2013 it is not enough for Democrats to assume their support just because their candidate is not Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of meaningful political engagement, the Hispanic Federation is seeking to fill some of the gap with its own non-partisan messaging. It will be running its own TV ad campaign from now until November exhorting Puerto Ricans to vote, using an animated little brown tree frog, the coqui, which is a symbol of the island\u2019s national pride.</p> <p>Rumor-mongering is another, less civic, way the void has been filled. One story doing the rounds, which was repeated to the Guardian by several people in Kissimmee, is that Trump intends to remove US citizenship from Puerto Ricans should he become president. A basic Google search reveals that the story began as a <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-puerto-ricans/\">fake news report</a> in a satirical magazine and rapidly took on a life of its own via social media.</p> <p>Outside the Unidos supermarket in Kissimmee, a sense of political weariness hangs in the air along with the enduring heat of early autumn. Luis Arze, 58, sat under a row of fans keeping cool. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for anyone, they\u2019ve got so many problems,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kiara Balasquide is one of the enthusiasts. Born and raised in Kissimmee, she is a volunteer in the Hispanic Federation\u2019s voter registration drive and is fired up about the election: at 19 it will be her first chance to choose her president.</p> <p>In her personal capacity, how will she use that new and potentially critical power? According to the statistics, she should be gung-ho for Clinton, but no, she\u2019s stuck on the fence.</p> <p>\u201cTrump has no filter, he might be good or he might get us into a lot of trouble, it\u2019s hard to tell. Clinton is a liar, we don\u2019t know anything about her real character.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s how it\u2019s looking to a Latina in the idealistic flush of youth barely a month away from exercising the power of her vote for the first time. There\u2019s clearly still a lot at play among the boricuas of central Florida.</p>",
  "<p>Western air forces must be willing to confront Russian military jets over the skies of Syria to enforce a no-fly zone and protect the citizens of eastern Aleppo from a bombardment akin to the attack on Guernica during the Spanish civil war, UK MPs will be told by a former cabinet minister in an emergency three-hour Commons debate on Tuesday.</p> <p>The intervention by Andrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary, and the granting of the debate itself, will force the UK\u2019s Foreign Office to set out how it intends to respond after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/russia-vetoes-un-resolution-syria-bombing-aleppo\">Russia\u2019s veto of a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in eastern Aleppo</a>. The west has been criticised for lacking any leverage over Russia in Syria. <br></p> <p>Britain has criticised Russia but set out no clear plan on how to respond to the growing threat posed by Moscow not just in the Middle East, but across eastern Europe. Mitchell argues the whole post-cold war international diplomatic architecture is being torn down by Russian actions.</p> <p>Russian jets resumed heavy bombing of rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Tuesday after several days of relative calm. Rebel officials and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported casualties from the airstrikes but gave no immediate toll. </p> <p>Mitchell, advised by former British military officials and supported by the former CIA director David Petraeus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/12/uk-should-be-prepared-enforce-syria-no-fly-zone-russian-veto-un-isis-assad\">has been arguing for a no-fly zone for many months</a>. In recent weeks some of Mitchell\u2019s advisers have developed this proposal into a call to track Russian jets from UK warships off the coast of Syria, and for a complete no-fly zone for Syrian helicopters over civilian areas. It has been argued that Syrian helicopters are doing all the damage with chemical, napalm and high explosive barrel bombs. One proposal has been to bomb air runways.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Mitchell said: \u201cWhat we are saying is very clear.

One of his leading surrogates, the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, went further by turning the issue into a joke.</p> <p>During a warm-up speech at the Wilkes-Barre rally, Giuliani made a quip about it during an attack on Clinton. He said: \u201cBoy, she is as phony as \u2026 I better not say, as I have to be nice.

He promised to build a wall along the southern border and have the Mexicans pay for it, to bring jobs back to America from overseas, and to cut taxes and government regulation.</p> <p>The candidate\u2019s braggadocio was clearly tailored to suit the tastes of his hardcore supporters, most of whom dismissed concern about the NBC tape as so much political correctness.

  "<p>Squinting so he could drive through the vodka and the pills, Heath Phillips searched for a tree he could wrap his truck around.<br></p> <p>It was a frigid February day in 2009, some 200 miles north-west of New York City, on a road Phillips drove every day to get to work. He describes this moment as his rock bottom, but it was not his first suicide attempt. Twenty-one years earlier, Phillips had first tried to kill himself aboard the ammunition ship USS Butte after his shipmates repeatedly raped him.</p> <p>Phillips enlisted in the navy days before his 17th birthday. He had dreamed of serving since he was a little boy and looked forward to a 20-year career in the military. Instead, the trauma of his repeated sexual assault shattered him and forced him to leave after barely a year.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong></p> <p>If he could have stayed, Phillips would have been retired with a military pension by the time he drove his Nissan Pathfinder for what he thought would be the final time. </p> <p>Phillips says he \u201cwas not a good person\u201d in the aftermath of his assault. \u201cI\u2019ve been in and out of jail. I\u2019ve been arrested. I have been homeless. I have older sons who know me but we\u2019re not close, because I don\u2019t know how to be close to them.\u201d He continues: \u201cI did what I knew how to do: I drank. From drinking, I started popping pills. I couldn\u2019t hold a job because I couldn\u2019t handle being near anybody. I couldn\u2019t be near men. If they reminded me of something, I\u2019d walk off a job \u2026 All I cared about is: I want to be drunk, I don\u2019t want to remember this,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Phillips never found the tree. The next thing he remembers is waking up in his truck. That day, he dumped out all of his drugs and alcohol \u2013 even his cigarettes \u2013 and began a long struggle to reclaim his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa7af54ea16fe6bf3515dd83d5faf3191ffb70f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa7af54ea16fe6bf3515dd83d5faf3191ffb70f9/0_103_4215_5073/831.jpg\" alt=\"Heath Phillips holding a photo of himself when he was in the Navy.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heath Phillips holding a photo of himself when he was in the navy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Lavalette/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Phillips is closer to the typical survivor of sexual assault in the US military than he is a deviation from it. According to the most recent <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/607047/department-of-defense-press-briefing-on-sexual-assault-in-the-military-in-the-p\">statistics</a> from the Pentagon, of the 20,300 service members sexually assaulted in 2014, 10,600 were men \u2013 a rate over 52%. </p> <p>Sexual assault within the military has reached shocking levels.<strong> </strong>In 2013, one in four women using the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 healthcare screened positive<strong> </strong>for military sexual assault. While awareness around female service members\u2019 ordeal lags far behind solutions, it has belatedly begun, in part due to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/11/gillibrands-military-sexual-assault_n_6309108.html\">efforts</a> from US senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Claire McCaskill and the award-winning documentary <a href=\"http://invisiblewarmovie.com/\">The Invisible War</a>. </p> <p>Yet male service members who experience military sexual assault remain even less visible. Studies by the Rand Corporation and the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019 research arm, indicate that only <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-284\">40%</a> of women service members report their sexual assaults, compared with just 13% of men.</p> <p>This lack of visibility can be partly blamed on common narratives within the military, which often diminish the threat to female service members and erase the threat to male ones outright. </p> <p>One of those faulty narratives was reaffirmed by someone seeking to be their commander-in-chief. During a presidential forum last month, Donald Trump defended a 2013 tweet asking: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/331907383771148288?lang=en\">what did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?</a>\u201d, adding \u201cthe best thing we could do is set up a court system within the military\u201d (and, in doing so, described the system already in place).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to walk a mile in my shoes</p> <footer> <cite>Heath Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nearly eight years after he nearly ended his own life, Phillips laughs when asked what he would say to Trump should they be face to face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to regroup my composure,\u201d he begins.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very, very ill-informed.

We sit on the patio overlooking her family\u2019s huge backyard, with her loquacious and passionate father, Russ, beside her. At times seething as she shares her story, he interjects and vows to shame the US military into reform. </p> <p>Kendzior was a star high-school soccer player with a 3.8 grade point average. The Naval Academy, incubator of the officer corps of the navy and marines, recruited her in her junior year. Steeped in pro-military Texas culture and her grandfathers\u2019 second world war service, Kendzior figured an education at the academy, followed by a commission in the navy, would prepare her for the challenging life in the business world she ultimately sought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3670a490238ea0fbdf738653ee3a89f6b8c0eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3670a490238ea0fbdf738653ee3a89f6b8c0eed/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Kendzior and her father Russ.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Kendzior and her father Russ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison V Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kendzior entered the Annapolis, Maryland-based academy in 2008 and immediately encountered an atmosphere of machismo. She overheard still-juvenile young men refer to certain women as \u201cdubs\u201d, an acronym for dumb ugly bitches. At her first off-campus house party, Kendzior got drunk faster than she expected as a result of boot camp and her soccer regimen. She didn\u2019t want to pass out on a puke-covered floor, so when a second-year midshipman told her there was a bed she could sleep in, she took the chance. </p> <p>\u201cI woke up to it happening,\u201d she remembered. </p> <p>Later, still in shock, Kendzior messaged the man on Facebook. He elided what he had done to Kendzior and, since he was a year above her, made it an issue of fraternization, a punishable offense. \u201cKeep your mouth shut, don\u2019t say anything, or we\u2019ll both get in trouble,\u201d he said. She dealt with it by putting it out of her mind as best she could. \u201cThere was a lot of that shame built in, like I shouldn\u2019t have been drinking,\u201d she says. Because he was in her company, she had to see him at every meal for weeks on end.</p> <p>A month later, she was raped for a second time by two different midshipmen on the varsity basketball team.<br></p> <p>Thinking an upperclass midshipman was trying to hook her up with a classmate she considered a friend, Kendzior went to hang out with them at a nearby hotel (something midshipmen do to drink away from prying eyes). Less than halfway through a red cup full of a drink they had mixed for her, Kendzior blacked out. </p> <p>\u201cThe next thing I know, I realized I was being raped by this upperclassman,\u201d she said. She was only awake for a few seconds before passing out again, and would later learn the man she thought was her friend joined in. </p> <p>For two and a half years, Kendzior did not report the incidents. She encountered what appeared to be studious avoidance at the academy. When doctors asked her if she had ever been assaulted, she answered affirmatively, but they did not ask follow-up questions. </p> <p>Her depression compounded until she had a breakdown in March 2011, complete with thoughts of suicide. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, something that would be brought up when she ultimately decided that year to report her rape. </p> <p>The navy convened a panel in the summer of 2011, attended by approximately 25 naval officers, and, extraordinarily, put her medical file on a screen. It exposed her struggles with depression, the antidepressants the navy doctors prescribed her, and her suicidal ideations (such carelessness for her privacy would be <a href=\"http://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Privacy-and-Civil-Liberties/HIPAA-Compliance-within-the-MHS/Military-Command-Exception\">clearly illegal</a> for a civilian organization). In other words, the navy was calling her crazy.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The panel lasted approximately an hour and concluded she was unfit to continue. Kendzior\u2019s military career was over before she was ever even commissioned. The three men who raped her, as far as she knows, became navy officers.</p> <p>A family friend, retired navy captain and Naval Academy alum Jack Reape, considers the hearing a disgrace, calling the assembled navy officers \u201ccowards\u201d and growing emotional when recounting it.</p> <p>In an interview, Reape told the Guardian:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt is one of my great regrets in the navy that I didn\u2019t get on an airplane, fly up there and tell those sons of bitches, \u2018You think you\u2019re going to take on a 20-year old girl?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A lawsuit against the navy and the defense department leadership went nowhere. Kendzior decided against suing her rapists directly, as \u201conce you do that, you give them the microphone\u201d. Instead, she has crusaded against military sexual assault in a high-profile fashion \u2013 ESPN even ran <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/e60/story/_/id/9754343/the-us-military-enemy-within\">a story in 2013</a> on her fight against the Naval Academy \u2013 while serving as a project manager for a Dallas-area IT company and working toward her MBA.</p> <p>\u201cI know I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If I leave without a fight, that\u2019s me giving up and then they win. You have to fight back,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Yet this is how the Naval Academy described Kendzior in her official separation papers: \u201c[S]he does not display leadership or maturity expected of a [senior midshipman] and I do not believe she is capable of reaching \u2018officer-level\u2019 maturity without professional psychological treatment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Rape prosecutions within the military are rare, and convictions rarer still. The survivors advocacy network Protect Our Defenders found that in 2015 only 20% of eligible cases made it to prosecution. Of those, 9% yielded a conviction. </p> <p>\u201cNo one ever tells you what you would feel if you went through the whole process and then didn\u2019t get the result,\u201d said a woman the Guardian will call Sara. </p> <p>In 2012, Sara was at a friend\u2019s house not far from Fort Hood, Texas, where she was stationed. She had drunk some recreational Robitussin and, high, didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the male strangers hitting on her. To get home, she did as she was instructed during the pre-weekend safety briefs and called her squad leader. The squad leader took her back to his apartment and raped her. </p> <p>For months, Sara told hardly anyone what had happened. Her unit had gone through a previous sexual assault episode and she remembered everyone, \u201cmyself included\u201d, refusing to believe the victim out of a sense of camaraderie. The anxiety she developed gave way to panic attacks she didn\u2019t want to explain, and the army assigned her the sedative Klonopin. </p> <p>Sara transferred out of her battalion to avoid seeing her attacker. Her future husband, who encouraged Sara to report the rape, ended up deploying with him. His increasing anger toward the attacker led to the end of his deployment, and at that point, Sara felt she had to come forward for his sake. Without counsel and \u201czombied out\u201d from the Klonopin, she gave a hazy statement to the army\u2019s criminal investigation division that would end up significantly different from a subsequent statement that wasn\u2019t influenced by the drug. </p> <p>Prosecutors, friends and others encouraged Sara to proceed with court-martialing her attacker. They told her that unless she came forward, he would be free to hurt others. Yet the trial featured techniques familiar to civilian women who do the same. \u201cThey said I was mentally ill,\u201d Sara recalled, even using her father\u2019s mental-health history to sow doubt among the jurors. </p> <p>Worse, her former friends lined up as character witnesses for her assailant, an unanticipated consequence of Sara leaving the bond of her old unit. </p> <p>Over a year after her attacker\u2019s acquittal, Sara regrets coming forward. \u201cA huge part of the hurt I still feel from what had happened is now related to what had happened through the court martial and the whole reporting process,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd291cec30e8345c71e1ea2f75ab3012b250f4b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd291cec30e8345c71e1ea2f75ab3012b250f4b8/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former US Navy Petty Officer Third Class Brian Lewis testified before Congress in 2013 about being sexually assaulted by a superior officer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former US navy petty officer third class Brian Lewis testified before Congress in 2013 about being sexually assaulted by a superior officer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtney Perry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Brian Lewis\u2019s case, reporting his own assault to command led to reprisals. </p> <p>Lewis, 36, joined the navy in 1997 and became a submariner. He recalls his days aboard subs with pride. Only when he was moved to the USS Frank Cable, a submarine tender, was he raped, pierside, aboard the ship.</p> <p>For over two weeks while their ship was under way, Brian Lewis had nowhere to escape from his attacker, a senior noncommissioned officer. They were in the Pacific Ocean, steaming away from their Guam homeport. Lewis became fearful of going to sections of the USS Frank Cable required for his job. He began cutting himself and ended up needing medical evacuation to Japan. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to hide when you only have 600 feet or so to run from somebody,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lewis, who was 20 in 2000, took the attack to his command. He was told to let it drop. It was the era of don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell, and the infamous policy of closeting LGBT service members had a perverse effect on sexual assault victims. \u201cYou know,\u201d Lewis remembers an officer telling him, \u201chomosexual activity is grounds for discharge.\u201d Out of fear, Lewis followed his command\u2019s advice not to report the rape.</p> <p>Lewis had no prior psychiatric problems, but the PTSD resulting from the rape \u201csavaged my life\u201d. When he complained about receiving no medical treatment other than a perfunctory pill prescription \u2013 a situation echoing the heavy medication given to Kendzior and Sara \u2013 Lewis received a diagnosis of a personality disorder, followed by a discharge from service. </p> <p>\u201cIf the military has to medically retire you, they\u2019re on the hook for payouts for potentially the remainder of your life, as well as healthcare. So there\u2019s a monetary savings there,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my case, it was retaliation for complaining about the lack of medical treatment I was receiving at the time \u2026 the fact that I had talked to my command about being a victim and then for saying, \u2018Look, you need to do more than simply give me pills.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1aaeffcbe07f834dc83bfdccfd37741f5530822b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aaeffcbe07f834dc83bfdccfd37741f5530822b/0_286_5898_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heath Phillips: \u2018There are still things that spark my memory, and I\u2019m shaking and I\u2019m scared.\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillips: \u2018He told me I needed to buck up and become a man and fight back.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Lavalette/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis joined the military so he would have money for college. Phillips also came from a working-class background, but while he wanted to help his family financially \u2013 even dropping out of school to enlist early so his mother would have one fewer mouth to feed \u2013 serving had always been his dream.</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s father and stepfather were both Vietnam veterans, and as he grew up in the 1980s steeped in pro-military pop culture, he worked out a plan. First he\u2019d join the navy and then he\u2019d transition to the army, like his father and stepdad. Even boot camp in 1988 was a dream come true: \u201cIt was like family. We worked together, these people helped me, I was pampered.\u201d </p> <p>So when his shipmates from the ammunition ship USS Butte invited him to hang out in New York City, Phillips didn\u2019t hesitate. It was his first time in the city and Times Square wowed him, especially when the men he wanted to be like started pouring him drinks back at their hotel. Phillips was no novice to drinking, but something in his beer made him groggy. </p> <p>\u201cThe next thing you know, I\u2019m waking up, I\u2019m on the floor, and what\u2019s waking me up was the tug of my pants. Soon as I open up my eyes \u2013 I was laying on my back \u2013 I open up my eyes and there\u2019s this guy standing above me with his genitals in his hand,\u201d Phillips remembered, while another man had a hand on Phillips\u2019s own genitals. When he ran to the bathroom to escape them, he heard his shipmates laughing at him. </p> <p>When Phillips got back to the Butte, he immediately told the master-at-arms what had happened. The master-at-arms asked if Phillips was homesick. He denied it. \u201cI think you\u2019re lying. I think you just want to go back home,\u201d Phillips remembers being told. </p> <p>The New York assault was a prologue of what Phillips was in for aboard ship. His shipmates threw urine on him, stuffed his pillow with feces, threw him out of his bunk and pulled his mouth open. They would force their genitals inside, telling Phillips that if he bit down, they would kill him. No one interfered to protect him.</p> <p>\u201cThese guys were not doing this to sexually be gratified,\u201d but rather to dominate him, Phillips said. \u201cI\u2019m 45 years old and I still have nightmares from this. I\u2019m 45 and there are still things that spark my memory, and I\u2019m shaking and I\u2019m scared.\u201d </p> <p>After weeks of escalating attacks, Phillips walked to a storage area and tried to hang himself. It didn\u2019t work. A petty officer came across him and helped him down before \u201csmacking the crap out of me. He told me I needed to buck up and become a man and fight back.\u201d The rape was anything but a secret aboard the ship. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m 45 years old, and I still have nightmares from this</p> <footer> <cite>Heath Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Suicidal, humiliated and alone, Phillips went Awol. He returned to his upstate New York home, living in abandoned cars or on the streets to dodge the police knocking on his parents\u2019 doors to find him. That didn\u2019t work either: Phillips ended up jailed, and from there, transferred to a naval brig.</p> <p>Soon, he was back aboard the Butte, where the attacks got worse. He was now known as a snitch. When his shipmates raped him in the shower with a shampoo bottle and a toilet brush, the infirmary informed him that he had suffered a hemorrhoid rupture.</p> <p>Phillips would never have the military career of his boyhood dreams. His navy service was a cycle of rape and incarceration until he received an other-than-honorable discharge. He was back home at just 18 years old, where he turned to drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>It took Phillips two decades to reach his rock bottom, that night on the road. His recovery has seen him extensively research sexual assault in the military; fight a veterans affairs department that maintains his trauma is not related to his service; and try to help others who went through what he did. </p> <p>Now, Phillips is the executive director of Mr MST, or <a href=\"http://mrmst.org/\">Men Recovering from Military Sexual Trauma</a>, a group Lewis co-founded. On 21 September, they spoke at a briefing in Washington hosted by the bipartisan chairs of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus. </p> <p>A report last year from the Government Accountability Office raised alarms about the military addressing male sexual assault. The Pentagon\u2019s health affairs office has not \u201csystematically identified whether male victims have any gender-specific needs\u201d, it <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-284\">found</a>, nor has it \u201cestablished goals or metrics to gauge sexual assault-related issues for male servicemembers.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe perception in DC is that they understand military sexual trauma,\u201d Phillips said, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s a man\u2019s issue.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Men and women who have survived military sexual assault have concrete ideas for the Pentagon on how to fix this crisis. Many back a measure championed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, to take prosecuting rape out of the chain of command, an effort at removing a conflict of interest for commanders who have to weigh a servicemember\u2019s value to a mission or unit against an accusation of assault. </p> <p>But the Pentagon is wary of any measure changing the chain of command, the backbone of military discipline and effectiveness, and Gillibrand\u2019s effort was defeated in June. </p> <p>Kendzior said she doesn\u2019t understand why the services will undergo extensive testing for changes in uniform camouflage patterns but won\u2019t pilot a sexual assault prevention program free of the influence of command in a non-deployment atmosphere, like a service academy. </p> <p>\u201cThis epidemic is undermining our military and its ability to attract our nation\u2019s best,\u201d Kendzior said. She said she has heard from talented young women who are ruling out military service to avoid being sexually harassed or assaulted. </p> <p>Kendzior and her father Russ back Gillibrand\u2019s bill. So does Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. </p> <p>Kendzior\u2019s father, Russ, has a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN sign in one of the rooms of his house. He doesn\u2019t trust Clinton \u2013 \u201cher husband is a predator,\u201d he said \u2013 and supports Trump. Although he concedes Trump has \u201csexist views\u201d, he hopes that Trump\u2019s mantra of change will extend to stopping military rape.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, he better put up. I want to put him on the spot: Mr Trump, I\u2019m leaning in your direction. You prove to me and my daughter, who is a victim of sexual assault, and all the Annies and Andys out there, that you are going to make a change,\u201d said Russ Kendzior.</p> <p>Other sexual assault survivors do not share the same faith in the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Lewis finds Trump\u2019s statements abhorrent. \u201cMr Trump demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge on the issue of military sexual assault in particular and on sexual assault generally,\u201d he says. \u201cThe issue of military sexual assault is not one that\u2019s gender-specific, and the integration of men and women together in the units is not the primary cause or any cause of sexual assault in our military.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cWe still contend with a stigma. Whether true or not for an individual, we [male survivors] are still seen in some quarters as homosexual. Unfortunately, that\u2019s a societal stigma as a whole, but still, that perception adds to the sense of isolation and vulnerability that exists as part of the American definition of masculinity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy failing to acknowledge that 53% of victims are men in our armed forces, Mr Trump has effectively excluded a majority of victims \u2013 men \u2013 from the conversation regarding how to address this particular issue.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump <a href=\"http://www.protectourdefenders.com/statement-protect-our-defenders-responds-to-donald-trumps-clueless-and-incomprehensible-comments-on-military-sexual-assault/\">stood his ground</a> during a forum in September, retired air force colonel Don Christensen, the president of Protect Our Defenders, said: \u201cMr Trump\u2019s destructive victim blaming shows he fundamentally misunderstands the problem. It diminishes women\u2019s enormous contributions to our nation\u2019s defense and ignores the fact that more than 50% of the victims are male.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis tweet was despicable. What can you say?\u201d added Susan Burke, a prominent lawyer who has represented military sexual assault survivors, including Kendzior. \u201cWe were all quite disappointed that President Obama did not support the [Gillibrand] legislative fix. We are hopeful that President Clinton will.\u201d</p> <p><em> In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

The definition of marriage would change: The definition of marriage in s5 of the Marriage Act would be changed to replace \u201ca man and a woman\u201d with \u201ctwo people\u201d.</p> <p>2. The conditions for a valid marriage would stay the same: It will continue to be the case that a marriage would be void if, for example, the parties are in a \u2018prohibited relationship\u2019, consent was not real, or one or both parties are not of marriageable age.</p> <p>3. Foreign same-sex marriages would be recognised in Australia: All valid marriage solemnised under the law of a foreign country, including same-sex marriages, would be recognised in Australia if they are consistent with Australian law. A foreign marriage would not be valid in Australia if the marriage would be unlawful in Australia, for example, if the parties are siblings, in a parent-child relationship, or are polygamous.</p> <p>4. Existing protections for ministers of religion would be retained and strengthened: ministers of religion would be able to refuse to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man and a woman, if that refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the minister\u2019s religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of the religion, or if (irrespective of the teachings of his or her church) the minister has a conscientious objection to same-sex marriage.</p> <p>5. Marriage celebrants (including those who are not ministers of religion) would be able to refuse to marry a same-sex couple: In addition to the existing law whereby marriage celebrants are under no obligation to solemnise marriage, the Marriage Act would be amended to allow marriage celebrants who are not ministers of religion to refuse, on the basis of conscientious or religious beliefs, to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man or a woman. Religious bodies and religious organisations would also be able to refuse to provide facilities, goods or services for the purpose of solemnisation of a same-sex marriage, or for purposes reasonably incidental thereto, if the refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents to that religion.<br></p> <p>In the event that the parliament passes the plebiscite bill, the government proposes the establishment of a joint select committee to review and report on the exposure draft.

Protections would be offered for religious organisations and celebrants involved in the marriage ceremony but not small businesses.</li> <li>Labor will meet this morning to decide their final position on the plebiscite bill that needs to pass for the plebiscite to be conducted. </li> </ol> <p>Apart from those points, these are the political points:</p> <ol> <li>Conservatives are unhappy that the amendments do not go far enough because small businesses are not offered protection on the grounds of freedom of speech \u2013 the so-called wedding cake clause.</li> <li>The LGBTI community say the amendments do not go far enough to force religious organisations to comply with the law. </li> <li>LGBTI community representatives are pushing the Labor party to oppose the plebiscite due to the fear of hate speech and the argument that no other human rights issues need to go to a plebiscite.</li> <li><strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong> said this morning that Brandis released the draft marriage amendments at 11pm last night and expected Labor to decide overnight.</li> <li>Plibersek also said \u201cmeh\u201d to the changes, given the draft bill still doesn\u2019t answer the mental health concerns of a divisive debate, nor the $200m cost of the plebiscite.</li> <li>Brandis said while Labor may complain, in his meeting with his shadow minister <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong> and <strong>Terri Butler</strong>, Labor refused nine times to suggest what changes they would like to the plebiscite bill. They are not serious, says Brandis.</li> </ol> <p>He argued on Sky that the amendments set out the general rules of the act \u2013 the rest is up to the courts. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People will always be able to dream up borderline cases, I mean that is what courts are for to interpret acts of parliament. All we can do in acts of parliament is to explain a general rule. And the general rule we have created is an absolute exemption for ministers of religion. An absolute exemption on conscientious grounds for civil celebrants and an absolute exemption for churches and religious bodies in relation to the provision of facilities or the sale of goods or services reasonably incidental to a same-sex marriage ceremony.</p> </blockquote> <p>OK there is a whole lot more in Brandis\u2019s remarks, which I will bring you in the minute.

The person said Walden said he expects even more erosion in Trump\u2019s numbers now.</p> <p>The people on the call spoke on condition of anonymity because the call was private.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fbc79de4b05d11acf9eb27\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/steven-w-thrasher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T16:59:58.395Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Snubbed at the debate: Black Lives Matter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On Sunday night, I wanted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Donald Trump to delve into real talk about race in America.

And after weeks of reading from a teleprompter as part of an attempt to project a more disciplined demeanor to attract more independents or quell concerns among suburban women, Trump on Monday left little doubt he was now appealing strictly to his base.</p> <p>It was perhaps all the Republican nominee had left.</p> <p>Members of Trump\u2019s party were left reeling from the political fallout, prompting leaders to shift their attention toward the impact on down-ballot races. </p> <p>Ryan, in his conference call with members on Monday morning, said he would no longer defend Trump, nor would he campaign with him.
