  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s core supporters may back his views on curbing immigration \u2013 but they disagree with him over global trade and US involvement in Nato, an opinion poll has found.</p> <p>Trump has made opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal between the US and Asia a central theme of his populist campaign, but more of his base favour it (49%) than oppose it (46%), according to the <a href=\"https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/america-age-uncertainty?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ccs-report\">2016 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey</a>.</p> <p>In another surprising finding, despite Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/07/03/484574128/sanders-centers-platform-fight-on-trans-pacific-trade-deal\">vocal criticism of the TPP</a> during the Democratic primary, some 56% of his supporters back the agreement, as do 74% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>The annual survey suggests a gap between the views of those who shout loudest during the presidential election and the more nuanced positions of many Democratic and Republican voters on the ground, most of whom want America to remain engaged with the world.</p> <p>As expected, immigration does seem to be a vote winner for Trump, who has been accused of inciting hatred and violence. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video\">Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigrants</a> and refugees has most clearly struck a chord with his base,\u201d notes the report, published on Thursday. \u201cOn each and every question concerning immigration, Trump\u2019s core supporters are the least favorable.\u201d</p> <p>An overwhelming majority of core Trump supporters (80%) agree that immigration is a critical threat to the US \u2013 almost double the percentage among the general public (43%). Six in 10 Trump supporters believe that undocumented immigrants in the US should be forced to leave their jobs, and the country. And nine in 10 Trump supporters support \u201cexpanding the 700 miles of border wall and fencing with Mexico\u201d. The public overall is divided on expanding the wall, and 58% support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>On other issues, however, Trump\u2019s regular battle cries appear to have less resonance. Although the Republican candidate said in July that \u201cNato is obsolete\u201d and complained that \u201cmany member countries [are] not paying their fair share\u201d, 51% of his followers want to keep the US commitment to the military alliance as it is now and 9% actually want to increase it. Just 13% favour withdrawal from Nato.<br></p> <p>While Trump has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy</a> and said US allies must pay for the cost of being defended, his backers are equally or more likely than other Americans to support long-term US military bases in Australia, Germany, Japan and South Korea.</p> <p>Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/public-opinion-and-americas-next-global-priorities\">told an audience at the Wilson Center thinktank</a> in Washington on Thursday: \u201cThe numbers are quite surprising. Even among core Trump supporters, 60% think that the United States should either maintain or increase its commitment to Nato. It\u2019s 75% for Americans overall. That\u2019s a remarkable number.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gratifying to see that in this, and in fact in so many other aspects of the poll, you find an American public that remains dedicated to the kind of open, engaged foreign policy and global engagement that we in many ways have taken for granted for a very long time and has been the basis until very recently of a bipartisan political consensus in this country.\u201d</p> <p>A decade ago more Republicans than Democrats said globalisation had been good for the US, but now 74% of Democrats view globalisation in a positive light compared with 59% of Republicans. Daalder added: \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strong number. You wouldn\u2019t know that if you talked to any congressman or senator from the Democratic party. Maybe one or two dinosaurs are still there but there are not many of them.\u201d</p> <p>The findings suggest that politicians are not always in touch with the public mood, Kori Schake, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said during the same panel discussion: \u201cOne of the things that I found most interesting in the numbers is that 56% of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters support the TPP. A vast majority of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters support it and you would never know that from listening to the campaign rhetoric.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">Clinton has joined Sanders and Trump </a>in opposing the TPP in what some see as an expedient move, although Schake speculated that, if elected, she might find a way to modify it while keeping it essentially intact.</p> <p>The survey was conducted from 10 to 27 June among a representative national sample of 2,061 adults. The label of \u201ccore Trump supporter\u201d was based on respondents\u2019 answer to a presidential preference question.</p> <p>The report concludes: \u201cThe changing demographic makeup of America will likely transform the political dynamics, given that younger and non-white Americans are more supportive of globalization, immigration and increasing ties to the world. But in the near term, the attitudes and opinions that brought Trump to the fore of American politics will remain \u2013 and could very well strengthen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/ava-duvernay-selma-13th-interview-criminal-justice-system\" title=\"\">Ava DuVernay</a>, director of the Martin Luther King drama Selma, has made a fiercely radical documentary for Netflix in sympathy with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. Her film argues that America\u2019s incarceration of black men is a phenomenon with its roots in slavery, and that the resemblances are not minor or ironic echoes but symptoms of the same structural cause. Ironically, it is about the 13th constitutional amendment, which abolished slavery and the state\u2019s right to deprive a person of liberty but with the specific exception of \u201ccriminals\u201d, thus forging a link in the judicial mindset between imprisonment and slavery. It is an attitude that persists into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/mississippi-anti-lgbt-law-derrick-errick-simmons-greenville\" title=\"\">Jim Crow era</a>, the Nixon/Reagan wars on crime and drugs, the Clinton three-strikes rule \u2026 and beyond. The state\u2019s punitive energies were always targeted at the poorest, the least able to pay bail, the likeliest to be involved in crime and the most liable to have their protest criminalised. It\u2019s like taking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/the-red-pill-reddit-modern-misogyny-manosphere-men\" title=\"\">Matrix red pill</a> when you listen to statements from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/16/us/john-d-ehrlichman-nixon-aide-jailed-for-watergate-dies-at-73.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Nixon aide John Ehrlichman</a> and Reagan consigliere Lee Atwater making it clear that attacks on \u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201ccrime\u201d are euphemisms for race. And with private firms running jails and lobbying Washington, black males have become raw material for a corporate legal industry. An intensely angry and persuasive piece of film-making, though maybe letting Bill and Hillary off the hook, a little bit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V66F3WU2CKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for 13th</figcaption> </figure>",

So we have a choice \u2013 retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.\u201d </p> <p>In an election year characterised by a wave of anti-trade sentiment from Trump and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders, Obama contends that globalisation has been by far a net positive for the American economy.</p> <p>\u201cLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade,\u201d Obama contends. \u201cWhile some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Clinton has joined Trump and Sanders in speaking out against the TPP, although some analysts suspect that, should she win the presidency, she will seek to repackage the deal in a manner that allows her to approve it. Obama pledges to keep pushing for Congress to pass the TPP because, he says, it will level the playing field for workers and businesses.</p> <p>In an obvious swipe at Trump, Obama writes of the current air of discontent: \u201cThe anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798</a>, the Know-Nothings of the mid-1800s, the anti-Asian sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again.\u201d</p> <p>But he acknowledges that some of the unrest is rooted in \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality resulting in slower income growth for low- and middle-income families. The financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/2016-economy-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-reagan\">Back to the future: economy becomes battle between Reagan and Bill Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton is attempting a broad church election campaign that embraces some ideas from Sanders, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn\">a self-proclaimed socialist</a>, but also has the centrist Obama as a leading surrogate. During an electrifying primary campaign, Sanders argued for the breakup of the Wall Street banks. But the president urges against quick fix solutions. </p> <p>\u201cFurther progress requires recognising that America\u2019s economy is an enormously complicated mechanism,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract \u2013 breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports \u2013 the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people.\u201d</p> <p>Obama does, however, devote a section of the essay to widening inequality \u2013 a key theme of Sanders and Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eugene-robinson-elizabeth-warren-makes-the-case-on-income-inequality/2014/10/20/ba54c68e-588a-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2_story.html?utm_term=.36595d694337\">senator Elizabeth Warren</a> \u2013 and its negative economic and moral consequences. In 1979, he says, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all after-tax income; by 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We don\u2019t begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, we\u2019ve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better.\u201d</p> <p>He cites technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage as factors in growing inequality. \u201cBut I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels \u2013 at church, at their children\u2019s schools, in civic organisations.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why CEOs took home about 20 to 30 times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why today\u2019s CEO is now paid over 250 times more.\u201d</p> <p>He urges the next occupant of the White House: \u201cIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition.\u201d</p> <p>He also calls for increasing the federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children and limiting tax breaks for high-income households.</p> <p>Obama further notes that in 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the workforce. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of prime-age women were out of the workforce. Today, it is 26%.</p> <p>\u201cInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among non-college-educated Americans \u2013 the group where labour-force participation has fallen most precipitously.\u201d</p> <p>Obama proposes increasing access to community colleges and providing wage insurance to those workers who cannot find a job that pays as well as their previous one. He says paid leave and guaranteed sick leave would also encourage flexibility that could lead to more people working. </p> <p>Championing the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2008 financial crisis from turning into a great depression, Obama says a foundation was laid for a better future. He suggests that the US should prepare for negative shocks to the economy before they occur and not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,\u201d he writes. </p>",
  "<p>This tumultuous election season is deserving of a soundtrack, one that captures the chaos of conflicting values that is ripping the country apart at the seams. </p> <p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/496689769/first-listen-live-drive-by-truckers-american-band\">American Band</a>, the 14th album by <a href=\"http://www.drivebytruckers.com/\">Drive-By Truckers</a> that deftly captures the mood of this country over recent years. It\u2019s a lean set of songs that serve as an urgent rallying cry against the divisiveness played out on the streets of Ferguson, Baton Rouge and Dallas, but also on the presidential campaign trail where rhetoric has become lighter fluid stoking the flames higher. </p> <p>Defiant guitar riffs open the album to the story of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/06/us/leader-of-rifle-group-affirms-that-he-shot-bot-to-death-in-1931.html\">Ramon Casiano</a>, the 15-year-old Mexican boy killed by the former head of the National Rifle Association in 1931, and continues with the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a> \u2013 \u201cIf you say it wasn\u2019t racial when they shot him in his tracks / I guess that means you ain\u2019t black,\u201d Patterson Hood sings on What It Means \u2013 as well as revisiting the tensions created by the the endless war on terror and recurring racial violence back home.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQQB7rkZZmk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aQQB7rkZZmk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The band has been here before. In 2001 the Truckers laid their claim for immortality with <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/southern-rock-opera-mw0000660406\">Southern Rock Opera</a>, a double album that pronounced southern identity as more complex than Confederate flags and racial scorn. Instead, Hood reimagines the southern experience through the eyes of a kid from Alabama who uses music as a conduit to greater things. As the title suggests, the songs are epic, the guitars are plentiful, and the references proudly regional. The album was widely praised, not just for its literate storytelling, but also for how it reclaimed southern rock from the state fair circuit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/05/southern-rock-passion-marred-racism\">Lynyrd Skynyrd cover bands</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople kept telling us what a terrible idea it was and it would be the end to our promising young career, but it felt right to us. We had a vision it was going to be and we followed it,\u201d he says. \u201cTurned out it worked.\u201d</p> <p>Hood, too, is a child of Alabama. He grew up outside of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/21/muscle-shoals-alabama-documentary\">Muscle Shoals</a>, home to the famed recording studio where his father, David Hood, served as a member the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-muscle-shoals-rhythm-section-mn0001352027/biography\">Muscle Shoals rhythm section</a>, playing bass on hundreds of recordings by Aretha Franklin, the Staple Singers, Etta James, Bobby Womack and Wilson Pickett. At an early age the younger Hood broke from the sports culture of north Alabama and turned to writing for refuge. It ignited a passion for politics. In the third grade he turned in a paper about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\">Watergate</a> that suggested that President Nixon \u201cshould be tarred and feathered and tried for treason\u201d. The teacher sent him home. </p> <p>\u201cTo me, the political is personal. Because it\u2019s not a sporting event where, at the end of the day, the team clocks out and moves on. There are very real things that that happen,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Yet this album almost didn\u2019t. By late 2015 the band planned to take this year off after an extended touring regimen following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/27/drive-by-truckers-english-oceans-review\">English Oceans</a>, their record from the previous year. Hood had relocated his family to Portland while Mike Cooley, his main collaborator, remained in Georgia aiming to write his first solo record. Soon enough the headlines laid both plans to rest: police overreach, street protests, the mainstreaming of the far right. \u201cSongs started coming for both of us,\u201d he said. Over three days in November the band cut nine of them; another three days in January finished the job. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY0qOCUy27Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mY0qOCUy27Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of the revelations of American Band is how this isn\u2019t a record that can be easily plastered on a protest sign or blasted at a rally. The songs go deeper in that they tell stories with human faces and personal testimony. For that reason no other band than this one can claim the mantle to the golden years of Bruce Springsteen. On Ever South, Hood traces his people\u2019s journey from Ellis Island to Appalachia where, once tormented as outsiders, they became the tormentors under the revival tent of Christian fervor. </p> <p>Another song connects the dots back to the fallout from 9/11 when in 2001 <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/usa/358957-911-clear-channel-memo/\">Clear Channel Communications, now iHeartMedia, released a list of 165 songs, including John Lennon\u2019s Imagine, for a suggested airplay ban</a> because they were \u201clyrically questionable\u201d in contradicting the thirst for war. On Once They Banned Imagine, Cooley sings of the same frenzy continuing today: \u201cWith or against, something been out to get us / and it looked like something finally did.\u201d </p> <p>For a band known for long shows and double albums \u2013 a consequence of there being three songwriters in the lineup \u2013 American Band is surprisingly lean and concise, with the 11 songs clocking in at about 45 minutes together. That was intentional, Hood says, to cater to the attention spans of those people who need to hear it the most. With so much talk in the media about southern white males clinging to the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, there is a silent caucus representing those, like Hood, who are white middle-aged men in the south who consider him anathema to the republic.</p> <p>\u201cThat is a big reason why this record exists. I am as truly in his demographic as you can get and I don\u2019t want anyone for a second to think that SOB speaks for me,\u201d he says. \u201cAlabama is a red state, but there are people who feel otherwise there. There\u2019s no shortage of people who feel that way, but they\u2019re not the ones being heard because they are not as loud. There needs to be more middle-aged southern dudes saying that black lives matter.\u201d</p> <p>American Band is also a statement on the state of the Truckers, which, besides Cooley and Hood, include bassist Matt Patton, multi-instrumentalist Jay Gonzalez and drummer Brad Morgan. This is the band\u2019s 20th year and the record is evidence that the urgency the band sparked in its first half thrives today. Much of that has to do with Hood\u2019s 31-year relationship with Cooley that, contentious at times, stands on its contradictory strengths, not just in songwriting but also in musical flourishes, like how Cooley\u2019s guitar spikes Hood\u2019s quieter songs with gnarly guitar licks, and the same in reverse.</p> <p>The band will tour on the record through late February and then another month in Europe before returning again come summer. By then the US will have a new president, which will make the record more relevant, no matter the outcome. \u201cOur families got back behind this record now, which is wonderful,\u201d Hood says. \u201cThat tells us we\u2019re doing something we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d</p>",

It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u2019s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, Hammond\u2019s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. </p> <p>The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion.

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance.

  "<p>Book reviews tend to make news only if they are particularly savage or concern a hotly anticipated book. So Hitler, by Volker Ullrich \u2013 the umpteenth biography of the dictator, translated from the German and published in America this month \u2013 would seem an unlikely candidate. Last week, however, Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times\u2019 chief book critic, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/books/hitler-ascent-volker-ullrich.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">did something extraordinary</a>: without ever making it explicit, she wrote an entire review about something, or rather someone, else.</p> <p>From the opening paragraph \u2013 in which Kakutani cites an eminent magazine editor in 1930 describing Hitler as a \u201chalf-insane rascal\u201d, a \u201cpathetic dunderhead\u201d, a \u201cnowhere fool\u201d and a \u201cbig mouth\u201d \u2013 one can start to guess the direction she\u2019s looking in.</p> <p>But that is only the beginning. What happens next is, by the standards of the genteel world of book reviewing, a breach of protocol so wild it has been pinballing around social media ever since. Kakutani dispenses with a conventional review and instead, as if we have reached a point in history when fine sentences are a luxury we can no longer afford, strips Ullrich\u2019s research down to nine, acutely angled bullet points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/denial-review-rachel-weisz-holocaust-david-irving-toronto-film-festival\">Denial review \u2013 Rachel Weisz makes heavy weather of Holocaust courtroom drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, \u201cHitler was often described as an egomaniac who \u2018only loved himself\u2019 \u2013 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatisation and what Mr Ullrich calls a \u2018characteristic fondness for superlatives\u2019.\u201d Or, \u201cHitler was known, among colleagues, for a \u2018bottomless mendacity\u2019.\u201d Or, \u201cHitler virtually wrote the modern playbook on demagoguery, arguing in Mein Kampf that propaganda must appeal to the emotions \u2013 not the reasoning powers \u2013 of the crowd.\u201d As the review proceeds, it becomes increasingly clear she has a current nominee for president in mind.</p> <p>The climax comes two-thirds of the way into the review, when Kakutani extracts from Ullrich\u2019s book the fact that, because serious politicians in Germany considered Hitler a buffoon and a lightweight, dismissing him as \u201ca celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \u2018evening\u2019s entertainment\u2019\u201d, they did not see the imminent danger.

I forgot about the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/tim-kaine-mike-pence-debate-religion-abortion-42574576\">vice-presidential debate</a>. Darn.</p> <p>My first reaction to Mike Pence and Tim Kaine\u2019s head-to-head was to try to remember how or why anyone watched presidential debates when they were just two white guys interrupting each other. And my second, when Pence introduced the topic of abortion, was a feeling of creeping dread. These two men were about to climb into the wombs of all American women and plant their flags \u2013 an operation every bit as uncomfortable as it sounds.</p> <p>Elaine Quijano, the moderator, asked both outspokenly religious candidates if they could discuss a time when they struggled to balance their faith and a public policy position. Kaine described his personal struggle in implementing the death penalty. And Pence, in an immaculate segue, talked about how he struggled to balance his faith with a <em>Clinton</em> policy position. On abortion. </p> <p>I knew what was coming. Because I am from Ireland: a country where male abortion oration has been exalted to an art form. To give examples from just the past week (otherwise the selection would be overwhelming), on Sunday Senator Ronan Mullen wrote <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/ronan-mullen-repeal-turns-to-repulse-in-war-of-weasel-words-35096233.html\">a column</a> for the Irish Independent vilifying women who travel to England to terminate pregnancies with fatal abnormalities. For Mullen, these women have denied a sick baby \u201cthe dignity of being allowed to reach a natural end. The same day, Archbishop Eamon Martin <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/archbishop-tells-politicians-to-remember-their-faith-when-debating-abortion-laws-35096605.html\">warned Irish politicians</a> \u201cnot to leave their faith outside of the door\u201d when forming abortion policy (which, trust me, they were never planning to do anyway).</p> <p>I am from a country where, earlier this year, the group Family &amp; Life held <a href=\"http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/post/137604518384/all-male-pro-life-talk-great-see\">a pro-life event</a> in which all three speakers were men. Men who, when questioned, saw nothing strange about the gendered composition of their learned gathering. I\u2019m from a country where national radio shows <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/ray-darcy-8th-amendment-2986715-Sep2016/\">routinely exclude</a> Irish women from debates about their reproductive rights. I knew what was coming.</p> <p>Kaine would play the coveted part of the liberal man distancing himself from the immorality of abortion (he would never have one himself), yet magnanimously conceding that he does not have the political right to extend his superior moral code to women. Pence would play the righteous conservative, possessed of the political courage to back up moral convictions that, really, both men share. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/05/vp-debate-abortion-kaine-pence-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5666p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2779864\"            data-video-name=\"Tim Kaine and Mike Pence clash on abortion at vice-presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f5375fe4b0e2a2a25af4f4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005abortionvp_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005abortionvp.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005abortionvp_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/05/vp-debate-abortion-kaine-pence-video\">Tim Kaine and Mike Pence clash on abortion at vice-presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>On cue, Pence began to speak in a concerned moral tone about the horrors of late- term abortions, even though <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states\">98.7%</a> of abortions happen before 21 weeks and, after the murder of Dr George Tiller, there are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf3rETOO62s\">only four</a> third-trimester abortion providers left in the entire US. </p> <p>Kaine exposed the wicked ruse of this focus on late term abortion: his opponent \u2013 gasp \u2013 actually wants to ban all abortions. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust women?\u201d our liberal ally proclaimed, simultaneously purporting to personally accept Catholic teaching on the issue, <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm\">ie</a> \u2013 that life begins at conception and abortion is evil.

It was time for the pair to exchange quotes from the Bible. \u201cBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you,\u201d Pence intoned in the actual voice of God, leaving me to wonder if he was talking to sperm because, technically, the almighty does appear to be referencing the period before womb inhabitation.</p> <p>Pence defended Donald Trump\u2019s publicly expressed opinion that women who have abortions should be punished by saying that Trump isn\u2019t \u201cpolished\u201d. But never fear, Kaine was ready with, \u201ca great quote from Matthew.\u201d St Matthew that is. \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.\u201d Bam! Take that conservative male abortion orator, you just got hallowed-out by the liberal guy.</p> <p>The next day, a New York Times editorial <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/opinion/mike-pences-fantasy-running-mate.html\">commended</a> the abortion section of the debate as \u201ca strong moment for both candidates\u201d, which \u201coffered a rare glimpse of politicians intelligently exploring a fraught question\u201d. It noted that the abortion issue has been largely absent from this campaign.</p> <p>It has been largely absent only if you ignore Clinton\u2019s consistent attention to Trump\u2019s anti-choice rhetoric; how she proudly touts the endorsement of Planned Parenthood (the first endorsement of a primary candidate in the organization\u2019s 100 year history); that she is running on a ticket supporting repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion. The abortion issue has been absent only if you ignore the fact that Clinton is about as provocatively pro-choice as any presidential candidate has dared to be. </p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s feminist politics are beside the point somehow. What\u2019s really exceptional is when two men bare their souls on what abortion means to them. With those pesky women out of the way, they can intelligently explore this fraught question.</p>",
  "<p>The problems with referendums are well known: they reduce often complex questions to a binary choice; they are a demagogue\u2019s dream, allowing populists free rein to fan fears, distort realities and appeal to emotions; voters can see them as a chance to voice their unhappiness about something else entirely.</p> <p>And yet referendums are on the rise.

Before David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, the last European prime minister to resign after ending up on the wrong side of a plebiscite was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1972\">Norway</a>, in 1972.</p> <p>From the 70s to the 90s, Qvortrup said, politicians largely felt confident about who was voting for them and why. Large, mainstream parties of the centre left and right dominated the political scene and most voters trusted them to make decisions. In many countries that is no longer so; politics are becoming increasingly fragmented, and voters sceptical and disaffected.</p> <p>Research by S\u00f6ren<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>Holmberg, a Swedish academic, had shown that voters in the 1970s agreed with up to 90% of their chosen party\u2019s platform, Qvortrup said, whereas today that figure was 60%. Moreover, referendums are often confidence votes and statistics show the longer a party has been in power the less support it can expect in a plebiscite.</p> <p>Most voters do not want too much of a good thing. Having \u201chired\u201d politicians in much the same way as they hire an estate agency, Qvortrup suggested, the public expects their houses to be sold for them at the right price, without being constantly quizzed about the details.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the recent return of the referendum may also fit with a move away from the \u201cpackage deal\u201d, he added.

  "<p>Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister once seen as a great reformist hope after years of economic stagnation, is at risk of becoming the next political casualty of an unwanted referendum result, with polls showing him facing tough opposition before a critical vote.</p> <p>Renzi headed into a packed auditorium in the north-eastern city of Treviso this week to make his case for a complicated change to the country\u2019s constitution, saying that the referendum scheduled for 4 December would set Italy\u2019s course over the next three decades.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want this country to change \u2013 not for me, not for you, but for the sake of our children \u2013 if you want it to have a simpler system, stand by me, because I can\u2019t make it alone,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cIf the referendum doesn\u2019t pass, over the next 30 years whoever is prime minister will \u2026 be a slave to vetoes, blackmail and bureaucracy,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/political-science/2016/oct/06/why-referendums-are-problematic-yet-more-popular-than-ever\">Why referendums are problematic \u2013 yet more popular than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the face of it, the referendum is centred on a complicated change to Italy\u2019s constitution that Renzi and his allies argue will make the country easier to govern and reform by disempowering the senate, the upper chamber of parliament. Critics of the constitutional change, which has already been approved by parliament but with too small a majority to avoid a referendum, have argued that it is potentially dangerous and leaves too much power in the hands of the executive.<br></p> <p>But, like Britain\u2019s EU referendum, the December vote is not only seen as a debate over the question at hand, in this case a question most suited to a law school seminar.

From the moment \u2013 when he was still fairly popular \u2013 that he vowed to put the issue to the people, he made the vote about himself. In a promise he now surely regrets, he said he would resign if the no vote prevailed and never return to politics.</p> <p>Renzi had not anticipated that voters might lose faith in him, angry that the economy is not improving fast enough and disillusioned by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/maria-elena-boschi-the-italian-mp-fighting-for-reform-and-family\">poor handling of four bank rescues late last year</a> that sparked accusations he was handing out favours to the political elite at the expense of ordinary Italians.</p> <p>The breezy confidence that had once made Renzi look like a man who could recreate a powerful centrist majority to last for generations started to resemble arrogance.</p> <p>\u201cHe thought that his personality and personal position would be an element that would favour the yes vote, and then he realised that, in fact, he was not going to make the yes stronger, but he could be making the no stronger,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of contemporary history at LUISS University in Rome.</p> <p>\u201cHe has been trying to depersonalise the referendum in the last months but it has become difficult for him because he tends to personalise everything, even though he knows he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he added. Orsini said he believed the situation was still far too fluid to predict an outcome. And, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">voters in Britain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/colombia-farc-peace-deal-voter-referendum-reaction\">Colombia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">Hungary</a> have shown in recent months, trying to predict the behaviour of voters in referendums is never easy anyway. </p> <p>Experts think the polls are unreliable. A recent effort by Corriere della Sera found that 23% of the electorate supported a yes vote, 25% were opposed, and 52% were either undecided or would not respond. Another this week by EMG, a polling firm, found 31% in favour, 36% opposed, and 33% were undecided. </p> <p>Renzi\u2019s support is thought to be especially weak in the south and among young voters who are attracted to the populist Five Star Movement (M5S).</p> <p>Voters looking to guidance from their own party establishment have been left frustrated as Renzi\u2019s Partito Democratico (PD) is split \u2013 not unlike Britons who saw a lukewarm endorsement of remain by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. </p> <p>And the complicated nature of the reform itself makes campaigning difficult. \u201cIt takes Renzi five minutes to explain it, whereas if you are [M5S leader] Beppe Grillo all you say is, \u2018It\u2019s about Renzi,\u2019\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence.</p> <p>The proposed change would reduce the number of senators serving in the upper parliament from 315 to 100; those who serve would no longer be elected directly but would be regional representatives instead. Renzi argues the changes will increase political stability in Italy and give lawmakers a better chance to pass tough reforms that could improve the economy but are politically unpopular.</p> <p>One of the biggest concerns about the constitutional change, however, is how it would work in conjunction with a separate electoral reform law \u2013 one that is not included in the referendum \u2013 that would make it easier for a party that won an election to take the majority of seats of parliament\u2019s lower house. </p> <p>In studying the Brexit results, Renzi has probably learned that fear alone will not be enough for a yes victory. In the UK, a slim margin of voters ultimately rejected the view of experts who predicted economic doom if the country left the EU. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/they-need-a-possibility-of-a-future-has-matteo-renzi-given-italy-what-it-needs\">'They need a possibility of a future': has Matteo Renzi given Italy what it needs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Renzi and his supporters can legitimately point to some potentially negative consequences if Italy votes no, beginning with the likely dissolution of the parliament and new elections that could open the door to a victory by the anti-establishment but inexperienced M5S.<br></p> <p>The problem for Renzi is that Italians are not necessarily spooked by political instability: they have witnessed it before \u2013 plenty of it \u2013 and survived. \u201cThe voters will say \u2018I know one thing, you [Renzi] are out and that is good enough for me,\u2019\u201d said Piccoli. \u201cTo scare Italians, the threshold is high.\u201d</p> <p>Renzi has taken that lesson on board.

A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether Donald Trump manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> \n<p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6011b052faaaed6f7ab94217eec26f852b51a891\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6011b052faaaed6f7ab94217eec26f852b51a891/0_245_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march to protest about the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march to protest about the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South \u2013 race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of America\u2019s major transport and financial hubs.</p> \n<p>Pride in North Carolina\u2019s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality. Drive into the state from the north, and road signs quickly herald its repeated ability to win Nobel prizes, celebrating last year\u2019s award of the chemistry prize to a Turkish American biochemist, Aziz Sancar, based at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill.

  "<p>The puzzle that is currently frustrating the pundit minds of America is this: why is Hillary Clinton not simply clobbering Donald Trump? How is this ranting, seething buffoon still competitive with her? Trump has now stumbled through a series of the kind of blunders that break ordinary political campaigns \u2013 the sort of deadly hypocrisies that always kill the demagogue in old movies \u2013 and yet this particular demagogue keeps on trucking. Why?</p> <p>Let us answer that burning pundit question of today by jumping to what will undoubtedly be the next great object of pundit ardor: the legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/19/yes-tried-barack-obama-legacy-gary-younge\">President Barack Obama</a>. Two months from now, when all the TV wise men are playing historian and giving their estimation on where Obama ranks in the pantheon of the greats, they will probably neglect to mention that his legacy helped to determine Hillary\u2019s fortunes in this election cycle. As a beloved figure among Democrats, for example, Obama was instrumental in securing the nomination for her. As a president who has accomplished little since 2011, however, Obama has pretty much undermined Clinton\u2019s ability to sell us on another centrist Democratic presidency. His legacy has diluted her promise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The reform impulse just keeps short-circuiting every time the Democrats try to switch it on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let me put this slightly differently. Hillary Clinton has lots of good policy ideas. She promises many fine things. That these things do not attract more voters to her side is (as many have noted) partially due to her wonkish way of presenting them. But it is even more because of the glaring contradiction between the nice things she says she will do and the failure of Obama to advance the ball very far on those same issues.</p> <p>I was pleased to learn, for example, that this year\u2019s Democratic platform includes strong language on antitrust enforcement, and that Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/upshot/liberal-economists-think-big-companies-are-too-powerful-hillary-clinton-agrees.html\">has hinted</a> she intends to take the matter up as president. Hooray! Taking on too-powerful corporations would be healthy, I thought when I first learned that, and also enormously popular. But then it dawned on me: antitrust enforcement is largely up to the president and his picked advisers. If Democrats really think it is so damned important, why has Clinton\u2019s old boss Barack Obama done so very, very little with it?</p> <p>Or take this <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/clinton-expected-hit-wells-fargo-speech-bad-corporate-040652414--sector.html?ref=gs\">headline </a>from just a few days ago: \u201cClinton promises to hold Wells Fargo accountable\u201d. Go get \u2018em, Hillary! To see a president get tough with elite bankers and with CEOs in general \u2013 that\u2019s something we can all cheer for. But then that nagging voice piped up again: if Democrats think it is so critical to get tough with crooked banksters, why oh why didn\u2019t Barack Obama take the many, many opportunities he had to do so back in the days when it would have really mattered?</p> <p>Where this contradiction gets particularly toxic is on the issue of trade. This is the locomotive of dissatisfaction that Trump means to ride into the White House, and Clinton has tried desperately to neutralize the issue by announcing that she, too, opposes the hated TPP and that she, too, deplores the unfortunate effects certain trade deals have had. And then you open the newspaper and find that her presidential patron and protector, Barack Obama, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/business/international/obama-trade-tpp.html?_r=0\">still</a> pushing the TPP in order to secure his legacy.</p> <p>The reform impulse just keeps short-circuiting every time the Democrats try to switch it on. They talk about healthcare \u2013 and immediately have to say things like <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-obamacare-heck-lot-starting-scratch/story?id=42567432\">this</a> about Obamacare: \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot better than starting from scratch.\u201d They talk about getting college tuition under control \u2013 and everyone remembers that the problem is decades old and that the Dems have done virtually nothing about it all those years. What was without a doubt the worst moment of them all came at the Democratic convention back in July, when Senator Elizabeth Warren <a href=\"http://time.com/4421731/democratic-convention-elizabeth-warren-transcript-speech/\">pronounced</a> on the current state of middle America as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look around. Americans bust their tails, some working two or three jobs, but wages stay flat. Meanwhile, the basic costs of making it from month to month keep going up. Housing, healthcare, child care \u2013 costs are out of sight. Young people are getting crushed by student loans. Working people are in debt. Seniors can\u2019t stretch a social security check to cover the basics.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was a powerful indictment of what Warren called a \u201crigged\u201d system \u2013 except for one thing: that system is presided over by Barack Obama, a man that same Democratic convention was determined to apotheosize as one of the greatest politicians of all times.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t really help matters to claim, as the most ardent Obama defenders do, that the president was powerless before Congress, and that it was therefore impossible for Obama to do anything differently than he did during his eight years. Such fanciful talk may help us to feel better about the current occupant of the Oval, but it also negates his would-be successor\u2019s promises more effectively than any lesser argument you might make against them. It transforms a vote for Hillary from mildly distasteful to almost totally futile.</p> <p>The immediate problem for Democrats this year is simple, really: it is hard to criticize power when your own leader is the most powerful person in the land.</p> <p>The larger problem facing them is the terminal irrelevance of their great, overarching campaign theme. Remember the \u201cman from Hope\u201d? \u201cHope is on the way\u201d? \u201cKeep hope alive\u201d? Well, this year \u201chope\u201d is most assuredly dead. Thanks to Obama\u2019s flagrant hope-dealing in the dark days of 2008 \u2013 followed up by his failure to reverse the disintegration of the middle class \u2013 this favorite Democratic clich\u00e9 has finally become just that: an empty phrase. Today as the Democrats go into battle against Trump, they find that their rallying cry has lost its magic. Hillary is discovering how difficult it is to win an election without hope.</p>",
  "<p>A muscle-heavy man sits, staring unsmiling at the camera, on a throne of yellow plastic water cans.

Tapestries and sculptures made from these objects are intended to highlight Ghana\u2019s water crisis and soaring levels of pollution.

  "<p>The arrival of the immense <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hurricane-matthew-leaves-haiti-facing-humanitarian-crisis-un\" title=\"\">Hurricane Matthew</a> on Haitian land early on Tuesday morning has plunged the Caribbean\u2019s oldest nation into another period of despairing uncertainty. Haiti is ill-prepared to deal with what Matthew brings \u2013 category 4 force winds and a 190-mile outer band of powerful rains pounding the towns and villages along the southwestern coastline and extending all the way to the Dominican Republic. Haiti\u2019s soil already holds the lives of far too many of its children taken by extreme natural disasters.</p> <p>Matthew comes at an especially tense moment for Haiti. This Sunday, Haitians were meant to go to the polls to choose from 27 candidates to cast their vote for the new president of the republic. However, in the wake of Matthew the election has been postponed indefinitely. The poll was to have been a restart of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/haiti-elections-2015-voters-face-long-wait\" title=\"\">controversial first round</a> held in October 2015 that cost millions, only to dissolve in fraudulent results and widespread national protests. This time around, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/13/rotten-system-blamed-haiti-election-stalemate\" title=\"\">campaign had been prolonged</a> by repeated delays and clashes between the electoral council and the candidates.</p> <p>Politics and natural disasters have a way of converging to disturb the state of things in Haiti. In most recent memory the devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/16/the-haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-then-and-now\" title=\"\">2010 earthquake</a> that struck the capital Port-au-Prince and its environs led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, bringing unimaginable trauma. A global outpouring of support drew sympathy and attention but few lasting resources. It also came in an election year. The elections were held at a time when the country, and the world, were still coming to terms with the earthquake. The cost was significant. International assistance addressed short-term needs while repeating the same approaches that had made the scale of the disaster so expansive. In 2004, seven months after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/08/guardiananalysispage\" title=\"\">ousting of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/sep/22/naturaldisasters.climatechange\" title=\"\">Tropical Storm Jeanne</a> deposited 13 inches of water in Haiti and claimed more than 3,000 lives. And as far back as the 19th century, a massive earthquake in the north of Haiti in May 1842 preceded an uprising against president Jean-Pierre Boyer less than a year later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d31e6b799e049eed1dfdf98831a1699c3a305159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31e6b799e049eed1dfdf98831a1699c3a305159/0_152_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The presidency of Michel Martelly was dogged with claims of corruption and state abuse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The presidency of Michel Martelly was dogged with claims of corruption and state abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rarely has a disaster occurred in such close proximity to a scheduled major political event as it has this week. Whenever the poll eventually takes place, the stakes will be high. The several political quagmires that followed the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/haiti-leaders-move-to-install-provisional-government\" title=\"\">president Michel Martelly</a> (2011-2016) have further undermined Haitian politics, with claims of corruption and state abuse. The forthcoming elections are expected to, at the very least, demonstrate a willingness to improve. Yet popular distrust of local and international powers is great.</p> <p>Most upsetting are the effects of these conditions on Haitians. Programmes intended to expand the economy in areas such as tourism have brought little benefit for Haiti\u2019s more than 10 million people. Instead, Haitian emigration has increased tremendously and to new locations in Central and South America as thousands of the country\u2019s citizens find fewer reasons to endure the economic hardships and political instability. Any improvement hinges on a restoration of the political process through the election of a new president. It is also clear that other countries, particularly the United States, are expected to play a role in whatever direction Haiti takes. Last month, at an address to the United Nations, interim president Jocelerme Privert called for more support from the international community to restore stability after the elections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hurricane-matthew-leaves-haiti-facing-humanitarian-crisis-un\">Hurricane Matthew: UN says 350,000 Haitians in need of assistance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of that was before Tuesday morning. Now Hurricane Matthew brings a new challenge for Haiti\u2019s leaders and the international community that has vowed to help the proud nation. The efficacy of the infrastructure repairs put in place since 2010 will be tested. Concerns that Haiti\u2019s fragile democracy must not be knocked off course have to be weighed against the human tragedy that will result from ineffective action.</p> <p>If Haiti\u2019s contending politicians must do anything now, it is to insist that the lessons of the past six years, which saw a deadly cholera outbreak added to the impact of the quake, are heeded. For a vulnerable country that has suffered greatly from weaker tropical systems, the effects of Hurricane Matthew could be catastrophic. The Haitian state and the international community have a duty to provide an effective emergency response. But so do members of Haiti\u2019s civil society and its large diaspora. It was these groups that made some of the strongest interventions after the earthquake. Haiti\u2019s neighbours, including spared Jamaica, also have a role to play once the full impact of the hurricane is known.</p> <p>Outside forces have much to atone for. In many ways it is the failures of international support since 2010 that have had greater consequences for Haiti than its longstanding political failures. There is now a desperate need for a new type of engagement with Haiti. After Matthew, Haiti simply cannot endure any more broken promises.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 October 2016 to reflect the fact that the elections had been postponed indefinitely</p>",

When Luntz ran a similar group during last week\u2019s presidential debate, Clinton beat Trump 16-6.</li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-highlights-tim-kaine-mike-pence-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/563yn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2778080\"            data-video-name=\"Vice-presidential debate highlights: Kaine and Pence face-off \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f48b49e4b0afec6ad16eec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005kainepence_KP-29565142_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005kainepence_KP-29565142.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005kainepence_KP-29565142_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-highlights-tim-kaine-mike-pence-face-off-video\">Vice-presidential debate highlights: Kaine and Pence face-off</a></figcaption> </figure>   <ul> <li>But Pence didn\u2019t win with everyone: Using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/that-mexican-thing-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate\">#ThatMexicanThing</a>, the Latino community flipped the script on a comment made by the Indiana governor during Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate. \u201cSenator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again,\u201d Pence responded to Virginia senator Tim Kaine at one point.
