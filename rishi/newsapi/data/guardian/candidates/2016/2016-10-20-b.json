  "<p>During last week\u2019s presidential debate, Hillary Clinton leaned on an old and appealing line. \u201cWe are great because we are good.\u201d Reagan has used it before, as did Eisenhower. What it means, of course, is that our country\u2019s performance advantage on the world stage comes from our willingness to do the right thing.</p> <p>Businesses who market social responsibility as a selling point have been trying to make the same claim for decades. But it hasn\u2019t been enough of a selling point. So, some savvy brands are digging deeper on what it means in practice to be great.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt\">How Google is using big data to protect the environment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Take the recent radical actions of Swiss sportswear brand Skins, for example. Skins invested a good deal of its cache on British marathoner Robert Young. An abused child who had grown into a man committed to the impossible, Young claimed to have run 370 marathons in a single year. His 2016 feat, sponsored by Skins, was to run across America in 46 days. What better way to inspire the brand\u2019s performance minded customers?</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/22/robert-young-marathon-record-attempt-cheating-rumors\">rumors began that Young was cheating</a> \u2013 rather than running \u2013 his way across the country. And this is where things got interesting. Rather than sit back and wait for the truth to come out, Skins launched its own investigation, hiring two independent researchers \u2013 Roger Pielke Jr, of the University of Colorado Boulder, and Ross Tucker, of the University of the Free State \u2013 to look into the claims. When they found that Young had likely been hopping into vehicles rather than running, Skins <a href=\"https://www.skins.net/usa/rob-young-investigation/\">published the 101-page report on its website</a> and ended its deal with Young.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a difficult situation when the shit hit the fan,\u201d Skins CEO Jamie Fuller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/02/robert-young-marathon-sponsor-stands-tall\">told the Guardian</a>. \u201cBut the most important thing for us isn\u2019t the initial problem \u2013 because problems will always happen \u2013 it\u2019s what you do when they arise. In our view, there are no half measures when you apply and live by your principles.\u201d</p> <p>The move may seem counterintuitive at first. When the Nike Oregon Project running team faced a doping scandal in 2015, Nike waited for the results of its own investigation and then quietly withdrew sponsorship, a strategy we\u2019ve all come to expect. Why would Skins invite the negative attention? Why spend money on an investigation that is likely to embarrass the company?</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/02/robert-young-marathon-sponsor-stands-tall\">Sean Ingle\u2019s Guardian piece</a> brilliantly scratched the surface as to why this is such a rare example, it\u2019s worth digging deeper into how the company\u2019s actions measure up against other corporate social responsibility efforts.</p> <p>The underlying message of how Skins approached this speaks of a company on a quest for perfection and, in that quest, doing the right thing is just a natural extension of excellence. Skins flipped the logic of traditional corporate social responsibility marketing by saying: \u201cWe are good, because we are great.\u201d</p> <p>See the difference? Skins isn\u2019t saying, \u201cWe\u2019re making great products because we do the right thing.\u201d It\u2019s saying, \u201cWe do the right thing because it\u2019s just part of making great things.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s actions send a strong message about its high-performance gear: to create an extremely high-quality product, a brand must pursue operational perfection. Abusing workers, trashing the planet, tripping through doping scandals \u2013 this is all evidence of a sloppy company that cuts corners.</p> <p>A brand that wants to charge a premium for what it claims are excellent products wins when it shows that it ruthlessly roots out imperfection wherever it\u2019s found.</p> <p>Fuller has built his entire brand around this concept. The company\u2019s mission statement declares that: \u201cSport should be played with creativity, flair and sportsmanship, free of corruption and drugs.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/01/north-carolina-hb2-law-transgender-issues-corporate-businesses-protest\">Inside corporate America's stand against transgender discrimination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How do you live by that mission? By making excellent products that allow athletes to win cleanly and by standing up against cheating. For consumers, the message reinforces the value of Skins products. In the logic of, \u201cWe are good because we are great\u201d, publicly investigating and cutting Young was a no-brainer. In doing so, Skins took what promised to be yet one more brand-bashing scandal and turned it into something positive.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that transparency in handling a corporate scandal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/29/what-are-the-business-benefits-of-being-more-transparent\">can actually help a company\u2019s bottom line</a>, both from a consumer perspective as well as <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/03/121703.asp\">overall market value</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s why brands should take notice of this unusual case. Using recycled content, donating a dollar for each purchase, reducing packaging \u2013 these are common efforts by companies who want to tell a story about doing the right thing. We\u2019ve seen that story before.</p> <p>The story that gets people talking \u2013 and buying \u2013 involves pursuing greatness with passion and zeal and doing the right thing in that pursuit. Any brand can do this simply by asking this: what is the greatness we are pursuing, and what good for the world can we do as part of that pursuit?</p>",

Last year at least one voting machine system was found to be substantially insecure. Princeton researcher Jeremy Epstein, now of technology firm SRI, discovered that WinVote machines used in Virginia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/15/virginia-hacking-voting-machines-security\">could be accessed comparatively easily</a> over a Wi-Fi connection through simple passwords. Epstein successfully pushed to have the machines decertified. </p> <p>Epstein told the Guardian that exit polls in particular were a dangerously inaccurate way to gauge the legitimacy of an election. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that exit polls are not very accurate,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tell the pollsters what they actually did. In this election, depending on the neighborhood, people might not want to admit that they voted for Clinton or that they voted for Trump.\u201d</p> <p>There are already methods in place to determine the accuracy of the results in a contested district. \u201cRoughly 75, 80% of all voters in this election will use paper ballots,\u201d Epstein said, \u201cso even if the machines were hacked, we\u2019d have the paper ballots to go back to in most cases, especially in states where they do audits.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security is already taking precautions to make sure election results are not interfered with electronically. \u201cTo date, 33 state and 11 county or local election agencies have approached the Department of Homeland Security about our cybersecurity services,\u201d the department said in a press release issued 10 October. DHS continues to offer \u201ccyber-hygiene\u201d services to other state or local boards looking for protection against hacking.</p> <p>Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, shared Epstein\u2019s concerns over using exit polls as way of measuring the legitimacy of an election and warned: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a scientific way to do things, nor do I think it\u2019s a sound way to ferret out machine problems, it sounds much more like a Roger Stone dirty trick.\u201d </p> <p>Stone, who did not identify the particular precincts volunteers would be targeting, argued that the polling methodology, was \u201cdesigned by professionals\u201d, but was unable to identify who these professionals were. The former Richard Nixon adviser added that the effort was being run by the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d organization, a group founded by Stone in the lead up to the Republican national convention in July, which organized protests aimed at preventing party delegates from taking the nomination away from Trump. </p> <p>The Citizens for Trump coalition, which will supply volunteers for the polling, was also present at the Republican convention and organized a large rally in Cleveland alongside a host of fringe organizations, including armed vigilantes group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/bikers-for-trump-republican-convention-open-carry\">Bikers for Trump</a> and the conspiracy theorist website Infowars.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds like he\u2019s organizing a goon squad that could potentially be intimidating voters in minority areas,\u201d said Hasen. \u201cIt does raise the threat of violence on election day at polling places. People are going to have to be vigilant.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

  "<p>We keep being told that the Donald Trump phenomenon means we have entered the era of post-fact politics. Yet, I would argue, post-fact politics has been tarnishing democracy for some time. Twenty-two years ago a successful businessman sent a VHS tape to Italy\u2019s news channels. It showed him sitting in a (fake) office. He read a pre-prepared statement via an autocue.</p> <p>The man\u2019s name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a>, and he was announcing that he was, in his words, \u201ctaking the field\u201d. The first reaction was derision. Opposition politicians saw his political project (the formation of a \u201cmovement\u201d called Forza Italia \u2013 Go for it, Italy \u2013 just months ahead of a crucial general election) as a joke. Some claimed a stocking had been put over the camera to soften the impact of Berlusconi\u2019s face.</p> <p>But Forza Italia soon became the biggest \u201cparty\u201d. In the working-class Communist citadel of Mirafiori Sud in Turin, an unknown psychiatrist standing for Berlusconi\u2019s movement beat a long-standing trade unionist. Berlusconi had not just won, he had also stolen the left\u2019s clothes and some of its supporters. That first government was short lived, but Berlusconi would dominate Italian politics for the next 20 years \u2013 winning elections in 2001 and 2008 and losing by a handful of seats in 2006. In terms of days in office, Berlusconi ranks as Italy\u2019s third longest-serving prime minister, behind Mussolini and the great liberal of 19th-century Italy, Giovanni Giolitti.</p> <p>The parallels between Berlusconi and Trump are striking. Both are successful businessman who struggle with \u201cmurky\u201d aspects linked to their companies \u2013 tax, accounting, offshore companies. Berlusconi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/27/silvio-berlusconi-ousted-italian-parliament-tax-fraud-conviction\" title=\"\">convicted of tax fraud in 2013</a>, which effectively put an end to his political career. But business success and huge wealth was part of his political appeal, as they are for Trump. Beyond wealth, Berlusconi, like Trump, always painted himself as an outsider, as anti-establishment, even when he was prime minister. And, like Trump, Berlusconi\u2019s appeal was populist and linked to his individual \u201cpersonality\u201d.</p> <p>Berlusconi\u2019s personal-business political model has since been followed by others in Italy. It could be argued that both Beppe Grillo\u2019s populist anti-political <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\" title=\"\">Five Star Movement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi\" title=\"\">Matteo Renzi</a>\u2019s insider-outsider appeal (until recently) have been created very much in Berlusconi\u2019s image. One could go so far as to say Berlusconi transformed politics. The mass parties of the postwar period had become increasingly irrelevant, but he didn\u2019t need a party just as Trump doesn\u2019t really need the Republican party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6801e1d51ae072ef0c8f122a09b028c9feeac005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6801e1d51ae072ef0c8f122a09b028c9feeac005/0_226_3584_2150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Like Donald Trump, Berlusconi\u2019s appeal was populist and linked to his individual \u201cpersonality\u201d.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Like Donald Trump, Berlusconi\u2019s appeal was populist and linked to his individual \u201cpersonality\u201d.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So-called gaffes were a frequent part of Berlusconi\u2019s political strategy \u2013 a dog-whistle strategy that included frequent recourse to sexist, homophobic and racist stereotypes, and reference to his belief that he was irresistible to women. He flaunted his Don Giovanni image, but also attempted to keep a parallel reputation as a family man, whose main concern was the welfare of his five children.</p> <p>His electoral campaigns were all about him. Nothing else mattered. He dominated the agenda from start to finish. When the former mayor of Rome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/08/italy1\" title=\"\">Walter Veltroni</a> tried to run a campaign against Berlusconi by not mentioning Berlusconi, he was heavily defeated. Silvio\u2019s \u201cgaffes\u201d would usually be followed by claims that he had been \u201cmisunderstood\u201d or was the victim of a \u201chostile media\u201d. He was also reluctant to accept the verdict of the electorate as final when he lost. He would make frequent (and unsubstantiated) claims of electoral fraud and ballot-stuffing. Remind you of anyone?</p> <p>He also created a set of enemies against which he could mobilise his followers: the judiciary, the media (despite owning much of it), politics itself, Communism, women (he often commented on the appearance of female opponents) and the EU and the euro. He presented himself as a victim of political correctness gone mad, an ordinary/extraordinary man speaking his mind. He promised the world, and it mattered little if he was quickly proved wrong, or had no intention of fulfilling any of his promises. Berlusconi knew that many of the electorate had short memories indeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f241ab3bac29d0d08b01ddb76419c35de1fcd7e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f241ab3bac29d0d08b01ddb76419c35de1fcd7e3/0_0_2254_3000/751.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Berlusconi\u2019s scandals had little effect on his support\u2019: the former prime minister was convicted but on appeal found not guilty of paying prostitute Karima El Mahroug for sex when she was under 18.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Berlusconi\u2019s scandals had little effect on his support\u2019: the former prime minister was convicted but on appeal found not guilty of paying prostitute Karima El Mahroug for sex when she was under 18.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Aresu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And as with Trump (at least until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/locker-room-talk-not-harmless-rape-culture-trump\" title=\"\">\u201clocker-room\u201d video</a>), Berlusconi\u2019s scandals had little effect on his support. The numerous trials and journalistic scoops regarding Berlusconi\u2019s private and business lives often seemed merely to reinforce his appeal. The message sent out was, for many, an attractive one. Be like me. Don\u2019t pay taxes. Enjoy life and make money. Say what you want. We won\u2019t bother you.</p> <p>He became so powerful at one stage that he even tried to make himself immune to prosecution, through a law passed by his own government. Luckily, Italy\u2019s constitution forbade such a monstrosity. But the fact that it was even contemplated was worrying. Mass opposition to Berlusconi rose and fell at various times, and many took to the streets to protest. Yet his appeal also had roots deep in Italian society \u2013 and in a hatred of politics and politicians that has since moved onto other forms of populism.</p> <p>The Berlusconi phenomenon shows that a post-truth politician can rise to power in one of the world\u2019s strongest and richest countries. The lesson for America is that for far too long Berlusconi was treated as a joke and a clown. By the end, nobody was laughing. Twenty years of Berlusconi at the centre of the system had a deeply damaging impact on Italy\u2019s body politic and democratic culture and the wounds are by no means healed. Win or lose, Trump has shifted the terms of political discourse, campaigning and organisation. As with the Berlusconi era, things will never be the same again.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump raised new questions about whether he would accept the election result on Thursday, less than 12 hours after he used the final presidential debate to declare that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">keep the country \u201cin suspense\u201d</a> over whether he would accept the outcome.</p> <p>At a rally in Delaware, Ohio, the Republican candidate said first: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\u201d before pausing for effect and then adding to cheers and applause: \u201cIf I win.\u201d </p> <p>Later he told the crowd: \u201cOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would reserve my right to contend or file a legal challenge, in the case of a questionable result.\u201d He did not define what he meant by a clear result. </p> <p>Trump later went on to warn that his opponent Hillary Clinton would \u201cdo anything, including voter fraud\u201d to win. And he claimed that in being asked to accept the integrity of the American electoral process, \u201cI am being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s refusal to endorse the results of the forthcoming election, unheard of in modern American history, ensured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">the main talking point</a> after the debate was whether the brash businessman had a suitable temperament for the White House.<br></p> <p>It also prompted a collective cringe from many in the Republican political establishment, which is now facing the prospect of losing control of the Senate and even the House because of the drag faced by down-ballot candidates campaigning into the headwinds of their presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cTalking about rigged elections with zero evidence is dangerous because it erodes trust without justification and kindles cynicism that undermines self-government,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who is not up for election but is an ardent critic of Trump, said in a statement. \u201cOur elections must have integrity, even if the two major party candidates do not.\u201d</p> <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost to Barack Obama in 2008, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance. A concession isn\u2019t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader\u2019s first responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The animus between Clinton and Trump was clear throughout the debate \u2013 once again, they did not shake hands \u2013 and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">some of the more heated exchanges</a>, with Clinton accusing Trump of being a \u201ca puppet\u201d of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Trump initially appeared more restrained than he had in the two previous debates, arguing forcefully with Clinton over abortion, gun rights and immigration, but over the course of a 90-minute debate in which Clinton repeatedly needled him he gradually returned to form.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58aff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822379\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump's final face-off \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58086051e4b055209adaf6c9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump\u2019s final face-off</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Looking increasingly irritable, he locked horns with the unflappable Fox News moderator, Chris Wallace, and repeatedly cut off his Democratic rival \u2013 including, on one occasion, interrupting her mid-sentence with the line: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">Such a nasty woman</a>.\u201d</p> <p>However, it was Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of an election he is currently projected to lose that will stand out from the ill-tempered clash on the debate stage on the University of Nevada campus in Las Vegas.</p> <p>Asked if he would accept the outcome of the election, Trump demurred. \u201cI will look at it at the time.

  "<p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is widely seen as being eager to establish some military facts on the ground before Barack Obama leaves the White House and is potentially replaced by the more hawkish Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/russian-fleet-could-pass-through-the-channel-as-early-as-thursday-night\">naval taskforce heading towards the eastern Mediterranean</a>, that means establishing a presence in the water off Syria. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/convoy-of-russian-warships-on-route-past-british-isles\">Admiral Kuznetsov</a> \u2013 Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier \u2013 and its escort of seven ships is one of the biggest demonstrations of Russian naval force in many years. In a context of broader tensions between Russia and the west, images of a Russian fleet drawing near to British waters will cause some consternation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/russian-fleet-could-pass-through-the-channel-as-early-as-thursday-night\">Russian fleet could pass through the Channel as early as Thursday night</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Military experts disagree on whether the 30-year-old aircraft carrier and its support vessels are truly needed to augment the already impressive Russian air capability in Syria. After all, most of the Russian aircraft capable of using the carrier \u2013 such as the Su-33s and newer MiG-29Ks \u2013 have been using Hmeimim airbase in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia since September 2015, and the base is capable of launching even more sorties than at present.</p> <p>Igor Sutyagin, a senior fellow in Russian studies at the Royal United Services Institute, said the aircraft carrier could not accommodate any planes that could not also be flown from Latakia. \u201cThere is not a great deal to be worried about. This is not the beginning of world war three. It is more a public relations exercise, a show of force,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If the deployment served any purpose, he suggested, it would be to make it even more difficult for western powers to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria, an idea that Clinton has still not abandoned and reiterated during Wednesday night\u2019s third US presidential debate.</p> <p>The fleet might also be used as a bargaining chip when the US and Russia come to decide both how to attack the final Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa and who will carry out the offensive.</p> <p>Sutyagin argued that Russia had already helped Syria to construct a sophisticated air defence system, including the S-300 V4 system capable of defeating short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, precision-guided missiles, and fixed-wing aircraft. It is the first time Russia has deployed the air defence system outside Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/convoy-of-russian-warships-on-route-past-british-isles\">Royal Navy sends ships to shadow Russian fleet passing Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was also doubtful that the Russian fleet was capable of withstanding a fight with US naval forces. \u201cThis fleet is not capable of high-intensity warfare for more than 50 minutes. After that it will run out of firepower,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The deployment is the first time that Russia has combined the aircraft carrier\u2019s defensive capability with the offensive capability of Peter the Great, a nuclear-powered battlecruiser. Russia\u2019s operational capability off Syria has previously been restricted to ship- and submarine-launched cruise missiles.</p> <p>But the deployment may also serve to underline how determined Russia is to build a permanent military presence in the Middle East \u2013 a presence that would require naval strength as well.</p> <p>Only last week, the Russian Duma voted to make the use of Latakia airbase permanent. Provided free of charge by its client Syrian government, the runway is needed not only to hit rebel positions in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second city, but also to protect Russian naval assets in the region, including by seeking out submarine threats to its naval forces. It is only 100 miles south of the Turkish airbase of Incirlik from which the US flies its sorties into Syria. </p> <p>Russia also announced this month that it intended to expand its old Soviet-era deep-water naval base at Tartus in Syria \u2013 currently a relatively limited supply base \u2013 and turn it into the nerve centre of a more active Russian fleet \u2013 something Russian military commanders have dreamed of doing since the 1970s.</p> <p>Sutyagin said: \u201cThe sea base at present is two piers and one workshop. It is useful for minor maintenance and repairs, but it would need to be protected by air and sea, as well as by anti-submarine systems. It is possible it could be constructed in two to three years, but there are many difficulties. The goods would have to be transported a long way, the security would need to be enhanced, the area is highly unpredictable \u2013 and the Russians do not have the money.\u201d </p> <p>Russia itself points out that the decision to send the Admiral Kuznetsov on its latest mission was made in late September, and the tour of duty is expected to last four to five months. It supplements 10 ships already in the region. </p> <p>It is not the carrier\u2019s first deployment to the Mediterranean: over the past two decades Kuznetsov has been sent there four times: in 1995-96, 2007-08, 2011-12 and 2014.</p> <p>But such a large symbolic deployment now is bound to add to uncertainty at a time when Nato relations with Russia are at their most uncertain for decades.<br></p>",
  "<p>What was one of the most telling moments from the third and final presidential debate? When Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton was \u201csuch a nasty woman\u201d, Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti said in a panel on Wednesday night. \u201cWomen recognized his tone in that sentence and what he really wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>At Tumblr\u2019s HQ in New York, the roughly 300 people who had gathered to watch Trump and Clinton face off for the last time at a debate watch party co-hosted by Guardian US and WNYC, seemed to agree, with many shouting \u201cNo\u201d and booing in response to Trump\u2019s comment. </p> <p>After the debate, the crowd stuck around to watch Valenti, the Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman and panelists from CNN and WNYC dissect the night\u2019s events in terms of gender, race and foreign policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"778a8c3e1a55e384c6829f59f4775feeb491def1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/778a8c3e1a55e384c6829f59f4775feeb491def1/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanzania Vega, CNN\u2019s national reporter on race and inequality, Jessica Valenti, staff writer for The Guardian US and Spencer Ackerman, US national security editor for the Guardian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanzina Vega, CNN\u2019s national reporter on race and inequality, Jessica Valenti, staff writer for the Guardian US and Spencer Ackerman, US national security editor for the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ackerman and Valenti were joined by Tanzina Vega, a national reporter on race and inequality at CNN, and Kai Wright, host of WNYC\u2019s United States of Anxiety podcast and an editor at the Nation, on the panel. </p> <p>The event marked the kick-off of the Guardian\u2019s membership program in the US.

Two friends and native Tennesseans, Katherine and Catherine, proudly sported Clinton campaign T-shirts at the event, happy to be away from their conservative Republican families. \u201cThey would disown us if they knew we supported her,\u201d Katherine said. In their chatter ahead of the debate, more than one attendee sarcastically asked if there were any Trump supporters in the room.</p> <p>\u201cI got the sense from the room that it\u2019s generally, slightly pro-Hillary,\u201d joked Nicholas Thompson, the panel\u2019s moderator and the editor of NewYorker.com, before asking what Clinton might have done better during the debate. He thought she stumbled on trade, while Wright thought she stumbled on guns.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s one-liners saying Trump \u201cchoked\u201d or about the Emmys were chosen by the panelists as the most memorable lines. The ultimate favorite, though, was the Democratic nominee\u2019s jab about the situation room.</p> <p>\u201cAnd on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d Clinton said. </p> <p><em>The Guardian is an independent voice in this year\u2019s election.

  "<p>A 10th woman accused Donald Trump of unwanted sexual contact on Thursday morning, just hours after the presidential candidate angrily renewed his denials of ever having inappropriate contact with women. </p> <p>Karena Virginia claims that Trump groped her breast and made sexual comments toward her at a random encounter outside the 1998 US Open tennis tournament in Flushing, Queens. Virginia was 27 at the time. The two had never previously met, she said.</p> <p>\u201cI was waiting for a car to arrive to take me home,\u201d she said, flanked by famous women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, and facing a battery of clacking cameras. </p> <p>As she was waiting, she claimed, Trump approached her with a small group of other men. \u201cI was surprised when I overheard him talking to the other men about me. He said: \u2018Hey, look at this one, we haven\u2019t seen her before. Look at those legs,\u2019 as though I were an object rather than a person.</p> <p>\u201cHe then walked up to me and reached out his right arm and grabbed my right arm,\u201d she continued. \u201cThen his hand touched the right side of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched. \u2018Don\u2019t you know who I am? Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what he said to me. I felt intimidated and I felt powerless. When my car pulled up and I got in, after I closed the door, my shock turned to shame.\u201d</p> <p>Virginia, who described herself on Thursday as a yoga instructor and life coach from the tri-state area, spoke in a midtown Manhattan hotel conference room just blocks away from Trump Tower. It was less than one week after Allred held a press conference with another Trump accuser.<br></p> <p>\u201cHer allegations demonstrate how Mr Trump selects his victims at random,\u201d Allred said.</p> <p>Within hours, the Trump campaign released an acid response, claiming Virginia\u2019s press conference was the work of the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cDiscredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity-seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr Trump,\u201d said Jessica Ditto, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cGive me a break. Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories and the clear efforts to benefit Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Allred disclosed, not for the first time, that she is an avowed supported of Clinton and served as an elected delegate at this summer\u2019s Democratic national convention. Allred denied that she had had contact with anyone inside the Clinton campaign regarding Virginia\u2019s claims.</p> <p>Asked if Allred and Virginia could produce eyewitnesses of the event, Allred replied that Virginia had told her husband and several friends about the alleged encounter soon after it occurred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/donald-trump-summer-zervos-apprentice-sexual-assault\">Summer Zervos: former Apprentice contestant claims Trump kissed and groped her</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virginia is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">10th woman to publicly accuse Trump</a> of inappropriate sexual contact \u2013 the seventh since a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">2005 tape revealed Trump bragging that his fame allowed him to grope and kiss women without their consent</a>.

But in the end, I feel that it is my duty as a woman, a mother, a human being and an American citizen to speak out and tell the truth about what happened to me.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump,\u201d she continued, \u201cyour random moment of sexual pleasure came at my expense and affected me greatly.\u201d</p> <p>Virginia described feeling shame about the alleged encounter and blaming herself for wearing a short dress and heels \u2013 an outfit she avoided for years afterwards \u201cso as not to attract unwanted attention\u201d.</p> <p>Virginia claimed that she met Trump one more time, about five years ago, at a business event. \u201cHe looked me up and down a few times in a lecherous manner. This time, mixed in with the feelings of shame, I felt disgust toward him. I had come to the realization that I was the victim and he had violated me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has shown tremendous courage in coming forward today, especially in light of Mr Trump\u2019s statements last night in which he called the allegations of the nine women who alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by him \u2018lies and fiction\u2019,\u201d Allred said.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump, you may have thought that you could violate women without consequences. But there are always consequences. There are consequences for the women that you have hurt and there are consequences for you as well.\u201d</p> <p>Besides Virginia, nine other women have accused Trump, publicly and using their full names, of harassing them or touching them without their consent. A few, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>, who claimed in a 1997 lawsuit Trump tried to sexually assault her, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">made their claims long before</a> the Washington Post published the infamous tape.</p> <p>Others came forward just days after the revelation of the tape and Trump\u2019s subsequent denials. Jessica Leeds claimed in a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0\">article</a> that Trump groped her on a plane while the two were seated next to each other. In the same article, Rachel Crooks, who worked in Trump Tower as a secretary, alleged that Trump would not let go of her hand after she introduced herself, and began kissing her. The two were in an elevator, she claimed. </p> <p>Virginia is the second woman to tell her story with the assistance of Allred. Last week, Allred held a similar press conference with Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice who claimed that Trump used a meeting about a job opportunity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/donald-trump-summer-zervos-apprentice-sexual-assault\">as a pretense to grope her and make sexual advances.</a> Neither woman has announced plans to take legal action against Trump.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

I\u2019m sure the whole House has sympathy for the thousands of workers and pensioners who have lost their jobs and seen their pension benefits reduced as a result of greed, incompetence and hubris. The reputation of business has been tarnished as a result of this greed. The vast majority of businesses are not run and managed like this. It would be wrong to tar all of business with the same brush. However, it is vital that this mess is sorted. Even at this late stage, Sir Philip should make amends for this whole story, and put right the wrongs that he himself engineered.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright accused Green of raiding BHS for his own benefit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> [Green] can\u2019t be described as a short-term corporate raider. But he did raid the company, and his ability to do so meant that he was then in a financial position to be able to obtain the debt to acquire Arcadia and, through the same modus operandi, pay his family the biggest dividend in corporate history. He took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support, and then wanted credit for keeping it alive.</p> <p>BHS\u2019s balance sheet was made considerably weaker during Sir Philip\u2019s tenure of the company. His extraction of value early on in his ownership made the company less able to innovate, to retain a market share or competitive place in the retail market which would allow the firm to generate the profits and be in more of a position to survive and to address the growing pension scheme deficit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said the BHS Group\u2019s dividend policy \u201cset the scene for the eventual demise of the company\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BHS folded in 2016, a year after Sir Philip Green sold it to Dominic Chappell, but its demise was on the cards a lot earlier than that. In the three year period between 2002 and 2004, BHS Group paid dividends of \u00a3423 million, even though operating profit for the period was less than that amount, at \u00a3325 million. In 2004, BHS Group had dividends of \u00a3199,500,000. This dividend exceeded the Group\u2019s operating profit for that year of \u00a3137 million ...</p> <p>Sir Philip could say, quite reasonably, that he received dividends for only a short period of time early on in his period of ownership. It was a long time ago. That is true. But I do think the dividend policy is crucial to understanding the whole story of BHS and wider lessons for business. </p> <p>Green was to enrich himself, his family and his friends at the expense of long-term and sustainable growth for the company. Certainly, profits were made, but they were more akin to a short-term sugar boost rather than a nutritious diet that aided the long term health and strength of the busines<strong>s. </strong></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said Green was not even very good at retail.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sir Philip received his knighthood for services to retail. However, throughout the course of our inquiry, it became increasingly evident that he wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail at all. True, he was able, in the early days, of sniffing out a corporate bargain and cutting costs to boost profit. There is nothing wrong with that, but he did not boost BHS\u2019s turnover during his period of ownership, he lost market share to more nimble, or even not-so-nimble competitors, and he failed to anticipate the on-line retail revolution. By failing to innovate and invest in the brand, BHS looked like a remnant of the 1970s and 1980s, in a cut throat competitive sector where grabbing the customer\u2019s attention and retaining their loyalty are paramount.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b936e4b055209adaf893\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:32:22.059Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says it is important that the investigating bodies are given time to complete their inquiries.</p> <p>If the evidence supports it, enforcement will be taken, she says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b837e4b005f21833b70f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:31:22.742Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says Green says he is in a dialogue with the pensions regulator.</p> <p>She says she would urge him to sort it out quickly.</p> <p>The pensions regulator continues to investigate the handling of BHS pensions.

Here it is.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rolf Harris</strong>, March 2015. The former children\u2019s entertainer was stripped of his CBE after being jailed for almost six years for a string of sex attacks on girls as young as seven. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong> Stuart Hall</strong>, October 2013. The former It\u2019s A Knockout presenter was made an OBE in 2012 for services to broadcasting and charity. But the Queen directed it be cancelled after Hall, then 83, was handed a 30-month jail term for sexually abusing 13 victims, one as young as nine, over a period of nearly 20 years. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vicky Pryce,</strong> July 2013. The economist was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 2009 in recognition of her contribution as head of the Government economic service. But in March 2013 she and ex-husband Chris Huhne were both jailed for eight months for swapping speeding penalty points a decade earlier so he could avoid a driving ban, which only emerged when Pryce approached newspapers after Huhne left her for another woman. She was released from prison after two months but, following her conviction, her name was removed from the Order of the Bath register. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>James Crosby,</strong> June 2013. The former HBOS chief executive, who was knighted in 2006 after leaving the bank, was stripped of the title at his own request following a scathing parliamentary report into its collapse. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jimmy Savile,</strong> January 2013. The television star was knighted for his services to charity in 1990 but the honours forfeiture committee considered stripping him of the title posthumously when the scale of the paedophile\u2019s crimes emerged. The Cabinet Office later said that he had ceased to be a member of the order upon his death in 2011. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Fred Goodwin</strong>, January 2012. Goodwin received his knighthood for services to banking under the Labour government before guiding the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse in 2008. While honours are usually only removed from those convicted or jailed, the Cabinet Office said the scale of the RBS disaster - necessitating a \u00a345bn bailout from the taxpayer - made the case \u201cexceptional\u201d. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jean Else</strong>, February 2011. \u201cSuperhead\u201d Jean Else was made a Dame in 2001 in recognition of her transforming performance at Whalley Range High School in Manchester. But in January 2009 she was banned from running a school after the General Teaching Council found her guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff. Her honour was revoked in 2011 after she was found guilty of misconduct. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Robert Mugabe</strong>, 2008. Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood in 2008 over his \u201cabuse of human rights\u201d and \u201cabject disregard\u201d for democracy. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>\u201cPrince\u201d Naseem Hamed,</strong> 2007. The former WBA world featherweight champion was jailed in 2006 for 15 months and disqualified from driving for four years after a crash in May 2005 that left another man with fractures to \u201cevery major bone in his body\u201d. The boxer was stripped of his MBE in January 2007. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Lester Piggott</strong>, 1988.The former champion jockey was stripped of his OBE after he was given a three-year jail term for evading tax in 1987. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Anthony Blunt,</strong> 1979. Art historian Anthony Blunt was a Professor of the History of Art at the University of London and Surveyor of the Queen\u2019s Pictures. What was not known was that in 1964 he had confessed to having been a member of the infamous Cambridge Five Soviet spy ring, passing information to Moscow while they worked for MI5 during the Second World War. His secret was closely guarded for many years, but Margaret Thatcher publicly revealed his status in November 1979 and he was immediately stripped of his knighthood.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aec6e4b055209adaf856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:47:58.677Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eleanor Laing,</strong> the deputy speaker, says she expects the debate to end around 2.30pm.

Witnesses appeared to harbour the misconception that they could be absolved from responsibility by blaming others. The worst example was Sir Philip Green, despite his protestations to the contrary. Sir Philip adopted a scattergun approach, liberally firing blame to all angles except his own, though he began his evidence by saying he would do the opposite. The truth is that a large proportion of those who have got rich or richer off the back of BHS are to blame. Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and their respective directors, advisers and hangers-on are all culpable. The tragedy is that those who have lost out are the ordinary employees and pensioners. This is the unacceptable face of capitalism.</p> <p>The sale of BHS did not have to proceed as it did. The potential checks, however, proved to be inadequate. Regulatory concerns were circumvented. Advisers were heavily incentivised to progress the deal ...</p> <p>Sir Philip Green drove the deal forward. He sought to sell a chain that had become a financial millstone and threatened his reputation. He knew that Dominic Chappell was a wholly unsuitable purchaser but overlooked or made good each of Chappell\u2019s shortcomings and proceeded with a rushed sale regardless.</p> <p>Dominic Chappell was out of his depth. He was over-optimistic to the point of arrogance. He failed to recruit a retail expertdespite his own lack of experience; failed to secure funding on commercial terms; failed to address BHS\u2019s property leases in a timely way; and failed to address the company\u2019s long-term underperformance ...</p> <p>The Green family benefited significantly from BHS. In his early years of ownership, Sir Philip cut costs, sold assets and paid substantial dividends offshore to the ultimate benefit of his wife. He failed, however, to invest sufficiently in stores or reinvent the business to beat the prevailing high street competition. We found little evidence to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood.</p> <p>It is true these are private companies holding Green family money. BHS, however, was a major employer and the sponsor of a large and ailing pension fund. Arcadia, another Green company, is in a similar position. Sir Philip gave insufficient priority to the BHS pension scheme over an extended period. His failure to resolve its problems by now has contributed substantially to the demise of BHS. Sir Philip owes it to the BHS pensioners to find a resolution urgently. This will undoubtedly require him to make a large financial contribution. He has a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aa25e4b005f21833b6bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:32:25.146Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fuller says Green was running a business with 11,000 employees.

Davis implied the government was looking at such an option. He told her:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are seeking to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union and it would not be in the interests of either side, either Britain or the EU, to see disruption. And to that end we are examining all possible options, as you would expect.</p> <p>We are approaching these negotiations in good faith and with goodwill towards our negotiating partners, and we hope the same in reverse, focused on a mutual interest to the UK and the EU including financial stability. I would say that having London as a number one financial centre sitting at the heart of the global capital markets is not just in the UK\u2019s interests, it\u2019s also in the EU\u2019s interests, and I\u2019m confident that everyone will see the value in not undermining it. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, the Labour MP and new chair of the shadow Brexit secretary, said that businesses needed to know now that transitional arrangements would be put in place if there was no deal within two year. Davis told him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to treat as absolutely central to what we do maintaining the stability of both the City but also the European financial markets, and the European financial markets are a little fragile over the last few years. Now we will therefore do anything necessary. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said that the government would publish \u201cmuch information\u201d about its Brexit plans between now and the triggering of article 50, starting the two-year EU withdrawal process.</strong> He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the course of the coming - whether it is six months or less - period before the triggering of article 50, much information will be put out about this and the House will be in no doubt what our aims and strategic objectives are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But he also claimed that Labour was undermining the national interest by demanding detailed information about the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating position. </strong>He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m afraid what [Labour] do is rather seriously not to the country\u2019s interests from time to time ...</p> <p>What the opposition are trying to do is to put us in a disadvantaged position against the European Union.

But more than 100 MPs have signed an amendment tabled by the Conservative MP Richard Fuller saying Green should lose his knighthood. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This House] noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services for the retail industry, believes his actions raise the question of whether he should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour and calls on the honours forfeiture committee to recommend his knighthood be cancelled and annulled.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be surprising if John Bercow, the Speaker, does not call the amendment and, assuming it does get called, it is hard to imagine it not being passed.

  "<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucia-graves\">Lucia Graves</a>: \u2018Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Lucia Graves\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday night, in the last presidential debate of what has been an emotional tornado of a campaign, Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women.</p> <p>It began with a commitment to upholding the values laid out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States. Clinton spoke of protecting healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood that make upholding those values possible.</p> <p>Trump proceeded to make a fool of himself: \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d he began, \u201c ... you can take baby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip the baby out of the womb</a> in the ninth month, on the final day. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also not true. Late term abortions are extremely rare, and Trump\u2019s insistence that a baby can be torn out of its mother moments before childbirth is pure malarkey. Roe v Wade is meant to protect women\u2019s right to abortion up until \u201cfetal viability\u201d, which in Planned Parenthood v Casey, in 1992, was defined as 23 or 24 weeks or earlier. More recently fights in Congress have centered around an abortion ban at 20 weeks \u2013 in other words nowhere near the ninth month.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s obliviousness to these facts underscores his lack of understanding of the abortion debate and women\u2019s issues generally, a trait that was on display earlier this year when he suggested women who have abortions should face \u201csome sort of punishment\u201d. That\u2019s something no one on either side of the aisle wants, and tonight made clear Trump hasn\u2019t done any homework since his earlier blunder. </p> <p>But the evening was also a referendum on Trump\u2019s personal treatment of women. At one point, Clinton more or less said so. \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d</p> <p>And unlike his infinite malleability on policy issues, misogyny is the one philosophy Trump clearly hasn\u2019t changed and seems genuinely unable to. He bristled when Clinton recalled his referring to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado as an \u201ceating machine\u201d, but soon after, he was interrupting to call Clinton not just the usual \u201cliar\u201d, which has by now become banal, but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">such a nasty woman</a>\u201d, an even more baseless character attack.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the election writing about the women who\u2019ve known Trump. But this isn\u2019t just about the women I interviewed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Machado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">Sheena Monnin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>. As Clinton made clear tonight, it\u2019s about women everywhere. How fitting it would be if she \u2013 another woman he\u2019s insulted \u2013 speeds past him to the most powerful job in the world. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steven-w-thrasher\">Steven W Thrasher</a>: \u2018Trump\u2019s biggest grievance is the possibility of losing\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9d44bc513a5de5dc5db4fa31008abca414e21fe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d44bc513a5de5dc5db4fa31008abca414e21fe1/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Steven Thrasher\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has been that of an aggrieved white man, losing his place in the world, who is trying to scare his way back to power with racialized fears of the other. He began it by saying Mexicans were rapists, and he continued in that vein the final debate, saying: \u201cWe have some bad hombres here and we have to get them out\u201d \u2013 using a not-so-subtle dogwhistle to stoke sexual fears of Latino men. The comment was ironic, given his admission, on tape, of his own sexually predatory actions, and the claims of his many accusers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-bad-hombres-us-presidential-debate-las-vegas-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58apd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822647\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: deport 'bad hombres' \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58088131e4b005f21833b5db\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020hombres_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020hombres.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020hombres_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-bad-hombres-us-presidential-debate-las-vegas-video\">Trump vows to rid US of \u2018bad hombres\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps Trump\u2019s biggest grievance is the possibility of losing.

But she also fumbled needlessly, at one point answering a question about Syria by saying the US must work with \u201cAmerican Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks,\u201d then awkwardly following up with a non-sequitur: \u201cThe killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.\u201d</p> <p>The night was devoid of poetry, and ended as depressingly as the entire campaign has been conducted.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-weinstein\">Jamie Weinstein</a>: \u2018The only question is whether he now faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe\u2019<br></h2> <p>Donald Trump needed a devastating knockout. At best he narrowly lost on points.</p> <p>He came into the third and final presidential debate far behind in the polls. With tens of millions watching, he did little to change the trajectory of the race.</p> <p>Compared to the first two debates, Trump did do a better job hammering home his message that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for the status quo.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been doing this for 30 years \u2013 why didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years,\u201d Trump said of Clinton when talking about negotiating better trade deals.</p> <p>\u201cYou talk but you don\u2019t get anything done Hillary,\u201d he later added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Trump also did a better job at controlling his emotions when Hillary tried to bait him by calling him a choker and a \u201cpuppet\u201d. (Well, at least until the end when he lashed out and called her a \u201cnasty woman\u201d.)</p> <p>But all this was not nearly enough. The only thing the media will talk about in the hours and days after the debate will be Trump\u2019s refusal to say he will accept the results of the election, making him appear small, petty and conspiratorial.</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you at the time,\u201d he said when pressed on the question by the election season\u2019s best moderator, Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d</p> <p>For her part, Hillary stayed calm and cool, avoiding any serious errors and hitting Trump on his major weaknesses, from his misogynistic comments about women to his perceived lack of presidential temperament.</p> <p>The major takeaway from the debate is that, barring a stunning revelation of the type that Hillary Clinton is a secret member of Isis, she will be the next president of the United States. The only question that remains is whether Donald Trump faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe \u2013 and, in that loss, whether Trump brings the Republican House, Senate, party and even conservative movement down with him.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopher-r-barron\">Christopher R Barron</a>: \u2018Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Christopher Barron\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump came to this behind in the polls and reeling after weeks of negative media coverage. He needed a big night \u2013 and he got one.</p> <p>For a campaign that prides itself on its mastery of policy, Hillary spent much of the night trying to get Trump to take the bait on sideshow issues.</p> <p>In previous debates, Trump took the bait. Tonight, however, we saw a much more disciplined candidate. Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy and \u2013 quite frankly \u2013 she had her worst debate performance. </p> <p>Unlike previous moderators, Chris Wallace was willing to properly challenge both Trump and Clinton. His line of questioning, particularly when it came to the Clinton Foundation, kept Hillary off balance.</p> <p>Clinton also found herself on the defensive on foreign policy, where she seemed more like a George W Bush Republican than a Democrat.</p> <p>As a result, this ended up being Trump\u2019s best debate. For far too long, the Republican candidate has let the campaign be about the circus and not about policy. If this race is about the circus then Hillary Clinton wins. If its about policy then Trump has a shot. It\u2019s frustrating for me, as a Trump supporter, that it has taken this long for him to focus on where his opponent stands on the issues.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-wolffe\">Richard Wolffe</a>: \u2018Trump refused to acknowledge that he might just need to play the role of the Loser\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"154828c7249f9d4bf4883c5db3caa03185e1f0b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/154828c7249f9d4bf4883c5db3caa03185e1f0b2/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Richard Wolffe\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It must be hard to live like Donald Trump. No, really. For years he has styled himself as the world\u2019s greatest gold-plated Winner. Now, at the peak of his celebrity, the GOP nominee is staring at the cold, hard prospect of defeat.</p> <p>In the final presidential debate of the 2016 carnival, Trump refused to acknowledge that he might just need to play the role of the Loser, and accept the result of an election that is less than a month away.</p> <p>\u201cI will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve seen is so bad.\u201d</p> <p>What we\u2019ve all seen from Trump is so bad, but he somehow managed to be even worse on stage in Las Vegas. He played a caricature of himself that contrived to be even more childish and temperamental than Alec Baldwin\u2019s rendition of him on Saturday Night Live.</p> <p>\u201cThere was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged,\u201d said Hillary Clinton. At which point, Trump leaned into his microphone and said: \u201cShould have gotten it.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s one thing to lose your self-control on Twitter. It\u2019s another to thing to lose it while talking about Twitter.</p> <p>Clinton goaded Trump as easily as an older sister drives her brother into a full-blown tantrum. She called him a puppet of Vladimir Putin. His response? \u201cNo, you\u2019re the puppet.\u201d</p> <p>She said the intelligence agencies blamed election-related cyberattacks on Russia. His response? \u201cShe has no idea whether it\u2019s Russia, China or anybody else,\u201d said the puppet. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>Barely a limo ride away from the Pyramids, the Grand Canal and the Eiffel Tower (the Vegas versions, at least) the GOP nominee explained his foreign policy in remarkable detail. He accused US forces of attacking Isis in Mosul simply to help Clinton get elected, before giving us his Cliffs Notes on the city. \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cMosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, she took everybody out. We lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Hangover series, this Trump debate trilogy has grown wan and tired in its final outing. The scriptwriters have run out of ideas.

However, in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/policies-for-election-observers.aspx#access\">at least 40 states</a>, partisan observers must be accredited or appointed. </p> <p>It\u2019s very possible that Trump\u2019s informal observers will be turned away if they haven\u2019t obtained the proper accreditation.</p> <p>Observers are typically allowed to watch the casting of ballots, testing of voting equipment and the counting of the ballots. States generally specify the number of partisan observers allowed at the polling place, how they are appointed and trained, when and where they are allowed to operate and what their responsibilities entail. </p> <p>Monitors are strictly prohibited from interfering with the electoral process, which includes intimidating voters, election officials and poll workers. If an issue arises, observers are allowed to alert the election officials or the authorities. </p> <p>Yet despite Trump\u2019s repeated calls for supporters to register to be poll watchers, there appears to be no real effort underway for them to do so, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/donald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html\">New York Times report</a> from this week. Local officials in battleground states told the Times that the numbers of people seeking to be poll watchers are \u201con par\u201d with years past. </p> <h2>What are poll workers?</h2> <p>Poll workers are civically minded recruits or volunteers who agree to give up their election day to work extremely long hours for very little pay. Because election day is on a Tuesday and is not a federal holiday, the job disproportionately attracts retirees and the marginally employed.</p> <p>Each state has a different set of laws and rules governing the selection and eligibility of a poll worker. But in general, they are eligible voters registered in the state where they are stationed. Training is typically offered or required both online and in-person, and workers in some states receive increased pay for having the extra instruction. Poll workers are not expected to be politically agnostic, but they are deployed to stations in a bipartisan manner. </p> <p>A typical day\u2019s work can be 11 or 12 hours, and includes opening and closing the polling stations, issuing ballots to registered voters, registering voters, monitoring the voting equipment or counting votes. Poll workers are typically paid for working election day and afforded a small stipend for meals and travel. </p> <p>US elections suffer from a dearth of volunteers. The shortage can result in longer lines, which can in turn depress voter turnout.</p> <h2>What are observers watching for?</h2> <p>There are several categories of observers, all of whom have different goals. The types of observers include partisan, nonpartisan, nonpartisan international and academics. Trump is specifically asking his supporters to ensure that election officials do not disadvantage his campaign. </p> <p>Nonpartisan observers are typically focused on ensuring integrity and transparency in the electoral process and should not have a stake in the outcome of the election. If carried out properly, these observers can provide useful feedback to improve election procedures going forward. </p> <p>Many poll watchers consider themselves voter rights activists,<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-monitors-arent-trump-thinks_us_57bcae40e4b03d51368b46b6\"> there to help prevent</a> instances of disenfranchisement \u2013 intentional and unintentional. In an essay for the Huffington Post, a poll monitor in California said instances of alleged voter fraud are incredibly rare. The most common problems watchers observe are related to a poll worker\u2019s failure to provide proficient translation or requiring a voter show ID that is not required. </p> <h2>What is voter fraud?</h2> <p>Voter fraud is committed when there is a deliberate interference with the election process. Examples of this include casting more than one ballot, voting under the name of a deceased person, casting a ballot by a felon who is not eligible to vote, registering to vote as a fictional person or someone else, impersonating another voter or manipulating the ballots by election officials. </p> <h2>Is voter fraud rampant? </h2> <p>Americans are sharply divided along mostly partisan lines about the extent to which voter fraud is committed. Conservatives have long alleged voter fraud is widespread and that preventing it is paramount to preserving the integrity of the election process. Yet critics note that many of the measures designed to reduce voter fraud and passed by Republican legislatures disproportionately impact poor and minority voters.</p> <p>Furthermore, research indicates that instances of voter fraud are relatively rare, and that claims of widespread voter fraud are greatly exaggerated. A <a href=\"http://votingrights.news21.com/interactive/election-fraud-database/\">News21 investigation</a> found just 2,068 cases of alleged election fraud between the years 2000 and 2011, when the report was published. Similarly, an investigation by Justin Levitt of the Loyola Law School found even fewer instances of voter fraud:<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\"> just 31 \u201ccredible\u201d incidents </a>of voter impersonation out of 1bn votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p> <p>Recent allegations of widespread voter fraud are often misrepresented. Multiple fact checks have debunked accusations of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\">voter fraud in Philadelphia</a> in 2012. The allegations stemmed from the fact that 100% of voters in 59 zones voted for Obama over Mitt Romney.</p> <p>While some saw the numbers as evidence of foul play, fact checkers deemed it wholly plausible and mathematically possible. The average number of registered voters in these small divisions within Philadelphia is 616, and the average number of registered Republicans in the divisions is 17,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\"> according to Politifact</a>. In a 2012 lawsuit over a voter identification, lawyers for the state of Pennsylvania <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/pennsylvania-admits-it-no-voter-fraud-problem/2012/07/24/gJQAHNVt6W_blog.html?utm_term=.e9d6b05d5e06\">conceded</a> that there have been \u201cno investigations or prosecutions of in-person voter fraud in Pennsylvania\u201d. </p> <p>In addition to Philadelphia, Trump has singled out Chicago and St Louis as cities where observers should expect voter fraud. There is no evidence to support that these cities are particularly beset by voter fraud. </p>",

The Hillary Clinton campaign took over the local Democratic office, thereby effectively ensconcing her as the establishment candidate. \u201cThey traditionally have a very solid network of precinct committeemen who tell people who to vote for, basically,\u201d said Dave Ring, who runs the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downtownfarmstand.com/\">Downtown Farmstand organic food store and deli</a> (which has Cubano paninis to die for). But that didn\u2019t work this time. The primary in May coincided almost precisely with the start of an FBI investigation into the local Democratic-run city council over conflicts of interest.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been asking Muncie residents to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/11/us-election-gary-younge-muncie-indiana\">guide and shape this series</a> \u2013 two contributors, Bob and Bryan, let me know about Farmstand. Another local reader, Timothy Fowler, suggested I meet Morgan Aprill of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PSABallState/\">Progressive Student Alliance</a>. Aprill, 23, grew up on a dairy farm in a small town with conservative, religious parents (many of the young people I spoke to have parents who are voting for Donald Trump, although Aprill says her parents won\u2019t be) and here she was canvassing for a revolution on the south side of town, the poor white side of town, where she had not spent much time before. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be shouted at for being a scummy liberal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut most everyone I talked to was already planning to vote for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b25d22a8c5b06127ce38403d7df7b69f97ecef69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25d22a8c5b06127ce38403d7df7b69f97ecef69/116_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Aprill of the Progressive Student Alliance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morgan Aprill of the Progressive Student Alliance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian/Gary Younge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ring was not surprised that support grew. \u201cI think people here understand inequality,\u201d he said. He is fourth generation Muncie. Both his grandfathers worked at <a href=\"http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=62&amp;ArticleID=78894\">the BorgWarner car plant, which is now closed</a>. \u201cAnd they understand the trade issue. People know what killed their jobs and that was Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement]. And not only did it kill our jobs here but it exploited people elsewhere and I think people are starting to understand how multinational corporations work. They move the jobs where there\u2019s people they can exploit. So I think people were able to hear his message and I think he put it out in a very cogent way.\u201d</p> <p>By 3 May when the Indiana primary took place, Clinton had all but claimed victory nationally. The week before, she had won Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Sanders won just Rhode Island, the smallest state in the union. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/03/indiana-primary-results-live\">he caused an upset in Indiana</a>, taking the state 52.7%-47.3% and Delaware County 55.7%-44.3%. People assign his victory in Muncie to the large student population at Ball State University. It\u2019s true that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/election/primaries/states/in/Dem\">statewide his victory was largely thanks to winning the under-40s with wide margins</a> and losing older groups more narrowly. He also did well with men, whites, the well-off and Independents. Bernardo says it would be a mistake to put it down to just students. \u201cHe did well in neighbouring counties where there was no university \u2013 95% of the volunteers doing the phone banking came from the community at large.\u201d</p> <p>Another reader, Cathy Day, a professor at the university, was one of them. Day, 48, had started following Sanders after she saw him<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005431.html\"> filibuster Obama\u2019s tax cut compromise in 2010</a>. Like Day, for many people I\u2019ve met this is very personal. This was her first campaign. \u201cMy dad worked on the railroad and the story Bernie was telling about working class people struck a chord with me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents remortgaged their home many times to put three kids and my mum through college and then lost everything in 2008. All of that work they put in and they\u2019re left with nothing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3280ee03ac33816e7aa4777b3d67875a38581f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3280ee03ac33816e7aa4777b3d67875a38581f05/591_133_2721_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cathy Day, a professor at Ball Sate University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cathy Day, a professor at Ball Sate University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gail Werner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">In 2008 when I covered the election from Roanoke, Virginia</a>, I saw a lot of people inspired by the Obama campaign who either ceased being active or whose energies were dissipated once the election was over. Some Sanders supporters may have gone back to doing what they were doing before or are now spectating, but there are opportunities to stay active. Sanders has set up <a href=\"https://ourrevolution.com/\">Our Revolution</a> to keep the campaign for a more progressive America going now that he has conceded, which Ring has some involvement in. The extension of the movement provoked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/fleeing-the-bern-half-of-staff-quit-sanders-legacy-project-before-it-begins\">some national disillusionment</a>, however, at the notion of a top-down grassroots organisation.</p> <p> At the university, the Sanders campaign transformed into the Progressive Student Alliance, with which Aprill is involved, which is now concentrating on the <a href=\"http://www.unkochmycampus.org/\">UnKoch My Campus</a> campaign to protest <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2016/03/02/papa-john-koch-gift-325m-ball-state/81223330/\">the Koch brothers\u2019 plan to fund an Institute for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise at Ball State</a>. At a table by the refectory on Tuesday the Progressive Student Alliance provided leaflets calling on students to oppose the influence of the Kochs on campus. \u201cAbout half have heard of them. People are quite receptive.

Ring will vote for Clinton too, as will Silas, 29, with whom I watched the first debate at the Fickle Peach. \u201cI agree with her on 80% of everything. I think I agree with Trump on almost nothing apart from how you spell America.\u201d This is the view of most people that I spoke to. But by no means all.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Aprill is going to vote for the Green candidate Jill Stein. \u201cI just don\u2019t trust the Democratic establishment ... The fear-mongering is the tactic of the two parties that\u2019s been used for decades to keep people in line. I think the two parties represent different flavours of the same thing which is a elite rich, wealthy class that rules our whole country. And I think it\u2019s pretty apparent by things that happened since the recession that we need more parties in our country to have an actual democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Indiana has been a reliably Republican state. But Obama did take it narrowly in 2008. And with Trump tanking nationally in the polls, it could be closer than usual. In the Senate and governor\u2019s races in the state, Aprill is voting for Democratic candidates with less progressive records than Clinton\u2019s because the contests are close. One gets the feeling she could be persuaded to back Clinton. But not easily.</p> <p>Todd Smekens, publisher of progressive midwestern media outlet, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.muncievoice.com/\">MuncieVoice</a>, voted for Sanders and will now vote for Stein. \u201cAs a progressive, the big issues for me are war, climate and the economy. I\u2019m not signing on for candidates who aren\u2019t going to do anything about those things. The job of the electorate is to assess the problem and then vote for the best candidates to deal with the problems. It\u2019s not my job to bail out the Democratic party. The Democrats keep making out like where everything is OK and it\u2019s not. Nobody\u2019s buying it.\u201d</p> <p>Said the veteran campaigner who braved the elements to sustain Occupy Muncie: \u201cDuring this last year \u2013 after almost two decades of living in this Red State \u2013 I have begun to see the social progress here in Muncie that I have long dreamed of.\u201d</p> <p><em>Main photography: David Levene</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">Last night\u2019s US presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump</a> revealed just how polarised American politics has become. But the Republicans are not the only party where the base is in revolt against its own establishment. This year\u2019s primaries saw a significant grassroots challenge to the traditional Democratic leadership too, in the shape of Bernie Sanders \u2013 a self-proclaimed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d who at one stage posed a serious threat to Clinton\u2019s nomination.</p> <p>One of the reasons I went to Muncie was because Sanders won both the county and the state in which it resides by a significant margin. I wanted to see what was driving that kind of support in a relatively conservative midwestern area \u2013 who are they, what do they want and why? Having covered the 2008 presidential election, in which Barack Obama was first elected, I also wanted to see what Sanders supporters were going to do now that their candidate was no longer running.

  "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/who-won-the-final-presidential-debate\">last debate</a> of the election, Hillary Clinton emerged the way she hoped she would, as the all-but-certain first female president of the United States.</p> <p>By refusing to pledge that he would accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">results of the election</a>, Donald Trump all-but-certainly disqualified himself for the position of president. The peaceful transfer of power after a presidential election has been the pillar of our democracy. By refusing to accept the results of the vote, Trump would be flouting the tradition of American politics and the democratic beliefs of almost all voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/who-won-the-final-presidential-debate\">Who won the final presidential debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like the two earlier debates, this one was contentious and marked by sniping between Trump and Clinton. But Trump\u2019s claims were often far-fetched and lacked a shred of factual evidence. Especially bizarre was his baseless charge that the Clinton campaign was behind the allegations of nine women that Trump improperly groped or kissed them, charges that Trump has denied.</p> <p>Some analysts thought Trump may have lost the election the day the disgusting tape of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragging</a> about his ability to kiss women and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d became public. His standing in battleground states and national polls did <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">drop precipitously</a> and steadily after the tape became public.</p> <p>But his constant claims of a rigged election and refusal to join his running mate, Mike Pence, in saying he\u2019d accept the election results are equally, if not more, outrageous. They are intended to damage people\u2019s confidence in the election process itself.</p> <p>So Trump blew his last best chance to present himself as a credible president, while Clinton, who maintained her composure throughout, radiated solidity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Going into Wednesday\u2019s debate, her stature as a candidate was much greater than in the previous two. Most national polls of late show her with a prohibitive lead over Trump. With 20 days remaining before election day, it is all but impossible for him to make up the lost ground necessary to win the presidency.</p> <p>So the debate had far lower stakes for Clinton than Trump. Her strategy was fairly simple: show Trump as not fit for the presidency, defend herself without seeming defensive or evasive and, most important, maintain the demeanor of an all-but-president.</p> <p>She did a masterful job of not letting Trump\u2019s sharp attacks rile her. She did not assault Trump with as much sting as she had in the two past debates, though she still obviously got under his skin. He blurted out that she is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">a nasty woman</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump began the debate talking in a quiet voice and scoring some points against Clinton on issues like trade. But he soon lost focus and eventually fell to pieces, denying, when there is tape to prove it, that he had demeaned the appearances of his female accusers and interrupting Clinton repeatedly, practically shouting \u201cwrong\u201d after some of her assertions about his record.</p> <p>There was substantive discussion of issues, on foreign policy, the supreme court, the US budget deficit and abortion. Clinton repeated her support for a woman\u2019s right to control her body, while Trump showed his revulsion of late-term abortions and repeatedly described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip[ping] the baby out of the womb</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton evaded direct answers posed by the moderator, Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace about her ethics and used her answers to accuse Trump of being Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet,\u201d a remark that clearly rankled with him.</p> <p>But she was careful to be positive, too, saying that America is great because \u201cits people are good\u201d. She said she had devoted her life\u2019s work to women and children and would devote her presidency to protecting them. Trump again provided a very dark vision of the United States.</p> <p>At times Clinton projected an almost regal bearing. She wore an elegant suit in white, a color she has favored at other key moments in her climb to the White House, including her Brooklyn victory rally after the primaries and at her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton-speech-artful-response-trump-dnc-verdict\">acceptance speech</a> at the Democratic convention. She clearly knows she is on the brink of making history once again.</p>",

On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data from <a href=\"http://acasignups.net/\">various states</a> and <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D\">providers</a> where <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX186EmjG4AR6ruydOJE2fGfzzCgpYCDVKZngFNf0hgLfrIhE%2BJuoUQjwImgHKotCy9LrONfdtvsk4im1VSMZcQCpaU3VHLZUiPU%3D\">rates have had higher</a> jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe take care of illegal immigrants \u2026 better than we take care of our vets\u201d</strong></p> <p>This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>. He also inflated that number. </p> <p>The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, combining an estimate <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke\">on prison costs</a> and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while migrants do not.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster.

That\u2019s partly just a matter of timing - with just 20 days to go until the election, most people have made up their minds and so polls tend to fluctuate less. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"Debates and polls\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">Debates and polls</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58080dece4b0cd26ff71eef7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T00:27:41.501Z\">1.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s <strong>activist Tom Moran</strong>, inside Trump at a rally at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas earlier today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"078215290eec3a794e0e55d79450c0380a2028cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/078215290eec3a794e0e55d79450c0380a2028cd/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Moran with his large Trump head at the rally at UNLV hours before the debate Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Moran with his large Trump head at the rally at UNLV hours before the debate Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s new work by the <b>New York-based artist Hope Gangloff</b>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d1f1c94b017e47a22040a64897803ec3e98f3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d1f1c94b017e47a22040a64897803ec3e98f3b/0_0_1536_2048/750.jpg\" alt=\"Courtesy of the artist.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtesy of the artist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hope Gangloff</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And <strong>a worker paints a mask of Donald Trump</strong> at the Shenzhen Lanbingcai Latex Crafts Factory in Shenzhen, China (picture from Tuesday):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc295e4e6a37c7813c17d2c39b1b91045d3e3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efc295e4e6a37c7813c17d2c39b1b91045d3e3da/0_173_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The factory employees 20-30 people and produces all sorts of Halloween and party costumes and masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The factory employees 20-30 people and produces all sorts of Halloween and party costumes and masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58080da8e4b005f21833b3f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T00:19:58.762Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tough luck for whoever\u2019s behind him:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CSStevensphoto/status/788894032680202245\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar gets a front row seat for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Debatenight?src=hash\">#Debatenight</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/unlv\">@UNLV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mOGyYsLCES\">pic.twitter.com/mOGyYsLCES</a></p>&mdash; Chase Stevens (@CSStevensphoto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CSStevensphoto/status/788894032680202245\">October 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58080b15e4b0cd26ff71eee9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T00:18:01.733Z\">1.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stick around for our post-debate panel</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Assuming we all make it through all 90 minutes of this, we have an invitation we\u2019d like to extend.</p> <p>We\u2019ve<strong> joined forces with WNYC and Tumblr to throw a <a href=\"https://debatepopup.splashthat.com/\">Pop-Up Debate Party</a></strong> at Tumblr\u2019s headquarters where, after the debate, we\u2019ll be hosting a post-debate flash panel featuring:</p> <p>Moderator: Nicholas Thompson, editor of NewYorker.com</p> <p>Kai Wright, host of WNYC &amp; the Nation\u2019s United States of Anxiety Podcast </p> <p>Jessica Valenti, columnist at the Guardian</p> <p>Tanzina Vega, national reporter at CNN</p> <p>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor at The Guardian</p> <p>We\u2019ll have a live video stream of the panel right here in the blog, so stick around! if you feel like.

Post-debate analysis comes to mind. Also, pre-debate analysis. Every description in advance of what we expect to happen onstage \u2013 the candidate chemistry, the tone, the issues they must surely discuss \u2013 those predictions seem unfailingly to miss. </p> <p>So let\u2019s give it another whirl. What will they discuss tonight? Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News will have questions cued to the six topic areas announced in advance: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president.</p> <p>But the candidates\u2019 preferred messages in recent days, especially as Trump is concerned, touch on different themes. Trump has been talking a lot about a rigged election and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. In recent days he has proposed ethics reform laws and congressional term limits. Meanwhile, Breitbart, Trump\u2019s phantom media arm, published today (for the first time, it seems) the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/former-tv-reporter-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-assault-229987\">story</a> of a former Arkansas broadcaster, Leslie Milwee, who says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980. She\u2019s invited to the debate.</p> <p>Trump says that Clinton emails released by Wikileaks show she is part of an international cabal, with banks and the media, to destroy the country and enrich and empower themselves. He has contended that the state department offered the FBI a quid pro quo for declassifying certain Clinton emails just as they were to come in for public scrutiny. Any of these would-be scandals might be expected to come up.</p> <p>Clinton, for her part, may want to discuss the attack by Trump on his Republican colleagues; Trump\u2019s increasingly wild talk about voter fraud; or the astounding outpouring since the last debate of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. (He denies all the claims.)

For those of us who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches</a>, this last leg of the campaign has been painful.

Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">The silver lining of Trump's misogyny?

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace - the first anchor from that network to host a presidential debate - will moderate tonight\u2019s engagement. For a network that has been embroiled in scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">brought down its chief executive</a>, Wallace\u2019s position is an opportunity to hit the reset button on a miserable year - although Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">willingness to feud</a> with Fox News personalities means that Wallace will not be protected from onstage criticism from the candidate just because he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">besties with Sean Hannity.</a></p> <p><strong>What is the format? </strong>The debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, following the same format as the first presidential debate. Each segment will be approximately 15 minutes long. Wallace will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Clinton and Trump will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. Wallace may use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. Those topics, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">as revealed by the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Debt and entitlements</li> <li>Immigration</li> <li>The economy</li> <li>Supreme Court</li> <li>Foreign hot spots</li> <li>Fitness to be president</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where is the debate being held? </strong>The debate is being held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which means that the journalists covering the debate are going to come home broke and hung over (they\u2019ve earned it, trust me).</p> <p><strong>How do I watch the misery? </strong>That\u2019s the easy part!

A week later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/ethiopia-declares-state-of-emergency-as-deadly-protests-continue\">the government announced a state of emergency</a> after protesters rampaged across Oromia, burning government buildings, and torching farms and factories.</p> <p>The events may mark a turning point in the 11-month uprising by the Oromo, Ethiopia\u2019s most populous ethnic group, who cite frustrations over political and economic marginalisation. The movement, along with a series of violent demonstrations occurring since late July in the historically powerful Amhara region, had already threatened the authority of the government, a favoured <a href=\"https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/countries/ET\">partner of the UK</a> and other donors that provide <a href=\"http://dagethiopia.org/new/oda-to-ethiopia\">close to $4bn</a> (\u00a33.2bn) in aid a year.</p> <p>The state of emergency is likely to mean the increased use of federal security forces, including the military, to quell unrest at the expense of regional states\u2019 autonomy, as well as occasional curfews and suspensions of due process. The US Department of State said the move could \u201cfurther enshrine\u201d the repression that has contributed to the crisis.<br></p> <p> The government has killed about 500 Oromo demonstrators so far during the crisis, while detaining tens of thousands more in an effort to discourage civil resistance. The message from those efforts and the latest round of unrest, however, is that it will be hard to subdue protesters, who see the government as discredited and embattled. That means the possibility of escalating violence in Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government persists with the current stand, Ethiopia may be in for long-term instability,\u201d said Hassen Hussein, a US-based regional analyst who has written sympathetically about the Oromo struggle.</p> <p>The Bishoftu violence was preceded by a two-month lull, as new Oromo ruling party leaders emerged and pledged reforms. Before that, on 6 August, activists called for a day of \u201cgrand Oromo protests\u201d, which resulted in about 70 deaths and included a rare demonstration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/29/insider-guide-addis-ababa-car-crashes-coffee-contemporary-art\">Addis Ababa</a>, the capital. Federal police dispersed that rally, scattering attendees with batons and boots.</p> <p>Among those subsequently detained was an educated young man calling himself Gudina Jalata. He\u2019d previously stayed away from protests out of fear, but felt compelled to participate by witnessing continuing injustice across the sprawling region that encircles the capital. \u201cFirst you have to be respected for your dignity \u2013 that is why I got involved. There is a lot of discrimination against the Oromo,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Before the government came to power in 1991 by removing a socialist junta, Ethiopia was a unitary state. A 1995 federal constitution ensured self-rule for minorities and promoted local languages in schools and government. However, Oromo allege the state is controlled by Tigrayans, <a href=\"http://ecadforum.com/2016/08/17/ethiopia-the-untold-plight-of-the-amhara-people/\">who comprise 6%</a> of the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/ethiopia\">almost 100 million-strong population</a>, and say farmers are being unfairly evicted by investors tied to ruling elites.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/20/unbridled-violence-gambella-ethiopia-south-sudan\">'Unbridled violence' in Gambella leaves Ethiopia searching for answers | William Davison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The divergent narratives feed a furious debate. Far from being oppressors, TPLF elites say their community made huge sacrifices during a 16-year struggle that liberated the Oromo and other groups from Amhara domination. They add that ethnic federalism now protects those hard-won rights, and power is shared equitably within government, while the statist development model pushed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\">Meles Zenawi</a>, the former TPLF chairman and prime minister who died in 2012, helped Ethiopia advance.</p> <p>For Gudina and the other detainees, such claims seem fanciful. After time in a cramped cell, his group was driven to a federal police facility in the Awash area; some were held for a week and then released, others were held for up to two weeks. There were no showers or toilets and they were given only small amounts of bread and water. The camp had three components: gruelling barefoot exercises on gravel under a scorching sun, political lessons and bouts of investigation.</p> <p>The workouts included being forced to hop forwards with hands behind their head. Even the injured had to participate; if there was any slacking off, they were beaten. \u201cIt was really inhuman,\u201d Gudina said.</p> <p>Tigrayan officers, the interviewed detainees claimed, gave lessons on federalism and ruling coalition doctrines. While they felt contempt for their instructors, the prisoners were compliant, although one bucked the trend and was severely beaten. \u201cThe constitution they are teaching us is not broken by us \u2013 they themselves break the law. For example, it\u2019s our right to protest,\u201d one explained.</p> <p>Mass detention is not a new tactic for a government that has largely failed to move Ethiopia on from an authoritarian past. There have been similar initiatives during these Oromo protests, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> said in June, while thousands have also been detained in Amhara. After the disputed elections in 2005, when Ethiopia faced its last major political crisis, the US state department said up to 18,000 youths were kept at a military camp for longer than a month.</p> <p>While the regime undertakes <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopian-mayor-says-1000-arrested-this-month-after-violence/3556118.html\">another mass roundup of suspects</a>, the efforts to indoctrinate Oromo youth are increasingly futile, Hassen believes. \u201cIf anything, it makes people even more defiant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exposing how empty the regime is, making it more vulnerable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"992e995a2eba9c55deae7237767293f91ba2d533\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992e995a2eba9c55deae7237767293f91ba2d533/0_0_2228_1485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Denkaka, Kebele, on 3 October, women mourn during the funeral of Tesfu Tadese Biru\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Denkaka, Kebele, on 3 October, women mourn during the funeral of Tesfu Tadese Biru, a construction engineer who died during the stampede after police fired warning shots at an anti-government protest in Bishoftu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiksa Negeri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ethiopia\u2019s crisis developed after only one opposition lawmaker won a federal parliamentary seat in 2010 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/ethiopian-election-marred-by-harassment-claims\">last year\u2019s election</a> produced no opposition representative.

States vary on how late they allow abortions \u2013 in some states there have been attempts to introduce very short time limits, including in North Dakota where a proposal in 2013 for a ban six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period was ruled unconstitutional, but in most states the time limit is at the start of the third trimester or earlier. There are nine states without specific term prohibitions, but clinics do not abort at such late terms: only 1.2% of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute.</p> <p><strong>\u201cClinton wants open borders\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton does not want \u201copen borders\u201d: she supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children.

Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhen you ran the state department, $6bn was missing!

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists. Like Petraeus, though, the FBI found actual intentional wrongdoing in Cartwright\u2019s case.

This complexity makes the notion of a \u201crigged\u201d national election, at least in the US, logistically daunting to the point of practical impossibility. Thirty-one states have Republican governors, including the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio; Pennsylvania only elected a Democratic governor in 2015. Polls show Trump losing even in some states where governors have strongly supported him. In Maine, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/me/maine_trump_vs_clinton-5896.html\">the Real Clear Politics average</a> shows him down five points.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/09/technology/voting-machine-hack-election/\">75% of the ballots cast </a>in federal elections have paper backups, and most electronic voting machines are not connected to the internet \u2013 though they have other flaws and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rigged-presidential-elections-hackers-demonstrate-voting-threat-old-machines/\">may be vulnerable </a>to tampering. But voter fraud to swing a major election, whether by tampering, buying votes or official wrongdoing, would quickly attract attention <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/05/donald-trump-is-wrong-rigging-an-election-is-almost-impossible/?utm_term=.e3b72d4ba7ff\">by its necessarily large scale</a>.</p> <p>If Trump loses the presidential election, it will be because American voters do not want him in the White House, not because of a conspiracy involving Republicans and Democrats alike at state and city levels around the nation \u2013 a conspiracy for which Trump has provided no evidence.</p> <p><strong>\u201cTrump\u2019s plan largely helps the wealthy and adds $20tn in debt\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton is correct that although Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut taxes for everyone, it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences.</p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d.

  "<p>The City of Melbourne covers an area which votes for progressives at a high rate at state and federal elections but thanks to voting rules is dominated by people who live elsewhere, with local residents playing a small role in electing the council.<br></p> <p>The council has been led by the lord mayor, Robert Doyle (a former state Liberal leader), for the past two terms, with a council dominated by councillors supported by local business interests and non-resident property owners. Thanks to rules which give a large number of votes to non-residents, and a postal voting system which works more efficiently for non-residents, Doyle and his coalition are likely to keep power in the city for the next four years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/how-melbournes-queen-vic-market-risks-upsetting-the-election-applecart\">How Melbourne's Queen Victoria market risks upsetting the election applecart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The City of Melbourne is quite small, covering a relatively small area in central Melbourne. In addition to the Melbourne central business district, whose ratepayers have helped build up a large budget, the council covers Docklands, Carlton, North Melbourne, Kensington and Parkville. The council does not cover other inner-city suburbs such as Fitzroy, Richmond, Collingwood or Brunswick.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a local resident you get one vote in the election. If you own property in the area but live elsewhere, up to two owners of the property can enrol to vote. Up to two representatives of local businesses can also enrol. Indeed, it\u2019s compulsory for these non-residents to enrol and vote.</p> <p>Similar rules have now been implemented for City of Sydney elections, but that council covers a larger area with a lot more residents. The residential population of the City of Melbourne is relatively small: 18 other Melbourne-area councils are more populous than the city.</p> <p>Thanks to these favourable rules and the narrowly drawn council boundaries, approximately 60% of the City of Melbourne roll is made up of business owners and out-of-area property owners, with local residents only making up 40% of the roll.</p> <p>The city\u2019s election is conducted entirely by post (like most Victorian councils), which also favours businesses and property owners over local residents. While the non-residential roll is highly accurate and compiled by the council, the local resident population is highly transient and this has meant that many ballot papers haven\u2019t reached the correct person.</p> <p>As of Wednesday, barely 35% of ballots had been returned \u2013 this compares with roughly 45% in 2008 and 2012, and about 55% in 2004. With no option for voters to cast a vote on Saturday at a local polling place, voters\u2019 last chance will be to drop their ballot in to the local council offices on Friday.</p> <p>All of this adds up to a voting system designed to keep the council in the hands of money, and out of the hands of residents. A majority of councillors live outside the council area, and largely rely on the votes of business and out-of-area property owners to win election.</p> <p>The attempted introduction of such a system in Sydney was met with outrage, as it was a transparent attempt to remove Clover Moore from power. No such outrage was seen in Melbourne as successive Liberal and Labor governments in the 1990s and early 2000s enhanced the role of property owners and business in controlling the city council. There should be no doubt: the voting system is designed to prevent the election of a Clover Moore-style lord mayor who would prioritise the interests of residents over property owners and business.</p> <p>Doyle is running for a third term as lord mayor. He was first elected in 2008 to succeed John So, and won a second term in 2012 with just over 40% of the primary vote. Doyle had previously served as leader of the state Liberal party from 2002 to 2006.</p> <p>There is a wide range of candidates challenging Doyle, including the pollster Gary Morgan and the former federal MP Phil Cleary. But the main opposition on the council comes from the Greens, whose MPs hold the overlapping federal and state electorates, and the party primarily gains its vote from local residents.</p> <p>The City of Melbourne is one of the fastest-growing council areas in the country. More than 25,000 more voters are enrolled this year than in 2012. The local council has a large budget and is overseeing significant changes to the city centre, and the new council will have a lot of influence over what direction that council takes. But the voice of local residents will come second as these big decisions are made.</p>",

Reams have already been written. We know insecurities are exploited for financial gain.<br></p> <p>We know there is a relentless and unrealistic pressure put on women to look a certain way from when they were girls.</p> <p>We know that more often than not, the product being sold just doesn\u2019t work.

But this campaign isn\u2019t just saying overweight people may not be inclined to show their bodies, it\u2019s also saying any woman could, and perhaps should, be self-conscious taking her clothes off. </p> <p>No matter your size you are susceptible to this campaign, whether you think you should lose 10kg, 30kg, or 2.5kg there is something in here for everyone. It\u2019s not just about being overweight, it\u2019s about every woman who has ever wished something about their body was different. Which is pretty much all women.</p> <p>It\u2019s so boring.</p> <p>This is the thin edge of the Donald Trump wedge, the insidious everyday misogynistic messaging we are telegraphed about how we should look, how it matters. It is the other end of the sexism spectrum to Trump who trumpets it, says bluntly: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/donald-trump-khloe-kardashian_us_5800e4c6e4b06e0475943e67\">\u201cShe is a fat piglet.\u201d</a></p> <p>If there is any silver lining, it is that more and more women are not putting up with this any more. Trump is actually losing votes over his comments and treatment of women. Weight Watchers was forced to respond to the backlash \u2013 it hasn\u2019t pulled the campaign but Weight Watchers\u2019 senior marketing manager, Rebecca Melville, conceded it could cause offence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/29/morbid-obesity-anorexia-disorder-fat-shaming\">Fat-shaming is as disgusting as any other prejudice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe launched in stages and that has fuelled the conversation without context,\u201d <a href=\"https://mumbrella.com.au/weight-watchers-night-light-dubbed-dim-idea-402490\">she told Mumbrella</a>. </p> <p>What context do we need?

Ridge said he was voting for Trump because he believed the supreme court was \u201ca major issue\u201d.

It is this market, which spreads over two city blocks and sells everything from cheap souvenirs to fresh produce and truffle-infused cheeses, that has driven him to run on the Melbourne city council ballot as the lead candidate for domestic violence campaigner and independent, Phil Cleary. </p> <p>They are staunchly opposed to the council\u2019s $250m redevelopment plan for the market, which has heritage listing. </p> <p>The push for the comprehensive redevelopment, the most expensive and extensive in the market\u2019s history, has become a pet project for the Liberal lord mayor, Robert Doyle. If elected on Saturday he will become the first Melbourne lord mayor to serve three consecutive terms. But if he loses, his council-approved plan for the 140-year-old market, a hodgepodge of art deco detailing and old-world charm, may be the reason why.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What he\u2019s proposing will change the fabric of it</p> <footer> <cite>Phil Cleary</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In newspaper editorials and on social media, celebrities through to humble traders like Caiafa have weighed in on the plan, which will see trestle tables replaced with fixed trading stalls in open sheds, the carpark abolished and moved underground, and increases in community space. </p> <p>It may seem like the investment should be welcomed given the roofing is in desperate need of waterproofing, the toilets are dank, and water and electricity access to outdoor fruit and vegetable vendors is almost non-existent. But Cleary and Caiafa feel the redevelopment goes too far.</p> <p>\u201cRobert Doyle\u2019s plan is promising to sanitise the market and turn it into a food hall-slash-supermarket, and what he\u2019s proposing will change the fabric of it,\u201d Cleary says.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s sending everything underground, the forklifts, the traders, the refrigeration. It\u2019s the antithesis of what the market ought to be. It\u2019s a disgraceful plan that has become symbolic of so many of inner-Melbourne\u2019s problems.\u201d</p> <p>Cleary believes those problems include high-rise development favoured over preserving open space and community, and increasing overcrowding and congestion. The market\u2019s sprawling mix of traders makes it a place people wander through and take their time, talking to traders who have been there, in some cases, for three generations.</p> <p>A 40-year resident of Melbourne, actor Sigrid Thornton, is a regular shopper at the market. She says there are enough \u201csanitised and curated\u201d markets around Melbourne and fears the redevelopment will see the Queen Vic\u2019s character destroyed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t want the market to be curated, and made into a David Jones food hall</p> <footer> <cite>Sigrid Thornton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s a slightly haphazard place, that it\u2019s not especially well planned, and yet it works,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cI like the forklifts and the the bustle. Hiding the working mechanisms of the market underground seems to me a variety of desecration. I don\u2019t want the market to be curated and made into a David Jones food hall. As much as I enjoy David Jones food hall, we have one of those already.\u201d</p> <p>Like several of the traders spoken to by Guardian Australia, Thornton feels that if the council had properly invested in the market over the past decade, such a drastic redevelopment would not be required now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a1b6a56c3acf960577a11e1a80796af2cbd2ea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a1b6a56c3acf960577a11e1a80796af2cbd2ea4/113_214_3366_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kay Gibson 68 and her partner Allan Searles, 65\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers Kay Gibson 68 and her partner Allan Searles, 65, were visiting from Brisbane. \u2018I hope whatever they do with it, they remember it\u2019s all about the culture, how you come, walk through, and see different foods from all over the place.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meredith O'Shea/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt seems to be a classic move, running something down so you can announce that something exciting and new is being planned, and the tone becomes one of being a rescuer,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But Doyle rejects claims that the market has been historically neglected, saying the council invested roughly $5m per year in the site. He insists he was not caught off-guard by the protests to his plan or the fight he now has to convince traders and the general public that the overhaul will reap rewards. </p> <p>\u201cYou can go back to the 1950s and you\u2019ll find the councillor who was chair of the marketing committee at the time saying that it was ridiculous the market did not have childcare facilities, or cold and running water,\u201d he says. \u201cThose issues haven\u2019t been addressed to this day, because every time the traders have arced up.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There comes a point where giving it another coat of paint just doesn\u2019t cut it</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Doyle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Doyle says while some traders were resistant, others had told him unless the council made a significant investment, the market may not still be there in 20 years time. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced of the business case we\u2019ve made to the state government for this project,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere comes a point where giving it another coat of paint just doesn\u2019t cut it. We\u2019re doing this for the traders, we know visitation will grow by 70% and retail spending will triple within 10 years of us doing this. Independent reports have verified the cost benefits of this.\u201d</p> <p>He admits briefly that consultation with stallholders about the plans could have been better. A key issue traders have is with the council\u2019s behind-closed-doors negotiations with developers to build an underground car park and childcare centre on the neighbouring council-owned Munro site, and there is anger that traders don\u2019t know where their stalls will be located once their leases, guaranteed until 2022, expire.<br></p> <p>But Doyle says it\u2019s unrealistic to expect a plan for where stalls will be located beyond 2022.</p> <p>\u201cHowever there is no secret plan to tip people out of the market then,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there is some mischief going on in some of the concerns being raised, given there will be more open space and more people attracted to the market. \u201c</p> <p>The market, which trades on Tuesdays and Thursday-Sunday, was only being used 40% of the time, Doyle adds. </p> <p>The council has already experimented with holding night markets on Wednesday nights throughout summer, in which artisan food trucks and live performers fill the asphalt, which usually lies abandoned and dark once the stallholders shut shop for the day.</p> <p>However the president of the Queen Victoria Market Traders Incorporated and owner of the big Vic Deli, Kon Kardaras, says many traders are opposed to increased pressure for extended trading. </p> <p>\u201cOur primary concern is that it will shift the focus away from it being a trading place as a market to a civic centre, but the reality is that this is a precinct of family-operated businesses that cannot operate seven days a week,\u201d he says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bae9c390672a494ffcf1c1d9126df2161665275b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bae9c390672a494ffcf1c1d9126df2161665275b/101_314_3254_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Meredith O\u2019Shea .

I have travelled the world making cheeses and salamis and that\u2019s what people come to me for.\u201d</p> <p>Kardaras favours a more modest redevelopment. He doesn\u2019t want to see trestle tables replaced with individual lock-up spaces sporting drawer-shutters, or casual eateries replaced with fine dining. </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re torn between the concept of what is 21st century, and what is attractive,\u201d he says. \u201cTwenty-first century Melbourne is cubicles but is it charming and appealing?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the charm that attracted Kay Gibson, 68, and her partner Allan Searles, 65, all the way from Brisbane. They made a stop at the market on Tuesday before attending a rock concert in the evening.</p> <p>\u201cI used to live in Melbourne, and I think [the market] is wonderful,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cI used to come once a fortnight, it\u2019s great to come and buy all your fruits and I love the deli part. I hope whatever they do with it, they remember it\u2019s all about the culture, how you come, walk through and see different foods from all over the place.\u201d</p> <p>Doyle dismisses concerns the character of the market will be lost.</p> <p>Part of the reason for the Unesco world heritage listing application was to protect that, he says. He believes what patrons will see at ground level post-development won\u2019t be much different to the look of the market now.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any fear about the feel of the market being lost, there\u2019s no intention to spit-polish it,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>Doyle met with senior representatives from the CFMEU, the Electrical Trades Union Victoria and the Plumbers Union this week to reassure them about the future of the site and that the heritage would be preserved. There has been talk from the unions of implementing a \u201cgreen ban\u201d on the development works, a form of industrial action to protect culturally and architecturally significant heritage buildings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/victoria-plans-harsher-penalties-for-cowboy-developers-after-historic-pub-demolished\">Victoria plans harsher penalties for 'cowboy developers' after historic pub demolished</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat they wanted was accurate information,\u201d Doyle says. \u201cI believe I managed to reassure them.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his confidence in the redevelopment plan, Doyle admits to feeling nervous about election day on Saturday. </p> <p>\u201cNo election is ever in the bag and it\u2019s even worse when you\u2019re the purported frontrunner and favourite,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe difficulty for me is that with all the preferencing against me although I may win on primaries, bit by bit someone else might leapfrog ahead of me.\u201d </p>",
