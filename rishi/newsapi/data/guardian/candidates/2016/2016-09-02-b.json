  "<p>Spain has moved closer to the prospect of holding its third general election in a year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/spain-mariano-rajoy-third-general-election-christmas-day\">slated for Christmas Day</a>, after its acting prime minister once again failed to win parliament\u2019s backing to form a government that would bring an end to eight months of political paralysis.</p> <p>On Friday evening, 48 hours after falling six seats short of a majority in the 350-seat congress of deputies, Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), lost a second investiture debate by the same margin as the first: 170 votes to 180.</p> <p>As predicted, the effort proved unsuccessful after the Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, maintained his refusal to support Rajoy or facilitate the formation of a PP-led minority government by abstaining. Instead, S\u00e1nchez used the highly charged debate to suggest that the \u201cforces of change\u201d could yet try to form an alternative administration to solve the political deadlock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5cfcfdb8048d8f86bc7c3030e1213c72c22e941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5cfcfdb8048d8f86bc7c3030e1213c72c22e941/146_86_3378_2453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro S\u00e1nchez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leader of the Socialist party, Pedro S\u00e1nchez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kiko Huesca/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The country has been in the hands of Rajoy\u2019s caretaker administration since last December\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/21/spain-broad-consensus-messy-election-result-parliament-opportunity-challenge\">inconclusive general election</a>, when the PP won 123 seats, but fell short of a majority. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/spanish-elections-exit-polls-show-deadlock-likely-to-continue\">repeat election held at the end of June</a> also yielded a hung parliament: although the conservative PP picked up 14 more seats, meaning a majority again proved elusive.</p> <p>Unless Rajoy or any of his opponents can find a way out of the enduring impasse, electoral law means the king will dissolve parliament in eight weeks\u2019 time, with fresh elections likely to be held on 25 December. Neither the prospect nor the timing of a third election will be popular with Spanish voters, who are growing tired of the politicking and the lack of a proper government.</p> <p>Speaking before the vote, Rafael Hernando, the PP\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, said that while the idea of further elections was ridiculous, the party would take the necessary steps to ensure Christmas was not ruined by a return to the polls. One mooted solution is to cut the campaign period in half so that the vote would be held on 18 December.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s favourite movie is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/28/scale-of-hearst-plot-to-discredit-orson-welles-and-citizen-kane-revealed\" title=\"\">Citizen Kane</a>, as he explains in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upC8pX3RY0A\" title=\"\">oddly mesmeric archive footage</a> released earlier this year by the documentary maker Errol Morris. \u201cCitizen Kane is really about accumulation,\u201d he analyses. Asked to offer a fix for the protagonist\u2019s problems, Trump advises: \u201cGet yourself a different woman.\u201d Like the rest of us, Charles Foster Kane \u2013 and indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/28/scale-of-hearst-plot-to-discredit-orson-welles-and-citizen-kane-revealed\" title=\"\">William Randolph Hearst</a>, on whom Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece was transparently based \u2013 should have listened to the Donald. The Donald knows the value of the women we accumulate, or certainly the price of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'His outrageous insults about Megyn Kelly\u2019s period or Hillary being 'schlonged' do not justify the defaming of Melania'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That said, it is crucial to note that we are talking about a takeover here, not a transaction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, is suing the Mail and some blogger</a> over the allegation that Melania once traded as an escort. The Mail has retracted the story, explaining that it was merely pointing out some things that someone else had said that weren\u2019t true. The blogger has taken down his posts; the $150m lawsuit remains. If they settle quickly, it might pay for some of Trump\u2019s election ads.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly one way of shutting the idea down, though it may remind some that there was a dimension of sexual prurience to Hearst\u2019s furious campaign against Welles\u2019s movie. Rosebud was the name on the sledge that perhaps represented Kane\u2019s last moment of childhood innocence, but was also, as Gore Vidal later pointed out advisedly, Hearst\u2019s pet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/25/citizen-kane-rosebud\" title=\"\">nickname for the clitoris of his mistress, Marion Davies</a>. Hearst was said to be as mad about this as Trump now clearly is at the suggestion that his wife was once available for hire.</p> <p>Certain liberals seem able to overlook the ethics of the Mail\u2019s actions on the basis that Trump has made a bed of psychosexual and misogynistic slurs in which the Melania tale has merely forced him to lie. Yet however outrageous his insults <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/09/politics/donald-trump-blood-comment-response-2016-sotu/\" title=\"\">about Megyn Kelly\u2019s period</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/21/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-disgusting-for-using-the-restroom-during-a-debate/\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s bathroom break</a>, or <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-disgusting/\" title=\"\">Clinton getting \u201cschlonged\u201d</a>, none of these should justify the shaming and defaming of Melania.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7430c2750ff8487f70ae6137844466e6e45d8e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7430c2750ff8487f70ae6137844466e6e45d8e1/0_308_3666_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sledge called rosebud goes up in flames in Citizen Kane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosebud \u2013 \u2018the name on the sledge that perhaps represented Kane\u2019s last moment of childhood innocence\u2019, goes up in flames in Citizen Kane, Orson Welles\u2019 masterpiece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, the tale is not without significance. Vidal didn\u2019t care about Rosebud for reasons of titillation or tedious voyeurism. As he put it to <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1989/08/17/rosebud/\" title=\"\">a lawyer who took him to task over the allegation</a>: \u201cUnlike today\u2019s journalists and tell-all biographers I have very little interest in the sex lives of others. But the significance of Rosebud, if that indeed was Hearst\u2019s private name for Marion\u2019s tender button, goes a long way toward explaining Hearst\u2019s fury at Orson Welles\u2019s Citizen Kane.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m with Gore. I have very little interest in whether Melania Trump was or wasn\u2019t an escort. As the obvious joke goes, the far more damaging claim is that she is married to Donald Trump. I am interested, however, in the particular things that particularly enrage the Republican nominee in the US presidential election. I am interested in which untruths Trump will spout again and again, and I am interested in which untruths spouted by others he won\u2019t stomach. I am especially interested in why it might be that he will not stomach them.</p> <p>What is it about this allegation about his wife that Trump particularly dislikes? (And don\u2019t for a minute think this suit is something Melania would have been permitted to bring on her own.) After all, this is a man whose conception of human and political engagement appears to be solely transactional. He has always been eminently relaxed about the racy nature of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/mar/17/what-donald-trump-butler-saw-behind-scenes-real-life-xanadu-citizen-kane\" title=\"\">Melania\u2019s earlier modelling work</a>. He even gave the New York Post a pass when they published pictures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/melania-trump-nude-photos-work-visa-immigration\" title=\"\">Melania with her hands on her rosebud</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\">Melania Trump sues the Daily Mail for $150m over 'lies' about her past</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, Trump is a man who actively seeks the sexual approval of other men for the women he values in his life (all two of them). Consider his serial ogling of his daughter Ivanka, and repeated declarations that <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-wont-stop-joking-about-banging-his-daughter/\" title=\"\">he\u2019d have her if he wasn\u2019t her father</a>. Professionally, Trump the employer is at pains to remind us he must respect women <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/ex-trump-employee-speaks-out-on-his-treatment-of-women-20160329\" title=\"\">because he has paid some for their services</a>.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t think Trump should mind in theory about acquiring something that other men had bought before him \u2013 after all, that\u2019s real estate, baby. It doesn\u2019t matter that other men owned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/mar/17/what-donald-trump-butler-saw-behind-scenes-real-life-xanadu-citizen-kane\" title=\"\">Mar-a-Lago, his Floridian estate</a>, before he did. What matters is that he ended up with it, and it\u2019s what you do with the place that counts. He specified certain improvements. He demands that it be kept a certain way. He has made something special of it. He constantly brags about the way that it looks, reminding people that it is, above all else, a prestige acquisition.</p> <p>Indeed, he has deliberately opened it up to others, in the form of a country club. They are invited to feast their eyes on certain bits of it, though there are, of course, particular areas reserved just for him. There may be a right time to offload it in the future \u2013 even the most exquisitely upholstered things get tatty in the end. There\u2019s every chance that in 10 years\u2019 time a west coast newbuild would look more appealing.</p> <p>I suspect that what Trump really can\u2019t stand about the Melania escort stuff it is that it reduces him to a plot device in her story. It makes him her mark, in a way \u2013 the ticket for what he knows others will see as her gimlet-eyed journey out of Slovenia, all the way to the Trump Tower penthouse. If people were even allowed to think it might be true, just this one remove from Pennsylvania Avenue, then his entire tale would have to be constituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/donald-trumps-lawyers-demand-art-of-the-deal-co-writer-pay-back-royalties\" title=\"\">The Art of the Deal</a> by Melania Trump.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is becoming notable how many of the most psychologically revealing things written about the Trumps have been either fictional or factually untrue. I loved <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/books/review/melania-trump-in-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-short-story.html\" title=\"\">The Arrangements</a>, a short story by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie published a couple of months ago in the New York Times review, which was told from the point of view of Melania. Only yesterday I devoured a <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-donald-trump-losing-garrison-keillor-20160831-story.html\" title=\"\">Garrison Keillor open letter to Trump in the Chicago Tribune</a>, headlined When This Is Over, You Will Have Nothing That You Want, which felt like an excellent piece of creative writing. Kurt Eichenwald, a journalist who has followed Trump, subsequently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/771485108897325056\" title=\"\">marvelled</a> at how well Keillor, a writer who has never met Trump, had got to the heart of his drives and fears.</p> <p>Again, with the Donald fiction is strangely truer. Perhaps in real life Trump is so crudely drawn \u2013 indeed, he draws himself so crudely \u2013 that he feels more real in the fictional realm.</p>",

  "<p>The taco, in both its bowl and its corner truck form, is having a political moment.</p> <p>On Thursday, Marco Guti\u00e9rrez, a Mexican-born founder of the Latinos for Trump group (yikes), <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/latinos-for-trump-founder-taco-trucks-marco-gutierrez-227667\">said on MSNBC</a> that if Donald Trump loses in November, there would be \u201ctaco trucks on every corner\u201d.</p> <p>I must spell out that he meant this as a negative thing and not, as it might seem on the face of it, a great reason to vote for Hillary.</p> <p>\u201cMy culture is a very dominant culture,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/latinos-for-trump-founder-taco-trucks-marco-gutierrez-227667\">he told</a> a horrified Joy Reid, who was filling in for Chris Hayes. \u201cIt is imposing and it\u2019s causing problems. If you don\u2019t do something about it, you\u2019re going to have taco trucks on every corner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means,\u201d Joy Reid said, speaking for all of us. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid to ask.\u201d</p> <p>The comments earned Guti\u00e9rrez rightful mockery on social media. Isn\u2019t an America with a taco truck on every corner the utopia we deserve? To suggest otherwise gives us insight into the depravity of the average Trump supporter.</p> <p>Joking aside, Guti\u00e9rrez is everything the Trump campaign could want in a surrogate. He apparently possesses enough self-loathing to deliver the talking points of white supremacy from a non-white mouth. He reassures Trump supporters that their racist views couldn\u2019t possibly be racist because, see? He agrees with us!</p> <p>But Guti\u00e9rrez, whether he knows it or not, is feeding the dangerous racial anxieties that have plagued America since its inception: the idea that Mexicans and Latinos are lesser, dirty somehow; they are diluting America\u2019s purity, which Trump supporters would call \u201cculture\u201d, but I would call \u201cwhiteness\u201d.</p> <p>In times of economic strife, these anxieties tend to intensify. I\u2019m reminded of the mass deportations of people of Mexican descent in the 30s and 40s when 2 million people, over half of whom were US citizens, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">were rounded up and forced out of the country</a>.</p> <p>Today, we have a demagogue whipping white Americans into a frenzy about Mexican immigrants and threatening to send them \u201chome\u201d. The parallels are alarming. It\u2019s sad, because the people who blame their economic struggles on Mexicans really ought to redirect that anger at people like Trump, magnates born with silver spoons in their mouths whose wealth relies on the toil of others.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also hypocritical. Because the American Dream, if indeed it exists at all, looks very much like that humble corner taco truck. Just ask a Republican.</p> <p>\u201cMy father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years so that I could stand behind this podium in the front of this room,\u201d Marco Rubio said, referencing his Cuban-born father at the kick-off of his presidential campaign. \u201cThat journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio isn\u2019t alone in touting his meager beginnings. Ted Cruz, also the son of a Cuban immigrant, said his father \u201ccame to Austin penniless, seeking freedom.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason I\u2019m running is simple,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cHe fled oppression once. And you have my word that I\u2019ll fight every day to protect freedom here, so that none of us have to flee oppression a second time.\u201d</p> <p>This rhetoric isn\u2019t unique to politicians with immigrant families. During the primaries, John Kasich emphasized that his father was a mailman. Indeed, politicians of all stripes love to tout the adversity their parents overcame so that their children could be successful and live comfortably.</p> <p>And yet, they shame the immigrant parents and families who are trying to do the same for their children today. They actively pursue policies that, had they been applied to their own parents, would have made the privileged lives they live impossible.</p> <p>Donald Trump is only here because his grandfather emigrated from Germany. It has been frequently pointed out that his wife, Melania, is an immigrant from Slovenia. None of this matters to many Trump supporters, of course, whose worldview is built on white nationalism, but the fact remains: Unless you\u2019re Native American, you came from somewhere else.</p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez, Trump, and the Republicans who share the view that Mexican immigrants are the cause of America\u2019s decline have turned their backs on the one thing that\u2019s supposed to make America special.</p> <p>So today, go out and celebrate the corner taco truck. In an America where wealth continues to accumulate at the very top, and where cynicism permeates the political landscape, the taco truck remains a pure expression of hope, a humble affirmation of America itself.</p> <p>Also, the tacos are probably delicious, and undoubtedly more authentic than the hipster joint with the zigzag taco holders and $12 margaritas. </p> <p><em>Buen provecho!</em></p>",
  "<p>Islam Karimov, who has died after a brain haemorrhage aged 78, ruled the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan from 1989, first as head of the republic\u2019s Communist party and, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as the newly independent country\u2019s first president.</p> <p>Karimov\u2019s desire to build a secular state and oppose Islamism lent him an allure in the west, which for long periods seemed happy to overlook his appalling human rights record and his steadfast refusal to embrace democratic reform. Following 9/11, Uzbekistan\u2019s proximity to Afghanistan made him a key strategic ally in the US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d, and helped to attract significant economic and military support from the west, despite the tyrannical nature of Karimov\u2019s leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/uzbekistan-uncertainty-death-dictator-islam-karimov\">Uzbekistan plunged into uncertainty by death of dictator Islam Karimov</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The president made no secret of his disdain for democratic principles, and throughout his rule implemented draconian restrictions on civil liberties and political opposition. In a televised address he once warned: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to rip off the heads of 200 people ... in order to save peace and calm in the republic. If my child chose such a path, I myself would rip off his head.\u201d</p> <p>Media censorship, among the strictest in the world, was enforced by the state press committee, while arrests of dissenting journalists, human rights activists and political opponents were frequent, with many reports of the use of torture to extract confessions. The \u201cwar on terror\u201d provided Karimov with plenty of ammunition to intensify his own war on religious freedom, and he ordered mass arrests of those suspected of \u201cillegal\u201d religious practice under the pretext of safeguarding central Asia from fundamentalism.</p> <p>Political parties were theoretically permitted, but needed to seek official registration, which they were routinely refused, and Karimov was responsible for holding thousands of political and religious figures in prison. In particular, he targeted followers of the Wahhabi sect and the Hizb ut-Tahrir group, which advocated the creation of an Islamic state.</p> <p>Having served as president of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Karimov was elected the first president of an independent Uzbekistan \u2013 amid widespread suspicions of electoral fraud \u2013 soon after the Soviet Union collapsed. A referendum in 1995 extended his first term of office until 2000, and he was re-elected for a second term with a reported 92.5% of the vote.</p> <p>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe declined to send observers to those elections after dismissing the possibility of a genuine contest, and the US state department agreed that they were \u201cneither free nor fair\u201d, noting that the only official alternative candidate had himself voted for the incumbent president. However, Karimov\u2019s positions on Russia and Islamism meant that the west was largely prepared to overlook this, and many other distasteful aspects of his regime.</p> <p>Karimov was born in the ancient Silk Road city of Samarkand, though details of his early years are murky. The official hagiography described him as the son of government workers, although other versions suggest that he was orphaned and grew up in a children\u2019s home. A Soviet apparatchik, he rose through the ranks during the Leonid Brezhnev years. Having studied engineering, he worked at the Tashkent aircraft manufacturing plant, then moved to Uzbekistan\u2019s state planning committee in 1966 and gradually worked his way up the republic\u2019s Communist party ladder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29150d869730f2e22ac754b7aedd19d55c3d1cd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29150d869730f2e22ac754b7aedd19d55c3d1cd9/93_42_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Islam Karimov meeting Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, in Tashkent, 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Islam Karimov meeting Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, in Tashkent, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1983 he was appointed as the republic\u2019s minister of finance, and three years later became vice-chairman of the Uzbekistan council of ministers. He eventually became first secretary of the Communist party of Uzbekistan in 1989, and a year later president of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.</p> <p>Once he had assumed the presidency of independent Uzbekistan, Karimov started to distance himself from Moscow and to realign with the west. In 1999 he refused to renew Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment to the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, a Moscow-led union of the former Soviet republics. He allowed Nato troops to participate in military manoeuvres on Uzbek soil, and support from western governments peaked in 2001 after the events of 9/11.</p> <p>Karimov allowed the US to establish an air base in the southern city of Khanabad, which played a key role in the war against the Taliban, and in return the US government helped train the Uzbek army. In 2002 the country received $500m in aid, of which an estimated $79m was directed to the police and intelligence services.</p> <p>In that year, Craig Murray, the UK\u2019s ambassador to Uzbekistan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jul/15/foreignpolicy.uk\">made a speech to fellow diplomats and Uzbekistani officials at a human rights conference in Tashkent</a>. He highlighted the \u201cprevalence of torture in Uzbekistani prisons\u201d and a system where \u201cbrutality is inherent\u201d, referring to a case in which two men were boiled to death, which he claimed was \u201cnot an isolated incident\u201d.</p> <p>Relations with western governments became less certain from 2005, when Karimov ordered the US off the Khanabad air base and when reports came through of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/16/markoliver\">Andijan massacre</a>, in which hundreds of anti-government demonstrators were killed by troops. Thereafter, concerns about human rights abuses received more attention across the world, and it was more difficult for western governments to maintain openly cordial relations.</p> <p>At the time of the Andijan massacre it was widely believed that Karimov might leave office as a result of the fallout, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/26/eu-dictators-islam-karimov\">which included European Union sanctions</a>. But the sanctions were dropped in 2009 without any real change in direction. With Uzbekistan\u2019s energy reserves gradually becoming of more interest to the west, normal relations eventually resumed, which played a part in helping Karimov to comfortably hold on to power until his death.</p> <p>In 2014, he had a major falling out with his elder daughter, Gulnara. She had once been mooted as his likely successor, but was charged with corruption. This resulted in her being placed under house arrest, and subsequent rumours suggested that Karimov may have had her killed.</p> <p>Karimov is survived by his wife, Tatyana, and by another daughter, Lola.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Islam Abduganievich Karimov, politician, born 30 January 1938; reported dead 2 September 2016</p>",

This morning he\u2019s as fresh as a daisy, raring to go. It\u2019s barely 9am and he has already been on the radio, chatting about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/dont-mock-ed-balls-strictly-come-dancing-smart-politics\">his upcoming appearance on Strictly Come Dancing</a>, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/27/ed-balls-new-chairman-norwich-city\">chairmanship of Norwich City</a>, his memoirs, his post as senior fellow at Harvard, piano playing, marathon running, baking, you name it. Even politics.</p> <p>There was a time not so long ago when the former shadow chancellor did nothing but politics. He worried he had no hinterland. Now, having lost his seat at the 2015 general election, there\u2019s nothing but hinterland.</p> <p>Balls says Strictly is the culmination of a midlife crisis that began when Labour went into opposition in 2010. What does his wife \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/jeremy-corbyn-no-vision-post-brexit-uk-yvette-cooper\">the MP Yvette Cooper</a>, who stood for the Labour leadership last year \u2013 think of his crisis? He laughs. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s a bit indulgent. When we were both in parliament, she thought it was easier for me to have a midlife crisis than her.

When it was announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/may/08/ed-balls-loses-seat-morley-outwood-labour-general-election-2015-video\">he had lost his Morley and Outwood seat</a> at 7.30am on 8 May by 422 votes, it became emblematic of the whole shambles. The man who had expected to be chancellor was out of a job. Were you up for Ed Balls?</p> <p>He is famous for his colossal brain \u2013 and an ego to match. His self-belief might best be summed up by a promise he made four years ago when he took up the piano. He told the world that by the age of 50 he would reach grade 8. Today, he says he was rash. Now 49, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/19/ed-balls-has-passed-grade-four-piano\">he has passed grade 4</a>, and revised his target to passing grade 8 at 55.</p> <p>Balls grew up in Norwich. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/ed-balls-labour-did-not-deserve-to-win-election-ed-miliband\">his memoir</a>, Speaking Out, he plays up his working-class credentials, talking about how his grandfather would do three shifts a day on a Saturday \u2013 as a lorry driver, on the turnstiles at Norwich City, and stewarding at the speedway in the evening. What he doesn\u2019t mention is that his father studied at Oxford University and became a professor of zoology \u2013 a shame, because it\u2019s a wonderful example of upward mobility. Balls himself was privately educated.</p> <p>By his late 20s, having <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110403052914/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/03/30/origins-of-the-cameron-balls-feud/\">graduated from Oxford in PPE (</a><a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/philosophy-politics-and-economics\">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a>)<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110403052914/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/03/30/origins-of-the-cameron-balls-feud/\"> with a first</a>, and having worked for the Financial Times, he was basically running the Treasury for Gordon Brown \u2013 number two in a team of bruisers that included legendary hardmen Charlie Whelan and Damian McBride. Their battles with Tony Blair at No 10 were legendary and legion, fired by a righteous desire to redistribute more widely than Blair did.</p> <p>Speaking Out is a spiky account of his years in power. He acknowledges that he has always been ferociously ambitious and wants to win everything, from an economics argument to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2011/sep/26/mps-playing-football-gallery\">a football match against the press</a> (he has a history of elbowing the opposition). And this is quickly apparent in the book. On the surface, it is a confession about failure and vulnerability. He writes about how he failed to foresee the collapse of the banks, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/06/ed-balls-wont-apologise-stammer\">a stammer</a> that left him mute at key moments in the Commons. But in most stories he tells, he emerges victorious, or with somebody else shouldering the blame \u2013 notably the former Labour leader Ed Miliband.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb9e465f232153920ed66b7cef2f1ed1129e20d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb9e465f232153920ed66b7cef2f1ed1129e20d0/0_151_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Balls at a Labour MPs v Press Lobby football match in Liverpool in 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balls at a Labour MPs v Press Lobby football match in Liverpool in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Mitchell - The FA/The FA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the book, he suggests his image is unfair. People think he\u2019s a bruiser because of his Brown associations, his name and his rugby forward\u2019s body. I\u2019m not convinced, though. Just look at what Blair had to say about you in his memoirs, I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad, was it?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Well, it wasn\u2019t great. I quote chunks of it to him. Blair says Balls constantly briefed against him on everything from schools to tax, he refused to share information, and yes, he could win a political scrap, but he had no public appeal.</p> <p>Balls smiles. He still insists he was not responsible for the briefings \u2013 but yes, it was a tricky relationship. \u201cMy job was to tell truth to power.\u201d He talks about his great victories at the Treasury, often achieved despite Blair: keeping Britain out of the euro, handing power to the Bank of England to set its own rates, increasing tax to boost the NHS.</p> <p>People have called you an intellectual bully, I say, and have said you patronised Blair. He looks astonished. \u201cTony Blair, in his pomp, patronised? Nooooo. I mean that\u2019s just complete crap. But with the euro, we were tough with No 10. Really tough. And at times we stepped over the mark. At times we were too heavy. There is no doubt in that first period in dealing with No 10 that there were times, intellectually and in policy terms, that we were definitely too heavy. We were inclined to think we\u2019ve got the answer, we\u2019re right, and to not be sufficiently appreciating of the other side\u2019s arguments and motivations. I think we were intellectually steamrollering. I\u2019d accept that, but that isn\u2019t the same as bullying.\u201d</p> <p>He says Blair regarded him as insolent, a young punk babbling nonsense. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t nonsense. And if you don\u2019t say what you think, what\u2019s the point of being in the room? He told me to wash my mouth out once. It was very early on, \u201996, before the \u201997 election. There were the typical Gordon/Mandelson tensions going on about who was running the election campaign, there were about 12 people in the room, and Tony said: \u2018I think we should make a commitment not to raise the tax burden\u2019. I then said, in front of everybody, \u2018You can\u2019t do that\u2019, and he said why, and I said: \u2018Because then when we raise the tax burden you\u2019ll have broken your promise.\u2019 He said: \u2018Wash your mouth out young man.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Is it true he accused Blair of believing that he was bigger than the party and the only man capable of winning elections for Labour? \u201cWell, I think that was true. Sometimes people get into a mindset where they think it\u2019s all about me and only me. There was a period when there was a danger of that for Tony.\u201d</p> <p>Like Blair, Balls could now probably make squillions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/01/ed-balls-brother-57m-pimco\">his brother is a top bond dealer</a>. Is he tempted? \u201cNot to go and advise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/24/tony-blair-advice-kazakh-president-protesters\">the government of Kazakhstan</a>,\u201d he says pointedly. \u201cComing out of politics, you have to make a decision on the path you choose, and that would not be the path I would choose. In the end it\u2019s been bad for Tony Blair\u2019s reputation, because it\u2019s not looked very discerning. The issue with him is not that he\u2019s gone on to make money, it\u2019s that he may have stepped over the line with some of the people he\u2019s worked with and advised.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b06dca5235d5d77c3811a386568c70bc7e4d44d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b06dca5235d5d77c3811a386568c70bc7e4d44d2/0_221_2760_3448/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Balls with Gordon Brown, then prime minister, in 2007.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018History will be much kinder to Gordon Brown than to Tony Blair\u2019 \u2026 Balls with Brown, then prime minister, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Buckmaster/PA Archive/Press Association Ima</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Balls\u2019 battles were not just with Blair. When Brown succeeded Blair, Balls frequently found himself at loggerheads with his mentor. Did they fall out? \u201cFall out is the wrong word. It was hard because when he was prime minister he was inevitably more distant from me because of the job he was doing, and he was also angry with me for being more distant from him by doing my job.\u201d Brown promised him the job of chancellor five times, but for various reasons it never worked out. Brown pleaded for him to work alongside him at No 10, but he was committed to his ministerial post as secretary of state for children, schools and families. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say no to Gordon because he never hears no. I worked hard to try to strengthen his office so he wouldn\u2019t think I had to come in and do it. But I felt guilty. He made me feel guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Brown\u2019s many flaws, Balls remains a fan. Legacy, he says, often looks very different a few years down the line. \u201cThe judgment of history will be much kinder to John Major and Gordon Brown than to David Cameron and Tony Blair. Cameron will be remembered as the guy who took us out of Europe by mistake, Blair will be remembered as the guy who took us to a war that was judged a failure. Gordon will be the guy who, having stopped us going into the single currency, then played a really important role in stopping the world depression. John Major will be remembered as the guy who, in very difficult circumstances, won an election and negotiated the Maastricht treaty opt-out. History will judge Gordon and Major well, which is surprising.\u201d</p> <p>Having achieved so much so early as an adviser, is he disappointed with his own legacy as an MP? \u201cIn 2005 I would have definitely thought that if I didn\u2019t get to be chancellor I would have been a failure. But part of the purpose of writing the book is to say to people who want to go into politics: if you think of that as being a failure, you\u2019ll have a really disappointing time.\u201d</p> <p>Does he think his greatest political successes were before he entered parliament? \u201cI may look back on my life and think 1997-2004 was my time. On Bank of England independence, the NHS and the euro \u2013 if I hadn\u2019t been there they may not have turned out the way they did, and they have been lasting achievements. I\u2019m not sure anything has happened since 2004 of which I could say the same.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/19/ed-balls-john-mcdonnell-labour-leadership-contest\">Balls stood for the leadership of the Labour party</a>, finishing third. He has always said that if Yvette, with whom he has three children, had wanted to run at the time he would not have stood. Looking back, does he think she would have had a better chance of winning than him? \u201cYes, for three reasons. First of all, because I was defined by my relationship to Gordon. Secondly, David Miliband became the Tony Blair person and I became the Gordon Brown person, and Ed Miliband somehow managed not to be the Gordon Brown person, which I could never understand. And the third thing is there was a male, Miliband grip in that election, and it was very hard for me to break through that, whereas Yvette would have found that easier, because the issue would have been: \u2018Do you want a Miliband or do you want Labour\u2019s first woman leader?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aca1457824af4d716b5e80128a6f847685b5db24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aca1457824af4d716b5e80128a6f847685b5db24/0_0_2974_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Balls with his wife Yvette Cooper while both were cabinet ministers in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls with his wife, Yvette Cooper, while both were cabinet ministers in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive/Press Association Ima</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Speaking Out, he blames Ed Miliband for Labour\u2019s defeat, and complains that Miliband rarely spoke to him and failed to take his advice on embracing business. You give Miliband a big kicking, I say. He looks surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to give Ed a <em>big</em> kicking. I set out to explain why things have been more distant between us for a long time, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable that it will last.\u201d Balls and Miliband had worked closely together on Brown\u2019s team, with Balls very much the senior. He suggests that Miliband was so anxious that there be no repeat of the Blair/Brown fallout that he deliberately created distance.</p> <p>Did that hurt him? \u201cYes. Intellectually, objectively, I understand, but emotionally I wish it hadn\u2019t been that way. I\u2019d much rather we had been close and a team as we were at the Treasury. It\u2019s not how I would have done it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all very well blaming Miliband, I say, but you don\u2019t appear to take responsibility for the defeat. What were your biggest failings? \u201cI let Osborne off the hook in two autumn statements by allowing the story to be whether I had done a good enough response rather than what he was doing, and that\u2019s really annoying. <em>Really</em> annoying. I should have been able to make you more scared of what the Tories were trying to do. I tried.\u201d</p> <p>There was an excruciating Newsnight appearance when Balls was asked which business leaders supported Labour and he said he had just been with one, but couldn\u2019t remember his name \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/04/ed-balls-bill-newsnight-somebody-business-labour-supporter\">Bill Somebody</a>. In the book he says there are trivial cockups like this, and major ones such as when Miliband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/24/ed-miliband-forgets-labour-conference-speech\">forgot to mention the deficit</a> in his 2014 conference speech. But the Newsnight appearance was not trivial, I say: it was one of the defining images of the election campaign. To his credit, Balls now concedes that it was devastating. \u201cI had this out-of-body moment.

So I had women coders and women film-makers, women web developers, and I really liked that dynamic because I saw women taking so many leadership roles just in a small group. I liked the support that they gave me.\u201d</p> <p>Dines, who attended an all-women\u2019s high school after the ninth grade, explained her experience with single-sex education in similar terms. \u201cGoing to a woman\u2019s high school, I was never put in a place where I was like, \u2018Oh, because I\u2019m a girl, I have to do this, I have to do that.\u2019 I\u2019m never put into another category.

Trump said immigrants would face questions about honor killings, their view on \u201cwomen and gays and minorities\u201d as well as their attitudes on \u201cradical Islam\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no idea who these people are, where they come from,\u201d Trump said of Syrian refugees during his speech in Phoenix on Wednesday. \u201cI always say, Trojan horse. Watch what\u2019s going to happen, folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the hot rhetoric and controversial proposals, Trump is tapping into serious anxieties about national security and the threat of terrorism. Here we <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\">revisit the topic of Syrian resettlement </a>in the US in an effort to try to separate fact from fiction.</p> <h2>We actually do know who these people are</h2> <p>Despite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the US doesn\u2019t know who it lets into the country, the US\u2019s refugee vetting process is among the most rigorous in the western world. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/11/249613.htm\">The state department</a> has said that Syrians flown to the US are among the most heavily vetted group of people currently allowed into the country.</p> <p>In total, the screening process takes an average of 18 months to two years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies who carry out a series of security screenings and checks. </p> <p>The process begins with an initial vetting by the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency. Prospective candidates are then referred to the US, where officials from the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the defense department conduct further vetting. </p> <p>The homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, said recently that the department had \u201cadded security checks to the process\u201d specifically for Syrian refugees as well as designated more resources to help make the process more efficient. As an added check, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services are instructed to review the social media accounts of Syrian refugee applicants who are referred for more enhanced vetting. </p> <p>Immigration officials have a very good idea of who they are accepting from Syria even before their plane touches down on American soil. </p> <h2>How many Syrian refugees has the US accepted?</h2> <p>The answer is significantly more than<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\"> the last time we posed that question</a>. </p> <p>After a painstakingly slow start, the White House announced this week that it had achieved its goal of resettling 10,000 refugees by the end of this fiscal year. </p> <p>Barack Obama made the commitment last year under pressure from Europe and the United Nations for the US to play a bigger role in confronting the global refugee crisis. The majority of the refugees were accepted in the last three months. Before that, the US had admitted just a quarter of the 10,000 displaced Syrians it pledged to resettle. In total, the US has resettled roughly 12,000 Syrian refugees since the war began five years ago.</p> <p>To help ease the integration process, the refugees are resettled in areas where they have family ties. For those who have none, the resettlement groups try to place them in cities with an established community of Syrian immigrants or where they will have the best chance of finding jobs.<br></p> <p>These groups \u2013 a coalition of humanitarian and religious nonprofits \u2013 help adults find work, enroll their children in school and learn English. During this process, they receive housing and financial assistance. One year after being admitted, refugees can apply for a green card at which point they must submit to another screening.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\"> has called </a>for the US to resettle an additional 55,000 refugees from Syria in addition to the 10,000 pledged by Obama. And even if the US were to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees, it will still be just a fraction of the more than 4.8 million Syrians who have fled mostly to neighboring countries who are bearing the biggest burden of the world\u2019s largest refugee crisis. </p> <h2><strong>Are Syrian refugees likely to be Isis sympathizers?</strong></h2> <p>The Syrian refugees who are coming to the US are among the most vulnerable in the Syrian conflict: many are women and their children, religious minorities and victims of violence or torture. Many have fled to escape the brutality of both the Islamic State, or Isis, and the Assad government and are doing so at their own peril. </p> <p>The worsening Syrian refugee crisis has undermined Isis\u2019s claim that its caliphate is a safe haven for Muslims. In choosing to risk their lives on the dangerous journey to Europe and beyond rather than join Isis\u2019s caliphate is a sharp rejection of the group and its ideology. On <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/09/22/442520787/the-flood-of-syrian-refugees-puts-isis-on-the-defensive\">several occasions the Islamic state</a> has condemned refugees who flee its strongholds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/us-military-iraq-syria-sean-macfarland-republican-carpet-bomb-isis\">US military commander in Iraq and Syria rejects GOP pledges to 'carpet-bomb' Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In effect, some experts argue that by rejecting Syrian refugees, American politicians are in fact helping Isis. When the US shuts the door on Syrian Muslims, it reinforces Isis\u2019s argument that the west does not want to assist them and that their only salvation lies in Isis.</p> <h2><strong>Could dangerous refugees come to the US?</strong></h2> <p>The refugees admitted to the US are much different than those arriving at Europe\u2019s borders. </p> <p>Unlike in Europe, where immigrants can cross through Turkey and then enter Greece, the immigrants who arrive will have cleared a lengthy screening process. Because of Europe\u2019s Schengen system, refugees could conceivably pass between EU countries without having to show a passport or submit to a background check. </p> <p>Public anxiety over the arrival of refugees has a historical precedent. The controversy over Syrian immigrants has <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/19/9760060/refugees-history-holocaust\">recalled</a> Americans\u2019 reluctance to accept Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany in the years just before the second world war. </p> <p>And yet an <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/us-record-shows-refugees-are-not-threat\">October 2015 analysis by the Migration Policy Institute</a> is a reminder of why many of these fears are misplaced. Of the 784,000 refugees resettled in the United States since 11 September 2001, just three have been arrested for planning terrorist activities, the report found. It adds for context that of those three cases \u201ctwo were not planning an attack in the United States and the plans of the third were barely credible\u201d. </p> <p>Finally, denying Syrian refugees entry to the United States would break a decades-long American tradition. After the second world war, the US created its first formal resettlement programs and began to position itself as a safe haven for the persecuted. In the 1970s, the US accepted <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/syria-refugees-europe-vietnam\">hundreds of thousands</a> of Vietnamese refugees. In 1980, the US accepted as many as 125,000 Cubans during the Mariel boatlift crisis. The 1990s saw an influx of refugees fleeing the wars in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\" data-alt=\"Refugees and population\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\">Refugees and population</a> </figure>",

But now the election of non-executive directors, such as Hellawell, must be approved separately by minority shareholders. To go against their wishes, Sports Direct would be forced to hold another vote between three and six months later. While Ashley could outvote minority shareholders at that point, such a move would be highly contentious.</p> <p>In an effort to win over its critics, Sports Direct announced earlier this week that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/sports-direct-allows-public-to-attend-annual-general-meeting\">open its doors to the public</a> on the day of the AGM, held in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.

A Guardian investigation last year exposed the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal requirement</a>.

Something snapped onstage after the third shout of \u201cmy friend died\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWill you listen? So did my son, OK?\u201d shot back the vice-president, instantly silencing both the heckler and those in the crowd who had been trying to drown out the disruption by shouting: \u201cHillary, Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s son Beau, an Iraq war veteran and former attorney general of Delaware, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/31/beau-biden-dies-of-brain-cancer\">died of cancer last year at the age of 46</a>.</p> <p>The vice-president\u2019s very public grief over the loss \u2013 of a son he raised alone after Beau\u2019s sister and mother were killed in a car accident in 1972 \u2013 moved much of the nation.</p> <p>Both Biden and Barack Obama have said it was a major factor in the vice-president\u2019s decision not to seek the Democratic nomination for the White House this year. But in a union hall outside Cleveland, campaigning for his party\u2019s nominee, the rawness of the grief was still apparent.</p> <p>It could have been a convenient non-sequitur, or just a simple unfiltered moment of exasperation \u2013 but in any event the protestor appeared satisfied with a promise to discuss the matter in private after the rally.</p> <p>\u201cLook let me answer your question. Come back after and talk to me about this. OK? You have my permission,\u201d finished Biden.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards the man could be seen talking to secret service agents and appearing to head to a backstage area.</p> <p>The protestor was referencing a controversial US decision to force the victorious Kurdish YPG forces to withdraw from the captured town of Manbij to the other side of the Euphrates river \u2013 a move aimed a placating Turkey, which views them as terrorists.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you tell the YPG to go back?\u201d he shouted at Biden, who intervened during a recent visit to Turkey.</p> <p>\u201cBecause the deal was to get them into Manbij \u2013 and to work \u2013 was that they would go back across the Euphrates so we could have [US] special forces move in. That\u2019s why,\u201d responded the vice-president.</p> <p>The heckler, who calls himself Reinas or \u201cRenas Isis-slayer\u201d in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAFWIXRZYvo\">video explaining why he fought in Syria</a>, said he was still waiting to speak to the vice-president after the incident.</p> <p>\u201cAt first they toyed with the idea of my meeting Biden, but in the end I was told that he didn\u2019t have time for me,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday. \u201cSo I offered my phone number, so that Joe Biden could contact me. I\u2019m still waiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI respect Biden\u2019s son and everything he did. But I was a bit confused as to the relevance to the conversation,\u201d added Reinas by email. \u201cI am not against the Obama administration and I respect Joe Biden. After hearing what he said, I think maybe he means well, but it was evident that he hasn\u2019t been briefed on the situation in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/3-americans-killed-fighting-isis-ypg-manbij-syria/\">reports that three Americans died alongside the YPG in Manbij</a>, part of a group of foreigners who travelled to Syria to fight against Isis.</p>",

Trump misstated the report\u2019s net estimate, which was actually $99bn <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/20/news/economy/immigration-myths/\">including tax revenues</a>.</p> <p>The report explains its estimate by saying there are 13 million undocumented people, and includes children of migrants in that figure \u2013 including 3.4 million children born to immigrant parents in the US, who are citizens merely descended from immigrants, like most Americans <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/us/politics/for-donald-trumps-family-an-immigrants-tale-with-2-beginnings.html\">and Trump himself</a>. The Fair report then tabulates $29bn in costs to the federal government and $84bn to state and local governments, mostly in education costs and medical expenses.</p> <p>The Heritage Foundation, another conservative group, estimated that undocumented immigrants cost the US about $85bn in benefits in 2010. Government <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/221495.pdf\">estimates from the 1990s</a> put the number far lower, from about $12bn to $22bn to account for about five million immigrants. A 2007 <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/87xx/doc8711/12-6-Immigration.pdf\">analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office</a> concluded that the cost of migrants is \u201cmost likely modest\u201d to government at any level, but that it\u2019s hard to make any clear estimate.</p> <p><strong>\u201cOur government has no idea. It could be three million, it could be 30 million [people in the US without immigration papers]. They have no idea.\u201d </strong>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJUSdz2rrw\">31 August, Phoenix</a></p> <p>The government has a fairly strong idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most, not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more unauthorized Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. </p> <p><strong>\u201cPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.\u201d </strong>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJUSdz2rrw\">31 August, Phoenix</a></p> <p>The US has no \u201copen borders\u201d, though Trump appears to be using the word to denigrate Barack Obama\u2019s support for immigration reform and protection for some undocumented people from deportation. But Obama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">deported a record more than 2.5 million people since he took office</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/\">a record 438,421 people in 2013</a>, and increased Border Patrol staff to<a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/performance-accountability-financial\"> a record 21,444 agents in 2011</a>; his policy could not reasonably be described as \u201camnesty\u201d or \u201copen borders\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports the deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <p><strong>\u201cHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, social security and Medicare for illegal immigrants.\u201d </strong>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJUSdz2rrw\">31 August, Phoenix</a></p> <p>Clinton has not pledged \u201camnesty\u201d: she has promised an immigration reform plan that would let people gradually become citizens after background checks and back taxes. She has not specified many details of the plan, but the Senate\u2019s bipartisan plan, killed in 2013 by House Republicans, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/immigration-bill-2013-senate-passes-093530\">outlined a 13-year \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d</a> that would likely serve as Clinton\u2019s model.</p> <p>She also supports Barack Obama\u2019s programs for deferred action for some migrants, called Daca and Dapa (the latter is pending review in the courts). She has proposed expanding Obama\u2019s healthcare act to cover migrants \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/\">regardless of immigration status</a>\u201d, but not providing them with social security or Medicare unless they achieve some form of legal status. They could, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.gistfunders.org/documents/DAPA-DACA-and-fed-health-economic-supports-january2015.pdf\">become eligible under Daca</a>, which would also require proof of 10 years\u2019 work history, paid taxes, and reaching retirement age.</p> <p><strong>\u201cHer plan [is] to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.\u201d </strong>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJUSdz2rrw\">31 August, Phoenix</a></p> <p>Trump has borrowed this figure from an ally, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/clinton-refugee-plan-could-bring-in-620-000-refugees-in-first-term-at-lifetime-cost-of-over-400-billion\">claims</a> Clinton would continue to grant asylum to 55,000 Syrian refugees every year in addition to 100,000 refugees from the Middle East in general.

  "<p>The night of 2 April 1990 is one Tina Condos will never forget. It was the opening night of Donald Trump\u2019s new $1.1bn Atlantic City casino, and Condos was working as a cocktail waitress serving drinks to Michael Jackson, Elle Macpherson and the other stars and socialites who had flown in for the big night.</p> <p>Lit by $16m worth of chandeliers, Trump described the casino, then the most expensive ever built, as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d. The property tycoon now turned presidential candidate also promised it would transform the fortunes of the New Jersey coastal city. </p> <p>His promise held true, for a brief period, but now his casino empire is a busted flush: the Taj is set to close, and Atlantic City teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. The impact of the Taj\u2019s closure will be worse for the city than Hurricane Sandy, the 2012 storm that all but washed away Atlantic City\u2019s tourism business, says its mayor. For a man who is running in large part on his business record and a promise to Make America Great Again, Trump\u2019s foray into Atlantic City tells a cautionary tale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8c641d0a24e8279ee840a8860fbb4776ea3b71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d8c641d0a24e8279ee840a8860fbb4776ea3b71/0_91_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jackson and Donald Trump at the grand opening of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jackson and Donald Trump at the grand opening of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018It was really, really awesome\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cTrump was like the second coming of Atlantic City,\u201d Condos, 54, said near the nine carved marble elephants that line the entrance to the 42-storey Trump Taj Mahal casino and hotel. \u201cThis was going to be the great place to work. We were going to make a lot of money, we were going to have benefits, healthcare, we were going to be able to raise our children. It was going to be awesome.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, you know what? It was. It was really, really awesome. I loved working for Trump back in the day.\u201d </p> <p>Trump soon became the biggest employer in town, running three casinos, and the city was, as the Republican candidate put it recently, \u201ca very good cash cow\u201d. But Trump, 70, has gone. </p> <p>After stripping hundreds of millions of dollars in assets from his casinos in successive bankruptcies, all that\u2019s left of Trump\u2019s legacy here is the forlorn and empty Trump Plaza and the down-at-heel Taj, which is set to close its doors permanently on 10 October.</p> <p>Trump has scrubbed his name from the boarded-up Plaza, but it still shines brightly above the elephants at the entrance to the Taj at the eastern end of the boardwalk. He has no stake left in the casino, which was bought out of bankruptcy by his friend the billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has been mentioned as a possible treasury secretary should Trump secure the White House in November\u2019s election.</p> <p>As part of the bankruptcy deal, the Taj workers were stripped of their healthcare, pensions, meal breaks and other benefits. Icahn had offered to restore benefits but not close to the level of other casinos. About 1,000 low-paid staff, including cleaners, cooks and waiting staff, including Condos, walked out on strike on 1 July.

  "<p>After Brexit, and with a Trump victory in November still a possibility, liberals are in a panic about populism. They have struggled to comprehend what a figure like Trump is about ideologically \u2013 hence the enormous amount of ink spilt over the question of whether he is or isn\u2019t a fascist \u2013 and the rather hapless attempt to coin the term \u201cTrumpism\u201d (Trump, you see, is really a representative of Trumpism). Alternatively, liberals have focused on actual Brexit and Trump supporters and jumped to conclusions about what they think and, especially, feel. As a result, the content of what, after all, is an \u201c-ism\u201d \u2013 that is to say, a political belief system \u2013 has become conflated with the supposed psychological states of its supporters, namely feelings of resentment and relative deprivation.</p> <p>It is correct that in Europe and the United States (at least in the case of Trump) less educated males are the main constituency of what is commonly referred to as populism; it is true that in surveys many voters register their sense that the country as a whole is declining (an assessment that does not necessarily depend on their personal economic situation; it is simply not true that every supporter of what can plausibly be classified as a populist party is an objective \u201closer in globalisation\u201d). But all this is like saying that we best understand the intellectual content of social democracy if we keep redescribing its voters as workers envious of rich people. The profile of supporters of populism obviously matters, but it is patronising to reduce all they think and say to resentment, and explain the entire phenomenon as an inarticulate political expression of the Trumpenproletariat and its European equivalents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df66a4d29c764e8f64eacba4c0ee3629ad98c8f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df66a4d29c764e8f64eacba4c0ee3629ad98c8f8/0_272_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Austria\u2019s Norbert Hofer reaching out to his supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Austria\u2019s Norbert Hofer reaching out to his supporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of speculating about the motives of voters, we need to pin down what populism really is. And that can only be done by paying attention to what populist leaders themselves are saying. The crucial point is this: it\u2019s not enough to be critical of elites in order to be classified as a populist. Otherwise, anyone finding fault with the status quo in, for instance, the US, UK, Greece and Italy would by definition be a populist \u2013 and, whatever else one thinks about, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate\">Bernie Sanders</a>, Jeremy Corbyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/25/one-year-on-syriza-radicalism-power-euro-alexis-tsipras\">Syriza</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/beppe-grillo-calls-for-nationalisation-of-italian-banks-and-exit-from-euro\">Beppe Grillo\u2019s</a> insurgent Five Star Movement in Italy, it\u2019s hard to deny that their attacks on the status quo can often be justified. Also, virtually every presidential candidate in the US would be a populist, if criticism of existing elites is all there is to the phenomenon: everyone, after all, claims to run \u201cagainst Washington\u201d.</p> <p>When in opposition, populists for sure criticise elites. But there is also always something else they do that is the tell-tale sign of populism: they claim that they, and only they, represent the people. Think, for instance, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/welcome-to-demokrasi-how-erdogan-got-more-popular-than-ever\">Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> addressing his critics in the country: \u201cWe are the people. Who are you?\u201d Of course, he knew that they were Turks, too.</p> <p>The claim to exclusive representation is not an empirical one; it is always distinctly moral. Populists\u2019 political competitors and critics are inevitably condemned as part of the immoral, corrupt elite, or so populists say when running for office; once in government, they will not recognise anything such as a legitimate opposition. The populist logic also implies that whoever does not really support populist parties might not be part of the proper people at all: there are American citizens, and then there are what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George C Wallace</a>, an arch-populist of the 1960s often viewed as a precursor of Trump, always called \u201creal Americans\u201d (white, God-fearing, hard-working, gun-owning and so on). Thus, populists do not just claim: we are the 99%. According to their own logic, they actually have to say: we are the 100%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"575ee55c1689770033b027bce6c264f07d0eada6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/575ee55c1689770033b027bce6c264f07d0eada6/0_269_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage, centre, claimed the Brexit vote was a victory for \u2018real people\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage, centre, claimed the Brexit vote was a victory for \u2018real people\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Think of Nigel Farage celebrating the Brexit vote by claiming that it had been a \u201cvictory for real people\u201d (making the 48% of the British electorate who had opposed taking the UK out of the European Union somehow less than real \u2013 or, rather, questioning their status as members of the political community). Or consider a deeply revealing remark by Trump that went virtually unnoticed, thanks to the frequency with which the New York billionaire has made scandalous statements. At a campaign rally in May, he announced that \u201cthe only important thing is the unification of the people \u2013 because the other people don\u2019t mean anything\u201d.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom that populists want to bring politics closer to the people or even clamour for direct democracy could not be more mistaken. They do say that they are the only ones who care for the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d, but they are hardly interested in an open-ended, bottom-up process where citizens debate policy issues. What populists take to be the people\u2019s real will is derived from what they stipulate to be the real people. What\u2019s worse, \u201cthe people\u2019s will\u201d that populists claim they will just faithfully execute \u2013 in that sense denying their own role as leaders and also any real political responsibility \u2013 is a fiction. There is no single political will, let alone a single political opinion, in a modern, complex, pluralist \u2013 in short, enormously messy \u2013 democracy. Populists put words into the mouth of what is after all their own creation: the fiction of the homogeneous, always righteous people. And then they say, like Trump, \u201cI am your voice.\u201d Or think again of Erdo\u011fan claiming this July: \u201cWhat does my people want? The death penalty!\u201d Never mind that he had asked for its reintroduction first.</p> <p>This split between the actual citizenry and \u201cthe real people\u201d explains why populists so frequently question election outcomes when they aren\u2019t the winners (which, after all, seems to falsify their claim to be the only legitimate representative of the people): populists only lose if \u201cthe silent majority\u201d \u2013 shorthand for \u201cthe real people\u201d \u2013 has not had a chance to speak, or worse, has been prevented from expressing itself. Hence the frequent invocation of conspiracy theories by populists: something going on behind the scenes has to account for the fact that corrupt elites are still keeping the people down. Before Trump was assured of the Republican nomination, he kept alluding to fraud, and with a defeat in the November election looming, he is already trying to discredit Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe\">The problem with populism | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, the rightwing populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/austrias-far-right-freedom-party-challenges-presidential-election-reults\">Freedom Party</a> in Austria successfully contested the outcome of the presidential election in May. Its candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/norbert-hofer-austria-presidential-hopeful-rightwing\">Norbert Hofer</a>, had kept confronting his rival, the economics professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/im-very-relieved-10-austrians-on-the-presidential-election\">Alexander van der Bellen</a>, with the claim: \u201cYou have the<em> haute vol\u00e9e</em> [high society] behind you; I have the people with me.\u201d What clearly follows: if the people\u2019s politician doesn\u2019t win, there must be something wrong with the system.</p> <p>Populist politicians are not like other politicians in a democracy. But the difference is not that they are somehow closer to the \u201cmasses\u201d who, according to the self-declared non-establishment thinker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/oct/21/-sp-the-truth-about-evil-john-gray\">John Gray</a>, are everywhere in \u201crevolt\u201d. It is also not that they want direct, as opposed to representative, democracy. Populists are fine with the idea of representation, as long as they get to represent who they consider to be the real people. This is why one cannot score points against figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/dutch-far-right-leader-geert-wilders-goeson-trial-for-inciting-hatred\">Geert Wilders</a> (who has spent his entire adult life in the Dutch parliament) or Trump by pointing out that they themselves are not exactly ordinary people. The crucial difference is that populists deny, or wish away, the pluralism of contemporary societies. When they say equality, they mean sameness, which is to say: conforming to some ideal of Middle America, Little England, or whatever a symbolic representation of real peoplehood comes down to for them.</p> <p>Does all this matter in practice? It\u2019s certainly worrying that populists cast doubt on election outcomes and try to question the legitimacy of all other politicians (to the point of wanting to lock them up, or even suggesting they could be shot, if we believe Trump\u2019s recent musings). But this might also lead one to conclude that populists live in a kind of political fantasy world and hence are bound to fail in practice. Many liberal observers think populists only offer simplistic prescriptions that will quickly be exposed as unworkable, or even that populists, deep down, are afraid of actually winning, because they are clueless about what to do next (an impression confirmed by Farage\u2019s flight after the referendum). Conventional wisdom has it that populist parties are primarily protest parties and that protest cannot govern, since, logically, one cannot protest against oneself: anti-politics cannot generate real policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"313ed87e383705daf7c34b6d2fa854a68f35c27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/313ed87e383705daf7c34b6d2fa854a68f35c27e/0_182_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Orban at an election rally for the Fidesz party in Budapest, Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Orban at an election rally for the Fidesz party in Budapest, Hungary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The notion that populists in power are bound to fail one way or another is comforting. It\u2019s also an illusion. For one thing, while populist parties necessarily protest against elites, this does not mean that populism in government will become self-contradictory. All failures of populists in government can still be blamed on elites acting behind the scenes, whether at home or abroad.</p> <p>Many populist victors continue to behave like victims; majorities act like mistreated minorities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/hugo-chavez-strongmans-last-stand\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela</a>, for instance, would always point to the dark machinations of the opposition \u2013 that is to say, the officially deposed \u201coligarchy\u201d \u2013 and the US trying to sabotage his \u201c21st-century socialism\u201d. Erdo\u011fan would present himself as a plucky underdog; he\u2019d forever be the street fighter from Istanbul\u2019s tough neighbourhood Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa, bravely confronting the old, Kemalist establishment of the Turkish republic, long after he had begun to concentrate all political, economic and, not least, cultural power in his own hands. One little noted side-effect of the recent failed putsch has been to reinforce this self-presentation as struggling with the people against the visible and invisible forces of evil \u2013 the military and the shadowy G\u00fclen network \u2013 as opposed to the face of a sultan-in-the-making, holed up in his pompous presidential palace, which Erdo\u011fan had been showing in the past few years.</p> <p>More worryingly still: when populists have sufficiently large majorities in parliament, they try to build regimes that might still look like democracies, but are actually designed to perpetuate the power of the populists (as supposedly the only authentic representatives of the people). To start with, populists colonise or \u201coccupy\u201d the state. Think of Hungary and Poland as recent examples. One of the first changes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/hungary-election-viktor-orban-fidesz-party\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his party Fidesz</a> sought after coming to power in Hungary in 2010 was a transformation of the civil service law, so as to enable them to place loyalists in what should have been non-partisan bureaucratic positions. Both Fidesz and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/jarosaw-kaczynski-one-more-thorn-in-europe-eastern-side\">Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s Law and Justice </a>party (PiS) in Poland also immediately moved against the independence of courts. Media authorities were captured; the signal went out that journalists should not report in ways that violate the interests of the nation (which were equated with the interests of the governing party). Whoever criticised any of these measures was vilified as doing the bidding of the old elites, or as being outright traitors (Kaczy\u0144ski spoke of \u201cPoles of the worst sort\u201d who supposedly have \u201ctreason in their genes\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Austrian arch-populist J\u00f6rg Haider would hand out \u20ac100 bills to 'his people' on the streets of Carinthia</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such a strategy to consolidate or even perpetuate power is not exclusive to populists, of course. What is special about populists is that they can undertake such state colonisation openly: why, populists can ask indignantly, should the people not take possession of their state through their only rightful representatives? Why should those who obstruct the genuine popular will in the name of civil service neutrality not be purged?</p> <p>Populists also engage in the exchange of material and immaterial favours for mass support. Again, such conduct is not exclusive to populists: many parties reward their clientele for turning up at the voting booths, though few would go so far as Austrian arch-populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/29/austria.kateconnolly\">J\u00f6rg Haider</a>, who would literally hand out \u20ac100 bills to \u201chis people\u201d on the streets in Carinthia. What \u2013 once more \u2013 makes populists distinctive is that they can engage in such practices openly and with moral justifications: after all, for them, only some people are really \u201cthe people\u201d and hence deserving of the support by what is rightfully their state. Without this thought it\u2019s hard to understand how Erdo\u011fan could have politically survived all the revelations about his regime\u2019s corruption, which began to emerge in 2013.</p> <p>Some populists have been lucky to have the resources to build up entire classes to support their regimes. Ch\u00e1vez benefited from the oil boom. For regimes in central and eastern Europe, funds from the European Union have been the equivalent of oil to some Arab authoritarian states: governments can strategically employ the subsidies to buy support or at least keep citizens quiet. What\u2019s more, they can form social strata that conform to their image of the ideal people \u2013 and that are deeply loyal to the regime. Erdo\u011fan continues to enjoy the unshakable support of an Anatolian middle class that emerged with the economic boom under his AK party (and that also embodies the image of the ideal, devout Turk, as opposed to westernised, secular elites and minorities such as the Kurds). Hungary\u2019s Fidesz has supported a new group that combines economic success, family values (having children brings many benefits) and religious devotion into a whole that conforms to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision of a \u201cChristian-national\u201d culture.</p> <p>There is one further element of populist statecraft that is important to understand. Populists in power tend to be harsh (to say the least) with non-governmental organisations that criticise them. Again, harassing civil society is not a practice exclusive to populists. But for them opposition from within civil society creates a particular symbolic problem: it potentially undermines their claim to exclusive moral representation. Hence it becomes crucial to argue (and supposedly \u201cprove\u201d) that civil society isn\u2019t civil society at all, and that what can seem like popular opposition has nothing to do with the real people.</p> <p>This explains why Putin, Orb\u00e1n and PiS in Poland have gone out of their way to try to discredit NGOs as being controlled by outside powers (and also legally declare them to be \u201cforeign agents\u201d). In a sense, they try to make the unified people in whose name they had been speaking all along a reality on the ground: by silencing or discrediting those who refuse their representative claim (and, sometimes, by giving them every incentive to exit the country and thereby to separate themselves from the pure people; 500,000 Hungarians have left in recent years). Thus, a PiS government or Fidesz government will not only create a PiS state or a Fidesz state \u2013 it will also seek to bring into existence a PiS people and a Fidesz people. In other words, populists create the homogeneous people in whose name they had been speaking all along: populism becomes something like a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"885b1dda9b79305abf093026bdd4f57043257d4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/885b1dda9b79305abf093026bdd4f57043257d4c/0_92_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rally for Donald Trump in Austin, Texas, in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rally for Donald Trump in Austin, Texas, in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a tragic irony in all this: populism in power commits the very political sins of which it accuses elites: excluding citizens and usurping the state. What the establishment supposedly has always done, populists will also end up doing. Only with a clear justification and, perhaps, even a clear conscience. Hence it is a profound illusion to think that populists, as potential leaders of Gray\u2019s \u201crevolt of the masses\u201d, can improve our democracies. Populists are just different elites who try to grab power with the help of a collective fantasy of political purity.</p> <p>So how should we react to the current wave of populism in the west? To begin with, we should stop the inflationary use of the term \u201cpopulism\u201d. There is no reason to put Sanders, Corbyn, Syriza and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">Podemos </a>into the same category as Trump, Farage and Erdo\u011fan \u2013 only the latter group claims exclusively to represent the one authentic people, whereas the former are just more or less plausible attempts to reinvent social democracy. Second, one should call populists out for what they are: a danger to democracy and not a useful corrective for too much elite power, as some commentators naively assume. This doesn\u2019t mean that one should avoid engaging them politically: talking with populists is not the same as talking like populists. Otherwise, one ends up in a paradoxical situation: because populists exclude, we exclude them; because they demonise their opponents, we demonise them. Instead, one should concede that some of their complaints may have been justified (Erdo\u011fan and Ch\u00e1vez did not invent the notion that many citizens in their respective countries had been excluded from the political process; rising inequality across the west is not a figment of the populist imagination).</p> <p>Finally, one has to face up to a genuine conflict that characterises our time (but which is hardly about \u201celites versus the people\u201d): on one side there are the advocates for more openness; on the other, the proponents of some kind of closure. Openness can mean more porous borders and the recognition of minorities inside a country (a commitment to openness can also translate into more trade agreements \u2013 but, contrary to what neoliberals insinuate, it doesn\u2019t have to). Demands for closure can come in the form of legitimate concerns about democracy. \u201cTake back control\u201d is not necessarily a populist imperative, whereas \u201cWe have been robbed of our country\u201d is likely to mean: \u201cThe government is un-British or un-American by my definition of Britishness or Americanness\u201d, or \u201cToo many other citizens don\u2019t look like us\u201d. It can also hide outright racism or a desire to preserve traditional hierarchies (on closer inspection Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d turns out to mean: \u201cMake sure white males continue to rule\u201d).</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to think that all liberals have to do is make these conflicts ones about interests, not identity, and win back voters willing to back populists by offering trade agreements more favourable to workers (and, right now, hammer away at the point that Trump\u2019s actual economic policy proposals, especially the enormous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, are a slap in the face of the working class). All this undoubtedly has to be part of an anti-populist strategy. But liberals also have to tread on the dangerous territory of identity politics. They have to argue against the populist fantasies of a \u201cpure people\u201d, and instead fashion attractive and, above all, pluralist conceptions of Britishness and Americanness.</p> <p>\u2022 Jan-Werner M\u00fcller is a professor of politics at Princeton and a fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna.

It has also used by opponents of abortion and to promote animal rights \u2013 bolstering criticism that its use minimises minorities\u2019 experiences, particularly of police brutality and discrimination. With the unprecedented online activity citing #BlackLivesMatter over 13 days in July, the Pew study found a \u201cdramatic\u201d shift in tone of the online conversation and a spike in support for #AllLivesMatter \u2013 and for #BlueLivesMatter, an affirmation of the lives of police officers.</p> <p>Mentioning the persistence of such rejoinders, which have dogged the BLM movement since it began, raises a rare spark of irritation from Garza \u2013 albeit accompanied by her characteristic incredulous chuckle. Her tolerance, she says, depends on her mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a767ec6f7c5a293967a437d283305ebf41823ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a767ec6f7c5a293967a437d283305ebf41823ed/445_167_2253_1830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Garza, centre, with her Black Lives Matter co-founders Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"812\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garza, centre, with her Black Lives Matter co-founders Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBy and large, I\u2019m starting to feel like, if somebody doesn\u2019t want to fucking understand \u2013 excuse my language \u2013 if somebody can\u2019t see the contradiction of saying all lives matter ... then they\u2019re just wilfully being ignorant, and an asshole.\u201d</p> <p>When black lives are being \u201csystematically targeted for demise\u201d, the inference of \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d is, \u201cI don\u2019t think that black people and white people should be equal \u2026 I don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I would much rather have that conversation than this other, round-the-road conversation of whether it\u2019s all lives, or black lives, or only black lives \u2026 I\u2019m starting to feel like I want to save my breath for more important conversations, which are like, \u2018OK, how are we going to get free?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This will take both legislative and cultural change, she says, and decades for them to bed in. \u201cDo we feel like we\u2019re making progress? Yes and no. It is very much two steps forward, one step back. And I think that that is why it\u2019s important for us to have a long view.

But this month the number of people in the camp reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, aid organisations estimate.</p> <p>The French authorities put the official number of people in the camp at almost 7,000. Authorities have said over the past year more than 5,000 asylum seekers have left the northern French town for 161 special centres set up around France.</p> <p>Cazeneuve said places for another 8,000 asylum seekers would be created this year and thousands more in 2017, saying efforts would be focused on getting peole in Calais to leave voluntarily.</p> <p>Currently a record 1,900 French police are operating in Calais, and Cazeneuve said another 200 would be added to their ranks \u201cto reinforce the battle\u201d against migrants smuggling themselves on to lorries bound for Britain.</p> <p>Daniel Barney, of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which opened a health centre in the camp, warned last week that the French and UK governments were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-and-french-authorities-blind-to-growing-problems-in-calais-jungle\">turning a blind eye to the growing problems</a>.</p> <p>He said the French authorities\u2019 decision to demolish the southern part of the camp in March had made the situation worse. \u201cHalf the camp was dismantled. So now we have double the population living in half as much land, with access to the same amount of water points and toilets. There is an extreme problem of overcrowding. Conditions in the camp are getting progressively worse.\u201d</p> <p>With overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages and a rise in the number of violent attacks on lorry drivers heading to the UK, there is growing tension in Calais and politicians from all parties are seizing on the seemingly intractable problem of how to deal with refugees and migrants trapped in France hoping to reach England. In the run-up to the French presidential election next year, the French right and far-right have increased their calls for hardline action on Calais. </p> <p>Cazeneuve will visit Calais on Friday afternoon, as French lorry drivers, shopkeepers and farmers plan to stage a blockade of the port on Monday to demand the camp is demolished.</p> <p>The Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who has until now avoided visiting Calais, is to visit the city later this month.</p>",

  "<p>Last month a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/16/in-both-parties-men-and-women-differ-over-whether-women-still-face-obstacles-to-progress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">study from Pew Research Centre</a> found a stark difference of opinion between women and men about whether or not sexism still exists. Where 63% of women believe that there continue to be major obstacles for women to get ahead, only 41% of men feel similarly.</p> <p>Which is, let\u2019s face it, part of the problem.</p> <p>But it does beg the question as to why the divide between the genders exists.</p> <p>It begins with the normalisation of sexism that\u2019s made it so transparent in our everyday lives that we often fail to recognise it. When I was growing up in rural Victoria, my dad, a dairy farmer, would sometimes whistle at young women as we drove through our local town. He meant nothing sinister. I\u2019m quite sure he thought he was paying them a compliment. Perhaps they did also. But not only do we fail to recognise latent sexism in the people around us, we\u2019re often unaware of our own. <a href=\"http://csivc.csi.cuny.edu/Nan.Sussman/files/publications/Sussman_Perception_Male_and_Female_Success.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Studies have found</a> that it\u2019s not just men who have implicit bias against women; women can also hold unconscious bias toward their own gender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/11/time-for-men-to-sign-up-to-female-dominated-caring-and-sharing-jobs\">Time for men to sign up to female-dominated caring and sharing jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Double standards are so embedded in our culture we often don\u2019t recognise when we\u2019re reinforcing them. For instance, expecting <a href=\"http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2013/may/%E2%80%9Cboys-will-be-boys%E2%80%9D-us-not-asia\" rel=\"nofollow\">our daughters to show more self-control and politeness than our sons</a> (after all, \u201cboys will be boys\u201d). Or judging women who fail to retain their youthful looks and figure far more harshly than we judge men. Or the idea we have about boys and girls \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/there-are-only-3-countries-where-girls-feel-more-comfortable-with-math-than-boys/284272/\" rel=\"nofollow\">natural</a>\u201d capabilities and in the workplace, where <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-potential-of-women-at-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">men tend to be promoted more on potential and women more on performance.</a> Even worse when high-performing women are passed over due to untested assumptions such as \u201cshe\u2019ll probably have babies soon and won\u2019t want the pressure!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve lost count of the times I have been asked \u201cHow do you do it all?\u201d in reference to the work that I do that requires a lot of international travel while also being mother to four teenagers. My husband has never been asked. Not once. </p> <p>Many women share similar experiences of having their actions judged by a different yardstick than their male colleagues. I once had a client who, when she asked why she was passed over for a leadership role she felt she\u2019d earned, was told she was \u201ca little too nice for such a tough job\u201d. Yet women are often damned if they do conform to gender stereotypes and damned if they don\u2019t. If they show assertiveness, they\u2019re more likely to be perceived as bossy or bitchy. If they seek to lead by consensus, they\u2019re more likely to be labelled weak and lacking leadership. Hillary Clinton is a case in point. Like or loathe her, Clinton\u2019s fierce ambition combined with her perceived lack of warmth is held against her where the same traits would be regarded as a strength for men. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/31/jeffrey-siminoff-twitter-inclusion-diversity\">Jeffrey Siminoff: 'Twitter is the place where inclusion lives'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the pervasiveness of everyday sexism, there is clearly much to be done to arrive at the day where gender is a non-issue in how we parent, speak, lead and pursue our ambitions. Until then, those who recognise the chasm that needs to be closed to reach gender equality must actively speak up and call out sexism when they see it \u2013 both the unintentional, seemingly harmless everyday variety and the more menacing and ill-intentioned type perpetuated by those who feel threatened by strong women.</p> <p>At a recent talk by the former army chief and Australian of the year, Lieutenant General David Morrison, he spoke about how the Australian army was slower to wake up to the sexism within its ranks than the airforce or navy. He shared the epiphany he had when then sexual discrimination commissioner Liz Broderick asked him why, for the past 100 years, less than 10% of the army had been female. His lack of a good answer woke him up to the sexism in his ranks and took him on a mission to radically change its culture. His call to arms against misogyny and unacceptable behaviour in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaqpoeVgr8U\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube video</a> sent a clear message to all who didn\u2019t respect women to \u201cget out\u201d.<br></p> <p>We need more of that. Much more.</p> <p>We need more people to wake up and see that sexism is still a barrier for women and that each of us has a role to play in removing it. Simply agreeing that women make strong leaders, that gender diverse teams produce stronger results and make better decisions \u2013 in business, science, politics, education and beyond \u2013 or that gender equality is morally right is not enough. For change to occur, we need an army of men and women committed to confronting sexism where it lives. In our conversations around the coffee machine at work, around the dinner table at home or at the pub on a Friday night.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about casting women as victims or making villains of men. It\u2019s about taking personal responsibility for the part we all play, albeit often unintentionally, to perpetuate the status quo and in having the courage to do our bit to change it.</p>"
