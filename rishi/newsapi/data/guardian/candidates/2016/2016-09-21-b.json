This designated survivor is something that actually happens, but the closest we\u2019ve had from Hollywood is Dave, a movie where the president\u2019s likeness steps in for him unbeknownst to the people so that he can pretend to be president. Creator David Guggenheim (the writer of action movies Safe House and Taken) finally deployed this bit of civics trivia and whipped it up into ABC\u2019s much-hyped new drama. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/best-tv-week-fall-premieres-this-is-us-lethal-weapon-macgyver\">Best TV of the week: fall series premieres are finally upon us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The popular narrative about what would happen if an ordinary guy suddenly became president is an intoxicating one because it makes the audience question what they would do if they were in charge of the nation in a time of crisis. That\u2019s exactly what happens to Adam Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland, in his second role where he\u2019s in charge of the nuclear football), the housing and urban development secretary who was sitting in his Cornell sweatshirt and comfy pants at a secure location when the Capitol is engulfed by a fireball killing every member of all three branches of government simultaneously. Before he can even finish his popcorn, he\u2019s being sworn in. </p> <p>Kirkman is shuttled into a bunker underneath the White House and is quickly joined by his wife, Alex (Natasha McElhone), and young daughter Penny (Mckenna Grace), but his son Leo (Tanner Buchanan) is missing. Kirkman doesn\u2019t have time for family problems because his former boss\u2019s deputy chief of staff, the lantern-jawed Captain American type Aaron Shore (Adan Canto), is trying to seize control of what little remains of the government. </p> <p>There is one scene, right after Kirkman is sworn in, when he goes to the marble-festooned restroom in his bunker and vomits from anxiety. It\u2019s the best scene in the pilot and it infuses the audience with the same doubts as Kirkman, wondering how the heck is he \u2013 or the country for that matter \u2013 going to get out of this mess. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_f1v0Nx5Sw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_f1v0Nx5Sw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Apparently the answer is optimism and meaningless platitudes. There is a lot of the \u201cwe\u2019re going to do this my way\u201d talk of a less successful action movie and the \u201cI\u2019m about as straight of a shooter as you\u2019re going to find in Washington\u201d talk out of a cut-rate West Wing. At one point Kirkman\u2019s new chief staff writer (former IRL White House employee Kal Penn) actually says: \u201cMr President, you need to be stronger than you\u2019ve ever been right now. We need that.\u201d That might be what the country needs, but this drama needs dialogue that won\u2019t make the citizenry\u2019s eyeballs roll. </p> <p> What\u2019s sad is that this idea launches us into a totally unknown and unexplored world. How is a new Congress going to be elected? Does this president now get to appoint all 12 supreme court justices? Won\u2019t the American people be freaking out and rioting? How will this all work? The pilot is not as concerned with any of these questions. Instead we get the unsure Kirkman seizing the reins after overhearing his kids in the Lincoln bedroom talking about how \u201cdaddy isn\u2019t afraid of anything\u201d, like we\u2019re in a lesser Jim Carrey movie and the political unity of the world isn\u2019t at stake. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/21/lethal-weapon-remake-loud-ludicrous-loveable\">Lethal Weapon remake: loud, ludicrous and lovable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is the question of who perpetrated the bombing and no terrorist groups or other nations are taking credit.

There\u2019s not enough family tension for it to be a domestic drama, not enough government intrigue to make it a political show, and not enough investigation to make it a procedural. The idea of what would happen if an average citizen were to take over the country is one worth exploring (particularly because it might be our fate come November), but Designated Survivor isn\u2019t quite up to the task.

If anything, [today\u2019s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks. Some members advocated a rate hike this year, even citing the possibility of one occurring in September, while others, like Fed Governor Lael Brainard, cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac6e61ee921b5970f39ae3a4112c3b31fbe56d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac6e61ee921b5970f39ae3a4112c3b31fbe56d3/0_0_2723_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Additionally, September has thus far seen a general deterioration of US economic data in the form of substantially worse-than-expected releases regarding employment (NFP), both the manufacturing and services industries (PMI), retail sales, and housing, that were all significantly worse than expected. The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u2019s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens. Of course, there could always be a surprise move, but the much more likely scenario will be a characteristically unmovable Fed.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad4d6875ec8a084a78a2ef359396ac1ae251fd2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad4d6875ec8a084a78a2ef359396ac1ae251fd2a/414_0_4091_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed expected to keep rates on hold\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed expected to keep rates on hold</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Therefore, the market\u2019s focus, as has consistently been the case from the beginning of the year, will be concentrated on the words emanating from the Fed statement as it relates to the indication of a possible rate hike in December and the potential pace of tightening going forward.

Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u201con the table\u201d in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple.

  "<p>When Barclays in 2012 became the first big bank to be fined for trying to rig the Libor interbank rate, its chief executive lost his job within days. He was bundled out of the door with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/10/barclays-warned-fsa-agius-diamond-bonus\">a shove from the governor of the Bank of England</a>.</p> <p>Other banks\u2019 Libor sins subsequently turned out to be equally grave, but few would argue that Bob Diamond was treated harshly, even if it was traders who were to blame. The buck had to stop at the top. Barclays\u2019 clean-up operation would not have been credible otherwise.</p> <p>Now consider the tricks played by Wells Fargo, the US bank where John Stumpf somehow survives as chairman and chief executive. Wells Fargo, which used to be America\u2019s most admired lender, created 2m accounts and credit cards for customers who had requested no such thing. The customers only noticed when the fees started to appear. And the deep cause of the scandal was a sales culture that imposed impossible-to-meet targets on branch staff who feared for their jobs.</p> <p>Wells Fargo has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/wells-fargo-settlement-illegal-sales-accounts\">fined $185m</a> by regulators but Stumpf is still in office, singing the standard refrain that he didn\u2019t know what was happening in the bank he was paid $19.5m (\u00a315m) last year to manage. Senator Elizabeth Warren gave her assessment in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/wells-fargo-ceo-apology-john-stumpf-congressional-hearing\">an admirable eight-minute onslaught</a> on Tuesday. A stupefied Stumpf was told his leadership was \u201cgutless\u201d, that he should return pay, that he was pushing blame on to junior employees (5,300 were sacked) and that he should be criminally investigated. The encounter is worth viewing.</p> <p>The boss of a big UK bank would not survive in similar circumstances. Our regulators may sometimes be tame, but a swift Diamond-style exit would surely be arranged if the non-executives proved spineless. What are the American authorities playing at? Trust in banks has barely improved since the bust and it\u2019s hard to imagine a case more likely to enrage customers. Don\u2019t they know there\u2019s an election on?</p> <h2>Chancellor Philip Hammond should flash the cash</h2> <p>The medium and long-term economic consequences of Brexit remain cloudy but the short-term picture is becoming clearer. The UK has not fallen into a funk. This paper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">analysis</a> of the post-referendum economic data shows as much, and now even the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/oecd-does-a-u-turn-over-brexit-warning-as-it-revises-growth-forecast-for-britain\">is sounding more measured</a>. The OECD has pencilled in growth of 1.8% in the UK this year, a 0.1 percentage point improvement from its last guess.</p> <p>The OECD is still predicting a slowdown to 1% in 2017, it should be said, which makes sense. Large economies do not turn on a sixpence but lower business investment, flowing from nervousness about access to the single market, is inevitable.</p> <p>Yet the OECD\u2019s policy prescriptions are always more interesting than its growth forecasts. On that score, the thinktank advises chancellor Philip Hammond to pull out his chequebook. The UK, like many countries, has room to pursue \u201ca growth-friendly mix by increasing hard and soft infrastructure spending\u201d.</p> <p>That is a welcome change of heart from the OECD, previously an austerity purist. Conditions for higher spending are excellent in the UK, even if the level of public debt is not. The government can borrow at next to nothing for 30 years and inflation is low. Even if the fall in sterling causes inflation to reach 3% in 2018, that wouldn\u2019t be a catastrophe. It is a good moment to address the historic underspending on infrastructure (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/19/hs2-rail-project-jobs-bonanza-high-speed-rail-industry-leaders\">as long as it\u2019s not HS2</a>).</p> <p>Hammond should draw a simple conclusion: if he is timid, he is inviting growth to fall to 1%, or worse, next year; if he is brave, he has a reasonable chance of doing better.</p> <h2>The ugly face of Big Pharma in the US</h2> <p>At almost $10,000 per small tube, Aloquin acne cream must be a new wonder-cure.

This comes on the heels of his approval of Israel\u2019s $38bn military aid package, the largest in US history, which many regard as a means to placate Netanyahu over the nuclear agreement the US signed with Iran. </p> <p>Ironically, it is that very deal, a symbol of the power of international diplomacy, that should serve as an example of how to craft a successful peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>The Iran deal was a historic effort that mitigated Iran\u2019s chances of obtaining a nuclear bomb, a dangerous development many believed was imminent. In exchange for lifting longstanding US and international sanctions, which had crippled Iran\u2019s economy, leaders allowed increased inspections of nuclear facilities, removed two-thirds of the country\u2019s centrifuges and dismantled its plutonium reactor. For the first time in a decade, Iran did not have sufficient enriched uranium to create a nuclear bomb. The deal also created the space to free five US citizens who were being held hostage there and dramatically increased international peace and security.</p> <p>It worked because the US and Iran understood that to move forward, both had to put something on the table. In addition, the involvement of the other P5+1 countries (France, Russia, United Kingdom, China and Germany) and the European Union was instrumental, since each had their own political and economic relationships with Iran and the US and could obtain buy-in from their national legislatures to ensure the deal\u2019s implementation. Additional partners also increased pressure on Iran to be accountable.</p> <p>As it stands, Netanyahu does not have much incentive to acquiesce to a peace agreement facilitated by the US alone. Israel has already secured US military aid for the next decade, and Netanyahu has a long track record of overseeing continued construction of settlements and destruction of Palestinian villages, despite US admonishment. From the Palestinian side, negotiators have called bilateral talks \u201c<a href=\"http://t.sidekickopen65.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg7dSn4KW7fJZRP3My7ynW7fZnDC56dzqlf3fHr3l02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aljazeera.com%2Fprogrammes%2Fupfront%2F2015%2F10%2Fheadliner-palestinian-chief-negotiator-saeb-erekat-151023152959054.html&amp;si=6388631026532352&amp;pi=36c78229-57f1-4711-e167-432f153d5e5a\">a waste of time</a>\u201d and increasing hopelessness motivates firing rockets from Gaza and knife and car attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem.

Gaza, in particular, he said, is a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d and requires Palestinian unity, ending illicit arms buildup and militant activities and lifting of movement and access restrictions to dismantle it. The secretary general urged international stakeholders to work toward a negotiated end to the occupation, now entering its 50th year, and the establishment of a viable, democratic Palestine which lives in peace with Israel.</p> <p>Like the Iran deal, economic incentives are probably the most viable means to accomplish such a goal.

We&#xa0;should also be careful, since the&#xa0;exploitation of existential fear has long been a feature of America\u2019s isolated&#xa0;political culture. In 1950, a little-known American senator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Kefauver\" title=\"\">Estes Kefauver</a>, achieved national fame by holding televised hearings into America\u2019s \u201corganised crime\u201d, drawing on blood-curdling fantasies of a Sicilian-American \u201cmafia\u201d. This mafia was, Kefauver claimed, holding American cities to ransom. Communities lived in&#xa0;fear of it. The national economy was&#xa0;menaced by it.</p> <p>The televised hearings were at times ludicrous. One hoodlum after another was dragged to Washington to protest that all he was running was a few protection rackets on the Lower East Side.

He still demanded a&#xa0;new Washington bureaucracy to \u201ccrack&#xa0;down on organised crime\u201d \u2013 and&#xa0;ran unsuccessfully for president.

His reporting unfolded as so many other journalists were writing their 50th stories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. It is only in the past week that the Post\u2019s reporting on the Trump Foundation has gained traction. The issue should come up in the first presidential debate Monday, as those \u201cdamn emails\u201d, as Sanders called the over-covered controversy over Clinton\u2019s private email server, surely will. (The Trump campaign, by the way, has claimed that the report is \u201cpeppered with inaccuracies and omissions\u201d.)</p> <p>There is a clear disparity in the attention focused on Clinton\u2019s supposed ethics problems compared with Trump\u2019s. There has been some excellent reporting on everything from Trump University to his business practices, especially the tax breaks he received on real estate deals uncovered by the New York Times. But these revelations seem to roll off Trump\u2019s back, while in the Clintons\u2019 case they create indelible stains.</p> <p>I have covered the nexus of money and politics since 1988. My investigations revealed the twisting of the tax code governing charities by GOP political figures and different Democratic fundraising abuses in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. When it comes to the cesspool of political money, I\u2019ve been an equal-opportunity scrutinizer.</p> <p>I also practically know by heart the tax code governing charitable groups \u2013 section 501C(3) \u2013 and immediately recognize that some of the Trump Foundation\u2019s donations involve unusual interpretations of it, to say the least.</p> <p>For example, when Melania Trump used a Trump Foundation check to purchase the towering (forgive the pun) portrait of her husband, the painting wasn\u2019t donated to a charity but apparently hung in the boardroom of one of her husband\u2019s golf clubs. The more than a quarter of a million dollars of Trump Foundation funds that went to help settle legal disputes included a case involving the height of a flagpole at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida. And the conservative activist group that <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-foundation-citizens-united-donation-eric-schneiderman\">received</a> $100,000 from the Trump Foundation was Citizens United, the group that opposes the disclosure and limitations of political fundraising and is headed by David Bossie, who was recently hired as Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager.</p> <p>Perhaps the most salient thing about the foundation that bears his name is that Donald Trump himself has given a relatively small amount of money to the Trump Foundation and none since 2009, although we won\u2019t know for sure until \u2013 don\u2019t hold your breath \u2013 Trump releases his tax returns. Although there are some legitimate gifts to real charities, it\u2019s unclear what the Foundation actually <em>does</em>.</p> <p>Except for deep explorations by the New Yorker editor David Remnick, the Times\u2019 Amy Chozick and Celia Duggar, and a recent book by Joe Conason, relatively few journalists have looked seriously at the good works of the Clinton Foundation, especially on global health and the environment. The Foundation has given many millions to drive down the cost of anti-retroviral drugs to treat Aids in Africa and Latin America. It helped establish a multi-city fund for better technology to combat global warming and other environmental problems. The list of its projects could fill its own book. When I was managing editor of the Times, Bill Clinton invited a group of us from the paper to his office in Harlem for a barbecue lunch (this was before his heart problems and vegan diet) and spent more than three hours talking to us about the foundation\u2019s work.</p> <p>A separate and much smaller Clinton Family Foundation handles their personal contributions to charities. According to their tax returns, the Clintons as a couple have donated about 10% of Bill and Hillary\u2019s multimillion-dollar incomes in recent years to various well-known charities, more than most super-wealthy people, who give an average of about 3%.</p> <p>Though his vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence, has said that Trump personally contributes \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d to charities, as with so much about Donald Trump, absolutely nothing has been made public to back up the claim. We are just supposed to accept Pence\u2019s word and the statement in a recent CNN interview by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who calls reporters\u2019 questions about his charitable foundation \u201cbadgering\u201d, that Trump is indeed \u201ca very generous man\u201d.</p> <p>Personally generous he may sometimes be. The work of the Trump Foundation, however, is an entirely different question. For journalists, for regulators, for any citizen who cares about the future of this country, this isn\u2019t badgering. It\u2019s an urgent democratic duty. </p>",

In the 1960s he developed new campaigning strategies including the delivery of Focus \u2013 the brash leaflet based on local issues that electors\u2019 identified with \u2013 that is still ubiquitous for Lib Dems. He was not its originator, indeed he was far too practical to be a theorist, but he developed the use of Focus and made it his trademark. As an organiser he had phenomenal energy and ambitions to match. First elected as a member of Liverpool city council in 1968, he was the dominant Liberal influence in the city for decades.</p> <p>Son of Owen and Ada, Trevor was born in the North Wales village of Dyserth, but his family moved to Bootle when he was young enough to acquire a clear Liverpool accent. He left the local grammar school in 1940, at the age of 14. He managed to conceal his age in order to join the Merchant Navy and served on the vulnerable Atlantic convoys that were essential to Britain\u2019s survival during the second world war. He later served in Aden and was in Singapore at the end of the war. Seeing the emaciated Allied prisoners being released from the infamous Changi prison camp had a great effect on him.</p> <p>After the war he worked on the Liverpool docks until, in 1961, he borrowed \u00a3200 to buy a business manufacturing dock fenders, which protect boats from docksides. He built this up and diversified into other businesses, including a ships\u2019 chandlery.</p> <p>Six years into his business life, one of his warehouses was threatened with demolition to make way for a new road. Trevor set about organising opposition and designing campaigning leaflets. Following an appearance before a House of Lords select committee to argue for conservation and against wholesale replanning in Liverpool, he turned to the political process as the way to influence decisions. His affinity with the underdog, and his Welsh roots, led him to join the Liberals, who at the time were barely above single figures in the polls.</p> <p>Within two years, he was elected to the city council, joining one other Liberal, Cyril Carr. Trevor was initially loyal to Carr\u2019s leadership, and at first he served as his deputy when the Liberals won control following local government reorganisation in 1973, but they fell out later that year. Carr gave up the leadership in 1975 on health grounds, leaving the way clear for Trevor. In 1973 Trevor was also elected to the new Merseyside Metropolitan county council and led the Liberal group there. Among the new city councillors was Trevor\u2019s wife, Doreen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8dd52f8fc81c23872892cff2a992625b67adc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8dd52f8fc81c23872892cff2a992625b67adc2/0_76_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Jones, second right, as a press conference with Michael Heseltine, far right, in the wake of the Toxteth riots, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Jones, second right, as a press conference with Michael Heseltine, far right, in the wake of the Toxteth riots, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having established a strong Liberal bridgehead in a northern industrial city, based on community politics, Trevor was frustrated that the national party\u2019s official lip service to this strategy was belied by its respectable image, typified by its then president, Stephen Terrell, a barrister with a distinguished war record, but who had openly criticised the young Liberals\u2019 radicalism. Typically, after Terrell\u2019s year of office ended, Trevor decided to contest the presidency against the leadership\u2019s nominee, Penelope Jessel. He toured the country, distributed his Focus leaflets and romped home, serving in 1972-73.</p> <p>Even while he was campaigning for the presidency, he had got involved in the pending byelection in the Sutton and Cheam constituency, in south-west London. The party was at 8% in the polls nationally and locally it had struggled to hold its deposit at the previous election. The local association adopted Graham Tope as its prospective candidate, delighted to have a young Liberal activist who had not been put off by polling only 6% there at the 1970 Greater London council election. Thus, when Trevor approached Tope and asked if he would use his techniques, Tope agreed, realising that he had nothing to lose.</p> <p>Trevor took over the campaign with astonishing energy. He would pick on local issues, produce all the election material in Liverpool, then drive down to Sutton with his Triumph Stag stuffed full of Focus leaflets, which the local helpers then delivered. It was rumoured that a mattress that made an appearance in one set of leaflets had been transported from Liverpool by Trevor and dumped in order to be photographed and then publicly removed.</p> <p>Des Wilson, the candidate fighting Hove a short time afterwards, said that Trevor was driving him around when a woman tripped and fell on a pedestrian crossing. Trevor slammed on the brakes and leapt out of the car, grabbing a camera on the way. He then photographed the uneven surface before attending to the woman\u2019s injuries. \u201cIt will look good on a leaflet,\u201d he commented.</p> <p>The final result in Sutton and Cheam in December 1972 was a Liberal victory by more than 7,000 votes, conjured apparently out of nowhere by Trevor. On the same day as Sutton and Cheam, the Liberal candidate in Uxbridge, with a traditional campaign, polled just 10%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was fierce with those who stood in his way. This applied to members of the SDP who stood against Liberal candidates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trevor himself fought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/25/britain-hung-parliament-1974\" title=\"\">two parliamentary elections in 1974</a> \u2013 the one in February, Toxteth in Liverpool, was theoretically ideal for his style, but he finished a poor third. He commented that he had spent too much time campaigning for other candidates. Trevor then contested Gillingham in October, but again finished third.</p> <p>Thereafter he concentrated on Liverpool city council and was leader of the council at the time of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/14/toxteth-riots-1981-summer-liverpool-burned-patrick-minford-jimi-jagne\" title=\"\">Toxteth riots</a>, which upset him greatly. In 1981 he was knighted for his services to local government. However, the title he preferred was the one that combined his Welsh origins and his political skills \u2013 \u201cJones the Vote\u201d.</p> <p>Trevor was intensely loyal and committed, but he could be a difficult man, never content to be No 2, and had little time for those who did not accept his strategy. He was fierce with those who stood in his way. This applied to members of the SDP who stood against Liberal candidates in Liverpool in the 1980s and who, by splitting the vote, ensured enough Labour victories to put the party in control and open the door to Militant. Trevor was fearless in standing up to their councillors. On one occasion he so riled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/16/militant-derek-hatton-labour-party-1991\" title=\"\">Derek Hatton</a>, Militant\u2019s key man, that Hatton shouted: \u201cI\u2019ll dance on your grave.\u201d Trevor replied: \u201cThat\u2019s fine by me \u2013 I\u2019m going to be buried at sea.\u201d</p> <p>When, in March 1987, 47 Militant councillors were disqualified, the Liberals came back into control and Trevor was again leader of the council. His refusal to give way to the SDP meant that Liverpool Broadgreen was one of only three seats contested by both Liberal and SDP candidates at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/electionspast/page/0,,1450576,00.html\" title=\"\">1983 general election</a>. He retired from the city council in 1991, but clearly found it difficult to be away from the action and returned in 2003 for a further six years.</p> <p>He is survived by Doreen (nee Brown), whom he married in 1950, and by a son, Glyn, and daughter, Louise.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Trevor Jones, politician, born 17 December 1927; died 8 September 2016</p>",

The move leaves Paris, Los Angeles and Budapest in contention. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/27/boston-mayor-2024-olympic-bid-doubt\">Boston</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/09/2024-olympics-why-hamburg-no-hosting\">Hamburg</a>, two other early potential candidates, have already pulled out.</p> <p>The decision was not surprising because Raggi had already signalled during her election campaign that she did not support the Olympic bid. Her party, the Five Star Movement, is vehemently opposed to unwieldy infrastructure projects and initiatives that are seen as vanity projects that come at a high cost to taxpayers.</p> <p>The decision came at a time when Raggi has come under pressure to right the course of her administration following a series of personnel issues, and when Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi, who enthusiastically launched the bid in December 2014, is facing a difficult referendum this autumn that could \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 end his career in politics.</p> <p>Renzi had launched the Olympic bid even though Rome at the time found itself at the centre of a series of public corruption scandals that came to be known as Mafia Capitale, raising questions about whether it could pull off a \u201cclean\u201d Olympics.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t allow our problems to stop us from dreaming,\u201d he said in 2014.</p> <p>For proponents of the bid, the idea of hosting the Olympic Games, while daunting, was seen as a way for the city to unite around a lofty goal, and a way to give the city the motivation necessary to pull off a huge global event that could return the city to the glory days of La Dolce Vita.</p> <p>If Renzi\u2019s view was too optimistic, then Raggi\u2019s may have sounded a bit too downtrodden. The 38-year-old lawyer said the city was still paying debts it had accrued for the Games in 1960, and would not stand for more \u201ccathedrals in the desert\u201d \u2013 abandoned stadiums \u2013 that the city could ill afford.</p> <p>\u201cThe Olympics are a dream that turn into a nightmare. I don\u2019t have all the facts about Rio, but we have the image in our eyes of the citizens of Rio,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The day included a touch of drama after Italy\u2019s Olympic Committee president, Giovanni Malago, who was supposed to meet with Raggi before the press conference, left city hall in a huff after complaining that he had waited for her for half an hour but that she had not showed up.</p>",

So if the Tories are going to lose seats, they will lose them to the Lib Dems, he told his conference.</p> <p>Conveniently for the Lib Dems, <strong>Chris Mullin</strong>, the former Labour minister, is making exactly the same argument. He has just published <a href=\"https://profilebooks.com/hinterland-hb.html\">Hinterland, a memoir,</a> and in it he says Labour needs a Lib Dem revival because \u201cthey can win seats in places we can never hope to hold.\u201d</p> <p>More significantly, Mullin, a leftwinger and former minister, calls for an electoral pact with the Lib Dems and the Greens. Here is an extract from his book.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the Tories have by historical standards only a small overall majority, the political realities are stark. Labour is between a rock and a hard place. Too left-wing for the southern middle classes, not left-wing enough for Scotland. Given that Scotland is not likely to return to the Labour fold any time soon, I see only one way forward - an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens designed to ensure that in, say, a hundred of the most marginal seats the Tories face a united opposition. Tribalists on all sides will throw their hands up in horror at the prospect, but the truth is that Labour badly needs a Liberal Democrat revival because they can win seats in places we can never hope to hold. One should never say never in politics, but the alternative is an indefinite period of Tory rule. Think about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Farron did not go quite this far. But there is increasing interest in the idea of some kind of progressive alliance on the left. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/labours-lisa-nandy-urges-party-to-ditch-tribalism\">The Labour MP Lisa Nandy has co-edited a new book that explores the idea. </a>Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">a separate initiative promoting cross-party progressive cooperation. </a>And the Green party, under their new co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, are actively pushing the progressive alliance theme.

And the way it was done was even more disgraceful. At the end of an NEC, when people had left, a paper laid round and a decision taken on a vote of 14/14. And it was carried on the basis of a recommendation. So it was 14 people basically preventing 140,000 [sic] people having a vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although people who joined after January were able to vote if they paid \u00a325 to become a registered supporter, McDonnell said many people could not afford that. He said many of those excluded were Corbyn supporters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we lost, I think, a large group of people who were Jeremy Corbyn supporters. I think never again should we allow that to happen.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the proposal from Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, that was debated at the NEC yesterday to change the leadership election rules and reintroduce an electoral college.</strong> McDonnell said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing about our party now is it\u2019s based on one person one vote. I don\u2019t want to go back to some of the proposals that have come forward today [for] electoral colleges. Because what that would mean, as it was before ... the parliamentary Labour party gets a third of the votes. It will mean for every individual MP, their vote will mean 3,000 or 4,00 of ours. That is unacceptable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the way Labour has applied rules banning some members from taking part in the election</strong>. People were being suspended \u201cfor the bizarrest of reasons\u201d, he said. He said he know one woman who was suspended for tweeting that she supported the Greens; but she was talking about a team from her child\u2019s primary school, not the Green party.

But McDonnell insisted that, even if Corbyn got a lower share of the vote than the 59.5% he got last time, that would not weaken his mandate. McDonnell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s going to be really tough to get the 59.5% that we got last time around because of the numbers that have been prevented from voting.

  "<p>If you have stumbled across the Isle of Man, chances are it is in one of two contexts: tax havens or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/isle-of-man-tt\">motorbike racing</a>. Few know that the 32-mile-long crown dependency is also home to a parliament of Norse origin, thought \u2013 at more than 1,000 years old \u2013 to be the oldest continuously sitting legislature in the world. Even fewer know that, in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/20/isle-of-man-campaign-abortion-law-modernisation\">general election</a>, 16-year-olds can vote and party politics is insignificant. And hardly anyone knows that the Isle of Man is on the cusp of a momentous shift in its political history.</p> <p>Carlos Phillips is 27 years old and is standing on the 22 September to become a member of the House of Keys, the island\u2019s equivalent of the Commons. Among the 62 other candidates jostling for position are a dentist, a sidecar racer, a theatre producer, an architect and a nurse. It\u2019s not your average Westminster lineup. But this isn\u2019t Westminster.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s nowhere to hide here. Ministers and backbenchers are all held accountable when they walk to buy a sandwich</p> <footer> <cite>Carlos Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide here,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThe approachability of politicians in the Isle of Man is unrivalled. Ministers right the way down to backbenchers are all held accountable when they walk down a street to buy a sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>What makes this election so significant, aside from the colourful cast? First, the chief minister (the island\u2019s prime ministerial equivalent) is stepping down, along with a handful of long-time MHKs, meaning that the average age of a member, currently around 56, is likely to plummet. Second, of the 24 seats, just 17 are being defended, meaning that at least 30% of the intake will be fresh faces.</p> <p>At approximately 86,000, the island\u2019s population is roughly a sixth of Manchester\u2019s. Yet Phillips thinks there is plenty the UK could learn from the accountability and accessibility that comes from national politics with a local flavour, not to mention the freedom from the dogma and spin of party politics.</p> <p>\u201cWith the lack of parties, it\u2019s hard to label people red, yellow, blue or green,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd without a party machine behind you, you really do rely on your own self-drive. In that respect, it\u2019s good: you can\u2019t rely on researchers or policy officers to formulate answers on your behalf. It\u2019s all down to you.\u201d</p> <p>Most importantly, the new candidates can see that the conversation is being changed. In the northern constituency of Ramsey, GP Alex Allinson is promising a \u201cvital increase\u201d in healthcare investment. In Arbory, Castletown and Malew, Carl Parker wants to legalise medical cannabis and tackle fuel poverty through investment in green energy. If either gets in, they will be one of 24 key people calling the shots.</p> <p>\u201cThere are exciting opportunities to enrich our parliamentary debates with some new-generation thinking,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those momentous times.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>Why is everyone talking about the Federal Reserve? </h2> <p>Because today\u2019s the day the US central bank will decide, once again, whether or not to raise interest rates.

Still the majority of the people on the Fed\u2019s board have not felt the economy was strong enough to take another rate hike.</p> <p>At the same time US stock markets have all hit record highs this year as investors have poured money into the markets looking for returns they can\u2019t find in low interest rates.</p> <p>If there is a shock to the system now, a cut to interest rates that are already close to zero is unlikely to save the day again.</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US news\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US news</a> </figure>  <h2>Uh-oh</h2> <p>Exactly.

  "<p>Yesterday, 375 of the world\u2019s top scientists, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, published <a href=\"http://responsiblescientists.org/\">an open letter regarding climate change</a>. In the letter, the scientists report that the evidence is clear: humans are causing climate change. We are now observing climate change and its affect across the globe. The seas are rising, the oceans are warming, the lower atmosphere is warming, the land is warming, ice is melting, rainfall patterns are changing and the ocean is becoming more acidic.</p> <p>These facts are incontrovertible. No reputable scientist disputes them. It is the truth.</p> <p>Despite these facts, the letter reports that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/26/donald-trump-wants-to-build-a-wall-to-save-his-golf-course-from-global-warming\">the US presidential campaign has seen claims</a> that the earth isn\u2019t warming, or it is only a natural warming, or that climate change is a hoax. These claims are false. The claims are made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/14/trump-and-the-republican-party-are-doing-big-oils-bidding\">politicians or real estate developers</a> with no scientific experience. These people who deny the reality of climate change are not scientists. <br></p> <p>These claims aren\u2019t new. We see them every election cycle.

It is terribly sad that the party of Lincoln (the president who initiated the National Academy of Sciences) has been rebuked by the National Academy today. It is sad that the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who created the National Park System, is acting in a way antithetical to his legacy. It is also sad that the party of Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency, now is trying to eliminate that very organization.</p> <p>What is perhaps most sad is that the party of \u201cfiscal conservatism\u201d is leading us on a path that will result in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">higher economic and social costs</a> for all of us.</p> <p>What we don\u2019t know is what the future will bring. Will the warming be gradual or sudden? Will ocean rise increase at a faster rate or not? Will we continue to see major ice shelf collapse? Increased droughts and heat waves? Will we be able to adapt?</p> <p>A rational decision maker would take action to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/23/climate-change-greatest-risk-management-failure\">manage the risks from climate change</a>. This threat is to our health, our communities, and our economies.

Basically, Trump wishes to scrap our environmental agreements, which have resulted in reductions to our own emissions as well as very strong agreements to reduce global warming through international agreements. <br></p> <p>Despite the excellent work over the past 7 years, we have not seen the increase in energy prices that the denialists claimed would occur. Instead, we\u2019ve seen huge reductions in the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources.</p> <p>We were right, they were wrong. We can deliver reliable energy to the USA at a low cost, with less pollution.</p> <p>We scientists have warned the country and the world about the dangers of climate change for decades.

For those who vote in anti-science politicians who attack the scientific experts rather than our pollution problem, your legacy will be the climate change that you could have helped prevent. Those voters will own climate change. </p> <p>What will that conversation be like with your kids?</p>",

He\u2019s awakening the country.\u201d Whether that is the majority PGA definition of \u201cwoke\u201d is unclear \u2013 though we do have some useful Sports Illustrated data. Every year, the publication polls tour pro golfers on the condition of anonymity, which allows them to speak more freely than the constraints of wealth and hardwired self-interest traditionally allow. Stop me if your own non-scientific guesses already confirmed this to you, but this year it found \u2013 inter alia \u2013 that 56% of PGA respondents wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary if she halved their taxes, while Trump was most supported in the Republican primary race.</p> <p>As for the European side of things, that promises to bring the angst. The very day after the referendum vote, the European Tour announced that the Ryder Cup team would still be flying the EU flag, though it did offer a hint on where it stood on the result with a slightly sniffy statement: \u201cLike all global companies whose headquarters are in the UK,\u201d this ran, \u201cwe are now in the process of assessing the implications for our business.\u201d</p> <p>If the Europeans win, you can be sure they\u2019ll be seen as a symbol of something or other. As the British gold medals rained in during the Rio Olympics, the Leave.EU campaign lost no time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/17/olympic-cyclist-callum-skinner-leave-eu-twitter-brexit\" title=\"\">putting out an advert</a> featuring all the winners, suggesting that their sporting success somehow proved the UK had no need of the EU to succeed. A category mistake, and one that caused the cyclist Callum Skinner to ask them to stop using his image. We shall have to see whether any UK golfers are moved to do the same should they be similarly co-opted in the event of a European Ryder Cup victory. In the event of a European loss, of course, there will be remainers quick to ascribe it to a doomy sign that the fellowship is so terminally scattered that we can\u2019t even beat the Yanks in the Ryder Cup any more.</p> <p>There is more, of course \u2013 so much more \u2013 and for some, golf is not an appropriate place for such multi-faceted conflicts to play out. For me, there is no better. Certainly no safer. Let us gird our loins, and have absolutely no time for those who wrongly imagine the Ryder Cup to be a good war spoiled.</p>",

Hillary Clinton has backed President Obama\u2019s failed Isis strategy to the hilt, and voters should know whether she too shares the White House\u2019s troubling assessment of the situation.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The \u201cnarrative fight\u201d reference is to remarks by <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/after-weekend-attacks-wh-spokesman-says-us-engaged-narrative-battle-isis\">White House spokesman Josh Earnest on CNN this morning</a>: \u201cWhat I can tell you is that we are, when it comes to [Isis], we are in a fight, a narrative fight with them.

  "<p>One episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\">Game of Thrones</a> tells you all you need to know about how important city walls used to be for defence. But they were also about identity and belonging, as Wendy Pullan, director of Cambridge University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.urbanconflicts.arct.cam.ac.uk/research-projects/conflict-in-cities\">Centre for Urban Conflicts Research</a>, explains: \u201cIf you lived within the walls then you were a citizen; if you didn\u2019t then you weren\u2019t. The status used to matter a lot.\u201d<br></p> <p>In recent times, since the collapse of the iron curtain, one might have imagined separation walls would be less in vogue. But walls within cities, slicing one community from another \u2013 whether on ethnic, religious or political lines \u2013 are still prevalent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2013/nov/walls#intro\">from Jerusalem to Belfast</a>, not to mention in war-torn cities such as Homs in Syria.</p> <p>\u201cAll over the Middle East, you\u2019re seeing walls between Sunni and Shia residents,\u201d says Raghda El-Halawany, who works for global peace movement <a href=\"http://www.masterpeace.org/\">MasterPeace</a>. Homs is now peppered with walls \u2013 the most famous one encloses Baba Amr, a rebel stronghold, surrounded by Sunni and Christian quarters.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a similar story in Iraq\u2019s capital, Baghdad. While many of its walls have been built for security around schools and hospitals, or for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/iraq-builds-wall-and-trench-around-baghdad-to-stop-militant-attacks\">protection against militant attacks</a>, they\u2019re also to keep sectarian communities apart: a three-mile wall was built by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/20/iraq.usa\">US soldiers in 2007</a>, for instance, which gated off a minority Sunni community.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93eed9891bd1deec9b7e984840e6f917d2e0d3b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93eed9891bd1deec9b7e984840e6f917d2e0d3b9/0_234_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wall Baghdad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A painter decorates a security wall sealing off the southern section of the Shia enclave of Sadr City in Baghdad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karim Kadim/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, walls separate rich from poor communities. The most well-known is the gated communities of Alphaville, in which 60,000-odd residents are surrounded by around 40 miles of wall. The high-rise buildings inside the compound, with their bright blue <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f4/15/10/f415103cf5b1fc89631e472084372a6b.jpg\">swimming pools on apartment balconies</a>, jar against the dusty red roofs of the surrounding, low-lying favelas.</p> <p>Referring to separating walls as a \u201chot topic\u201d, El-Halawany also cites the recent UK proposal for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/uk-immigration-minister-confirms-work-will-begin-on-big-new-wall-in-calais\">big, new wall</a>\u201d in the French port city of Calais \u2013 four-metres-high and 1km-long \u2013 to stop refugees boarding lorries to reach England illegally.<br></p> <p>Pullan says it\u2019s unclear whether there has been the same kind of growth in city walls as along the borders between countries \u2013 a phenomenon that will surely increase should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">Donald Trump become the next US president</a>. Certainly, though, \u201cvarious municipal authorities are using walls and it seems to be more prevalent,\u201d she suggests.</p> <p>It\u2019s with the aim of subverting the trend, and turning walls of separation into walls of connection, that MasterPeace has invited artists to spend 21 September, the UN\u2019s annual <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/\">International Day of Peace</a>, painting walls in 30 cities around the world for one of the biggest mural projects in history. Walls will be painted in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slums, one of the worst spots of post-election violence in recent years; in the Bangladeshi city of Sylhet, prescient in a country that\u2019s home to the world\u2019s longest border wall; and in Mexico City, where the Trump wall is on everyone\u2019s minds.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77aac25d3b21c46bc3c75b991d9c53aa6bad2271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77aac25d3b21c46bc3c75b991d9c53aa6bad2271/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banksy\u2019s work on the West Bank wall in Ramallah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banksy\u2019s work on the West Bank wall in Ramallah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In most cases, separation walls are imposed, usually by some sort of authority, and usually against the wishes of some, if not all, affected inhabitants. The separation wall in Jerusalem, for instance, built by Israel from 2002 onwards to cut East Jerusalem off from the rest of the West Bank, has been built against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Palestinians.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you build a wall, you need to guard it \u2026 walls create hatred automatically</p> <footer> <cite>Raghda El-Halawany</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Northern Ireland, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/29/belfast-berlin-wall-moment-permanent-peace-walls\">Belfast\u2019s walls</a> are unusual as the majority of those living beside them \u2013 built from 1969 to divide Protestant and Catholic communities \u2013 seem to favour them.<br></p> <p>In desperate times, such walls can be a pragmatic answer to a city\u2019s volatile rifts. As Pullan concedes: \u201cYou can understand that when there is fighting going on, and people are killing each other, the municipal authorities will react usually quickly in wanting to pull the warring communities apart.\u201d</p> <p>Although many walls start life as temporary, they very quickly take on a permanence, and divisions become harder to heal. For El-Halawany, they are antithetical to the very nature of cities: \u201cCities are built on integration, mobility and connections. The feeling of separation creates more of this feeling of \u2018I don\u2019t belong\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m hated\u2019, so it\u2019s more okay to be violent.\u201d</p> <p>She feels their ill effects in her native Cairo: \u201cWhenever there is a new compound, there is increased security \u2013 when you build a wall, you need to guard it \u2026 walls create hatred automatically.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7JHbwVD2wU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q7JHbwVD2wU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What makes these walls so damaging, says Pullan, who who is speaking from Jerusalem where she lived for over a decade, is that they\u2019re \u201coften in a place where no one would have expected a wall, they divide the urban fabric \u2013 they cause spacial discontinuities. If you get that, you usually get social discontinuities as well \u2013 it cuts the normal flow of movement in a city, it means that people never encounter each other, or very rarely.\u201d</p> <p>She takes the example of the wall and UN buffer zone built between the Turkish and Greek communities of the Cypriot capital, Nicosia: \u201c[It] goes right through what was their major commercial street ... and that\u2019s what\u2019s so damaging \u2013 you end up with two rump cities. Once you do that, it\u2019s very hard to put the city back together again.\u201d You only need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/apr/12/cyprus-buffer-zone-photographs-agencies\">look at pictures of the area now</a> \u2013 eerie, like a ghost town \u2013 to understand what she\u2019s talking about.</p> <p>In Jerusalem today, some of the same issues apply as in Nicosia\u2019s old commercial heart. In such a badly divided city, Pullan says, \u201cit\u2019s very important that occasionally people see a face that doesn\u2019t look like theirs \u2026 The Palestinians hear quite a lot of Hebrew, because that\u2019s the dominant language at this point, but the Israelis need to hear Arabic \u2026 These are little things but they\u2019re really important if societies are ever to come together.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/23/struggle-cairo-egypt-revolutionary-graffiti\">'Erase and I will draw again': the struggle behind Cairo's revolutionary graffiti wall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So separation walls feed into a much bigger narrative of estrangement in divided cities: without contact with \u201cthe other side\u201d, communities will tend, Pullan says, to vilify \u201cthe other\u201d. </p> <p>The roots of division often run very deep and it\u2019s difficult to bring walls down even when they\u2019ve been physically removed. So is there an answer? Public space, according to Pullan, is essential. \u201cThere\u2019s the tendency \u2013 even in cities that have a very low level of conflict \u2013 to privatise, put in barriers.\u201d Turning the areas around walls into useable public space is one of the things El-Halawany hopes MasterPeace\u2019s project will achieve. They painted a wall in Cairo a few years ago<strong></strong>, not far from Tahrir Square. Ever since, she says, the space around it has been used for pop-up concerts and events. The local community have invested in it.</p> <p>\u201cThere probably is something fairly inherent in the way we live that we tend to want to live with our own people,\u201d Pullan says. \u201c\u2026 And I suppose there\u2019s nothing so terrible about that. However, there have to be places in cities where we meet other people, and that\u2019s key. Diversity has to be there \u2013 without it you really don\u2019t have a city.\u201d<br></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",
  "<p>If there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign has taught us it\u2019s to view every depraved moral nadir as a challenge, not a destination. You think this is bad? Wait for the tangy mouth garbage he\u2019s got stewing for tomorrow. Then forget about it instantly \u2013 everyone else will! I heard state department employees sometimes email each other!!!</p> <p>Just this week we\u2019ve seen Trump metabolise the Chelsea bombing into an incoherent anti-Clinton smear before the shrapnel had even settled. I\u2019ve listened to my Muslim friends express their fear of leaving the house after <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/new-yorkers-just-received-a-terrible-emergency-alert.html\">Monday\u2019s unconscionably irresponsible emergency alert</a>, the kind of histrionic racial profiling Trump vows to amplify. We\u2019ve read up on <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/donald-trumps-new-anti-abortion-letter-should-terrify-you.html\">Trump\u2019s alignment with an anti-abortion extremist group</a>, and his avowal to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-law-and-order-approach-wont-make-us-safer/\">\u201cget very tough\u201d</a> on \u201cthing[s]\u201d apparently including <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/348568/donald-trump-free-speech-ny-bomb/\">freedom of expression</a>. We\u2019ve clocked Trump\u2019s pin-drop silence on the shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher and Tyre King, though \u2013 don\u2019t worry \u2013 over the summer he promised to make the streets safer \u2026 for police. Trump \u201cjoked\u201d (again!) <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/9/16/12949204/trump-jokes-clinton-assassination\">about the assassination of Hillary Clinton</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">His son compared refugees, who are human beings who need our asylum to live, to Skittles</a>, which are sweets.</p> <p>It was a panoply of potentially career-ending gaffes extruded, clumped, scooped and forgotten in a single week \u2013 AKA business as usual in proto-Trump America. Baffled disgust turned to abject terror (in my circles, at least) when new poll numbers saw Trump climb to 42%.</p> <p>So, yesterday (like most days in these, surely, the end times), I wrote some snotty doom and gloom about Trump on Facebook and, to my surprise, was gently scolded by a friend. \u201cHating Trump isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, \u201cjust like hating W wasn\u2019t enough in 2004. We have to talk about Hillary.\u201d I was defensive for a second \u2013 I do talk about Hillary! \u2013 but couldn\u2019t quibble with her point. It\u2019s easy and fun (and compulsory for responsible human beings) to despise Trump, but treating Clinton like a barely-better-than-a-literal-white-supremacist cipher does her \u2013 and our future as a non-blown-up planet \u2013 no favours. Yes, Trump is an objectively, dangerously horrendous candidate. But we have to start acknowledging that even if we scrubbed Trump from this universe altogether (buy my fan fiction!), Clinton would still be an excellent one.</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton, but not just because I want to see Donald Trump fail and cry.</p> <p>Clinton is pro-choice. This means she does not want to force anyone to give birth to their rapist\u2019s child, or carry a dead foetus inside of their body for 20 weeks, or derail their future because sex is great and everyone has it and accidents happen, or otherwise be a nonconsensual incubator of any kind. Clinton wants to make it harder, not easier, to buy guns. She believes in eliminating loopholes and expanding background checks on gun sales. She does not think domestic abusers should own guns, which is good, because abused women are five times more likely to be murdered if their abusive partner owns a gun. She would prefer your children not to get shot in schools or shopping malls or nightclubs. I agree.</p> <p>Clinton believes in guaranteed paid family leave, because fathers are parents too, and mothers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between career stagnation and going back to work while their episiotomy stitches are still oozing.</p> <p>Clinton wants to tax rich people more than poor people, which is a sentence that no one should have to type ever again.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s platform addresses mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, climate change, violence against trans women of colour, the systemic neglect of veterans, mental health stigma, voting rights, student loan debt, public education and affordable health care. Clinton is the candidate whose views best represent my own.</p> <p>Whether or not you feel comfortable with every decision and position in Clinton\u2019s past (I do not), she is qualified for this job. She is a shrewd, savvy, tough politician.</p> <p>Clinton has weathered intrusive, insulting, gendered smear campaigns \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/490478924/cooked-up-after-a-hillary-clinton-gaffe-the-first-spouse-cookie-battle-is-back\">cookies</a>, Benghazi, emails and pneumonia \u2013 with a grace rivalled only by Obama\u2019s unflappable handling of birthers. She swam through tar every single day of her career and still surpassed male opponents who swam through water. She has been scrutinised in bad faith and beyond all reason for her entire campaign (and decades prior), and Republicans have still had to manufacture baroque, toothless scandals out of dust motes. Yet, somehow, 42% of my country apparently believes that Donald Trump is more qualified to address foreign policy and \u201csafety\u201d than an actual seasoned diplomat. Do you guys think \u201csecretary of state\u201d is the kind of secretary who gets the president coffee? Is that the confusion?</p> <p>We cannot excise sexism from this election (and here I am talking predominantly to white dudes \u2013 the group most disproportionately supporting Trump \u2013 who just have a vague \u201cfeeling\u201d that they don\u2019t like Clinton). You might not overtly hate women. You might be a fantastic boyfriend, husband, brother or son. You might not beat women or harass them or even objectify them or belittle them. But do you trust them? Do you hire them? Do you hire them for management positions? You\u2019re building a house. Do you prefer a male contractor or a female contractor? You\u2019re having open heart surgery tomorrow. Do you want a male surgeon or a female surgeon? If your gut says \u201cman\u201d, you have some introspection to do.</p> <p>So let\u2019s try again: you\u2019re voting for a president soon. Do you want a graduate of Yale law school who served eight years as a US senator and four as secretary of state? Or a racist landlord who moonlights as a tie salesman?</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton.</p>",

Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, it\u2019s relevant reading:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.</p> <p>Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?\u2019</p> <p>But in America, people said: \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you become a citizen?\u2019</p> <p>America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable.</p> <p>With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America\u2019s example and work together to do more to support refugees....</p> <p>When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, it\u2019s important that President Obama is setting this example.</p> <p>When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country.</p> <p>Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a621e4b0603ea33c4669\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:18:18.009Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News talking head Sean Hannity\u2019s outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0J_EKmvYZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k0J_EKmvYZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV\">soak up each others\u2019 awesomeness</a>, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the reasons I\u2019m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he\u2019s going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government.</p> <p>He\u2019s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.</p> <p>And, of course, he\u2019s gonna build that wall.

She shared the news in a Facebook post, which the Guardian obtained.</p> <p> Jim McGrath, a Bush family spokesman, told the Guardian: \u201cThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s busy day came as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton stayed off the trail in advance of Monday\u2019s presidential debate, the first between the two candidate. Although the former secretary of state did a radio appearance and held a conference call with national security advisors, she held no public events. As a result, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/778238281196662784\">jibed on Twitter</a>: \u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest.
