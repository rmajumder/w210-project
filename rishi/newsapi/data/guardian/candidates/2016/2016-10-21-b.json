Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign should be concerned,\u201d said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Optimus, a Republican data analytics firm. His firm\u2019s analysis suggests a \u201cstrong final showing for the Clinton campaign\u201d in early voting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton campaign is looking to build an insurmountable lead in Florida and North Carolina during early voting. If she wins either of those states, she\u2019ll probably be the next president.</p> <p>Using 2012 as a guidepost, she appears to be in a strong position in early voting.</p> <p>While Democrats tend to do better in early voting, Republicans usually post an initial lead with mail-in ballots before Democrats surpass them during in-person early voting in mid to late October.</p> <p>Democrats so far have kept it close with mail-in ballots, giving Clinton a chance to run up the score with in-person early voting. To do that, she\u2019ll need non-whites and young people to turn out near the high levels they did in 2012 for Barack Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Democrats have moved ahead of Republicans in early voting. Republicans had held a modest lead based on mail-in ballots returned, but that was at a much narrower margin than in 2012, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. After in-person voting began on Thursday, Democrats overtook Republicans in overall votes cast.</p> <p>In Florida, a record 3.1 million people have requested ballots, more than one-third of the total voters in 2012. Democrats have requested almost as many ballots as Republicans: 39 percent vs. 40 percent.</p> <p>By comparison, in 2008, Republicans held a lead of 49 percent to 32 percent in requests, according to an analysis for AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm. Obama won in Florida in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Democrats are also showing momentum in the 2nd congressional district of both Maine and Nebraska. The two states allocate electoral votes by congressional district.</p> <p>There\u2019s more where that came from. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/8aeeaf8ed917469da03b1381cbe13d47/Early-voting:-Democrats-show-strength-in-key-battlegrounds\">Read further here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580a3eb8e4b055209adaff6f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T17:14:13.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton to meet with Black Lives Matter activists</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In advance of her rally in Cleveland, Ohio, this afternoon, Hillary Clinton will meet with Movement for Black Lives activists Brittany Packnett and DeRay Mckesson, her campaign reports.

I mean, when Michelle, you know, she had her own sort of professional life, and she was very committed, as she is now, to the kids. And so there was this understanding between them before he ran for president that you know, that was his career. She would be as supportive as she could, but she wasn\u2019t really involved. You know, she wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t campaign terribly much for him in 2004 when he ran for the Senate, for example, a campaign that I was involved in.

He finds the d\u00e9tente between conservatism and populism abrogated. His models\u2014Buckley, Burnham, Will, Charles Murray, Yuval Levin\u2014are forgotten, attacked, or ignored by a large part of the conservative infrastructure they helped to build. He finds the prospect of a reform conservatism that adds to our strengths while ameliorating our weaknesses to be remarkably dim. Such conservatism has exactly two spokesmen in the Senate. It has a handful of allies in the House and states.</p> <p>From the Panama Canal to the Tea Party, from Phyllis Schlafly to Sarah Palin, the conservative intellectual has viewed the New Right as a sometimes annoying but ultimately worthy friend. New Right activists supplied the institutions, dollars and votes that helped the conservative intellectual reform tax, crime, welfare, and legal policy. But that is no longer the case. Donald Trump was the vehicle by which the New Right went from one part of the conservative coalition to the dominant ideological tendency of the Grand Old Party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T14:41:29.535Z\">at 3.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5809f6f0e4b005f21833bc73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T12:51:26.058Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. </p> <p>Can we say we\u2019re in the home stretch?

  "<p>Four years ago Mitt Romney became a global laughing stock when he talked proudly about \u201cbinders full of women\u201d. It was a funny phrase, no doubt about it. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfXgpem78kQ\">watch the clip</a> now, and it\u2019s hard not to feel sympathy for the hapless Romney. He was recalling his spell as governor of Massachusetts and his discovery on taking office that too many senior posts were filled by men. He told his aides to encourage more female applicants, and they duly returned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/17/binders-full-of-women-romneys-four-words\">\u201cbinders full of women\u201d</a>, a move that eventually led Romney to have the most gender-balanced senior team of all 50 US state governors. But he worded it badly, so he became an object of derision.</p> <p>How long ago that seems now. While the 2012 campaign\u2019s idea of a sexist outrage was a poor turn of phrase hinting at tokenism and condescension, 2016 has seen the nominee of a major party exposed as a perpetrator of sexual assault. Recorded on tape admitting that his modus operandi is to force himself on women, push his tongue down their throats without their consent and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">\u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d</a>, Donald Trump has since been confronted by at least 10 women who have testified that this was indeed his method \u2013 and that what he said into that hot mic in 2005 was the truth.</p> <p>But we didn\u2019t need to hear that recording to know Trump is an aggressive misogynist. His serial outrages are well known.He has called women dogs and pigs; he humiliated the winner of his Miss Universe beauty pageant for gaining weight, forcing her to exercise in front of the cameras; he rates women\u2019s bodies out of 10; he dismissed Republican rival Carly Fiorina on the grounds that no one would vote for \u201cthat face\u201d; he suggested TV anchor Megyn Kelly was hostile because \u201cshe had blood coming out of her wherever\u201d. Even when seeking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">rebut the charges</a> of sexual assault, he couldn\u2019t help himself. His defence amounted to: \u201cHave you seen what these women look like? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>This is such a swift degeneration from the public mores that America and the wider world had arrived at \u2013 and which had seemed steady and settled \u2013 that it can be hard to take in. It\u2019s not that long ago that George W Bush received a global, and deserved, scolding for the unsolicited shoulder massage he fleetingly administered to Angela Merkel, which triggered a recoil reflex she could not conceal. Now you have a succession of credible accusers saying a would-be president thinks nothing of seizing women by the genitals.</p> <p>As Michelle Obama put it in perhaps the <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/156767/read-the-full-text-of-michelle-obama-s-powerful-speech-denouncing-donald-trump#.HRzP4Ddxx\">most powerful speech</a> of the presidential campaign: \u201cWe thought all of that was ancient history, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>Of course, that was a comforting delusion. You only have to read a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/29/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-fox-news-laurie-luhn\">fraction of the accusations</a> of appalling sexual harassment and abuse of power levelled at Roger Ailes \u2013 the former overlord of Fox News, now reborn as an adviser to (who else?) Donald Trump \u2013 to know that such behaviour never stopped. Glance at the experiences shared online by EverydaySexism or under the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-groping-not-okay-hashtag_uk_57fa5e9ae4b04e1174a4c775\">notokay</a> hashtag, and you know that men abusing women did not end in the 1970s.</p> <p>Nevertheless the standard society set for itself aimed higher. Publicly, it deemed certain behaviour and attitudes unacceptable. Of course, the new standard was not always respected. But the line was drawn in a new place.</p> <p>This is what Trump threatens. The way he both talks and acts seeks to roll back those 25 years of progress, sanctioning language and conduct that many had hoped was banished. The hope is that, if the polls are right and Trump is crushed next month, this will come to be seen as an aberration, allowing America to return to the more civil, more respectful habits it thought it had entrenched. The gloomier prospect is that the painstaking work of the last generation will have to be done all over again.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, this isn\u2019t only about Trump. Fate conspired to pit perhaps the most misogynistic nominee in US history against the first female nominee. (Perhaps that\u2019s no coincidence.) But even without Trump\u2019s disgusting boorishness, the mere presence of Hillary Clinton\u2019s name on the ballot may well have unleashed a torrent of misogyny. Witness the merchandise I saw on sale outside the Republican convention in Cleveland this summer. Among the slogans were: KFC Hillary Special: 2 fat thighs, 2 small breasts \u2026 left wing. Also: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/trump-adviser-al-baldasaro-hillary-clinton-firing-line\">Hillary Sucks, But Not Like Monica</a>. And the hardy perennial: Life\u2019s a Bitch, Don\u2019t Vote for One.</p> <p>The intensity of this hatred can\u2019t be explained solely by the controversies over Clinton\u2019s emails, her hawkishness or links to Wall Street. More Americans have a \u201cstrongly unfavourable\u201d view of Clinton than of any Democratic nominee since pollsters started asking the question. Some will say that\u2019s because she\u2019s a lacklustre campaigner. But compare her with, say, John Kerry, who was hardly electrifying on the stump in 2004. Among white men, 52% hold a \u201cvery unfavourable\u201d view of her, compared with the 24% who took a similarly dim view of Kerry. It takes a wilful blindness to think this has nothing to do with the fact that Clinton is a woman.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/fear-of-a-female-president/497564/\">fascinating essay</a> for this month\u2019s Atlantic, Peter Beinart surveyed the academic research that found men (and plenty of women) unnerved by women in traditionally male roles, especially overtly ambitious women, judging them more harshly than they would men. Roles don\u2019t get much more traditionally male than the US presidency. What\u2019s more, Beinart cites polling that shows Clinton has been at her most popular when \u201cconforming to traditional gender roles (working on women\u2019s issues as first lady, sticking by her husband during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, loyally serving Barack Obama as secretary of state), and least popular when violating them (heading the healthcare task force, serving in the Senate, running for president).\u201d</p> <p>The most obvious manifestation of this sexist hostility to Hillary is in the hatred spat out by Trump and his most devoted followers. But might some of that same sexism lurk in the now cliched insistence that she\u2019s a terrible candidate, that Trump v Clinton is like choosing between cholera and gonorrhea, as Julian Assange memorably <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or\">put it</a>, that progressives can only vote for her while holding their nose?</p> <p>Michelle Obama was right: no candidate in the modern era has ever been more qualified. Clinton won <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/19/13340828/hillary-clinton-debate-trump-won\">all three debates</a> by outwitting Trump, luring him into one trap after another. She is serious, sober, prepared and with a detailed grasp of policy. And, despite Trump\u2019s taunts to the contrary, she has demonstrated extraordinary stamina. Yet somehow, for some, she\u2019s still not quite good enough.</p> <p>The optimistic view is that the best remedy for this strain of sexism is simply for America to see a woman in the White House and get used to it. But the depressing evidence of the last eight years is that racial resentment actually rose rather than fell while Obama was in the Oval Office. It suggests that neither electing Clinton nor defeating Trump will be enough to defeat the demons unleashed by this campaign. That work won\u2019t end on 8 November. It will begin.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2016 to correct the spelling of Carly Fiorina\u2019s first name.<br></p>",

A reported 4,800 people, many ordinary customers who had paid deposits for pieces of furniture, were owed money by Broyhill\u2019s company, according to a list of creditors.

Bradford, 71, is one of the co-chairs of Trump\u2019s council.<br></p> <p>Bradford and his wife reported that they owed millions of dollars in business debt, outstanding loans, credit card bills and other costs such as $6,500 in membership dues to their country club.

In 2004, the US justice department successfully sued Trump adviser Phyllis Hill Slater of New York for $169,000 in income and payroll taxes dating back 12 years.<br></p> <p>Slater and her architecture engineering firm have also had warrants and liens filed against them by New York authorities for non-payment of state taxes. It was unclear from filings whether Slater\u2019s outstanding taxes were eventually paid.

Keyt, 75, does not, however, currently have registered with Florida authorities any active business that employs people. Keyt did not respond to a message and calls seeking comment.<br></p> <p>Adviser Erica Taylor of Wichita founded two non-profits in the 1990s that were struck off the state register for failing to file accounts, according to filings at the office of the Kansas secretary of state. Taylor was in 2013 reported <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/feature/40under40/erica-r-taylor.html\">to be the owner of something called T&amp;C Publications</a>, but no records of the firm actually being incorporated could be found in state filings. Taylor, 46, did not respond to several emails and calls seeking comment.</p> <p>At the other end of the corporate scale, Anthony Scaramucci of New York is the co-founder and co-owner of SkyBridge Capital, a $12bn hedge fund, which is not a small business.<br></p> <p>Another Trump adviser, Joe Salvucci of Pennsylvania, owns and is chairman of Peak Technical Staffing, a large employment agency that brings in annual revenues of about $60m by supplying companies with contract staff. Salvucci, 60, said he bought the business from his father about 30 years ago.<br></p> <p>Salvucci and his company have been accused of failing to act on allegations of sexual assault and harassment made by female staff, and even of retaliating against those who made them. He denies this.<br></p> <p>In 2013, 27-year-old manager Allison Trathen alleged that her boss in an Illinois branch of Peak Technical subjected her to a campaign of harassment that culminated in him following her into an elevator and assaulting her by rubbing his genitals against her backside while grunting.<br></p> <p>Trathen alleged in a federal lawsuit that she emailed Salvucci, the Trump adviser, three times anonymously to say that she was being sexually harassed by her boss, eventually identifying him by name. \u201cI just want my supervisor to stop with the inappropriate texts/emails and to stop trying to touch me inappropriately,\u201d she wrote. She said no investigation was opened.<br></p> <p>When she was assaulted by Williams a second time, she said, she took a leave of absence, and Williams was allowed to resign. But even after that, she alleged, one of Salvucci\u2019s senior executives insisted to her that the activity had been a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d and tried to have her sign a document saying she would comply with company policy on harassment.<br></p> <p>In court filings, Peak Technical denied Trathen\u2019s allegations that she had alerted Salvucci, the chief executive who is now a Trump adviser, about her claims of sexual harassment. But the company eventually settled her lawsuit, for an undisclosed amount.<br></p> <p>In 2007, office administrator Mary McLaughlin alleged that she was terminated from her job after telling bosses in a Michigan office that she was sexually harassed by a co-worker. The alleged harasser was also terminated from his job.<br></p> <p>Peak Technical then advised another company where McLaughlin had applied for a job not to hire her, saying she was \u201csomewhat unstable and defensive\u201d, according to a $300,000 lawsuit McLaughlin brought against the company.<br></p> <p>Denying that McLaughlin\u2019s termination was related to the harassment allegations, Peak Technical said in a court filing that it was due to \u201cperformance deficiencies\u201d. After McLaughlin named Salvucci\u2019s sister as a witness she planned to call at trial, the case went to mediation. McLaughlin\u2019s attorney said it was \u201cresolved under a confidentiality agreement\u201d.<br></p> <p>In 1992, Rebecca Magnuson, a 27-year-old Peak Technical employee in Virginia, alleged that she was constantly sexually harassed by the manager of a Volkswagen dealership to which she was assigned. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/donald-trump-net-worth-forbes-400\">Donald Trump's net worth is down $800m, according to Forbes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The manager repeatedly made lewd comments about Magnuson\u2019s body, she claimed, and asked her three times to leave work with him and check into a hotel, telling her \u201che could make or break her career\u201d.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\" title=\"\">final presidential debate</a>, thankfully the last set piece in a wretched campaign, revealed what is admirable and loathsome in American politics. Hillary Clinton displayed a razor-sharp intelligence and a quick wit. Her facility with facts trumped Donald Trump\u2019s lack of them. Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful, thin-skinned billionaire who trades in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\" title=\"\">racism</a> and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate. His jibes revealed a&#xa0;man out of his depth. His answer was to plunge down deeper. By disgracefully refusing to rule out calling this a rigged election he gave up a fight he had by then lost.</p> <p>Americans should vote for Secretary Clinton as an able and proven politician. A Trump presidency would be bad for America and dangerous for the world, so a vote for Secretary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Mr Trump has been exposed for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">questionable tax arrangements</a>, outrageous business practices and irregularities at his charity. The billionaire is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\" title=\"\">grabber and kisser</a> of women who he presumed gave consent because he was famous. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\" title=\"\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual assault by Mr Trump. He has demonstrated that he has neither the conscience, training nor sense of history \u2013 and the desire to be judged well by it \u2013 to occupy the White House. Secretary Clinton possesses such attributes. She has a serious and sustained commitment on issues like education, healthcare and equality, and she has stood consistently for the rights of women, ethnic minorities, children and the disabled through her long career.</p> <p>However, there are fewer reasons to vote for Secretary Clinton than one would have hoped. For more than two decades she has been part of a political establishment that shaped a dysfunctional country. She has been unable to escape being tarnished by the most damaging policies \u2013 notably around <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36020717\" title=\"\">criminal justice</a> \u2013 of&#xa0;her husband\u2019s administration. There are well-founded concerns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\" title=\"\">highlighted by transcripts of her speeches</a>, that she is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on&#xa0;its excesses if&#xa0;elected.</p> <h2>The mood for change</h2> <p>Even so, as the first female president she would represent a symbolic transformative change in American politics. In some ways what Secretary Clinton has had to deal with are ingrained cultural attitudes about what success and leadership look like. These were exposed by the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">finding that Mr Trump would win if only men voted</a> and Secretary Clinton would win if only women voted. That most men favor Mr&#xa0;Trump over Secretary Clinton demonstrates at some level a more insidious sexism than the one Mr Trump peddles: that centred on the mind, not the body. It is a hostility \u2013 deeply embedded but rarely conceded \u2013 against seeing women as genuinely equal.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the 2016 presidential campaign has been one of the most confrontational contests of the modern era. The mood for change has been more pervasive and volatile, and has been supercharged by Mr Trump, a braggart with tyrannical instincts. The backdrop to this election has been genuine and understandable public anger about economic insecurity, growing inequality and frustration with elites. Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left have reflected that mood in their very different ways. That is not going to disappear after 8 November. The election has also raised real questions about the crisis of American democracy. Mr Trump encouraged violence against opponents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">threatened to jail Secretary Clinton</a> if he took office.</p> <p>The civility that has marked out US democracy as ordered and restrained appears dead. The next president will have to resurrect it. The political topography of a polarized and resentful nation has been obscured by the preternatural equanimity of Barack Obama. Mr Trump has in some ways skilfully exploited these divisions. On social security he has moved to the left on the campaign trail, telling jobless Americans that he would <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/08/08/social-security-where-clinton-and-trump-stand/#6dbc02aa4f40\" title=\"\">not touch their benefits</a>. Mr Trump also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark measure that increases health coverage for low-wage workers and benefits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">large numbers of immigrants and minorities</a>. This contrasts with the real estate magnate\u2019s offer to expand the US health programme for the elderly \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20161020/clinton-trump-tangle-on-preserving-medicare\" title=\"\">Medicare</a> \u2013 which benefits overwhelmingly older, whiter voters.</p> <p>These dog whistles have been part of American politics for decades. But they come at a time when there is a sense that there are too many losers from economic growth in the country. Driving discontent in the US is a system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. The&#xa0;middle classes <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">are poorer today than in 2000</a>. Since the Great Recession the top <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/u-s-top-one-percent-of-income-earners-hit-new-high-in-2015-amid-strong-economic-growth/\" title=\"\">1% of families in the US have captured 52% of the income growth</a>. There\u2019s understandable anger that the wealthy were bailed out while ordinary Americans were hollowed out. Voters rage that, in the current incarnation of globalization, jobs that disappeared when the US decided to import rather than manufacture did not come back \u2013 they simply popped up elsewhere, usually in China.</p> <h2>The Sanders effect</h2> <p>Nowhere has this fury been more keenly felt than in the country\u2019s former manufacturing heartlands, tapping into America\u2019s long history of resistance to free trade and making protectionism a potent political force once again. The politician who has shaped the politics of the country and accounted for populist anger is Senator Sanders. The man from Vermont understood, earlier than most, that voters see the economy as rigged against them by a political system that has been corrupted by big money. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/03/the-democrats-generation-gap/\" title=\"\">His campaign was backed three to one by millennials in the Democratic primaries</a>. This month his favorability ratings in opinion polls <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/cx4orjzwhb/econTabReport.pdf\" title=\"\">are only bettered by Michelle&#xa0;Obama</a>.</p> <p>Senator Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign has transformed Democratic politics \u2013 forcing Secretary Clinton to adopt, albeit sotto voce, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-election-democrats-sanders-commentary-idUSKCN0Y90C9\" title=\"\">key planks of his program</a> such as a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour, tuition-free public college and opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 President Obama\u2019s big trade deal. Until this week, Secretary Clinton failed to outline enough of a bold reform program. Tellingly, she offered signs of one in the final televised debate, making unprompted promises to push immigration reforms, a key Sanders point, within the first 100 days of her presidency.</p> <p>Although domestic politics has framed the campaign, Secretary Clinton\u2019s election would be greeted with relief and optimism in most world capitals other than Moscow and Damascus. Despite her <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/\" title=\"\">hawkish outlook</a>, she will have no alternative but to recognize that the 21st century no longer always looks to the United States as an indispensable hegemon, whether benign or threatening. Secretary Clinton should focus on US soft, not hard, power \u2013 dealing with climate change and working out fairer global trade arrangements.</p> <p>If Secretary Clinton is elected she must recognize the mood without pandering to its demons. She needs to bring the bold ambition about the role of government to this era that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt each did in earlier times. She has the intelligence, the seriousness and the experience to do this. The&#xa0;US presidency is hugely powerful: 10% of all posts in federal government are allocated on the basis of political patronage. Secretary Clinton offers the best chance of ensuring those jobs go to competent people. Her choice of Treasury secretary in the aftermath of the banking crisis will be watched with special care, as will an olive branch appointment to Senator Sanders of the kind that president Obama made to her in 2008. She offers the greatest hope that the supreme court defends abortion rights and looks again at issues like campaign finance as well as background checks on gun owners. Yet America will soon find itself weakened at home and abroad if the new president is as badly served by congress as Mr Obama has been for most of his tenure.</p> <p>There is a danger, if Mrs Clinton wins, that&#xa0;the Republicans will relapse into the Hillary-hatred that has marked them for a quarter century. The tragedy of this election is&#xa0;that, to become president, Secretary Clinton has had to talk more radically than she actually felt; to be an effective president she may be compelled to act more conservatively than she&#xa0;now says she wants to do.</p>",

One that morning, while children sat in their classes, thousands of tonnes of slurry and coal waste slid down the hill above the village and crushed the primary school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef7b64f216255a890d3d3c249d2b216def106e77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef7b64f216255a890d3d3c249d2b216def106e77/0_218_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aberfan on the day of the disaster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aberfan on the day of the disaster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I found it very difficult this morning to think of anything much else apart from the anniversary. I\u2019m not old enough to remember it myself, but as a parent it touches a raw nerve about how you could ever cope with losing your children in circumstances like that.</p> <p>And some of the reporting, after all this time, still has the capacity to move you.</p> <p>Roy Greenslade has published on his blog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/20/aberfan-a-reporters-letter-home-reveals-the-true-horror-of-the-tragedy\">a letter that Alix Palmer wrote home to her mother from the village</a>, where she had been sent to report for the Daily Express:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I saw such dreadful things, Mummy. They brought out the deputy headmaster, still clutching five children, their bones so hardened that they first had to break his arms to get the children away then their arms to get them apart. And the mothers of two of them watched it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>The most impressive coverage I\u2019ve seen today is by WalesOnline. They have produced <a href=\"http://aberfan.walesonline.co.uk/\">a beautifully designed special feature on Aberfan</a>, which includes the testimony of several survivors and rescue workers who have never spoken publicly before about their experiences.</p> <p>I truly urge you to spend some time reading through it \u2013 I can\u2019t stop thinking about these words by Melvyn Walker about the impact it had on him as an eight year old who had escaped from one of the classrooms:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I couldn\u2019t go to school for two years. Nobody knew, I couldn\u2019t tell anybody. I used to go out and then head up to the mountainside in my uniform and sit there on my own all day.</p> </blockquote> <p>As with many man-made disasters, the bereaved then faced a battle with the authorities to get the true nature of what happened recognised. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/21/aberfan-survivors-mark-50th-anniversary-of-disaster\">As my colleague Steven Morris wrote today</a>, one father stood up during an inquest after the cause of his child\u2019s death had been given as asphyxia and multiple injuries and declared: \u201cNo, sir, buried alive by the National Coal Board. That is what I want to see on record.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3e8c2be39ce843e856b3be5cd31e57897998416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e8c2be39ce843e856b3be5cd31e57897998416/0_219_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaque on the memorial garden to the victims of the Aberfan disaster that was built on the site of Pantglass Junior School\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plaque on the memorial garden to the victims of the Aberfan disaster that was built on the site of Pantglass Junior School</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:59:31.729Z\">at 2.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580a1d0ce4b0cd26ff71f874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:50:29.344Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More views below the line on that Brexit vs the NHS question.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85907912\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4153533\" title=\"View Qube2\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4153533\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Qube2\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4153533\" title=\"View Qube2\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Qube2</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85907912\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">21 October 2016 2:33pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Tories have a lot of responsibility for the problems within the NHS, but others are based on the system itself. It is simply too large and too centralised, for example patients shouldn't need to travel to a central hospital for an ultrasound; patients and their families shouldn't need to explain the same symptoms/history at every shift change to all the new staff. While emergency care is amazing the primary care can be completely patchy depending on where you're unlucky to be ill. In many European countries private capacity is incorporated into health services and it works remarkably well without fears of money grabbing or lousy service. The problem with the Tory approach is that privatisation never really works in the UK, because making profits becomes paramount and share ownership promoted as a virtuous ideal - there are scant examples of real value and improvements being delivered by privatisation. So the problem is a psychological British one: why can't we do privatisation to actually improve service? Other countries do.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809dda3e4b0cd26ff71f73c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:42:26.068Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are baby boxes on the way for Scotland?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another conversation our team of moderators found particularly interesting this week (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/21/baby-boxes-the-nhs-join-our-live-look-at-the-week-to-discuss?page=with:block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c#block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c\">see 13:35</a>) was around this article on baby boxes in Scotland.

Boots vouchers when every savvy mum knows it's all much cheaper at Pound land (and Lidl and Aldi's nappies are far cheaper and just as good if you don't fancy washable.)<br />Books and breastfeeding advice would be useful. A list of 'things that are normal, so don't worry' with a poo chart, pictures of benign rashes, like cradle cap and the 6 week spots (erythema toxicum neonatorum). Some paracetamol, a 'snotter sucker' for when you wee Scottish baby gets his first respiratory virus and can't feed and breathe at the same time.

It is scary to suddenly come across part of the British population who must have had a simmering anti-foreign sentiment for a long time. I've lived here longer than I lived in my native country and if someone is asking me now if I wanted to become British to make my life here secure, I think I would have to be nearly desperate to do so as this country is split, with nationalism raising its ugly head. Having read plenty of blogs, I can't but help that many of the people having voted BREXIT have done so because they felt left behind and unheard and are under the impression that they will get back what the lost over the last 40 or so years. What they want back cannot be got back as what they want is for globalisation to go away, as the world is so meshed up now that you can't have control as one has to compromise in this globalised world. If people think that foreign people undercut their own wages, ask if something produced or service rendered more expensive than created or done by people in another country will not be left unbought, making it unproductive so that said UK worker will be out of a job soon, never mind if the competition is working within the UK or in another country.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think?

  "<p>Wellesley hadn\u2019t seen a demonstration in a long while, but the late 1960s were vibrant times. The Massachusetts college had always been quite closed; we were trying to change that, baby steps at a time. I chaired the student education committee which was set up to give the all-female students a role in shaping the academic side of the college. We organised this rally to try to change college policy on the way non-core subjects, such as physical education, were graded. We wanted pass or fail, rather than a competitive grading system. </p> <p>We wanted to ensure the rally wasn\u2019t seen as partisan, so we invited speakers from both sides of the political divide. It is well known that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\"> Hillary Clinton</a> shifted her politics while at college, but at this point (she was a sophomore, or second year student), the perception was that she was still a Republican. </p> <p>Even at that time, she was a good speaker. She was curious, serious and intellectually active. I was two years ahead of her, studying political science and history of art; we lived in the same dorm and were friends. Civil rights, women\u2019s rights, Vietnam: all these critical issues were bubbling. </p> <p>The previous summer, at the end of my junior year, I had interned on Capitol Hill with a progressive Democratic senator called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_S._Clark_Jr.\">Joseph Clark</a>, and I had come back to Wellesley buzzing with it. Hillary listened to us talking about our experiences, and my sense was she really wanted to be part of it. Her style, taking in others\u2019 opinions and formulating her position, was evident all these years ago. </p> <p>Two years after this rally, she became student government president, and the first student to give a <a href=\"http://www.wellesley.edu/events/commencement/archives/1969commencement/studentspeech#xM6VK9CVJAPx4gBu.97\">graduation speech at Wellesley</a>; her criticism of the guest speaker, Senator Edward Brooke, made national headlines. Did I ever think she could be president? I\u2019m not sure we had our sights set that high, but Hillary clearly stood out as a leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/30/scott-ones-kisses-alexandra-homas-during-the-ancouver-riots-15-june-2011\">'I kissed her to calm her\u2019: Scott Jones and Alexandra Thomas, the Vancouver riots, 2011</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Wellesley, Hillary\u2019s career intertwined with mine; at one point, we were both working for the <a href=\"http://www.childrensdefense.org/\">Children\u2019s Defense Fund</a>. When I worked in the US House of Representatives, I went to speak in Arkansas and stayed at the governor\u2019s mansion. After more than a decade, I left the government; but when Governor Clinton became president, Hillary recommended me for a job as a senior official in health and human services. </p> <p>Today, I continue to work in the area of inequality, trying to advance opportunities for disadvantaged people: ensuring that children of low-income families can read proficiently by the end of third grade; consulting on disability rights; and creating opportunities for women and girls. </p> <p>The two years after my graduation from Wellesley \u2013 Hillary\u2019s final years there \u2013 were pivotal in the women\u2019s movement; it was gaining energy and traction. I recall conversations I had with her around that time and in the early 1970s, about whether it was possible to manage a marriage and a career. The goal for some Wellesley girls was to meet the right partner and get married. Hillary always wanted a career of her own. </p> <p>\u2022 Are you in a notable photograph?

It\u2019s nice to be thought of as the world\u2019s nice guys. And it\u2019s useful \u2013 it obscures a lot of dirt.</p> <p>Last year, Canadians almost came to terms with the lie in our branding. After a decade of the rightwing Harper government, with its pro-oil, anti-science and anti-Muslim ideas, it had become difficult to maintain our sense of smug superiority. Add to that the global coverage of crack-smoking Toronto mayor Rob Ford (since deceased), and the maple leaf flag patch sewn to our metaphorical backpack was coming loose at the seams.</p> <p>In this disillusionment, there was opportunity. If we wanted to reclaim our reputation as a just and caring and helpful society, perhaps we could try behaving like one. During our 2015 election, everything from electoral and environmental reform to international peacekeeping was put back on the table, and we dared to open our eyes (just a peek) to the neglected, remote indigenous communities where <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/attawapiskat-suicide-emergency-help-1.3529750\">suicide rates</a> are shockingly high and access to untainted <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bad-water-third-world-conditions-on-first-nations-in-canada-1.3269500\">drinking water</a> is shamefully low.

Trudeau is the political equivalent of a YouTube puppy video. After your daily barrage of Trump and terror, you can settle your jangled nerves with his comforting memes. </p> <p>Each week, Trudeau feeds the news cycle a new sharable moment, and our Facebook feeds are overwhelmed with shots of the adorable young statesman cuddling pandas and hugging refugees and getting accidentally photographed in the wild with his top off, twice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/canada-pacific-northwest-lng-natural-gas-pipeline-british-columbia\">Environmentalists 'expected better' of Trudeau as Canada backs gas project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For international audiences, the Justin moment has been a harmless diversion.

A few weeks later, right as he was backtracking on a campaign promise for electoral reform, Trudeau\u2019s approval rating hit 64%.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s moment would likely have lapsed by now if not for the American election. The comparison of Trump v Trudeau is just too rich for the press to resist. Canada has a dashing Disney prince for a ruler, and the US is considering<em> this guy</em>?

The recent rise in income tax on dividend income is likely to have led to some owner-managers bringing forward their dividend payments. As a result we can expect strong growth in income tax receipts on dividend payments to arrive around the self-assessment deadline at the end of January. Therefore a better estimate for receipts this year is for an undershoot of \u00a38bn, driven by with weak receipts from income tax and National Insurance on earnings, and from VAT on purchases.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>On 23 November, the new chancellor will present his response to a much changed economic outlook at the Autumn Statement.

If government wants to support the property sector and help first-time buyers, they will need to increase the circulation of homes on the market. </p> <p>In order to achieve this, they first need significantly step-up the construction of new homes - David Cameron\u2019s Government built the fewest new homes of any administration since the 1920s. Theresa May must do better. More also needs to be done to encourage older people to consider downsizing, freeing up more homes for families and younger buyers. Reducing Stamp Duty rates would provide a greater incentive to move home, increasing the flow of properties onto the market and ensuring house prices remained stable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809fbf4e4b055209adafe26\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:31:01.723Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Burberry shares jump on Coach merger report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Burberry shares have jumped more than 5% to \u00a315.27 after financial blog Betaville (citing sources) reported that US rival Coach was working with investment bank Evercore on a potential merger with Burberry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b3e5aab5f9014796aeacf634cef1085af453f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b3e5aab5f9014796aeacf634cef1085af453f75/0_188_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burberry at Castleford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burberry at Castleford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burberry</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:32:23.844Z\">at 12.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5809f7f8e4b005f21833bc79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:24:18.417Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Property conference MIPIM UK, a three-day event (the UK offshoot of the annual Cannes conference) draws to a close today.

  "<p>Halloween 2016 is the scariest it\u2019s been since we thought there were real witches up in Salem. We are weeks away from an election that could give us a president as orange as a Jack-o-Lantern that wouldn\u2019t just decompose after a few weeks. It\u2019s terrifying and we could all use some catharsis, no matter the source. It may just be the bad vibes talking, but the image of Tyler Perry\u2019s Madea racing down a street screaming \u201cHelp me, Jesus!\u201d with zombies hot on her trail seems slightly \u2026 <em>profound</em>? It\u2019s an unexpected reaction to one of Perry\u2019s low-budget comedies that mostly trades in pratfalls and bawdy invective before slamming into a wall of treacly pop-psychology. But it\u2019s a very strange time in America right now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/do-the-right-thing-how-black-cinema-rose-again\">Black films matter \u2013 how African American cinema fought back against Hollywood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tyler Perry is a horrible director and a rancid writer, but I absolutely love Madea. With Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween, she stars in her ninth feature film. Add that to a slew of plays, television appearances and a direct-to-DVD cartoon and it\u2019s undeniable that she is a pop culture icon. She is rude, loud, violent, boastful of her criminal past, but, for reasons psychologists could only understand, we crave her approbation. Her thorny approach to life flies in the face of every family value that seemingly serves Perry\u2019s wholesome audience, and this is why he\u2019s a genius. Somehow, when Madea does the horrible thing, it\u2019s all right. And when she finally comes around and does something decent, it\u2019s like a big warm hug.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to take a second look at Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween with a stopwatch just to see how much of it is devoted to extolling the virtues of corporal punishment in child rearing. One awkwardly blocked scene consists of Madea (played by Tyler Perry in drag) sitting in her straight-laced nephew Brian\u2019s living room (Brian is also played by Perry) with her brother Joe (Perry in a white wig) and her two pals Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis) and Hattie (Patrice Lovely), and the four elders riff on \u201cwhoopin\u2019 ass\u201d for what feels like forever. If Andy Warhol ever came back from the dead, the director of the eight-hour film consisting of a single shot of the Empire State Building, would be shocked at how long this sequence drags on. But sprinkled among the desultory morass are occasional firecrackers of brilliant schtick-based comedy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sPHseSGr9Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-sPHseSGr9Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Perry is an outstanding performer, whose biggest laughs frequently come from sputtered reactions of anger and frustration. There\u2019s plenty of it in Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween (yes, I\u2019m going to use the full name every time, this movie is all about excess) and it stems from a plot too ridiculous to spend much time describing. Brian\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Tiffany (Diamond White) wants to sneak out to a costume party at a nearby frat house, but to do this she and her pal Aday (Liza Koshy) have to spook the old chaperones with a spooky tale. Then they head to the party, get found out, and there follows a series of increasingly far-fetched pranks.</p> <p>The final act shoves a message in our face, something about kids respecting their parents, and parents rejecting today\u2019s namby-pamby parenting methods and getting tough. It crescendos in a series of gay panic jokes when Brian and Madea pretend someone\u2019s throat gets slashed and all the kids end up on a prison bus. It\u2019s just one of the many moments of tonal strangeness, but rather than dwelling on that it\u2019s much more fun to remember the scenes of Madea knocking the wind out of evil clowns or Aunt Bam griping about her hip surgery and toking on more medical marijuana. There\u2019s also the absurd moment when a horny frat boy suggests going to \u201cfifth base\u201d, and a riff in which Madea tries to get a preacher to hurry up past his praying while making an emergency phone call. It\u2019s truly a marvel of extemporized, non-verbal comedy. It\u2019s just that these moments come amid so much filler.</p> <p>I can\u2019t call Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween anything resembling a good film (it\u2019s shot with the production values of a television sitcom) but it is so relentless that, like gorging on a bag of trick or treat candy, it\u2019s undeniably addictive. Before the stomach ache comes. </p>",
  "<p>She had kept it to herself. \u201cBuried it\u201d and moved on. But when an audio <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">tape</a> emerged 7 October of presidential candidate Donald Trump boasting in 2005 about habitually getting away with being a sexual predator, Shannon Coulter couldn\u2019t ignore her reaction.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a feeling of recoiling. It was emotional, visceral. Then I had a pounding headache for a few days. I was filled with nausea,\u201d said the technology and media marketing specialist based in the Bay Area. </p> <p>Like many <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sexual-assault-diane-rehm_us_58054af6e4b0dd54ce34b83b\">women</a> who have watched sexual harassment allegations against Trump unfold, Coulter was reminded of her own experience. \u201cI was in an office belonging to a firm I was working for in Silicon Valley and my boss\u2019s boss came breezing through. Suddenly he came up behind me and pressed himself right up against me and said \u2018Why is it you always look so good?\u2019 He had a colleague with him and it was so humiliating,\u201d Coulter recalled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa154e5dacb45ff8515b2410b6cd42317441b0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa154e5dacb45ff8515b2410b6cd42317441b0f/0_360_2667_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"shannon coulter ivanka trump boycott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Coulter, a tech and media marketing specialist who is boycotting the Ivanka Trump Collection fashion line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Casey Fatchett photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd when I heard Donald Trump talking on that tape, I recognized in his words the same feeling that I had that day \u2013 of being nothing more than an object. No matter how smart you are or how hard you work, they can do that to us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Now Coulter is taking action. But instead of targeting Donald, she\u2019s going after his daughter, calling for the boycott on the clothing, jewelry, shoes, handbags and perfume that are branded as part of the widely sold Ivanka Trump Collection. She is also calling on the retailers that carry them \u2013 including Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Amazon, Lord &amp; Taylor, Marshalls and Zappos \u2013 to stop selling them.</p> <p>For Coulter, it\u2019s unacceptable that Ivanka Trump continues to support her father, despite mounting evidence that he denigrates women. \u201cIf Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her. But something changed for me when that tape was released,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ivanka Trump has since called her father\u2019s comments on the tape \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">inappropriate and offensive</a>\u201d. But she has made excuses for his misogynist comments in the past and has enjoyed a high profile in his campaign, speaking at the Republican national convention. A recent <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">article</a> reported that sales revenue from her clothing line exceeded $100m last year and is growing strongly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter how smart you are or how hard you work, they can do that to us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 11 October, Coulter created the hashtag #GrabYourWallet on Twitter \u2013 a call for shoppers to vote with their wallet, as well as a pointed echo of Donald Trump\u2019s bragging on tape about being able to approach women uninvited and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, which he subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">apologized</a> for but also sought to dismiss as \u201clocker room talk\u201d.</p> <p>More than a million people have viewed her posts in the last 10 days and she is receiving 200 direct replies on Twitter per day and hundreds of retweets, according to a review of the relevant social media activity.</p> <p>Coulter estimated that more than 50,000 respondents have expressed support for her campaign and at least 2,000 have said they will participate.</p> <p>Susan Rhodes, who lives in Palm Beach, the Florida location of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, said she joined the boycott after seeing #GrabYourWallet on Twitter, despite having previously bought a \u201cvery tasteful\u201d pair of $400 Ivanka Trump boots from Amazon for her daughter last year. </p> <p>\u201cI remember working as a female banker in Florida 30 years ago and being surrounded by men saying \u2018I can\u2019t talk to you today because your boobs are staring me in the face so I can\u2019t focus\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She said Donald Trump\u2019s vulgarities hit a raw nerve, and now Ivanka needed to take a stand. </p> <p>Coulter researched which stores stocked any items in Ivanka Trump\u2019s line of clothing, shoes, perfume or accessories. The list also includes TJ Maxx, DSW, Dillards, Carson\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, Saks Off Fifth, Stein Mart and Belk.</p> <p>The retailers on the list and Ivanka Trump were asked to comment on the boycott campaign but most did not respond to the request on Thursday. Zappos.com, Amazon, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Neiman Marcus stated that they would decline to comment. Nordstrom sent this statement: \u201cWe have heard from some customers about this. We don\u2019t currently have any plans to stop offering this collection.\u201d</p> <p>Ivanka Trump\u2019s chief brand manager Abigail Klem did not directly address the news of a boycott campaign, but sent the following statement to the Guardian: \u201cWe are proud that our business is growing rapidly and that our brand resonates strongly with women who are inspired by our messaging and excited about the polished and chic solution-oriented products that we offer.\u201d</p> <p>She added that the brand had experienced \u201csignificant year over year revenue growth\u201d, though without any details.</p> <p>Lindsey Ledford, 29, from College Park, Maryland, who is studying full time for a degree in cybersecurity, has joined the campaign. She said she normally shopped at the bargain stores Marshalls or TJ Maxx two or three times a week, but now she would avoid them unless they stopped selling Ivanka Trump products.</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t spoken out. The Donald Trump brand and the Ivanka Trump brand \u2013 ultimately it\u2019s all the same thing and in good conscience, I cannot buy that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her for being supportive to her family. But the way she has positioned herself with her website, the one-stop shop for women who work and female empowerment, then acting as a surrogate for the most hateful, racist, sexist campaign \u2013 you can\u2019t pick and choose like that,\u201d she said, referring to Ivanka\u2019s Women Who Work lifestyle brand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Coulter said she has encouraged consumers supporting her campaign to call the customer service numbers of the retailers and protest their selling Ivanka Trump products.</p> <p>She said that when she had called, the phones had always been answered by women who listened sympathetically and often said they would take the point up with management.</p> <p>Macy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/macys-fires-donald-trump-mexico\">stopped</a> selling Donald Trump\u2019s clothing line in 2015 after he made offensive comments about Mexico \u201csending\u201d rapists to the US. But so far, Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand is still on sale at the outlets on Coulter\u2019s hit list.</p> <p>\u201cIf she were not campaigning for Donald Trump, I would be very happy for her business and proud of her success. But I think she is being used to whitewash the candidate and make him more palatable,\u201d Coulter said.</p> <p>\u201cThe boycott is actually a mark of respect for her,\u201d she added.</p>",
  "<p><br>After America went bananas over Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to say he\u2019d accept the results of the presidential election, it seemed almost inevitable that he would keep saying it. When Trump says something that shakes the earth, he\u2019s almost bound to double down. Because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">the only thing Trump loves almost as much as himself is attention</a>.</p> <p>And did he ever double down. It might\u2019ve been a triple down. At a campaign rally on Thursday morning, Trump leaned in hard: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election.\u201d Then, in an emphatic cadence that can only be expressed in that internet-y way with extra periods, he delivered this horrifying caveat: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result\">If. I. Win.</a>\u201d</p> <p>That it was a punchline seemed evident from Trump\u2019s trademark self-satisfied grin, but this was no joke.

In other words, Republicans.</p> <p>If you\u2019re the type of person who\u2019s inclined to stick with Trump through everything that\u2019s come out about him, you\u2019re probably going to buy into his bogus claims that the election is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">rigged</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>You see, the normal rules of democracy don\u2019t apply to Donald Trump. Just as Trump doesn\u2019t need to bother with all the traditional electoral stations of the cross \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/harry-reid-donald-trump-tax-returns-senate-democrats\">presidential candidates releasing their tax returns</a> \u2013 he simply doesn\u2019t have to accept a vote from the American people he doesn\u2019t want.</p> <p>For Trump and his supporters, that leaves only one possible outcome. Trump\u2019s line about accepting the results only if he wins smacks of a man who says <em>of course</em> he believes in getting consent \u2013 but only if she says yes. <em>Of course</em> a peaceful transition is a hallmark of our governmental system; that\u2019s why we have to hand the White House over to Donald Trump.</p> <p>This line of thinking is about as self-serving and circular as it gets.

That would make him a loser, and Donald Trump is no loser. Losers are the people Trump mocks, mostly by calling them \u201closers\u201d.</p> <p>So it comes as no surprise that, when Trump put out a call for official \u201cvolunteer Trump Election Observers\u201d \u2013 under the banner \u201c<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/landing/volunteer-to-be-a-trump-election-observer\">Help Me Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!</a>\u201d \u2013 his supporters began signing on.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Novi, Michigan, on Friday had a guest that caught many observers by surprise. Hovering behind Trump\u2019s head in the fourth row, was a man in a white turban and the traditional dress of a Shia Muslim cleric. </p> <p>The man was later identified as Lebanese sheikh Mohamed El-Hajj Hassan, who has since received a barrage of criticism for attending the rally given Trump\u2019s inflammatory language toward Muslims, including his call for all Muslims to be banned from entering the country.</p> <p>Before the rally in Novi, Trump met with Hassan and members of the <a href=\"http://amctrump.org/\">American MidEast Coalition for Trump</a> \u2013 a group working to build support for Trump in Middle Eastern communities \u2013 at an event organized by his foreign policy adviser and Fox News pundit Walid Phares.</p> <p>Hassan was previously a part of Hezbollah, the Shia militant and political group that has been listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the US state department since 1997. He broke off from the group shortly after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/ten-years-after-hariri-assassination-lebanon-needs-moderation\">2005 assassination</a> of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and formed the Free Shia Movement, a splinter group that has gained little to no traction in Lebanon since.</p> <p><strong></strong>Hassan has since maintained his position as a vocal opponent of Hezbollah; even appearing on <a href=\"http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4937.htm\">a TV show</a> last year referring to the group as hooligans.</p> <p>His attendance at the Trump rally last week drew the ire of a range of onlookers online. </p> <p>\u201cEvery commentator (who isn\u2019t a member of a political party) that I\u2019ve seen comment on this was just confused,\u201d said Joey Ayoub, Lebanese blogger at Hummus For Thought and MENA editor at Global Voices Online. Ayoub added that Hassan\u2019s anti-Hezbollah stance does not gel with Trump\u2019s tacit support for Vladimir Putin, as the Russian president supports Hezbollah in Syria. </p> <p>However, Hassan said Trump told him he likes Muslims and he has no problem with them, <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/10/01/area-middle-eastern-leaders-got-face-time-trump-novi/91357724/\">according to the Detroit Free Press</a>. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Guardian\u2019s multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>Michigan is home to the largest Arab American population in the country. Trump probably hoped that Hassan and the dozen other religious leaders he met with at the American Mideast Coalition for Trump event, would help mend his image among Arab Americans.</p> <p>\u201cTrump obviously benefits from the optics of having a visibly Muslim Arab at his rally,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior non-resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council. But he added, \u201cit will mean harsh questions for Hassan from the larger Arab and Muslim communities in the United States, and probably in Lebanon too.\u201d </p> <p>The meeting with Trump was orchestrated by Phares, a controversial figure in Trump\u2019s campaign. The news of his appointment as foreign policy adviser to Trump in March 2015<strong> </strong>was met with a wave of backlash. </p> <p>Phares is reported to have been a member of the Phalangist militia, a Christian Maronite force, during Lebanon\u2019s sectarian civil war that spanned 1975-1990. According to a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/walid-phares-mitt-romney-lebanese-forces\">2011 Mother Jones investigation</a>, Phares was in charge of the ideological training of militia troops and even advocated for the creation of a Christian enclave within Lebanon, a hardline position in the multi-confessional state. There is no indication that Phares personally carried out any acts of violence or war crimes. </p> <p>The 15-year-long Lebanese conflict was brutal, with atrocities committed on all sides. The Phalangist militia itself, which was allied with the occupying Israeli army, was responsible for one of the war\u2019s lowest points: the 1982 massacre of hundreds of civilians at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut. </p> <p>Phares ultimately fled Lebanon during the civil war and relocated to the US where he then became an academic. Over the next two decades, Phares published several books and espoused a hardline approach to Islam and the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cHe began to endear himself to neocons after 9/11, with his books and studies about radical Islam,\u201d said Mohamad Bazzi, a New York University professor in journalism. </p> <p>According to Bazzi, he lumped all Islamist movements together \u2013 non-violent and violent \u2013 and heightened fears and suspicions around Islam. Phares became a regular \u201cexpert\u201d guest on NBC and later Fox News, even though several terrorism experts, such as Andrew Exum, have <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/96519/romney-walid-phares-sharia-caucus-iowa-pawlenty\">discredited</a> his work.</p> <p>In 2011, the former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney appointed him to his campaign as a foreign policy adviser, the same role he now fulfills for Trump.</p> <p>The appointment was met by a backlash from the Council of American-Islamic Relations and a variety of Islamic scholars who said that Phares had no credibility.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be akin to turning to [former KKK member] David Duke to get advice on race relations,\u201d Omid Safi, currently director of Duke University\u2019s Islamic Studies Center, told <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/12/mitt-romney-s-new-adviser-sparks-islamic-uproar.html\">the Daily Beast</a> at the time.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to remove a reference to Martha Crenshaw discrediting Phares\u2019 work.<br></p>",
  "<h2>Trump flops, booed, at Catholic charity fundraiser</h2> <p>If Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been defined by going where no candidate has gone before, on Thursday the real estate mogul went even further: getting himself roundly booed at a Catholic charity dinner that is usually a moment of bipartisan good cheer in the presidential race. Trump earned some laughs with his address to the crowd \u2013 \u201cmany tell me modesty is my best quality\u201d \u2013 but it quickly deteriorated into an attack on Clinton that prompted jeers from the audience and shouts for him to stop speaking.

The effort, led by Trump\u2019s notorious informal adviser Roger Stone, will focus on 600 different precincts in nine Democrat-leaning cities with large minority populations, a tactic branded highly irregular by experts, who suggested that organizers could potentially use polling as a way to intimidate voters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim\">Trump loyalists plan own exit poll amid claims of \u2018rigged\u2019 election</a></p> <h2>Will the west turn blue?</h2> <p>Across the towns and cities of bone-dry Arizona, voters and pollsters have started to ask openly about a change that seemed nearly glacial, if not impossible, not so long ago: could Democrats take the American west?

Nevada, another toss-up state, showed Clinton ahead by seven, and she has an apparent lock on Colorado and New Mexico.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/arizona-swing-state-west-democrats-clinton\">Arizona asks \u2018the unprecedented\u2019: could Democrats sweep the west?</a></p> <h2>Clinton\u2019s problem with young black voters</h2> <p>There\u2019s no question that black voters will support Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in large numbers, but the real question is whether they will actually come out and vote for her.

As they anxiously try to rally their bases, the concern is that there is limited enthusiasm from black millennial voters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">Why should we trust you?

Then the trouble started. First Megyn Kelly lit into Trump over the candidate\u2019s insulting remarks about women. Then came the ousting of Fox\u2019s founder and chairman Roger Ailes, who left the network in disgrace in July amid a series of allegations of sexual misconduct. Now the chaos of the Trump candidacy is tearing the network in two. But this is the logical conclusion of what Fox News spent nearly 20 years sowing in rightwing politics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/20/fox-news-changes-donald-trump-rightwing-politics-roger-ailes\">Can Fox News survive the forces it unleashed on the 2016 election?</a></p> <h2>The plight of central American migrants</h2> <p>A M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res study has found that nine out of 10 migrants seen by the charity\u2019s psychologists this year have showed symptoms of anxiety or depression caused by violence and threats suffered during their journeys.

It\u2019s a real honor; he\u2019s taken time out from socializing with his friends to talk to you! Instead of understanding how much of an honor it is, however, you tell him that you\u2019re not really interested.

Bush lost the national popular vote to Gore by 0.51% but won the electoral college by 271 votes to 266.<br></p> \n<p>After initially conceding to Bush on election night and minutes before he was due to formally admit defeat, Gore famously phoned Bush back to explain that circumstances had changed and he now wanted to change his mind. </p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me back to retract your concession,\u201d Bush said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get snippy about it,\u201d Gore shot back. </p> \n<p>The election result hinged on Florida, where the margin of victory was so slim it triggered a recount. Gore sought recounts in a handful of counties and Bush sued to stop them. A case was ultimately brought before the US supreme court, whose 5-4 decision stopped the recount and in effect awarded Bush Florida\u2019s electoral votes. </p> \n<p>Gore disagreed with the decision but conceded nonetheless. In his concession speech, delivered days before the electoral college vote, Gore quoted Stephen Douglas, who lost the presidency to Abraham Lincoln: \u201cPartisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I\u2019m with you, Mr President and God bless you.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Donald Trump has boasted of being the law and order candidate, but legal scholars and ex-government ethics officials have warned against what they see as his cavalier attitude toward potential conflicts of interest and the rule of law, based on the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s rhetoric and policy stances.</p> <p>Specifically, ethics and legal scholars say that Trump\u2019s notion of creating a supposed \u201cblind trust\u201d for his businesses, if he becomes president, that would let his children run the Trump Organization without an independent trustee is risible. Trump told Fox News last month: \u201cI will sever my connections and I\u2019ll have my children and my executives run the company, and I wouldn\u2019t discuss it with them.\u201d</p> <p>He told CNN last month that \u201cI would most likely put it in a blind trust and they [his children and executives] would run it, or something.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/apr/21/donald-trump-brand-white-house-business-empire\">Why winning the White House would be the best deal of Donald Trump's business career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, legal experts say, is not how a blind trust is supposed to work. Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for President George W Bush, says that in a true blind trust \u201cthe trustee has to be independent of the office holder and certainly not the sons and daughter\u201d. Additionally, he said, Trump would have to sell off his real estate assets and an independent trustee would then have to place his funds or investments in a new trust without revealing the contents to Trump or his children.</p> <p>Other legal scholars concur. \u201cAbsent a truly blind trust, Mr Trump would be able to make decisions that could benefit his business interests,\u201d says Lloyd H Mayer, a law professor and tax specialist at Notre Dame. \u201cNothing Trump has said indicates he\u2019s interested in setting up a truly blind trust where neither he, nor his family members, nor his close associates would know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>The criticisms of Trump\u2019s blind trust proposal echo other recent controversies over legal issues over which Trump has faced fire from scholars and former government officials for challenging, or ignoring, social and legal norms through his policy stances.</p> <p>Some legal scholars, for instance, note that Trump has shown contempt for press freedoms by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">advocating changing the libel laws</a> to make it easier to sue the media \u2013 and \u201cmake lots of money\u201d in Trump\u2019s words \u2013 while using inflammatory words to paint a picture of a vast press conspiracy ranged against him.</p> <p>Painter sees Trump\u2019s talk of changing libel laws as glib and dangerous since he \u201cdoesn\u2019t acknowledge there\u2019s a constitutional problem\u201d, given the first amendment right to free speech.</p> <p>In a similar vein, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result\">stonewalling and equivocating over whether he would accept the election results</a> \u2013 win or lose \u2013 drew widespread bipartisan fire as a rebuke to the principles of democracy.<br></p> <h2>Conflicts of interest</h2> <p>Most recent presidents have taken pains to curb conflicts of interest or appearance problems \u2013 even though the president and vice-president are exempt from the conflict of interest statute that other executive branch officials have to follow.</p> <p>But legal scholars say that Trump would potentially face more conflict of interest problems than previous presidents given the global nature of his real estate empire and business dealings \u2013 from Azerbaijan to Turkey and from China to India \u2013which could be impacted by government economic or foreign policy decisions and often involve licensing agreements with his name and brand on hotels plus residential and office properties.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents, who have used blind trusts to hold and manage their assets while in office, this kind of arrangement would not work for Trump because he has integrated his children into the management of his business operation, and his assets are so closely tied to his name and identity,\u201d says Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University who specializes in legal ethics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8/173_0_4526_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further, Trump and his businesses could face legal risks under the constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, an ethics measure that bars a president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, or entities controlled by those governments. Painter points out that Trump\u2019s real estate empire has often relied on foreign bank loans \u2013 including from the Bank of China \u2013 which could create problems if new loans were made, or old ones renegotiated, under terms that deviated from normal rates, thus giving Trump\u2019s businesses a financial edge.</p> <p>Other experts agree that the emoluments clause could impact Trump\u2019s businesses. \u201cIf Donald Trump\u2019s business arrangements involve his receiving payments, directly or indirectly, from a foreign government or an entity it controls, that would violate the emoluments clause,\u201d Clark said.</p> <p>As legal criticism has escalated of Trump\u2019s unusual concept of a blind trust, his son Eric Trump last month tried to defend it in an ABC television interview by noting that his father would not make decisions as \u201cit relates to the company\u201d, and that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be involved in government\u201d.</p> <p>Those broad assertions haven\u2019t quieted critics of Trump\u2019s notion of a blind trust. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have cosmetic value because his interests are presumably aligned with his kids\u2019,\u201d says Ken Gross, a partner with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom.</p>",
  "<p>For more than 50 years the Vatican\u2019s relationship with China has been intractable. But if Pope Francis has his way, a deal to bridge what many believe is an insurmountable divide between the Roman Catholic church and the communist Chinese government could be announced within the next 30 days.</p> <p>According to one person who has closely followed developments, the pope would like to seal a deal before the conclusion on 20 November of the <a href=\"https://cruxnow.com/church/2015/12/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-holy-year-of-mercy/\">Holy Year of Mercy</a>, which was called by the pontiff to celebrate acts of forgiveness.</p> <p>Any agreement that solves the thorniest issue between the two sides \u2013 the Vatican\u2019s right to appoint its own bishops in China \u2013 would represent the most consequential diplomatic feat of the Francis\u2019s papacy.</p> <p>It would also spur a debate about whether Francis \u2013 a Jesuit who has always promoted <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/distinctly-catholic/pope-francis-encounter\">the importance of \u201cencounters\u201d</a> but has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30455187\">declined to meet the Dalai Lama</a> \u2013 has been too willing to ignore concerns about human rights and religious freedom for the sake of furthering the Vatican\u2019s own interests in a country that is officially atheist.

A great country. But more than a country, a great culture, with an inexhaustible wisdom,\u201d the pope told Asia Times this year.</p> <p>Since his election in 2013, there have been subtle signs that the relationship between the Vatican and Beijing has warmed. There was <a href=\"http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/08/14/pope_francis_sends_telegram_from_plane_to_china_/1104531\">the telegram Francis sent</a> to President Xi Jinping as his papal plane flew in Chinese airspace on the way to Taiwan in 2014, and the gift of a silk print, symbolic of Christianity\u2019s presence in China, that was reportedly given to the pope this month by a representative of Xi, though the accuracy of that story has not been confirmed.</p> <p>Chinese Catholics are free to go to mass and attend church, but barred from proselytising.

Jeroom Heyndrickx, a Belgian priest who has championed the negotiations, said the talks were centred on whether the Vatican would be given permission to appoint its own bishops. </p> <p>There is also a disagreement over the the fate of eight \u201cillegal\u201d bishops appointed by officials in China, some of whom have been excommunicated by the Vatican.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere have been some efforts at dialogue in the past, but never so intensive and ongoing and with perseverance on both sides,\u201d Heyndrickx said. \u201cThe situation is more hopeful now than it has been in 65 years.\u201d </p> <p>Reaching an initial agreement on the bishops could make it easier to tackle other issues, such as the fate of the China Catholic Patriotic Association, a state-controlled organisation that controls the church and appoints bishops.</p> <p>Heyndrickx said negotiations between the Vatican and Beijing were set to recommence later this month. A preliminary agreement that was reportedly reached in August would allow the pope to choose bishops from candidates recommended by the CCPA.</p> <p>Church sources have separately told Reuters that China is preparing to ordain at least two new bishops before the end of the year, and these appointments would have the blessing of the Vatican. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/What-will-2016-bring-the-Church-in-China-36349.html\">most vocal critic</a> against any such deal is Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong and critic of China\u2019s human rights record. \u201cIt is unthinkable to leave the initial proposal in the hands of an atheist government who cannot possibly judge the suitability of a candidate to be a bishop,\u201d he wrote <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/What-will-2016-bring-the-Church-in-China-36349.html\">in an article</a> for AsiaNews in September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/china-arrests-christians-opposed-cross-removals-zhejiang\">China arrests Christians who opposed removals of crosses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The apparent warming of relations between Beijing and Vatican coincides with a controversial \u201ccross-removal\u201d campaign in eastern China.

But the real difficulty in hammering out a deal was not resistance inside the Vatican but rather China\u2019s objections.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that Xi has a strong wing of the party apparatus that says if you give the Christians, and the Catholics in particular, an inch, they are going to take a mile. Ultimately this is about who controls the Catholic community. Is the primary loyalty to the state or the pope?,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>Successive popes have had an answer to that question: it can be both. \u201cBut the Chinese to date are divided on whether that is true,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>The difference between the current negotiations and previous talks is Francis himself. The first non-European pope is viewed as less political and more sympathetic to interests outside the US and Europe, experts say.</p> <p>Francesco Sisci, a senior researcher at China Renmin University in Beijing, noted that Francis was the first pope to have his homilies translated in China.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, he is not a superstar, he is not as popular as a rock star, but he is known to the Chinese public and that is very different from other popes, who were totally unknown\u201d Sisci said.<br></p> <p>Richard McGregor, a China expert and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/13/the-party-richard-mcgregor-review\">author of The Party</a>, said it was not clear why agreeing a deal with the Vatican would be a priority for senior officials. \u201cThere are lots of obstacles in the way of a genuine deal. At the same time, they have many other political priorities in the area of managing and keeping a lid on religion, so it is hard to see why China would compromise.\u201d</p> <p>While a deal would be a propaganda coup for Beijing and put pressure on Taiwan, McGregor said there were \u201cfundamental issues of authority\u201d at stake that would make it hard for the Vatican to demand any guarantees on control of the church in the mainland.</p> <p> Pope Francis is said to have a special devotion to Mary, the \u201cundoer of knots\u201d. After brokering a deal that saw the US and Cuba <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/18/us-cuba-deal-a-marriage-18-months-in-the-making-blessed-by-pope-francis\">restore diplomatic relations</a> last year, the pontiff may find a breakthrough with China during the year of mercy a deal worth doing, no matter how big the knot.</p>",

Though Thiel has supported Trump\u2019s candidacy since the summer, the billionaire did not donate any money to the campaign until 15 October, just three days after a deluge of sexual assault complaints were levied against the candidate.</p> <p>Thiel plans to \u201caddress the controversy\u201d in a speech later this month, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/technology/how-silicon-valley-treats-a-trump-backer-peter-thiel.html\">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>In the book, co-authored with Thiel\u2019s fellow Stanford and PayPal alumnus, David O Sacks, the pair discuss a 1991 case in which a 17-year-old Stanford freshman alleged that she had been raped in a dorm room while intoxicated:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAlthough [the alleged perpetrator] was clearly guilty of serving alcohol to an underage woman and taking advantage of her resulting lack of judgement, there was no sexual assault ... Understandably, however, the woman regretted the whole incident afterwards.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Thiel and Sacks also took issue with Stanford\u2019s policy on sexual assault, which said that \u201csexual assault by force or coercion, including deliberate coercion through use of drugs or alcohol, is absolutely unacceptable at Stanford University\u201d.<br></p> <p>But Thiel and Sacks wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIt is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>They added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cBut since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might \u2018realize\u2019 that she had been \u2018raped\u2019 the next day or even many days later. Under these circumstances, it is unclear who should be held responsible. If the alcohol made both of them do it, then why should the woman\u2019s consent be obviated any more than the man\u2019s?

  "<p>You always know an election is near in the US when Democrats and Republicans start to discuss the plight of black Americans. </p> <p>Most of the time, little is said about the high levels of poverty in black communities.

Then, more than half of young black voters participated, outpacing their white and Latino peers in the process.

In other words, if the campaign simply tweaks its messaging or if young black voters would only consult her website, they would see that Clinton has a robust platform to address their concerns. </p> <p>While it is certainly true that Clinton has gone out of her way to use the language of the Black Lives Matter movement and to highlight the unquestioned racism of Donald Trump, she faces three problems that no campaign promise can adequately address. </p> <p>The first problem for the Democrats is the dreadful continuation of police killing black men. </p> <p>The police killings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">came so quickly in September</a> that most people had forgotten that on 15 September, police in Columbus, Ohio, shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/tyre-king-shooting-funeral-columbus-police-officer-bryan-mason\">13-year-old Tyre King</a>. Described as 4ft 11in and 95lb, King was shot three times in the back, according to an autopsy. And in the last several weeks, there have been continued protests in El Cajon in southern California and in Charlotte, North Carolina, in response to two killings. There was also the video-recorded killing of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/terence-crutcher-shooting-not-guilty-plea-betty-shelby\">Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>. </p> <p>Even where police killings of black men and boys do not receive national attention, they reverberate within the neighborhoods and wider communities for days, weeks and months afterward. Indeed, the crisis of police violence was identified by black millennials as their number one concern above all other issues. In a <a href=\"http://blackyouthproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BYP-millenials-report-10-27-15-FINAL.pdf\">poll</a> taken last August, 91% of black and 71% of Latino millennials described \u201cpolice killing of Black people as a serious problem\u201d. Seventy-seven per cent of black millennials said that they or someone they knew had been \u201charassed\u201d by the police. </p> <p>The Democratic party has appeared completely incapable of putting a stop to it.</p> <p>It has now been 19 months since Obama\u2019s commission on policing in the 21st century released its report and offered 58 recommendations for reform. The police have killed more than 1,000 people in that time. Furthermore, for all the publicity that some cases have received, it is more likely than not that the police officers will not even be charged, let alone punished. </p> <p>In the absence of actual reform, Democrats led by Obama seem to stress the need for understanding on both sides \u2013 as if police violence were the product of misunderstanding as opposed to oppression at the hands of an armed appendage of the state. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s platform is more substantive than that, as she calls for spending a billion dollars to better train police, legislation against racial profiling and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. While one can debate Clinton\u2019s ability to actually follow through on these promises (and whether they would actually produce the kind of accountability the Black Lives Matter movement is demanding), the bigger problem for Clinton is one of credibility. </p> <p>Supporters of Clinton have denounced the perception of her as untrustworthy, calling it ignorance or sexism. It is undeniable that some of the vitriol directed at Clinton has misogynistic undertones, especially when it comes from Trump and his supporters. But to reduce all criticism of Clinton to gender discrimination is both disingenuous and dishonest. </p> <h2>America\u2019s \u2018first black president\u2019?

What has been left out of the happy tale is the way Clinton used poor and working-class black people as political grist to rebuild an electoral coalition of old Reagan Democrats and moderate white Republicans. </p> <p>In 1993, Bill Clinton went to the church where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his last speech before his assassination. Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=all\">said</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[King] would say, \u201cYou did a good job creating a black middle class of people who really are doing well \u2026 You did a good job. You did a good job in opening opportunity.\u201d But he would [also] say, \u201cI fought for freedom \u2026 but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don\u2019t amount to anything. I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton had perfected the southern cadence \u2013 in this case, literally speaking as if he were Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 that intimated an insider\u2019s perspective on black life, while clearly communicating to white voters a rejection of the \u201csystemic racism\u201d which Hillary Clinton speaks so much about today. </p> <p>(Of course, these were the words of Bill and not Hillary \u2013 but the painful efforts to parse out where her politics begin and his end are specious. Aside from the fact that Hillary\u2019s comments about \u201csuper predators\u201d aped the sentiment at the core of Bill\u2019s law and order agenda, we can\u2019t ignore how she has cast her years in the White House as part of her vast political experience that makes her more prepared than anyone else to be president.)</p> <p>This skilled blame game continued throughout Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, during which the Democratic party as a whole helped to structure the wider context within which the discussions about crime and welfare reform were taking place. </p> <p>For example, in the aftermath of the Los Angeles Rebellion in 1992, the then candidate Bill Clinton traveled to South Central Los Angeles and diagnosed the roots of the crisis. He <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-03/news/mn-1956_1_los-angeles\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p> \u201cPeople \u2026 are looting because they are not part of the system at all any more. They do not share our values, and their children are growing up in a culture alien from ours, without family, without neighborhood, without church, without support.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, Clinton and the Democratic party of the 1990s played a pivotal role in helping to shift the discussion <em>away</em> from \u201csystemic racism\u201d, as it had been in the 1960s and 1970s, back to a focus on the culture and family structure of African Americans as the root of black inequality. Bill Clinton and his political partner, Hillary, were not passive observers of an ideological attack that posited crime and punishment over government assistance and public welfare; they, in the 1990s context, were its architects. </p> <h2>\u2018Free stuff\u2019 and the anti-capitalist politics Hillary won\u2019t touch </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e838388000f4c20912f60b4dfcaa8cbefc1c83b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e838388000f4c20912f60b4dfcaa8cbefc1c83b/901_162_1463_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bernie sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Young black voters were most attuned to Sanders\u2019 redistributive political agenda.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second problem the Clinton campaign faces is the developing anti-capitalist politics of young voters, especially black millennials. </p> <p>Though Clinton supporters chastised Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign for its poor showing among African Americans, what went without much comment is how well the Sanders campaign did among young black voters. In fact, 44% of black voters aged 18 to 30 voted for Sanders, compared with the 32% of votes that went to Clinton. Sanders, by <a href=\"http://genforwardsurvey.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/GenForwardAugust2016Toplines_final-1.pdf\">comparison</a>, received only 33% of the white youth vote. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, Sanders\u2019 campaign began with little attention paid to racial inequality, but that slowly shifted over its course. Nevertheless, young black voters were most attuned to Sanders\u2019 redistributive political agenda. Polling found that \u201cpoverty and inequality\u201d together were listed as the third most important issue for black millennials. </p> <p>This fits with the growing anti-capitalist sentiment among young people today. According to a Harvard University poll of young adults from ages 18 to 29, 51% said they <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/26/a-majority-of-millennials-now-reject-capitalism-poll-shows/\">did not support capitalism</a>; conversely, 33% said they supported socialism. This is a political awakening that has been developing over the last several years. In the year that the Occupy movement announced its arrival in 2011, a Pew poll found 47% of young people did not support capitalism. </p> <p>Today, that sentiment is deeper than just an anti-capitalist feeling: it is also expressed positively and in support for redistributive social programs. Forty-eight per cent of millennials support health insurance as a \u201cright for all people\u201d. And 47% agree that basic necessities, such as food and shelter, are \u201ca right that the government should provide to those unable to afford them\u201d. Clinton mocked Sanders supporters during the primary fight for wanting \u201cfree stuff\u201d.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-supporters-audio-leak-228997\">leak</a> of remarks Clinton made during a February fundraiser demonstrates her grasp of at least some of the reluctance of millennials to embrace her candidacy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And on the other side, there\u2019s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we\u2019ve done hasn\u2019t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don\u2019t know what that means, but it\u2019s something that they deeply feel. Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the great recession. And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement \u2026 They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future \u2026 If you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, and doesn\u2019t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. </p> </blockquote> <p>For whatever insights Clinton may demonstrate here, there is also a kind of smug undercurrent that links newness to politics with the \u201cnaive\u201d desire for \u201cfree healthcare\u201d and \u201cfree college\u201d. </p> <p>Months later, after a bruising primary with Bernie Sanders, Clinton now supports some aspects of \u201cfree college\u201d. This sudden switch, in addition to contributing to the perception that Clinton will say anything to curry political favor, speaks to the larger disconnect between her campaign and young voters. Young people wonder how it is that a wealthy nation like the US with its 400 billionaires can also be home to 45 million people living in poverty. The young people, like those of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter, care less about what is politically realistic and more about what is just. </p> <p>This concern expressed by millennials is not just altruistic, but it is deeply personal. </p> <p>For some black millennials, their lives teeter on the edge of catastrophe. There is breathless reporting of gun violence in Chicago, but outside of the city there is remarkably little said about the conditions within which the violence gestates. Forty-seven per cent of 20- to 24-year-old young black men are unemployed. Among black 16- to 19-year-olds, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-youth-unemployment-urban-league-0126-biz-20160124-story.html\">14%</a> are neither working nor in school. </p> <h2>Candidate Obama was no President Obama</h2> <p>Finally, the main factor in black millennials\u2019 shortage of enthusiasm for Clinton may be the thin portfolio of reform offered by Barack Obama. </p> <p>Obama won in 2008 and 2012 in part because of the historic turnout of young black voters. This was the generation that had politically come of age during the endless wars of the Bush administration; it had witnessed the collective shrug of the federal government in response to the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina. Black youths also watched as their families were the canaries in the mine shaft of the pending economic meltdown in 2008. The ensuing wave of home foreclosures began to take effect in black communities in 2006 and 2007. </p> <p>This was the context of Obama\u2019s run against Bush in 2008, when Obama jettisoned the cookie-cutter political campaign. </p> <p>He righteously counseled: \u201cChange doesn\u2019t come from Washington \u2026 change comes to Washington.\u201d While on the campaign trail, he made speeches that invoked the legacy of the abolitionist movement against slavery, the labor movement of the 1930s that made unions possible, the gay rights movement and, of course, the civil rights movement. Obama rhetorically tried to situate his campaign among those social movements: underdogs in the grassroots doing the impossible for the good of the nation. </p> <p>But candidate Obama was no President Obama, who quickly distanced himself from the loftiness of his campaign. The rise of Black Lives Matter is, in no small part, a product of his inability or unwillingness to directly and forthrightly address the persistence of racial inequality. The paralysis of the president in the face of racism and injustice was a bitter pill to swallow. </p> <p>Obama has reminded all who would listen that he was not the president of black America, but the president of the US. Even if this disappointment was never measured in opinion polls, today it can be measured in the waning interest of black millennials in the Clinton campaign. It can even be detected in the terse words of Obama, who recently said it would be a \u201cpersonal insult\u201d to him if black voters did not mobilize in big numbers to elect Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>But perhaps it is most clearly borne out in the anger of black millennials, as exemplified in this <a href=\"http://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2014/12/01/dear-mr-president-a-letter-from-tef-poe?page=2\">letter</a> from the St Louis artist and poet Tef Poe, written at the height of the Ferguson uprising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When an assault rifle is aimed at your face over nothing more than a refusal to move, you don\u2019t feel like the American experience is one that includes you. When the president your generation selected does not condemn these attacks, you suddenly begin to believe that this system is a fraudulent hoax \u2013 and the joke is on you. Racism is very much alive in America, but as a president with so much melanin in his skin, you seem to address it very bashfully \u2026 Now we are organizing against you and members of your party as though we didn\u2019t vote for you to begin with. This saddens me, because we rooted for you. Me and my friends are young. We voted for you because initially you spoke our language. We believed you would be more of an activist than a typical suit-and-tie teleprompter politician. Are you not outraged by the treatment of your own people by law enforcement? Why is it so difficult for you to display a moment of honesty and reflection to the public about your own blackness? </p> </blockquote> <p>If the nation\u2019s first black president, who won a majority of the electorate and came into office with a super-majority in Congress, could not disrupt the racial status quo, then what can anyone expect Clinton to accomplish?</p> <h2>\u2018If things get worse\u2019 isn\u2019t a good political choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f034330ce33113dcb7f37beb5f348b1b04b2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f034330ce33113dcb7f37beb5f348b1b04b2e4/9_0_2995_1797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"hillary clinton donald trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The myopic focus on Donald Trump\u2019s rightwing and racist rhetoric cannot, in and of itself, undo the sense of disappointment and cynicism black millennials feel toward the Democratic party.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last May, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/06/02/transcript-hillary-clinton-delivers-major-national-security-address/\">said in a foreign policy speech</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that America isn\u2019t great.

That plane \u2013 those words \u2013 our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. It represents freedom and hope and opportunity. I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country \u2013 that we\u2019re still \u2026 the last, best hope of Earth.</p> </blockquote> <p>The incongruent logic of deploring \u201csystemic racism\u201d while championing the US as \u201cthe last, best hope of Earth\u201d lends itself to the constant questioning of Clinton\u2019s sincerity. </p> <p>Perhaps she thinks that both can be true, but others might conclude that the candidate has either not truly grasped the depth or scale of the crises in black communities today, or that she will say anything to get votes. Whatever her intentions, it will certainly take more than \u201cladders of opportunity\u201d to address our country\u2019s deep racism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/half-of-young-americans-prefer-meteor-apocalypse-to-donald-trump-presidency\">Half of young Americans prefer meteor apocalypse to Donald Trump presidency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The myopic focus on Donald Trump\u2019s rightwing and racist rhetoric cannot, in and of itself, undo the sense of disappointment and cynicism black millennials feel toward the Democratic party. As for the Clinton supporters who suggest that Trump represents a unique threat to free speech \u2013 do they believe that Trump will execute an executive order banning protests? Will he mobilize the military to stop demonstrations? Because this generation has already endured a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy\">violent crackdown</a> on the Occupy encampments in the winter and spring of 2012 coordinated by Barack Obama\u2019s FBI. </p> <p>Black millennials who have taken up the cause of Black Lives Matter have already endured teargas, live ammunition, dogs, false arrest, military tanks, police beatings, fees, fines, prison time, jail, surveillance, infiltration and harassment. All with a black president at the helm. Under such circumstances, it is a remarkably hollow argument to insist that a vote for Clinton is a vote to be able to continue to organize. </p> <p>The insistence that things will simply get worse under Trump as the motivation to vote for Clinton is to gloss over, if not ignore, the deep and profound ways that young people are already suffering. Yes, life can always get worse, but this narrow fixation ignores the more pressing question: how do things get better? </p> <p>Clinton should pay heed: a growing number of young black people are not settling for the question of \u201cwho will cause the least harm\u201d.

The Pew study points out that inefficiencies among state registrars are mostly the cause of innocent, if unfortunate, circumstances: one in eight Americans moved between 2008 and 2010, many pushed by the financial crisis, which also strained local budgets, and 51 million more Americans were not registered anywhere to vote at the time of the study.</p> <p><strong>\u201cMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals right now are listed as voters.

Halfway through her second term, President Michelle Bachelet\u2019s approval rating is hovering around 25% \u2013 well below the 71% she reached towards the end of her first term. </p> <p>Bachelet\u2019s approval ratings cratered last year after her son was accused of using his political connections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/08/chilean-president-michelle-bachelet-corruption-charges-sebastian-davalos\">to help his wife obtain a bank loan for a property deal</a>. </p> <p>Concurrently, a huge campaign finance scandal has tainted dozens of political leaders, many of whom were elected as socialists but were then discovered to have been funded with money from Soquimich, a publicly traded Chilean company run by the former son-in-law of the dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p> <p>The rightwing UDI party has imploded under its own scandals: the party\u2019s former presidential candidate Laurence Golborne \u2013 who as minister of public works led the 2010 rescue of 33 miners trapped in a copper mine \u2013 is under house arrest while prosecutors investigate allegations of tax fraud and illegal campaign funding. The longtime UDI president Jovino Novoa was given a three-year prison sentence for illegal campaign contributions and banned from political office. </p> <p>Turnout for the upcoming national elections is expected to set record lows with barely one in three eligible voters participating. \u201cWe will have places where less than 30% will vote,\u201d predicted Marta Lagos, a sociologist and Chile director of Market Opinion Research International, a leading polling company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/pinochet-widow-lucia-hiriart-cema-chile\">Pinochet's widow under investigation on suspicion of swindling millions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With traditional parties mired in controversy and internal divisions, it is perhaps not surprising that voters should look for an alternative in the generation that came of age during the 2011 student protests. <br></p> <p>Other former student leaders, Gabriel Boric, 29, and Giorgio Jackson, 30, are years away from the minimum legal age of 35 to run for president and are still in their first term in congress. </p> <p>But they and their followers can mobilise a powerful voter bloc with which they hope to take control of cities including Antofogasta, Punta Arenas and Valpara\u00edso.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is happening in Chile is happening in other countries in the world, particularly in Spain and England,\u201d said Sharp, who pointed to the rise of insurgent parties including Ukip and Podemos, and widespread disillusionment with traditional politics. </p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t trust or feel close to the large political coalitions and are looking for new alternatives. The economic and social models didn\u2019t bring the social wellbeing that was promised.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

The turnout was 26%.</p> <p>The Conservatives, Greens, Ukip and the Liberal Democrats did not field a candidate as a mark of respect to Cox, leaving the path clear for a Labour win. However, nine fringe candidates \u2013 many from far-right parties \u2013 did stand.

She said she had met many people who did not usually vote Labour, but had done so this time as \u201ca reaction to some of the fringe parties who chose to try and use this tragic byelection as an opportunity to sow division\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Jo will be proud tonight of our community. We have shown that we stand together with one voice choosing unity and hope.\u201d</p> <p>Liberal Democrat president Baroness Brinton congratulated the Labour victor, adding: \u201cThis is an election we wish had never happened and this is why the Liberal Democrats decided not to stand. Parliament, public life more widely and a young family were robbed of Jo Cox. She was a strong, brilliant voice for progressive politics, and we are much poorer without her.\u201d</p> <p>Brabin, who was a friend of Cox, grew up in a council flat in Howden Clough in the Batley and Spen constituency. She played Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street from 1994-97, Roxy Drake in EastEnders in 2001 and Carole in Emmerdale in 2014. Brabin has also written for shows including Heartbeat, Shameless, Family Affairs, Crossroads and Hollyoaks.</p> <p>It was Cox who first suggested to Brabin that she stand for parliament, while they were campaigning together before the 2015 general election. \u201cWhile we were going door knocking, she said, \u2018Tracy you should think about being an MP\u2019,\u201d Brabin told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/tracy-brabin-i-hope-i-can-build-on-jo-coxs-legacy\">the Guardian last month</a>. \u201cThe irony is horrid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Cox, 41, was killed outside Birstall library, where she was scheduled to hold a constituency surgery, on 16 June.

Many people tell me that modesty is perhaps my best quality, even better than my temperament.\u201d</p> <p>In a riff on what he has dubbed bias within the media, Trump brought the house down by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-plagiarism-scandal-michelle-obama\">poking fun at his wife\u2019s partly plagiarized speech</a> during the Republican national convention in July.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy wife Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case.

Nor were they amused when Trump made light of his assertion in the final presidential debate, held less than 24 hours earlier in Las Vegas, that Clinton was \u201ca nasty woman\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis stuff is all relative,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don\u2019t think so badly of Rosie O\u2019Donnell any more. In fact I\u2019m actually starting to like Rosie a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s speech was less bitter in its tone but also included a series of jokes not far removed from the attack lines she has employed against Trump on the stump.</p> <p>Clinton needled her opponent over his admiration for Russia and its president, remarking of Trump\u2019s refusal to disclose his health records: \u201cDonald Trump really is as healthy as a horse \u2013 you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.\u201d</p> <p>Of his inability to stick to teleprompters, Clinton quipped: \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re translating from the original Russian.\u201d</p> <p>Both candidates laughed along for parts of one another\u2019s remarks, but in other moments sat stoney-faced. The frostiness was uncharacteristic of previous election cycles but then so has been the tenor of the 2016 contest.</p> <p>As Trump focused on Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness, the former secretary of state honed in on his behavior toward women.</p> <p>\u201cDonald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cmaybe a five, if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,\u201d she added, in reference to the number marking the next president\u2019s place in US history.</p> <p>Her roast also nodded to the previous night\u2019s debate, in which Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">refused to endorse the US democratic process</a>, leaving open whether he would accept the outcome of the 8 November election.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing I\u2019m up here after Donald. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be OK with a peaceful transition of power,\u201d Clinton said, before tossing in a dig at Trump\u2019s running mate: \u201cAfter listening to your speech I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny you ever gave it.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s remarks were met with occasional groans but not the open show of distaste that greeted Trump. Relishing her standing with less than three weeks remaining until election day, Clinton made sure to capitalize on the moment by calling out her opponent for saying she should be drug tested prior to the final debate.</p> <p>\u201cI am so flattered that Donald thought I use some sort of performance enhancer,\u201d she said. \u201cActually I did \u2013 it\u2019s called preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the evening the collective toll of an election distinct in its ugliness separated the event from previous years\u2019.</p> <p>Even Nicholas DiMarzio, the reverend who conducted the invocation at the start of the ceremony, deadpanned: \u201cI think most of us, including Secretary Clinton and Mr Trump, are praying for this election to be over soon. So let us pray.\u201d</p> <p>Al Smith IV, the great-grandson of the late Al Smith in whose memory the dinner earned its name, cautioned the candidates in his own introduction: \u201cTonight we\u2019re all friends.\u201d</p> <p>But even Smith couldn\u2019t help himself when commenting on a race that with each passing day has never ceased to shock the public.</p> <p>\u201cDonald went up to Hillary and asked her how she was doing,\u201d Smith joked.</p> <p>\u201cHillary replied: \u2018I\u2019m fine. Now get out of the ladies\u2019 dressing room.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Just a few breaths later he skewered Trump again over the allegations of sexual assault and a lewd tape in which the former reality TV star bragged of kissing and groping women without their consent.</p> <p>\u201cDon, even though there\u2019s a man sitting next to you in a robe, you\u2019re not in a locker room,\u201d Smith told the New York developer in his hometown. \u201cSo please watch your language.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

His infamous speech railed against the \u201cmass ranks of the trade union movement\u201d and twice denounced the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.

Responding to a Dorothy Dixer on \u201cdangerous non-citizens\u201d, he delivered an anti-union rant so bizarre it could be described radical performance art.

Even if these impacts are real, then they\u2019re probably good for us. </p> <p>The era is named, of course, for the phenomenon that is Donald Trump, the Republican pick for US president whose candidacy has been defined by a loose grasp of facts, jingoistic posturing, populist rhetoric, his amazing hair and his treatment of women. </p> <p>So what are the things that might define the Trumpocene? </p> <p>Is it the point at which large numbers of people started to reject the views of large groups of actual experts \u2013 people with university qualifications and things \u2013 in exchange for the views of anyone who agrees with them? (Brexit, anyone?)</p> <p>How about that point when a critical mass of people have become convinced that they can Google their way out of the laws of physics? </p> <p>Let\u2019s go and dig for evidence of the Trumpocene.</p> <p>A few months ago, Trump gave an interview to polemicist and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who could be the angriest person on the internet. </p> <p>Jones has a regular online radio and TV show called Infowars that has expanded beyond being a vehicle for Jones\u2019s cult personality to include regular news bulletins and a line in \u201calternative\u201d health therapies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/las-vegas-shooting-false-flag-government-infowars\">Las Vegas shooting was 'false flag' operation, InfoWars founder claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones thinks that climate change is a scam being forced on us by the United Nations, which, in turn, is a totalitarian regime and kingpin of a new world order. </p> <p>The a fervent Trump supporter has told his viewers that the both US president, Barack Obama, and the Democrat nominee, Hilary Clinton, were \u201cliteral demons\u201d who smelt of sulphur.

Our top-rating radio host, Alan Jones (no relation), has said climate science is \u201cwitchcraft\u201d. </p> <p>Now, before I go on, there\u2019s a prevailing view (often expressed in the comments of this blog) that climate science deniers and oddballs like Alex Jones should be ignored. In some ways, those commenters are right.</p> <p>But then you look at the popularity of people like Jones and see that, to increasing numbers of people, they are not people to be ignored, but are paragons of fearless truth-telling.</p> <p>There\u2019s a demographic to which rhetoric from people like Jones and, more broadly, Trump, appeals. </p> <p>Jones\u2019s YouTube account has about 1.6 million subscribers and is growing.

His website, according to <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/us-media-publishers-august-2016\">SimilarWeb</a>, was getting 27m pageviews a month back in February. Now it\u2019s at 36m.</p> <p>Earlier this year Jones snagged a rare interview with the conservative blogger Matt Drudge. Jones and Drudge expressed mutual admiration. </p> <p>Drudge\u2019s news and opinion aggregator website, the Drudge Report, is a genuine web phenomenon and considered hugely influential.</p> <p>With about 1.37bn page views a month, the Drudge Report is the second-ranked media site in the United States \u2014 600m views behind msn.com but 300m ahead of Google\u2019s news page. </p> <p>The Drudge Report also tends to link to news items that disparage any action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>There\u2019s now a whole media ecosystem that climate science denialism can exist inside, where there\u2019s little scrutiny of the views of deniers. US-based sites like the Drudge Report, Infowars, Breitbart and Daily Caller are part of that ecosystem.</p> <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Roy Greenslade notes, Breitbart \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/aug/30/breitbart-takes-centre-stage-as-donald-trump-embraces-the-alt-right\">has the dubious honour of challenging Fox News\u2019s status</a> as America\u2019s most influential conservative media outlet\u201d.</p> <p>Not only is the outlet having influence, but its executive chairman, Stephen Bannon, is running Trump\u2019s campaign. </p> <p>Breitbart too is growing its audience, according to those <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/us-media-publishers-august-2016\">SimilarWeb</a> statistics.

Smith dinner, an annual Catholic fundraiser in New York City, with Hillary Clinton also in attendance. Presidential candidates have long graced the white-tie affair and roasted themselves while throwing in a few jabs at their opponents.</p> <p>But after earning a few laughs, Trump\u2019s remarks quickly devolved into a stinging indictment of Clinton that prompted jeers from the audience.</p> <p>\u201cHillary believes it\u2019s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,\u201d Trump said, nodding to the emails of her campaign chairman John Podesta that were published by WikiLeaks.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump responded to the audible boos that followed. \u201cI don\u2019t know who they\u2019re angry at, Hillary, you or I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d a voice cried out from the crowd.</p> <p>Trump pressed on, standing at a podium mere feet away from Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who served as the evening\u2019s host: \u201cFor example, here she is tonight in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did bring the house down with a rejoinder poking fun at his wife\u2019s dabble with plagiarism during the Republican National Convention in July.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy wife Melania gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case.

These viewers watched 11.8 million minutes of content, the equivalent to 22 years of view time, which illustrates the strength of the event\u2019s reach.

That is evident in the size of the crowds our campaign rallies attract, and also in the unprecedented level of engagement sparked by Mr. Trump\u2019s social media activity. According to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, more than 96 percent of presidential campaign contributions made by members of the media have gone to Hillary Clinton.
