  "<p>Donald Trump has long held that Hillary Clinton is stealing the election. But on Tuesday <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">he suggested</a> something even darker and more sinister: that his supporters resolve the issue with guns.</p> <p>Specifically, he suggested that using the constitutional right to bear arms may be the only way to stop Clinton from appointing supreme court justices should she win in November. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cAlthough the second amendment people \u2013 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Whether Trump was suggesting his supporters use their weaponry against Clinton herself or any liberal judges she might go on to appoint is somewhat open to interpretation. Most people are reading it as the former, but either way it\u2019s unacceptable and a violation of what it means to live in a free democracy.</p> <p>This is a new low even for Trump, who\u2019s been accused of inciting general violence and has verbally attacked individuals from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/smear-today-gone-tomorrow-khan-controversy-goes-over-trump-fans-hats\">Khizr Khan</a> to Rosie O\u2019Donnell. But he\u2019s never seemed to incite it against individuals \u2013 until now.</p> <p>Gabby Giffords drove home that point and the pernicious effect those words could have on the unstable, in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cWe must draw a bright red line between political speech and suggestions of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cResponsible, stable individuals won\u2019t take Trump\u2019s rhetoric to its literal end, but his words may provide a magnet for those seeking infamy. They may provide inspiration or permission for those bent on bloodshed.\u201d Those words have special meaning coming from Giffords, whose time in political office was cut short by an assassination attempt that left six dead; she survived but with a critical gunshot wound to the head.</p> <p>Now Trump is pulling the tricks he always does when he says something beyond the pale politically. He\u2019s blaming the media for getting it wrong.</p> <p>Before when he\u2019s implicitly encouraged or used the language of violence \u2013 at rallies when he\u2019s told supporters if they punch a protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/14/donald-trump-legal-fees-protester-punched-video\">he\u2019ll pay the legal bills</a>, or at campaign stops when <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/266809-trump-i-could-shoot-people-in-streets-and-not-lose-support\">he\u2019s boasted</a> murder wouldn\u2019t drive his supporters away \u2013 he\u2019s walked it back as just another quirky part of his humor. \u201cObviously it was a joke,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418283/Donald-Trump-says-joking-said-shoot-somebody-win.html\">he later said</a> of the murder brag.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s already spinning this newest threat, saying he meant that second amendment supporters could still stop Clinton\u2019s election \u2013 by voting, sillies!</p> <p>But that line, like much of his campaign rhetoric, is pure bullshit. While there\u2019s some wiggle room in other parts of his statement what\u2019s not up for debate is that he was talking about Clinton\u2019s powers after the election, if she wins \u2013 \u201cif she gets to pick her judges\u201d.</p> <p>You can\u2019t stop someone from winning democratically if they\u2019ve already won a democratic election \u2013 you have to do it criminally, and specifically, according to the rest of Trump\u2019s quote, using \u201cthe second amendment\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve no doubt that it\u2019s an unequivocal call for the use of gun violence to upend democracy and one for which Trump should not be given the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>Even more stunning than any of Trump\u2019s stunningly unpresidential behavior is that not every Republican has run straight for the hills. He even had backup from that Republican mainstay organization known as the National Rifle Association, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763110521889402880\">tweeted its support</a> for his initial statement even as it altered its meaning by claiming Trump said if Clinton gets to pick supreme court judges, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p> <p>This is not party politics as usual. This goes beyond mere polarization or the other ills of Washington. It\u2019s an attack on democracy that\u2019s as personal as it is politically vile.</p> <p>Trump was talking in thinly veiled terms about the most personal kind of attack there is \u2013 an attack on the body and specifically, an attack on the body of the first female president. </p> <p>The gendered element of it isn\u2019t lost on party leaders. Elizabeth Warren didn\u2019t mince words on Twitter this evening, saying Donald Trump\u201cmakes death threats because he\u2019s a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Traister <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/donald-trump-fraud-claims.html\">has written brilliantly</a> on the long history of powerful men like Trump who would delegitimize the ascent of women and minorities. But this \u2013 to have the nominee of a major party appear to encourage his supporters to assassinate his opponent \u2013 is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, quite likely for the simple reason that we\u2019ve never had a woman this close to the White House steps.</p> <p>Just as the birther movement that Trump helped lead was thinly veiled racism rooted in the belief that a black man couldn\u2019t possibly legitimately be the president, Trump\u2019s insistence that \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d has \u201cstolen\u201d the election thrives among those who are angry that power could be taken from them by a woman, and specifically this one.</p> <p>It\u2019s vulgar, un-American and undemocratic. And it was only a matter of time.</p>",

Hillary Clinton paid a visit earlier to a health clinic in Miami, the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in the US, and appealed to Republican leaders to convene an emergency session of Congress to pass funding to combat the mosquito-borne virus, <em>reports <strong>Sabrina Siddiqui </strong>in Washington</em>.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee used the bully pulpit of the presidential campaign to voice her frustration with lawmakers in Washington, who left town last month for a summer recess without meeting the federal government\u2019s request for funds to fight the spread of the Zika virus.</p> <p>\u201cI am very disappointed that the Congress went on recess before actually agreeing on what they would do to put the resources into this fight,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I really am hoping that they will pay attention.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton delivered her remarks following a tour of the Borinquen Health Care Center, a community clinic in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, which has borne the brunt of Florida\u2019s Zika outbreak. The state of Florida, a key battleground in November\u2019s presidential race, has been the most severely hit by the virus, which poses the greatest threat to pregnant women due to its cause of birth defects such as microcephaly.</p> <p>Clinton said she first learned of Zika in December through her daughter Chelsea, who was pregnant at the time with her second child. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up in a year and read so many more stories about babies like the little girl who just died in Houston,\u201d Clinton said, citing a fatal case of Zika-related microcephaly reported out of Texas on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cThat is just not something we should tolerate in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Obama administration requested a $1.9bn spending package several months ago, basing its figure on the needs of public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p>The request quickly devolved into partisan politics on Capitol Hill, as House Republicans instead passed a measure that included riders to overturn certain clean water regulations, restricted money for Planned Parenthood and undermined the health care law. Senate Democrats twice filibustered the House-passed proposal, which Barack Obama has also said he would veto.</p> <p>Republicans have in turn accused Democrats of blocking the necessary funding and on Tuesday took aim at Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator and Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, for voting against their Zika bill. Clinton urged lawmakers to put aside politics and advance a separate bipartisan agreement that cleared the Senate in June and would allocate $1.1bn in funding with no strings attached.</p> <p>She also took aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has ignored the Zika virus all together and told a local television station in Florida he did not need to opine on the issue because the state\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, had it \u201cunder control\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is something we need to take seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, Scott, a Republican who has endorsed the nominee, has sounded repeated alarms over the Zika outbreak. He, too, implored US lawmakers to return to Washington and address the funding gap.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government must stop playing politics and Congress needs to immediately come back to session to resolve this,\u201d Scott said on Tuesday, as Florida\u2019s health department identified four more individuals who likely contracted Zika through a mosquito bite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/zika-virus-could-be-linked-with-whole-spectrum-of-disorders\">Zika virus could be linked with 'whole spectrum' of disorders</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T17:45:41.031Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa43e0e4b03b51a99e18f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:58:24.267Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Salman Rushdie, himself no stranger to threats of assassination, has delivered his verdict on the nature of Donald Trump\u2019s remarks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the Trump flacks are now trying to confuse the issue, but Senator Murphy is clear about what Trump meant. <a href=\"https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw\">https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw</a></p>&mdash; Salman Rushdie (@SalmanRushdie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa41c6e4b0f5d064841f0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:25.772Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>US Secret Service, on Donald Trump\u2019s comments:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Secret Service is aware of the comment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa40e3e4b0f5d064841f07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:03.610Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NRA might have changed the channel a little early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763110521889402880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@RealDonaldTrump</a> is right.

So, in the interest of providing as much information as possible to American readers and voters, here are Trump\u2019s full comments regarding the Second Amendment today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hillary wants to abolish, essentially, the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day. If Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we\u2019re tied. You see what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re tied \u2018cause Scalia, this was not supposed to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years, at least, and this is what happened. That was a horrible thing, So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the second amendment.</p> <p>Now speaking to the NRA folks, who are great: when you, when you, and I tell you, so they endorsed me. They endorsed me very early. My sons are members. I\u2019m a member. If you, we can add, I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the justices, they almost go, in a certain way, hand and hand. Now the justices are going to do things that are so important. And we have such great justices. You saw my list of eleven that have been vetted and respected and have gotten great, and they, a little bit, equate.</p> <p>But if you don\u2019t do what\u2019s the right thing, you\u2019re not going to have - either you\u2019re not going to have a Second Amendment or you\u2019re not going to have much of it left. And you\u2019re not going to be able to protect yourselves, which you need. Which you need! When the bad guys burst into your hours, they\u2019re not looking about Second Amendments and \u2018do I have the right to do this.\u2019 The bad guys aren\u2019t going to be giving up their weapons. But the good people will say, \u2018oh, well, that\u2019s the law.\u2019 No, no. Not going to happen. We can\u2019t let it happen. We can\u2019t let it happen.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa3d44e4b0f5d064841ef4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:30:29.384Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump implying that the use of firearms might be adequate response to Hillary Clinton\u2019s selection of supreme court justices.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q7nk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2643266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump suggests 'second amendment people' could stop Clinton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57aa3839e4b03b51a99e18bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\">Trump suggests \u2018second amendment people\u2019 could stop Clinton</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa3cf6e4b03b51a99e18d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:29:27.584Z\">9.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/07/29/roger-stone-milo-show-trump-can-fight-voter-fraud/\">implied last month</a> to internet agitator Milo Yiannopoulos that the notion of discrediting the election as \u201cillegitimate\u201d is part of Trump\u2019s campaign strategy.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have widespread voter fraud, but the first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe needs to say for example, today would be a perfect example: \u2018I am leading in Florida.

It is not clear if he is trying to avoid debates, or merely toying with the press to create more drama.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Either way, our campaign is not interested in playing along with a debate about debates or bargaining around them.The only issue now is whether Donald Trump is going to show up to debate at the date, times, places and formats set by the commission last year through a bipartisan process. We will accept the commission\u2019s invitation and expect Donald Trump to do the same.</p> </blockquote> <p>The dates for this year\u2019s debates have been set since before Trump was a candidate, but that hasn\u2019t kept the Republican nominee from accusing Clinton of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/nfl-presidential-debates-schedule-donald-trump\">scheduling misbehavior</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWell, I tell you what I don\u2019t like.

  "<p>Cast shakeups are nothing new at <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a>, a show with a revolving door, where comedians can cut their teeth before moving on to bigger things or, well, just moving on and doing their Debbie Downer face when they appear on The $100,000 Pyramid a decade after they\u2019ve left the late night staple. (Sorry, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRealDratch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rachel Dratch</a>.) But the departure of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/08/09/snl-drops-taran-killam-jay-pharoah-cast-shakeup/88441498/\">Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah</a> still seems rather curious.<br></p> <p>The contracts for both men, who joined in 2010, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/columns/snl-jay-pharoah-taran-killam-leaving-lorne-michaels-1201833248/\">were not renewed</a>. Killam <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/tv/taran-killam-leaving-snl-interview/2/\">told Uproxx</a> that he expected to return but Lorne Michaels, the longtime executive producer of the show, must have had other ideas. (He seems to be taking it in stride and even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaranKillam/status/763009853900124160\">joking about his ouster</a> on Twitter.) Jon Rudnitsky, a featured player for one season, <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/08/saturday-night-live-jon-rudnitsky-featured-player-depart-1201800755/\">was also let go</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s an odd time to be parting ways with both men for several reasons, the biggest of which is that the cast isn\u2019t really full of breakout stars or household names like the Andy Sambergs, Kristen Wiigs and Will Ferrells of old. Along with <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/kate-mckinnon-15056\">Kate McKinnon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lesdoggg?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Leslie Jones</a>, these were two of the only standouts in a cast of relative unknowns. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft5XUalItuY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ft5XUalItuY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Taran Killam as Donald Trump. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>It makes sense for Killam \u2013 who was often in more sketches than any other player \u2013 to move on, probably to a lucrative movie career. He\u2019s already starred in films as diverse as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/the-heat-review\">The Heat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/12-years-a-slave-review\">12 Years a Slave</a> and should have plenty of opportunities ahead of him. Dumping Pharoah, however, is strange for several reasons. First of all he does the resident Barack Obama impersonation, and considering that the show will be covering politics quite a bit between its 1 October premiere and the election in November, it makes sense to have someone who can do the sitting president in the cast. Obama may be a lame duck, but he\u2019s our lame duck until January. </p> <p>Saturday Night Live has been called under fire in recent years for its lack of diversity, especially for having no black women on the cast, something that it very publicly corrected. That\u2019s why it seems odd to dismiss one of the more prominent actors of color on the roster. Pharoah is a master impressionist who can cycle through a <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/914049\">variety of black comedians</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-jay-pharoah-on-rappers-meeting/3036127\">a whole pack of rappers</a> in one sitting. If the show wants to be more in touch with a world where Kevin Hart and Jay Z are two of the biggest celebrities on the planet, ousting Pharoah seems like a bit of a fumble. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSuHLaw5g4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wbSuHLaw5g4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jay Pharoah impersonates black comedians. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>As they do every summer, SNL is scouting for talent and will be sure to hire some replacements by the fall. Picking up a person of color seems like an absolute necessity, maybe even one with an Obama impression is his (or her!) back pocket. Maybe they should rescue <a href=\"http://www.jeremydhoward.com/\">Jeremy D Howard</a>, one of the standouts from the otherwise mediocre reboot of Mad TV on the CW. Here\u2019s an outrageous idea, why not solve their diversity and visibility problems in one fell swoop and hire an underused veteran improv star, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waynebrady?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Wayne Brady</a>? </p> <p>Since we\u2019re talking about diversity, how about adding a gay male to the cast to join <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/08/09/gillian-anderson-48-birthday-kate-mckinnon-throwback-video/88444092/\">Kate McKinnon</a>, the first out lesbian cast member. There hasn\u2019t been a gay man on the program since <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/terry-sweeney-15326\">Terry Sweeney</a> in the mid-80s. Someone like Cole Escola or Drew Droege, whose YouTube impersonations of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15Afl1Fy9Y\">Bernadette Peters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-LRITaHUbI\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a> are excellent successors to Maya Rudolph\u2019s Donatella Versace, would be great additions to the cast. Also, there have still been no Asian cast members on the show ever (though Rob Schneider and Fred Armisen are both part Asian) and it definitely seems time that was rectified. Do you think buzzy comedian <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/talking-pregnancy-and-prostates-with-ali-wong.html\">Ali Wong</a> wants to do TV? </p> <p>SNL is always changing things up and nurturing the next generation of comedic talent and it\u2019s sure to find suitable alternatives to Killam and Pharoah, but with the increased pressure of the election and a slate of presidential specials on the horizon, there are some big gaps in their lineup that need filling fast. </p>",

  "<p>Some Republicans fear Donald Trump is reaching the point of no return as party stalwarts turn against him and his national poll numbers continue to plunge.<br></p> <p>Susan Collins of Maine, the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, on Monday announced her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/susan-collins-donald-trump-washington-post-op-ed-republican\">intention not to vote for her party\u2019s nominee</a>, while 50 of the GOP\u2019s former national security officials signed an open letter calling Trump the most reckless candidate in history.</p> <p>Opinion polls show Hillary Clinton consolidating a significant lead. A Fox News survey shows her up by 10 percentage points; <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clintons-lead-over-donald-trump-widens-to-9-points-poll-shows-1470347810?mod=wsj_streaming_latest-headlines\">an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> puts her nine points ahead; and a Washington Post/ABC News survey gives her a margin of eight points. Real Clear Politics\u2019 current polling average gives Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">a lead of 7.5 points</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of writing on the wall,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.wwsg.com/speakers/rick-tyler/\">Rick Tyler</a>, former spokesman for Trump\u2019s Republican primary rival Ted Cruz. \u201cThree weeks after the conventions, the candidate leading the polls usually wins. There\u2019s still a week to go until we reach that point, but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s going to move 10 points.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Three weeks after the conventions, the candidate leading the polls usually wins</p> <footer> <cite>Rick Tyler, former spokesman for Ted Cruz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are growing signs that Republicans who sense Trump cannot win might move to ostracise him, whether out of principle or self-preservation or both. Tyler added: \u201cThe peeling off is remarkable. You have a conservative, Ted Cruz, and now the most moderate Republican in the Senate, Susan Collins, not endorsing Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very problematic. You have Republicans on both ends of the spectrum distancing themselves from Trump. It represents an ideological schism; the party is substantially divided.\u201d</p> <p>A generation after the so-called \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d ensured a landslide victory for Ronald Reagan, some commentators now speculate that \u201cClinton Republicans\u201d could produce a similarly one-sided result, putting once safe states such as Arizona and Georgia into play.</p> <p>Collins, who is not seeking re-election this year, is the sixth out of 54 Senate Republicans to say they will not vote for Trump. She explained that the tipping point in her decision was his recent attacks on the family of fallen US army captain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Humayun Khan</a>. \u201cHe does not have the restraint and the consideration and the judgment and the knowledge to handle those dangerous events with which presidents are inevitably confronted,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/politics/sen-susan-collins-explains-opposition-to-donald-trump-says-he-will-make-the-world-more-dangerous/index.html\">Collins told CNN</a>.</p> <p>The senator, a close ally of Senate colleague John McCain, added that she would not vote for Clinton but had yet to decide whether to vote for the Libertarian party or write in a name on the ballot paper. \u201cI have always supported my party\u2019s nominee. That\u2019s what made this decision so difficult, but in the end I just cannot support Donald Trump. I do not believe that he is the president that we need at this time in our country\u2019s history and I believe that in many ways he is antithetical to the values of the Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>Following hard upon the joint letter from former national security officials, it was the last thing Trump needed as he tried to get his campaign back on track with a speech in Detroit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">setting out his economic platform</a>. This followed a wretched run of gaffes following a Republican national convention last month that had been billed as a moment of party unity.</p> <p>Instead, the trickle of defections threatens to turn into a stampede. Meg Whitman, the technology executive and former Republican candidate for governor in California, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/meg-whitman-endorses-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">is backing Clinton</a>. On Tuesday, William Ruckelshaus and William Reilly, former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency under Republican presidents, also endorsed the Democrat.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans have a long history of support for the environment dating back to Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cDonald Trump threatens to destroy that legacy of respect for the environment and protection of public health ... That is why as Republicans, we support Hillary Clinton for president.\u201d</p> <p>Four Republican former secretaries of state \u2013 James Baker, Henry Kissinger, Condoleezza Rice and George Shultz \u2013 have yet to announce their intentions. None responded to requests for comment from the Guardian on Tuesday.</p> <p>And Republicans facing tight congressional races in November are weighing whether to back or sack Trump. <a href=\"http://coffman.house.gov/\">Colorado congressman Mike Coffman</a> has launched a TV advert in which he promises to \u201cstand up\u201d to the nominee. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018What do you think about Trump?\u2019\u201d the Iraq war veteran says. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t care for him much.\u201d</p> <p>But some in the party argue that the divisions cannot be blamed on Trump alone. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the Guardian via email: \u201cThe cracks have been there a long time. If Trump were not the nominee you would still have tensions, they would just manifest differently (as we saw in 2012).</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s strongest argument is, \u2018the ones who are not supporting me are the very ones who created the mess I\u2019m trying to fix\u2019. There will be more defections \u2013 likely by people who didn\u2019t support Trump in the first place. For Trump he now has to figure out how to navigate around those headlines \u2013 not be creating negative ones of his own \u2013 and resecure his base support and grow it with independent voters he may have lost in the past week.\u201d</p> <p>George Ajjan, a Republican strategist, said: \u201cAs bad as the Republican convention was for Trump, he still managed to get a bounce. This suggests that there is a broad constituency for Trump\u2019s anti-establishment brand of politics, which should not be underestimated. </p> <p>\u201cBut the infighting is a major distraction. Normally a candidate seeks endorsements from neutral figures outside of his party. Clinton is doing this successfully but Trump\u2019s energy is wasted on internal rebellion. To be fair, some of these defections on the part of senators in close races reflect their own self-preservation instincts and not necessarily a systemic breakdown of party unity.</p> <p>\u201cA worst-case scenario would be a third party plucking away a prominent former Republican senator or governor as its [presidential] nominee in a bid to steal away disgruntled establishment voters. That would mean open war and a total collapse of party unity.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, a former CIA agent, Evan McMullin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">launched an independent run</a> for president in the hope of offering conservatives an alternative to Trump. He has already missed the deadline to get on the ballot in numerous states, but, as a Mormon from Utah, could hurt Trump among Republicans there.</p> <p>Even three months out, some pundits believe it is all over bar the shouting. Stuart Rothenberg, an analyst and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/09/donald-trump-needs-a-miracle-to-win/\">wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cThree months from now, with the 2016 presidential election in the rear-view mirror, we will look back and agree that the presidential election was over on Aug. 9th.</p> <p>\u201cA dispassionate examination of the data, combined with a cold-blooded look at the candidates, the campaigns and presidential elections, produces only one possible conclusion: Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump in November, and the margin isn\u2019t likely to be as close as Barack Obama\u2019s victory over Mitt Romney.\u201d</p> <p>But one recent ray of light for Trump came when he was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/07/politics/george-p-bush-donald-trump-jeb-bush\">endorsed by George P Bush</a>, the Texas land commissioner and son of former candidate Jeb Bush, who clashed bitterly with Trump during the Republican primaries. </p> <p>And Trump\u2019s campaign can still hope that he will be viewed as the lesser of two evils by those who have long been hostile to Clinton. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief strategist, issued an email headed \u201cWe Can\u2019t Afford The Consequences Of A Clinton Presidency\u201d, which spent 10 paragraphs attacking her record and only mentioned Trump in the final sentence.</p> <p>The nominee himself suggested on Tuesday there would be no major shift of strategy. \u201cI think it\u2019s just, you know, steadiness,\u201d Trump told Fox Business. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>",

And here I am playing an alpha male with racist and misogynistic views.\u201d</p> <p>With so many US tourists visiting Edinburgh for the festival, Jay said he hoped his satire would be a release valve. At the end of every show, he asks for a show of hands from those who intend to vote for him; he has yet to have any Trump fan reveal themselves.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe show features so many of the ludicrous things he has said and presented as fact \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-wall-mexico-border\">Isis wants to take over the Vatican</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">calling Hillary Clinton the devil</a>.

Social conservatives of the pro-life, pro-gun, pro-not-gay marriage variety eventually landed with Ted Cruz. Then there were the unexcitable moderate types who limped along quietly behind John Kasich to the bitter end, hoping for some sort of divine intervention in Cleveland that never happened. </p> <p>Last but not least, there was the remaining pissed off 30 to 40% of the GOP, the angry, white, middle-class Americans who wanted a narcissistic, sociopathic, Mexican-hating, baby-expelling, parents-of-a-dead-war-hero-offending, (I\u2019ll stop there even though there\u2019s so much more) reality TV star. </p> <p>Then after Trump won the Indiana primary, when every other candidate dropped out, GOP \u201cleaders\u201d decided that rather than stand on principle and forever lose the Trumpsters, who make up about a third of the party, they would throw their half-hearted, afraid-to-say-his-name-in-public support to \u201cthe nominee.\u201d </p> <p>They justify their support by saing things like, \u201cWe have to protect the supreme court from Hillary Clinton\u201d and citing a list of potential nominees that some junior Trump staffer lifted off the Heritage Foundation\u2019s website.

He and his campaign aides talked privately of being the Reagan of the left: a transformative figure who would leave an indelible legislative mark at home and restore America\u2019s position on the world stage.</p> <p>With his appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, Obama could break the Republican party as a national force. With his appeal to minority voters \u2013 a rapidly emerging majority across the country \u2013 he could lock in the fastest growing demographics that could turn red states blue.</p> <p>So the GOP leadership chose to make Obama unacceptable, unpalatable and un-American. On the night of his first inauguration, House Republican leaders met at a Washington steakhouse to plot their path back to power. They would not reform their policies or consider the root cause of their defeat. Instead, they would oppose Obama on everything, well before he tried to pass a giant stimulus bill or healthcare reform.</p> <p>They needed to deny him a reputation for bipartisanship and mainstream politics, and they succeeded. He wasn\u2019t reasonable; he was an ideologue. His vision of healthcare reform wasn\u2019t a free-market system based on Republican plans; it was a socialist takeover that would destroy the American way of life. He was inviting terrorist attacks on the homeland, not hunting down Osama bin Laden. He was acting in unconstitutional ways because he wasn\u2019t really American at all.</p> <p>The party of Sarah Palin, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Roger Ailes had turned him into their own kind of freak.</p> <p>Before he finished his second year in office, Obama was such an object of Republican loathing that the Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell could say \u2013 with impunity \u2013 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d</p> <p>If your political priorities are the total defeat of a single politician \u2013 not the advancement of your own policies through debate or legislation \u2013 then you are already in pretty desperate shape. You render it impossible to compromise with your opponents, and you fan the flames of extremism that will burn anyone in the center.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/donald-trump-hand-size-hollywood-reporter-madame-tussauds\">It's a fact: Trump has tiny hands. Will this be the one that sinks him? | Dave Schilling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You also look weak and foolish when you lose, surrendering the stage to someone who can vilify his opponents better than you. So don\u2019t look dazed and confused at Donald Trump when he runs your playbook more convincingly than your own team. It\u2019s too late to fret about endorsing his kooky positions \u2013 like deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, treating all Muslims as enemies and blowing up the deficit \u2013 when they are only logical extensions of your own.</p> <p>After eight years of conservative caricature, you may be forgiven for thinking that Obama is a Kenyan Muslim socialist with terrorist sympathies and job-destroying policies on healthcare and bank regulation.</p> <p>Of course, if you live inside the echo chamber of Fox News and rightwing talk radio, you have to ignore the pesky fact that unemployment now stands at 4.9%. That\u2019s lower than when Reagan left office in 1988, and it\u2019s lower than when Bill Clinton won re-election in 1996.</p> <p>The rate stood at 8.3% in Obama\u2019s first full month in office, and not much below that when he won re-election. For a president with a job-killing economic plan, that\u2019s not a shabby performance.</p> <p>Sure enough, Obama\u2019s approval ratings (52%) are almost identical to Reagan\u2019s in August 1988 (53%) and a dramatic contrast to those of George W Bush (32%) in 2008. One of these Republican presidents was succeeded by his own vice-president; the other was succeeded by Barack Obama.</p> <p>This should lead to some serious soul-searching inside the Republican party. Not a post-mortem about how to reach out to Latino voters, but a dismantling of the politics of personal destruction, and the creation of a new, hopeful agenda that can appeal to the mainstream.</p> <p>Instead, the only point of unity inside the GOP is its gleeful hatred of Hillary Clinton, and its thinly veiled disdain for a nominee who has yet to find a politician he can\u2019t insult.</p> <p>The Republican party did not entirely fail to destroy Barack Obama. For a few years, aided by the great recession, they almost succeeded. But then they contrived to revive him by nominating a man who would destroy everything Obama stood for, along with much of the free world as we know it.<br></p> <p>The rise of Trump has led, perversely, to the revival of Obama. Republican candidates are saying they will not vote for their presidential nominee, and the party\u2019s national security officials are lining up to condemn Trump as a reckless danger to the Republic. How could the incumbent not look like a statesman compared to a man who apparently can\u2019t be trusted with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/politics/trump-elevator-rescue/\">the elevator button</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">never mind a nuclear one</a>?</p> <p>Inside the White House, Obama\u2019s aides talk about a president liberated from previous constraint. On the trail, and at the podium, he seems to love campaigning against his orange nemesis. His party\u2019s candidates can\u2019t get enough of him, and his potential successor \u2013 instead of putting distance between them \u2013 believes Obama doesn\u2019t get enough credit for his economic achievements.</p> <p>This one-term president is having an unusually successful end to his second term, and for that he can thank the Republicans who were so determined to destroy him.</p>",

I agree that the health of the media is at risk. Much of what I value was encapsulated by Malcolm X when he said that what African Americans needed was not training but education, and that the former was equivalent of teaching a dog a circus trick, while the latter taught people how to think.</p> <p>Thinking requires time. It is not consistent with a five-second attention span. If we have no ability to comprehend that truth ought to have priority over lies, then we are in deep trouble.</p> <p>If we fail to understand the difference between learning how to think for ourselves and obeying orders, between reading a considered piece of journalism and relying on the latest Facebook offering, will we be able to discern the difference between fact and fantasy?</p> <p>We do need expert and honest witnesses who speak truth to power without fear or favour. We also need thinking citizenry, not well-trained circus dogs. We need time to think. We need these things to be able to protect our democracies. We need them to be fully human.</p> <p>If we value democracy and the rights of citizens to have opinions and individual rights, and if we value the difference between fact and fiction, we must support our media so that it can continue to speak truth to power on our behalf, and do its best to keep us informed.<br><strong>Lavinia Moore</strong><br>Aldgate, South Australia</p> <h2><strong>Exploitation is the culprit</strong><br></h2> <p>No it is not globalisation that causes \u201cless affluent, less educated, mainly white people\u201d to feel themselves marginalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-show-trial-republican-convention-built-on-anger\" title=\"\">(29 July)</a>. Poor whites feel marginalised because they are poor and marginalised, not by globalisation but by the exploitative economy that drives it at whatever human cost.</p> <p>The beggar-your-neighbour system that its friends and foes call capitalism enables those with wealth to buy up whatever human and other resources they can turn to profit, and drop them when they can\u2019t.

On Saturday, Rigell told the New York Times he would vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and earlier last week Hanna said he would vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Both Rigell and Hanna have said they intend to retire after this term, and Collins does not face re-election this fall.

It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies.\u201d</p> <p>Collins also responded to assurances from Trump\u2019s campaign and some Republican leaders that Trump would soften his tone in the general election, and cease criticizing party members and minorities. \u201cThere will be no \u2018new\u2019 Donald Trump,\u201d she wrote, \u201cjust the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat.\u201d</p> <p>Maine\u2019s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">endorsed Trump</a>, and the candidate himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft9oujWos64\">held a rally in Portland</a>, Maine, last week, despite the state\u2019s long history of voting Democratic in general elections.

Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/politics/republican-national-security-letter-donald-trump-election-2016/\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would but the nation\u2019s security at risk.

Nevertheless, in 2014, the most recent year on record, federal, state and local governments spent $416bn on infrastructure, including $96bn from the federal government, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an increase from previous years.</p> <p>These figures dwarf spending on refugee resettlement, according to the nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/the-u-s-refugee-resettlement-program-a-primer-for-policymakers.aspx\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, which found that the Office of Refugee Resettlement spent $1.56bn in the fiscal year of 2015.</p> <p><strong>\u201cDetroit has per capita income of about $15,000, about half of the national average.\u201d</strong></p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US2622000-detroit-mi/\">the Census\u2019 American community survey</a>, Detroit\u2019s per capita income in 2014, the most recent year on record, was $14,810, which is just over half the national<strong> </strong>per capita income of the past 12 months, $28,555.

It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national-security salon<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland-security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon undersecretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over Trump posture toward Russia -- the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager Paul Manafort has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump.</p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, who has let his antipathy to Trump be highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence. So did George W Bush\u2019s White House Iraq and Afghanistan adviser, Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, who is held in high esteem amongst congressional Republican internationalists.</p> <p>The new letter also contains harsher language than the old. While the March letter compared Trump to a \u201cracketeer,\u201d the new one flatly says Trump \u201clacks the temperament to be President.\u201d It also calls into question his fitness to wield \u201ccommand of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnlike previous Presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHe continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has also sought to cast a spotlight on Trump\u2019s competence to be commander-in-chief as voters grow increasingly alarmed over national security. The Democratic National Convention featured a cadre of generals, admirals and former officials from Republican administrations making the case against Trump in primetime, honing in on his erratic behavior and wayward statements on US foreign policy.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign also released a video stringing together clips of both national security officials and former Republican presidential candidates, from Mitt Romney to Marco Rubio, stating that Trump was fundamentally unqualified to be president and should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ed45e4b0f5d06484198a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:36:39.628Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump sought to regain momentum with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">an economic speech</a> in which he floated new tax breaks and cuts to regulation, as protesters repeatedly interrupted him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He told the Detroit Economic Club, a traditional venue for political candidates to discuss their economic vision, that his plan would include imposing a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations, and reducing rates for income and corporate taxes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8dbd7e4b03b51a99e12f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amber-jamieson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:21:09.058Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Currently the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=mobilebar&amp;v=1#now\">New York Time\u2019s Fiverthirtyeight blog</a> has Clinton\u2019s odds of winning the election - if it was held today - at 94%.
