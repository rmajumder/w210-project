  "<p>\u201cIt looks like remain have won,\u201d Nigel Farage said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/voters-still-divided-as-eu-referendum-polls-close\" title=\"\">as the polls closed on 23 June</a>. To concede defeat on the brink of victory was one of the outgoing Ukip leader\u2019s more erratic actions. Another was the decision to stand down over the party\u2019s weak showing in the 2015 general election and then, days later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\" title=\"\">retract the resignation</a>. The implication was that Ukip could not survive without Mr Farage but also that Mr Farage could not imagine life after Ukip.</p> <p>He must be glad that he waited another year before quitting again. He now leaves bathed in the glory of a referendum result that he strived for years to achieve, while washing his hands of responsibility for the consequences. He gets invited to appear as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">the exotic support act</a> at a Donald Trump rally. But he does not have to resolve the&#xa0;question of Ukip\u2019s purpose now that its best-known mission has been accomplished. That&#xa0;task falls to his successor, elected over a&#xa0;two-week period beginning on 1 September.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the need to ponder the party\u2019s place in post-referendum Britain has not been a feature of the Ukip contest so far. Petty factional bickering has instead been the dominant motif. The victor seems likely to be either <a href=\"http://www.dianejamesmep.com/\" title=\"\">Diane James</a>, currently an MEP, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaduffy1968\" title=\"\">Lisa Duffy</a>, a Cambridgeshire councillor. In policy terms, their pronouncements have been unremarkably Faragist. James praises Vladimir Putin; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/ukips-lisa-duffy-wants-to-ban-muslim-veil-in-public-venues\" title=\"\">Duffy decries intrusions of Islamic faith</a> into public space.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the contest, the trajectory of Ukip is towards more aggressive fomenting of rage, paranoia and xenophobia. The practicalities of Brexit will demand some compromise by the government, against which Ukip will rail. Yet even a thorough severing of relations with the continent will not end migration from overseas, reverse demographic change established over decades or transform economic opportunities for people currently without the qualifications or skills to find security in&#xa0;a&#xa0;competitive labour market.</p> <p>So the economic and cultural drivers of Ukip support will not be removed by any form of Brexit, while the proxy of blaming everything on Brussels will be less available. So new scapegoats will be found. A narrative of Brexit betrayal will take hold. And Euroscepticism is likely to congeal into more pungent nationalism. How far that project can go depends in part on the skill of the leader. At the top of his game, Mr Farage had a knack for packaging poisonous messages in media-friendly banality. He was dangerous because he knew how to push incrementally at the boundaries of tolerable discourse, smuggling far-right idiom into the mainstream. He was also lucky to have David Cameron as a foil \u2013 a Tory leader who was distrusted by many of his party\u2019s core supporters and who yielded to Europhobic pressure whenever it was applied.</p> <p>Mr Farage\u2019s successor will have an equivalent opportunity to capitalise on Labour\u2019s turmoil. In the 2015 general election, <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-ukip-tipping-point/\" title=\"\">Ukip came second to Labour</a> in scores of seats, many coinciding with areas of high support for Brexit. A dysfunctional Labour opposition, perceived in its former heartlands as soft on immigration and queasy around patriotism, could be savaged by a well-organised nationalist challenger under shrewd, charismatic leadership. Judging by the Ukip contest thus far, that is&#xa0;mercifully&#xa0;not imminent.</p> <p>There is some potential for Faragism to grow stronger in Britain without Farage. There is also a chance that Ukip will implode in acrimony and slink back to the fringe. The best-case scenario is one in which the parties of the mainstream develop strategies for addressing the resentments that give succour to virulent illiberal reaction. Although the referendum result expressed a depth of grievance with the EU, it would be naive to think that EU membership was the root cause or that Brexit will dissipate all of the pent-up rage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/forget-nigel-farage-people-ukip-exploits\" title=\"\">against \u201cestablishment\u201d politics</a>.</p> <p>Referendum victory has disoriented a party that was fuelled by perpetual frustration. Referendum defeat would have better fitted Ukip\u2019s familiar modus operandi. The future was clearer as the victim of a conspiracy than as the victor with nothing left to say. A party of perpetual protest that gets what it wants has to find other things to protest against. Ukip will now seek to reboot its campaign against liberal values, tolerance and diversity in Britain. That project can only succeed if other parties indulge and accommodate the new leader, repeating the mistakes that gave Mr Farage\u2019s tenure the happy ending even he hadn\u2019t dared to expect.</p>",

At the start of the senate impeachment process in May, Rousseff was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/dilma-rousseff-brazil-president-impeached-senate-vote\">defeated by 55 votes to 22</a>, which was just one above the 54 that will be needed in the final vote. Newspaper forecasts suggest there has been little progress since then in swaying senators to switch sides, but Rousseff\u2019s supporters have not given up hope of a last-minute reprieve and promise to fight to the end.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere will be a very strong debate because all sides are tense,\u201d one senator, Vanessa Grazziotin, told local media in a warning that Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the upper house would not let the president go quietly \u201clike a lamb to the slaughter\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In the early years of her presidency, she was one of the most popular leaders in the world, with approval ratings of 92%. But Rousseff, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-fight-congress-vote\">poor communicator who presided over several years of decline and upheaval</a>, has become deeply unpopular with the electorate and for much of the past year her approval ratings have hovered around 10%. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Many of her allies, including the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, have been implicated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-government-crisis-briefing-dilma-rousseff-lula-petrobas\"><em>Lava Jato</em> investigation into corruption at Petrobras</a>, which has tainted almost all of the major parties. As a former energy minister and head of her party, critics say, Rousseff should have known what was going on, but she has not been charged.<br></p> <p>Instead, she is being impeached for window-dressing government accounts before the last election by issuing decrees on spending without congressional approval and waiting several months to reimburse a state-owned bank for a low-interest financing scheme for family farmers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Senators must decide if this is a \u201ccrime of responsibility\u201d that merits removal from office. Rousseff\u2019s lawyers claim the argument against her is more political than legal. Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous national and regional administrations, but they are a pretext to remove a leader who has struggled to assert her authority.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There are widespread concerns about the way she has been elbowed out of power by her former running mate, Temer, who conspired against her even though he, as former vice-president, bore a similar share of responsibility for failed economic policies and widespread corruption.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Opinion polls suggest the interim president is almost as despised as his predecessor. \u201c<em>Fora Temer!</em>\u201d (Temer out) placards were prominently displayed during the Olympics. He was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/rio-2016-olympic-controls-freedom-of-speech-brazilian-judge-protests\">loudly booed during the opening ceremony</a>, which was attended by far fewer foreign leaders than London 2012 or Beijing 2008 \u2013 a sign of international unease about the political situation in Brazil.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This was highlighted on Thursday by an open letter signed by 22 prominent overseas figures, including Stephen Fry, Naomi Klein, Noam Chomsky, Oliver Stone, Arundhati Roy and Alan Cumming.<br></p> <p>In a declaration of concern about the installation of an unelected government, the authors said: \u201cThe legal basis for the ongoing impeachment is widely questionable and there is convincing evidence showing that the main drivers of the impeachment campaign are trying to remove the president in order to stop corruption investigations in which they themselves are involved.\u201d</p> <p>When she makes an initial 30-minute address to the Senate from 9am, Rousseff is expected to present evidence for this claim. She has previously noted that the impeachment process was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/brazil-lower-house-speaker-eduardo-cunha-resignsimmediately\">launched by the former house speaker Eduardo Cunha</a> after the Workers party refused to protect him from corruption and perjury accusations in the congressional ethics committee. Tapes of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/brazil-dilma-rousseff-plot-secret-phone-transcript-impeachment\">secretly recorded conversations</a> have also revealed that Temer\u2019s most powerful ally in the upper house \u2013 the PMDB Senate leader Romero Juc\u00e1 \u2013 was plotting to oust Rousseff because he wanted to curtail the <em tabindex=\"-1\">Lava Jato</em> investigation, which implicated him and dozens of other politicians in the multibillion-dollar corruption scandal at the state oil company Petrobras.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Following the president\u2019s statement, senators will begin their interrogation. It is likely to be a noisily partisan affair. Up to 20 supporters from each side will be invited into the chamber. Rousseff\u2019s allies will include Lula, the former president, senior ministers and the musician Chico Buarque, who has been prominent at many anti-impeachment rallies. Their opponents will include leaders of the <em tabindex=\"-1\">Vem Pra Rua</em> (take to the streets) campaign and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/24/brazil-activists-march-free-markets-margaret-thatcher-rand-paul\">libertarian <em tabindex=\"-1\">Movimento Brasil Livre</em></a> (Free Brazil Movement). <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Several questions \u2013 including the first of the session from Kati\u00e1 Abreu \u2013 will come from allies, which will provide an opportunity for the president to highlight the positives of her time in office. Since the Workers party gained power in 2003, tens of millions of Brazilians have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/brazil-bolsa-familia-decade-anniversary-poverty-relief\">moved out of poverty thanks to \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">bolsa familia</em>\u201d welfare payments</a>, increased access to education and \u2013 until the last few years \u2013 a strong economy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She will also declare once again her innocence of any crime. Her supporters also emphasise that Rousseff has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\">a far cleaner record than that of many of her accusers</a> in both the lower and upper house.</p> <p>Last week, the Workers party senator Gleisi Hoffmann told the upper house that \u201cno one here\u201d had the moral ground to judge Rousseff.

He was until recently chief executive of a marijuana marketing company and if elected would delist the drug as a class one narcotic.</p> <p>Citing a scenario familiar to watchers of the HBO satire Veep, Wallace asked if Johnson\u2019s aim was to keep Clinton and Trump below the 270 electoral-vote threshold for winning the presidency, which would throw the race into the House of Representatives, a polarised body in which a one-state-one-vote ballot might give Johnson the presidency on a second ballot.</p> <p>\u201cWell, the object is to win outright,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not impossible that if we go into the presidential debates with the polarisation of Clinton and Trump that we might actually run the table on all this. And I\u2019m talking about me and Bill Weld, two former Republican governors re-elected in heavily Democrat states.\u201d </p> <p>Johnson was governor of New Mexico, Weld of Massachusetts. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-iowa-republican-red-state\">Welcome to Iowa, where Trump's purple patch could turn a blue state red</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any arguing that we did make differences in our state[s] being fiscally conservative, socially inclusive,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cI\u2019ll add to that, that we\u2019re really skeptical about intervening militarily to achieve regime change that I think has resulted in a less-safe world. </p> <p>\u201cSo I think that we represent about 60% of Americans with that philosophical belief.\u201d</p> <p>A difficult exchange followed on Johnson\u2019s policies on immigration, tax, a balanced federal budget and the use of American force, the candidate repeating that he was \u201cnot getting elected dictator or king\u201d and Wallace countering that \u201cwhen you say we\u2019re not going to be elected dictator, you\u2019re saying, \u2018Don\u2019t take my policies seriously because they won\u2019t get through.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Undaunted, Johnson closed by emphasising his optimism.</p> <p>\u201cYou know how crazy this election cycle is,\u201d he said. \u201cI might be the next president.

A Morning Consult survey <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/08/28/trump-gains-ground-clinton-black-voters-still-wary/\">released</a> on Sunday found Clinton leading by only three points, 43-40, in a head-to-head matchup. The same poll found her ahead by nine points at the start of the month.</p> <p>No such tightening was visible in polling averages, however, which have steadily <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">described</a> a Clinton lead of between six and eight points since the conclusion of the national conventions. This squares with a Quinnipiac <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us08252016_U88mxwn.pdf\">survey last week</a> finding that 90% of likely voters have already made up their minds.</p> <p>The defibrillator now attached to the Trump campaign is in some ways plain to see. In the past two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">the campaign leadership has been remade</a>, the candidate has redoubled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">outreach to non-white voters</a> and the campaign has spent its first millions on TV ads in battleground states.</p> <p>A shift by Trump on immigration, particularly given the influence of Hispanic voters in a number of battleground states, would seem of a piece with those changes. But a day after Trump ran through a number of proposals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">in a speech at an Iowa fundraiser</a> \u2013 but did not mention deportation \u2013 his top surrogates insisted he had not shifted on the issue.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear, nothing has changed about Donald Trump\u2019s position on dealing with illegal immigration,\u201d Indiana governor Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s running mate, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cHe put this issue at the center of this presidential campaign in the Republican primaries, and his position and his principles have been absolutely consistent.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, New Jersey governor Chris Christie said of Trump: \u201cThis is a guy who\u2019s been very consistent on no amnesty, no legalization, for folks who have been coming to the country illegally.\u201d </p> <p>Christie denied that he had personally advised Trump to moderate on immigration, as former the New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_christie_urged_trump_to_soften_on_deporta.html\">told</a> a reporter last week.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s perceived backing down last week from his \u201cdeportation force\u201d proposal has inspired unease among some of his most vocal supporters.

  "<p>As the current election cycle heads into its grueling 10,000th week (with a scant 700 more before the election) the campaigns of human hellmouth Donald Trump and presidency-seeking robot Hillary Clinton are both hard at work grinding for cash to stay afloat. While the larger cash injections to these campaigns seem to come from a complicated web of corporate pals, shady oligarchs and people who owe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/clinton-foundation-bill-hillary-us-election-state-department\">Clinton Foundation</a> a favor, they\u2019re not above seeking a couple bucks from the average Joe, either. Thus, for many Americans, quickly identifying and moving contribution-seeking emails into trash or spam folders has become as much a part of their morning routine as a first cup of coffee. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/libertarian-gary-johnson-president\">Libertarian Gary Johnson: crazy election cycle means 'I might be next president'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be blunt, these emails are weird as hell. They\u2019re frequently formatted in a style that\u2019s a little too similar to those scheming spam messages seeking your help to unlock an enormous African fortune held in place by international banking regulation, or promising longer lasting, more satisfying boners. The caps are locked, the graphics are lo-fi. A recent message from DCCC.org features splashes of red, green, and blue highlighting, and opens with a single-sentence paragraph: \u201cWe\u2019re freaking out.\u201d</p> <p>I get that the choice of words there is supposed to come off as relatable to the casual constituent, and scary enough to motivate donations \u2013 but isn\u2019t the idea of congressmen \u201cfreaking out\u201d a little upsetting? Hey, DCCC, \u201cfreaking out\u201d is reserved for college freshmen who just found out their roommate\u2019s cousin dated the drummer from Twenty One Pilots in 2006. We\u2019re counting on you chumps to govern us. You only get to publicly freak out when you either discover that an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth or your email gets hacked. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>Emails from the Clinton campaign are a bit nicer and more polished. I received one the other day purporting to be a personal note from Hillary that opened: \u201cFriend \u2013I\u2019ll keep this short because I know how much you already do for this team.\u201d</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that nice? We\u2019re friends; she knows I don\u2019t have all day to read emails; she\u2019s recognizing what I\u2019ve already done to service her commitment to the idea that she deserves to be president. </p> <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s latest messages offer an interesting incentive to donors \u2013Executive Membership. There\u2019s a graphic of a gold card that says \u201cTrump\u201d at the top, and at the bottom it has Trump\u2019s signature over \u201cAuthorized by the future President of the United States\u201d. Pretty cool, right? And get this \u2013 normally there\u2019s a one-time induction fee of $100, but for a limited time only they\u2019re slashing rates and offering the deal for the low, low price of 35 bucks.</p> <p>So the list of things the Trump campaign has in common with a late-night infomercial now includes: a cheap, garbage product you absolutely don\u2019t need; a spokesperson who is either feigning enthusiasm for cash or actually soulless; multiple vague promises to improve the quality of your life with little to no evidence the product can do what it claims; and limited time, low, low prices if you act fast.</p> <p>The only problems with the Trump campaign Executive Membership (beyond that it involves giving money to Donald Trump, the worst thing to happen to North America since \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 the Jamestown settlement?) is that it isn\u2019t clear what the membership gets you. It\u2019s not even clear if you get that golden card.</p> <p> That\u2019s a big mistake. The Trump campaign needs to offer its Executive Members some perks. How about offering cardholders personalized messages explaining what Trump <em>meant to say </em>after each public statement and a strand of Mike Pence\u2019s weirdly brittle hair to use as a lockpick? And why stop there? How about a Super Executive Membership for $50, which could entitle members to a free consultation with a Trump campaign attorney following any violence they take part in at an authorized Trump rally? At the top level, there could be a Huge, Fantastic Membership, where for just $1,000 Trump will take you on a personal tour of the Kremlin.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get any contribution emails from third-party or independent candidates, because none of those people will ever be president and my time on Earth is ultimately finite, but I\u2019d be willing to guess that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/libertarian-gary-johnson-president\">Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson\u2019s</a> emails arrive totally blank, allowing recipients the freedom to decide how the text should appear.

  "<p>It\u2019s far easier to start a war than stop one, especially when the conflict has lasted longer than many people have been alive, making peace an unfamiliar prospect. </p> <p>But Colombians showed the world this week that it can be done. After 52 years of hostilities, the Colombian government and leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the Farc, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/colombia-government-farc-rebels-peace-deal-52-year-war\">finalised a deal to end their war</a>.

So how did they get there this time and what lessons are there for Syria and other nations in conflict? </p> <h2><strong>Make peace with who you can when you can</strong></h2> <p>Former president C\u00e9sar Gaviria recently recalled that his son had once asked him how peace would be achieved in Colombia. \u201cIn bits and pieces,\u201d he told him.

The AUC, a federation of rightwing paramilitary militia groups \u2013 which fought the Farc as a proxy of a then-weak military \u2013 demobilised in the early 2000s.</p> <h2><strong>It helps if one side has the upper hand </strong></h2> <p>In the 1990s, flush with proceeds from Colombia\u2019s booming drug trade, the Farc had Colombia\u2019s military on the run. The rebels, who numbered about 18,000, seemed to be winning the war.

As Uribe\u2019s defence minister, Santos had overseen many of those operations and had been expected to continue the same policies. Instead, recognising the opportunity to finish what he had started, he persuaded the Farc to begin peace talks.</p> <h2><strong>Incentive</strong></h2> <p>Both the Farc and the government understood that neither side had won and neither had been defeated. That meant both sides had to make compromises at the negotiating table. Trying to establish how far each side was willing to go on each point kept the negotiators busy for four intense years. </p> <p>The Marxist Farc gave up their demand for comprehensive agrarian reform and agreed to sever all ties to drug trafficking, a business that had made them hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f5d19097194ab18366cb2175f4b42a7c5c1241a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f5d19097194ab18366cb2175f4b42a7c5c1241a/33_111_4003_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Colombian government signs the peace accord with the Farc.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Colombian government signs the peace accord with the Farc.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ernesto Mastrascusa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government, in exchange, granted the Farc access to political power, by guaranteeing they will hold 10 seats in Congress in 2018, even if the political party they will create does not get enough votes in the legislative elections that year. </p> <p>And the Farc leaders, even those who carried out kidnappings, indiscriminate attacks on civilians and forced recruitment of minors, can avoid jail time by confessing their crimes and serving \u201calternative sentences\u201d such as long-term community service.</p> <h2><strong>Timing</strong></h2> <p>Armed struggles have fallen into disfavour throughout Latin America, once a hotbed of insurgencies. A decade ago, leftist leaders were in power across the region. In Brazil and Uruguay, former leftist guerrillas had become presidents through the ballot box. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who started his self-styled socialist \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/04/venezuela-election-bolivarian-revolution-maduro\">Bolivarian revolution</a>\u201d, was consolidating himself in Venezuela. Those regional references gave the Farc confidence.</p> <p>But regional tides have shifted since then. Brazil\u2019s Dilma Rouseff is facing impeachment, Ch\u00e1vez succumbed to cancer three years ago and his successor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/the-guardian-view-on-venezuela-chavismo-fights-for-survival\">Nicol\u00e1s Maduro</a>, has driven the country into the ground. These are hard times both for the left and for the revolutionaries.</p> <h2><strong>Mood </strong></h2> <p>Societies don\u2019t stand still.

Almost a year on he may win the Hawkeye State in the presidential election.<br></p> <p>Republicans have only won Iowa once since Ronald Reagan \u2013 in 2004, when George Bush eked out a win by 10,000 of more than 1.5 million votes. And yet, among the traditional battleground states, Iowa has become perhaps Trump\u2019s best hope of a win. While <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">national polls</a> show the Republican far behind his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton-5597.html\">recent Iowa polls</a> have the candidates neck and neck.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s strong position is in part due to the fact that unlike in other swing states, the Iowan Republican establishment has rallied conclusively behind him. </p> <p>On Saturday at the Roast and Ride, a fundraiser featuring pork sandwiches and motorcycles held on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/03/joni-ernst-pig-castrator-iowa-win-senate-republicans\">the freshman senator Joni Ernst</a>, every major Iowa Republican was present. All three US representatives and both senators rallied behind Trump. So did Terry Branstad, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/14/meet-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-who-as-of-monday-is-americas-longest-serving-governor/\">longest-serving</a> governor in American history. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">Donald Trump politicizes death of Dwyane Wade's cousin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Trump only midway through a speech that touched on hot issues such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">immigration policy</a> and his attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">to appeal to African American voters</a>, things almost became awkward: Branstad, Ernst, congressman Steve King, lieutenant governor Kim Reynolds and state party chair Jeff Kaufmann all gathered behind the candidate, squeezing in for a photo opportunity.</p> <p>As Kaufmann told the Guardian, this rare embrace of a candidate who blew the establishment to pieces in primary season and has not dialled down his rhetoric or style since came about thanks to Iowa\u2019s vulnerable status as the state that kicks off each presidential election. </p> <p>\u201cAs a first-in-the-nation state,\u201d Kaufmann said, \u201cour folks are discerning and even our officeholders dig a little bit deeper.\u201d </p> <p>However, the real fuel for Iowa Republicans\u2019 love for Trump is to be found in the strong ties between the candidate and Branstad. The governor has long been an enthusiastic supporter and has stumped the state on thebusinessman\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign director is Branstad\u2019s son, Eric, a veteran operative who during the caucuses led a bipartisan advocacy campaign on behalf of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/iowa-caucus-corn-ethanol-republicans-democrats-ted-cruz\">the renewable fuels industry</a>. In Iowa at least, as election day approaches, Trump can count on the party machinery going into fully into gear.</p> <p>This is not to say Iowa Republicans are unfamiliar with intra-party conflict, and a vocal \u201cNever Trump\u201d contingent is to be found among those who supported Ted Cruz, the victor of the caucuses. But it receives no establishment support. Even congressmen in swing districts are happy to appear with Trump.</p> <p>In contrast, Democrats are off the pace they set in the past two election cycles, regarding organizational goals like absentee ballot requests and thanks to lingering bad blood from the caucuses, when many supporters of Bernie Sanders felt the state party chair, Andy McGuire, tilted the scales on Clinton\u2019s behalf.

Ninety-one per cent white, it was one of a handful of states where Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/nov/07/obama-reelection-senate-democrats-live\">won a majority of white voters four years ago</a>. But many of the blue-collar white voters who have traditionally voted Democratic in the eastern part of the state are increasingly attracted to Trump. </p> <p>In fading factory towns like Dubuque and Waterloo, long bastions of Democratic support, Trump\u2019s anti-free trade and anti-immigration message is increasingly finding an audience. </p> <p>In the suburbs of Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, meanwhile, he is not losing many moderate Republicans \u2013 mostly because such areas are home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/09/iowa-senator-ted-cruz-republican-presidential-caucus\">significant numbers of evangelical Christians</a>, to whom Clinton is simply anathema. If such voters do not vote for a third party candidate or stay home, Trump will be their man.</p> <p>New Trump supporters have, however, presented new challenges. Traditionally, Republican operatives scorn Democratic campaigns, which tend to be based on hiring hundreds of staffers to go door to door, getting marginal voters to sign up for absentee ballot requests. Republican voters have been far more consistent, meaning the party\u2019s campaigns have instead focused on tapping into networks of social conservatives, in particular home-schoolers. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xt4d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690131\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade's cousin \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c2a9eee4b0655f72768734\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/28/160828TrumpWade_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\">Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade\u2019s cousin \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now, with social conservatives less enthusiastic about Trump than other Republicans, the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts in Iowa must become non-traditional \u2013 in effect, Democratic-style efforts meant to turn out former Democrats. </p> <p>This shift has been buoyed by what Kauffman, the Republican Iowa state chair, sees as a \u201cresurgence of rural populism\u201d. Iowa has a long and bipartisan history of rabble-rousing, going back to the 1890s. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, farmers held dramatic strikes and even kidnapped a judge who presided over foreclosures. In parts of the state, martial law was declared. That tradition had receded, but Kaufmann has seen Trump hauling it back to the surface.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">Turned off by Trump: Republican mega-donors focus on congressional races</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republican gains are borne out in registration figures. Since November 2012, Democratic voter registration in Iowa has fallen by 15,000. In the same time, Republicans have picked up almost 20,000 voters. This effort has been helped by two strong midterm results, eradicating the Democratic bench and leaving the party holding only one of the state\u2019s four congressional seats.</p> <p>In the shifting political math of 2016, all this makes Iowa far more winnable for Trump than many traditionally more competitive states. Accordingly, his campaign has committed significant resources. It is expected that Trump will campaign in the state three or four times a month until election day. Saturday\u2019s Roast and Ride was a taster.</p> <p>Even if this is not enough, and Trump loses Iowa, the coalition he has built may point to a long-term shift which will make the state less purple and more red. As Kaufmann said, win or lose: \u201cI think we have the ingredients for a realignment.\u201d</p> <p>That was a statement with which one well-connected Democrat agreed, though he did not want to attach his name to such an opinion. As he said mournfully this weekend: \u201cIncreasingly, it seems like it is a Republican state and they just let Democrats live here.\u201d</p>",

Their meeting of minds is recounted in a movie, <a href=\"http://southsidewithyou.com/\">Southside with You</a>, which opened on Friday to mixed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/southside-with-you-review-obamas-first-date-is-before-sunset-sans-subtlety\">reviews</a>.</p> <p>The flattering portrait was released to 813 cinemas in North America, far more than first planned, after positive reaction at the Sundance film festival in January. Opinion polls showing the president\u2019s approval rating well above 50% will also have done no harm. \u201cMr Obama hasn\u2019t even left office, but the cinematic hagiography has begun,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/movies/southside-with-you-review.html\">the New York Times commented</a>.</p> <p>Written and directed by 31-year-old Richard Tanne, Southside with You stars Parker Sawyers as Barack and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/movies/tika-sumpter-southside-with-you-michelle-obama.html\">Tika Sumpter</a> as Michelle; the executive producer is the musician and Obama fan John Legend. It meanders through a series of conversations \u2013 reminiscent of Richard Linklater\u2019s Before Sunrise \u2013 against the backdrop of southside Chicago in the late 1980s. At one point, the ambitious young lawyers walk past a wall bearing the name of people killed on the city streets.</p> <p>The movie <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/17/how-true-is-southside-with-you-fact-checking-barack-and-michelle-obama-s-romantic-first-date.html\">sticks mostly to the facts</a>, although a community meeting in a church, where Obama displays his rare talent for oratory, is incorporated from a later date. Michelle, 26, asks 28-year-old Barack if he has dated white women. Tanne has said he doesn\u2019t know if this happened but imagines it probably did at some point. Valerie Jarrett, who in real life had dinner with the couple early in their relationship and is now a senior adviser to the president, does not appear.</p> <p>Some critics have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/barack-obama-takes-michelle-robinson-on-a-first-date-in-southside-with-you/2016/08/24/f2fe0544-6874-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html\">praised the film</a> and others have been lukewarm.

Another film is imminent: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5477566/\">Barry</a>, about his time as a student in New York. Should America\u2019s first black president write another memoir, a screen adaptation might be expected to follow.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with biography in general is it tends to be hagiography or denigration, in movies even more than books,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cIn general, people don\u2019t tend to want to take in the complexity.\u201d</p> <p>Obama is far from the first president to be lionised \u2013 or demonised \u2013 by Hollywood.

  "<p>In the beginning, mythology told stories about events or experiences that would otherwise leave us mystified \u2013 how the world was created, what happens after we die. The first myths were mostly optimistic fictions, but our ancestors longed to believe in them: that\u2019s how religion established its hold.</p> <p>The original myth-makers expected us to take literally God\u2019s fabulations about heaven and hell and to obey his bullying commandments. Today, less credulous, we think religion itself is a myth, by which we mean a consoling lie. In common usage, \u201cmyth\u201d is at best the word we use to refer to amusingly preposterous urban legends \u2013 tales about <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/critters/lurkers/gator.asp\" title=\"\">albino alligators in the Manhattan sewers</a> or the Holy Grail\u2019s hiding place under the floor of a Paris shopping mall.</p> <p>In our society, it is publicists, spin doctors and advertisers who devise the myths. Sometimes the aim is to exalt an imperfect human being: celebrities and even politicians need to possess \u201ccharisma\u201d, a word that originally vouched for a believer\u2019s direct contact with a divine source. Myth also invests manufactured objects with a supernatural grace or glory. In the 1950s, Citro\u00ebn\u2019s DS car came to be known as the D\u00e9esse \u2013 a goddess of sleek metal and smooth leather, so curvaceously aerodynamic that it seemed, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/roland-barthes-happy-100th-birthday-centenary-birth\" title=\"\">Roland Barthes\u2019s</a> description in <em>Mythologies</em>, to have \u201cdescended from the sky\u201d, not driven up the highway.

Or could the plane be mimicking the athletic mystique of the shoe? On its white, shiny fuselage, the proud slogan UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is underlined by a blue stripe, a counterpart to the Nike flash, which pays streamlined homage to the Greek goddess of victory. More than a means of transport, Air Force One is a propaganda tool, and its effectiveness&#xa0;depends on the implied presence of a deity.</p> <p>So long as the doctrine of American isolation prevailed, the presidency was a desk job, tethered to Washington DC. But when the US acquired global power after 1945, the president took to the air, travelling in a plane that has come to represent the ubiquity and intimidating might of this ultimate empire. Equipped with surveillance systems that eavesdrop on the lowly world it overflies, allegedly able to fire missiles and to withstand a nuclear blast, Air Force One is evidence of dominance. Even if we don\u2019t accept American superiority, we bow down before American immensity: the customised 747 currently in use is as tall as a six-storey building and as long as a football field.</p> <p>On the ground, the president travels in a black Cadillac nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d, ready to repel assailants with rocket-propelled grenades, pump-action shotguns and tear-gas cannon. Soaring aloft, he exchanges a beast for a bird: Air Force One is America with wings, a mechanised version of the beaked, pinioned eagle \u2013 a predator that clutches in its claws twin bundles of peacemaking olive branches and spiky, militarised arrows \u2013 that appears on the country\u2019s Great Seal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56a2c208567b263cdd19c1ae016a87644b2bfc8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56a2c208567b263cdd19c1ae016a87644b2bfc8a/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first President Bush, who took delivery of the current double-decker Air Force One to replace the humbler 707 he inherited from Ronald Reagan, remarked that it embodies America\u2019s \u201cmajesty\u201d. A Freudian slip, surely \u2013 republics should be unmajestic and the USA was meant to be the paradise of the common man \u2013 but not inaccurate. Air Force One is a triumphal chariot, a steroid-boosted equivalent to the golden coaches and slow-motion Bentleys in which the Queen sedately trundles along. For extra effect, Lyndon Johnson installed a hydraulic \u201cking chair\u201d on board his Air Force One, which enabled him to hover in midair as he harangued the congressmen he invited into his cabin.</p> <p>Like the country whose head of state it carries, Air Force One is exceptional \u2013 and exceptions are always made for it by air-traffic controllers, who suspend other operations to give it instant clearance. The numeral in the plane\u2019s call sign is exclusive, monopolistic, not the inception of a series; it brags of being one of a kind, rather than a first among equals. In fact that solitary integer is misleading: here is the first of the myth\u2019s little fibs. Air Force One has a duplicate that, like the vice-president, is a useful safeguard against mishaps. But to preserve the myth of American primacy, the second plane is never referred to as Air Force Two and whichever of them carries the incumbent becomes Air Force One for the duration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nuclear-football-donald-trump\">The \u2018nuclear football\u2019 - the deadly briefcase that never leaves the president\u2019s side</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George W Bush may be the only president to have used both planes on a single journey. At Thanksgiving in 2003, he flew to Baghdad, where he spent a couple of hours posing for photographs as he dished out portions of festive turkey to the troops who were fighting his war. To ensure that the trip remained secret, he retreated to his ranch in Texas for the holiday, then travelled back to Washington on the first Air Force One \u2013 though it couldn\u2019t officially be called that because he was pretending not to be on board: the trip was logged as routine maintenance. The second plane was waiting in a hangar, fuelled and provisioned for the onward flight to Iraq. With a baseball cap as his camouflage, Bush entered it by the back stairs, which no president ever uses. That skulking between planes was an odd manoeuvre, very unlike his customary strutting. Bush was playing hide and seek with his twin Air Force Ones, and duplication hints at duplicity, a cultivation of double meanings that dodges, as myth always does, between truth and falsehood.</p> <p>The plane borrows America\u2019s attributes \u2013 its size, its might, its technological supremacy \u2013 but can any president dare borrow those attributes from the plane? Although Americans proverbially describe their nation\u2019s CEO as \u201cthe most powerful man in the world\u201d, it\u2019s a hollow boast, since the only way of making that power manifest is by opening the suitcase of nuclear codes chained to the arm of the military aide who accompanies the president everywhere. Power is meaningless unless it\u2019s displayed, enacted: hence Vladimir Putin\u2019s bare-chested preening or his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/putin-judo-book-russian-schoolchildren\" title=\"\">sessions of bone-crushing judo</a>. American presidents sometimes jog to demonstrate fitness, though <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2025424_2025864_2025986,00.html\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carter once embarrassingly keeled over while out for a run</a>. A president\u2019s best chance of personifying confident, aerobic America is in bounding energetically down the stairs of Air Force One. Yet the height of those stairs and their steep pitch are reminders that the presidency is a heady, hubristic office, undermined by pitfalls. In 1975 in rainy Salzburg the notoriously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlz0he9rtKw\" title=\"\">clumsy Gerald Ford slipped on the wet bottom step</a> as he deplaned and tumbled on to the tarmac, forcing his wife to shield him with an umbrella as an official tugged him upright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5040e31af859e96dd78138e9283ceb085642be6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5040e31af859e96dd78138e9283ceb085642be6f/0_0_3513_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For once avoiding risks, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination last year he relied on a gilded escalator in his New York headquarters to deposit him in the lobby where the photographers were gathered. Stairs require effort, which may be unavailing or self-defeating; an escalator \u2013 or so Trump hoped \u2013 allowed him to waft down smoothly from on high like a golden-maned angel of deliverance.</p> <p>In one respect, America\u2019s aeronautical myth has to wheedle its way around a flagrant contradiction: Air Force One carries the commander-in-chief, but he is not in command of the plane. When Barack Obama came on board for the first time, he shook the hand of the pilot and complimented him for looking the part, \u201clike Sam Shepard in <em>The Right Stuff</em>\u201d. In the film of Tom Wolfe\u2019s book about Nasa\u2019s astronauts, Shepard as Chuck Yeager breaks the sound barrier while remaining laconic, nonchalant, metaphorically down to earth. Actually, the pilot who flies Air Force One is nicknamed Top Gun during his tenure in the cockpit; it\u2019s lucky that Obama was greeted by a laidback Shepard lookalike rather than a clone of Tom Cruise, who played the hepped-up hotshot naval aviator known as Maverick in Tony Scott\u2019s film <em>Top Gun</em>.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s charmingly deferential remark joked about his own unfitness \u2013 physically at least \u2013 for the office. Americans want their head of state to be both a warlord and a saviour and these impossible expectations have turned the presidency into a myth \u2013 a starring role for an action hero rather than an exhaustingly intricate job for a fixer schooled in the art of compromise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYnVOIfNiU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jPYnVOIfNiU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYnVOIfNiU\">Watch Harrison Ford as President James Marshall in the 1997 film Air Force One.<br></a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump, when asked last December which president he most admires, did not pay the usual unctuous tribute to Lincoln, Kennedy or Reagan, but said that his role model was James Marshall. He was referring, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/12/12/donald-trump-harrison-ford-and-the-pre-911-politics-of-air-force-one/#3aa68d0651ff\" title=\"\">he explained, to \u201cHarrison Ford on the plane\u201d</a>: in Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s 1997 film <em>Air Force One</em>, Ford plays a president whose name suggests martial prowess as well as anticipating the air marshals who, after 9/11, began to travel on civilian flights, weapons at the ready. Marshall\u2019s backstory alludes to his time piloting combat choppers in Vietnam, when he received the Medal of Honor for valour in battle from one of his predecessors. He is therefore well prepared to beat up or gun down the terrorists from Kazakhstan who take over Air Force One after a summit meeting in Moscow; in an emergency he can even fly the plane himself.</p> <p>Harrison Ford\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s accolade was scornful, sad and a little anxious. \u201cDonald,\u201d he groaned, \u201cit was a movie! It\u2019s not like this in real life \u2013 but how would you know?\u201d Undeterred by protests about his infringement of copyright, Trump uses Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s embattled but rousingly brassy music from the film to underscore his campaign appearances, and when he arrived in Cleveland for the Republican convention in July he was greeted by the fanfares that accompany Ford\u2019s gung-ho bouts of fisticuffs with the hijackers. All he did was step out of his name-tagged helicopter, but Goldsmith\u2019s theme lent that act an air of unearned grandiosity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1ac364548256b0c4fbed012afd4ecb2446567be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ac364548256b0c4fbed012afd4ecb2446567be/0_0_1227_1877/654.jpg\" alt=\"The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Mcneely/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s enthusiasm is easy to understand: as <em>Air Force One </em>begins, Marshall plays the kind of president any of us might fancy being, a man for whom the executive branch and its perks are a licence to daydream. Returning to the airport in wintry Moscow, he suggests a whimsical detour on the way home: \u201cLet\u2019s go to Barbados.\u201d Here, in theory, is true power, unhindered by responsibility; the plane is a magic carpet. But once he forfeits control of Air Force One, Marshall is suddenly disempowered. Hiding from the terrorists in the luggage compartment, he finds a mobile phone with which he tries to alert the cabinet to his plight. He has to go through the White House switchboard and when he identifies himself to the woman on duty she refuses to put him through because he sounds like a crackpot fantasist. That, a year ago, is how everyone viewed Trump; real life, we now know, is not quite as reasonable or as immune to delusion as Harrison Ford hoped.</p> <p>Whatever frenzy or folly it is that impels Trump, his motive can hardly be the desire to survey the world from inside Air Force One. He already has a plane, a secondhand 757 branded with his surname along its fuselage and his cross-country trips in it have made him look prematurely presidential. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, began her campaign in April 2015 with a road trip, a reprise of the mythically intrepid expeditions of the pioneers in their horsedrawn wagons: she travelled from New York to Iowa in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/hillary-clinton-iowa-road-trip-scooby-doo-van\" title=\"\">a chauffeured and prudently armoured Chevrolet camper, </a>emerging to be photographed at fast-food outlets along the way.</p> <p>Days after she set out, Obama teased Hillary\u2019s mock-modesty at a dinner for White House correspondents. Reflecting on the economy\u2019s ups and downs, he said: \u201cI have a friend who used to make millions a year. Now she\u2019s living out of a van in Iowa.\u201d But this July he invited Hillary back on to Air Force One to fly with him to an electoral rally in North Carolina. In a tweet, Trump railed against this partisan misuse of the plane and claimed that Hillary\u2019s free trip cost taxpayers half a million dollars. Obama\u2019s gesture indeed had a solemn constitutional significance. Never before had an incumbent offered a ride to a candidate for the succession who wasn\u2019t already the vice-president; it meant, as one commentator pointed out, that Obama was \u201cready to hand over the keys to Air Force One\u201d. Perhaps that transfer should be part of the ceremony at the inauguration next January.</p> <p>Guarded by snipers and sniffer dogs in a hangar that is described as a \u201csanctuary\u201d, debarred to anyone without security clearance, Air Force One is a symptom of the privileged exclusivity that Trump the populist pretends to despise. With his customary shrewdness, he has maintained an advantage by symbolically opening his private jet to all, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74\" title=\"\">a video tour posted on YouTube.</a></p> <p>As hostess \u2013 a throwback to the days when flight attendants were described that way \u2013 he has appointed Amanda Miller, his gatekeeper in the reality show <em>The Apprentice</em>. (She first came to Trump\u2019s attention as a 15-year-old waitress at one of his golf clubs and after she graduated from college with a degree in fashion merchandising he hired her as a corporate marketer.) With one hand propped on her hip like a starlet posing on a red carpet, Miller purringly extols the plane\u2019s luxuries: seat belts plated in 24-carat gold, head rests on which the Trump family\u2019s spurious crest is embroidered, silk-clad walls for the boss\u2019s bedroom, Ultrasuede ceiling panels, mahogany cabinets, a shower cubicle. We are supposed to slaver enviously at this ostentation; if we don\u2019t, we condemn ourselves as losers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UZq3iCn2y74?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a guided tour of Donald Trump\u2019s 757.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s plane does without the emergency medical facilities secreted on Air Force One, which has an operating table discreetly stowed in a wall like a fold-up bed. Instead, Miller recommends a bouncy mohair divan (she pronounces it \u201cdive-in\u201d) in the guest bedroom. To conclude the tour she curls up on a sofa, tosses gobbets of popcorn into her mouth and relaxes with a film from Trump\u2019s on-board <em>cin\u00e9math\u00e8que</em> of a thousand movies. We hear only noises \u2013 a burst of gunfire and the clatter of broken glass: she could be watching Harrison Ford fight back against the hijackers in Petersen\u2019s <em>Air Force One</em>.</p> <p>That would not be my choice for in-flight entertainment, since the film\u2019s climax is a plane crash. With failing engines, ruptured fuel tanks and a damaged rudder, Air Force One finally lunges into the Caspian Sea and breaks apart; just in time, Ford is safely yanked on to a hovering Hercules turboprop, which, as its pilot beamingly announces while the theme appropriated by Trump blares out one last time, at once becomes Air Force One. This is how the succession works in the supposedly unmonarchical United States: the plane is dead, long live the plane.</p> <p>Obama, asked in 2012 what he might miss if he weren\u2019t re-elected, said: \u201cThe plane is really nice, it really is. It\u2019s a great plane.\u201d Now that he\u2019ll soon lose his right to it, he must dread having to take commercial flights again \u2013 a crash landing for the executive ego. Of course there are consolation prizes. When Bill Clinton left the White House, he swapped Air Force One for an aerial pleasure palace, a Boeing 757 owned by his fun-loving billionaire buddy Ron Burkle, a venture capitalist who, according to <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/bill-clinton-health-trump-and-hillary\" title=\"\">a recent article in <em>GQ,</em></a> paid Clinton $15m for his schmoozy aid in recruiting international clients; the in-flight services available on Burkle\u2019s jolly jet prompted the tycoon\u2019s employees to call it \u201cAir Fuck One\u201d. Absolute power, as Trump understands, can mean uninhibited self-indulgence.</p> <p>As Americans prepare to elect another president, a new presidential plane is on order. Last year, the air force secretary, Deborah Lee James, announced that the Boeing VC25-A currently in use would be replaced by a Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, which \u201cwhen fully missionised\u2026 will meet the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission, while reflecting the office of the president of the United States of America consistent with the national public interest\u201d.</p> <p>That sentence, which mixes aggression with evangelism by placing an execution between two missions, packs in all the contradictions of the myth that sustains the country and supplies its Messiah-like sense of purpose. But will a technological upgrade to the plane solve the problems of the presidency, which, thanks to props like Air Force One, has an aura of insuperable power, even though in practice it is limited or even enfeebled by partisan feuds and the rapid disillusionment of an electorate that wants its wishes instantly&#xa0;gratified?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2d96c3bbfb0b03a121bcde35f4d8cb7a1948d0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2d96c3bbfb0b03a121bcde35f4d8cb7a1948d0a/0_0_2009_2700/744.jpg\" alt=\"George W.

Reality flails and flounders, unable to match the myth. After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, President Bush spent the rest of the day flying to and fro between Florida and Nebraska in a sky that had been emptied of all other traffic. Secure in the \u201cmobile command centre\u201d of Air Force One, he issued no coherent commands, later shiftily explaining that he remained aloft because he didn\u2019t want to give \u201cthe bad guys\u201d the satisfaction of killing him. Air Force One keeps the president out of harm\u2019s way, but it also ensures that he remains out of touch. The shining seas and purple mountains celebrated in the patriotic hymn are far below and actual Americans remain invisible.</p> <p>\u201cThe presidential aircraft,\u201d James insisted, \u201cis one of the most visible symbols of the United States at home and abroad.\u201d True, but a plane is an odd or ominous symbol for a country, which surely consists of terrain, not airspace. Thunderous, scarily propulsive, bristling with weaponry, Air Force One encourages effusions of the wrong kind about American greatness; what\u2019s worse is that Petersen\u2019s film has made it an arena for crazed feats of derring-do by a superhero \u2013 or, with luck, by a superheroine in a nattily tailored trouser suit. The overlapping of politics and fiction is absurd, but that\u2019s no reason not to find it alarming. The very irrationality of myth makes it irresistible in a time of unease or trauma like the present: we are all at risk of being blown away by the rhetorical jet exhaust that Air Force One leaves behind it.</p> <p><em>Peter Conrad\u2019s Mythomania: Tales of Our Times, from Apple to Isis, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson next month. </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mythomania.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for the special price of \u00a315.94</em></a></p>",

Remainers might want to put their head in the sand, but the vote itself has not caused a 20% drop in property prices or most of the other&#xa0;scary things on the roster of gloomy predictions.</p> <p>But it is also true that the bounceback in consumer spending and business activity has only recovered some of the ground lost over the preceding six months. More than that, the recovery is largely a result of the devalued pound and the Bank of England\u2019s promise to stimulate the economy with another adrenaline shot.</p> <p>In the same vein as European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s \u201cready to do whatever it takes\u201d speech in the summer of 2012, which soothed the nerves of eurozone investors as Athens burned, the Bank of England made it clear in February, as soon as the vote was called by David Cameron, that it stood ready to give the economy a boost, and duly delivered on 4 August.</p> <p>A cut in the base rate to 0.25%, an extra \u00a360bn of quantitative easing and \u00a3100bn of cheap loans for banks to offset the squeeze from low interest rates was heavily trailed by the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney, albeit in the vaguest terms, giving a measure of comfort that a repeat of 2008 could be avoided.</p> <p>The real problem for Carney is that Brexit hasn\u2019t happened yet. And while David Davis and Liam Fox may yet carve out trade deals for the UK that boost trade, the betting is that in an era of globalisation and the domination of powerful trading blocs, the UK is going to struggle to attract international businesses bringing new jobs.</p> <p>Most forecasts have reduced the average growth rate over the next four years from above 2% to below 2%. If that turns out to be true, the UK will need a bit more stimulus to help it through. What does the Bank of England have to offer? What about negative interest rates?</p> <p>Neither the UK or US have allowed their central bank to charge customers \u2013 mostly commercial banks \u2013 to keep funds on deposit in the way that the ECB and Bank of Japan already do.</p> <p>Adam Posen, the former Bank interest-rate setter who is now in charge at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, has urged his former colleagues and the Fed to put aside their reluctance and adopt negative rates.</p> <p>In his defence Carney can cite warnings from the central bankers\u2019 club, the Geneva-based Bank of International Settlements, which worries that negative interest rates will hit commercial bank profits hard and undermine their ability to make loans.</p> <p>Robert Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton and head of the Sonecon consultancy in Washington, says the only reason the Fed is considering an increase in rates is to regain some firepower before the next recession. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had three quarters of annual growth at around 1%, inflation is low and productivity is around 1% when it should be above 2%, there is still more work to do,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Like many, he wants governments to use low interest rates to fund infrastructure spending and investments in schools and training. He despairs at Hillary Clinton\u2019s $275bn investment plan, which is fully funded from tax rises and savings in government spending. This money should be borrowed at the current ultra-cheap rates \u2013 not least because a policy of ever-cheaper credit is not going to raise productivity. Only an injection of new, freshly minted funds that add to the sum of money in circulation, invested wisely, can do that.</p> <p>Carney and Draghi have argued this case, only for politicians to take a step back. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/fischer-signals-2016-rate-hike-with-economy-nearing-fed-goals\" title=\"\">Stanley Fischer, deputy Fed chief, made the same point</a> before this weekend\u2019s meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p> <p>Unfortunately, month by month, the situation is getting more desperate. Three business confidence surveys do not make a trend, but the pessimism registered by Belgian, French and German firms last week could force the ECB to consider further action before its 8 September meeting.</p> <p>The Bank of England may need to follow suit, however reluctantly, as the post-Brexit fall in sterling pushes up inflation while wages remain stagnant, cutting living standards and growth.</p> <p>The final nail in the coffin would be a rise in US rates, triggering a rush of funds across the Atlantic, forcing the pound down further and inflation higher. Carney would be forced to switch tack, raising rates to stem the flow. Then he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the colour of his remedy pills: just the looming recession he will surely be blamed for.</p>",
  "<p>The map of competitive states is expanding this year as Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers dipped to surprising lows in historically red states such as Georgia and Arizona. The last time either state voted Democratic was two decades ago.</p> <p>But even as the small club of battleground states grows this year, fewer than 10 states will likely determine the outcome of this year\u2019s race. </p> <p>Relying on the same handful of states to decide the outcome of presidential elections is a fairly recent phenomenon. Just three decades ago, when politics weren\u2019t yet so polarized, all 50 states were up for grabs, swinging between parties from one election to the next.</p> <p>Looking <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/politics/07REAG.html?pagewanted=all\">somber and drained</a> near midnight on 6 November 1984, Democrat Walter Mondale conceded victory to Ronald Reagan in the presidential election after Reagan won 49 of 50 states. Mondale won only his home state of Minnesota.<br></p> <p>Such blowout elections may seem incredible today, but Reagan\u2019s win was less exceptional at the time. Just 12 years earlier, in 1972, Richard Nixon also swept 49 out of 50 states against George McGovern to become president. And in 1964, Lyndon B Johnson won 44 states to Barry Goldwater\u2019s six.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s in stark contrast to today\u2019s political landscape.<br></p> <p>Despite campaign troubles and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">low favorability ratings</a>, Trump will almost certainly win at least 20 states, if not 25 \u2013 half the US \u2013 on election night. In a different decade, a candidate plagued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">controversial statements</a>, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/hillary-clinton-fundraising-report-donald-trump-us-election\">historically underfunded campaign</a>, and who many party elites have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">publicly denounced</a> might have been tanking in more states.</p> <p>The term \u201cswing states\u201d is well known today, but the same few states determining several consecutive presidential elections is a recent occurrence.</p> <p>The phrase \u201cswing state\u201d wasn\u2019t mentioned in books until the 1950s, according to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google Ngram Viewer,</a> a service that shows how often phrases have been used in texts over time. But between 2000 and 2008, usage of the term more than tripled. During that period, Ohio, Florida, Virginia and a handful of others coalesced into the group we now think of as swing states.<br></p> <p>Since 2000, 40 states have voted for the same party\u2019s candidate in all four presidential elections. By contrast, in the four elections between 1984 and 1996, states \u201cswung\u201d more often: only 17 states voted for the same party\u2019s candidate in the four consecutive elections during that period.<br></p> <p>Increasing political polarization is a big factor in the swing state phenomenon. The roots of current polarization stretch back to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/08/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-our-polarized-politics/\">about the 1970s</a>; since then, the parties have become not only more ideologically sorted but also more ideologically divergent, and their members more hostile toward the opposing party.</p> <p>Liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats used to make up a much larger share of both the US Congress and the broader population. Even a decade ago, conservative Democratic representatives in Congress voted alongside Republicans almost as often as they voted alongside Democrats. Now, conservative Democrats in the House and Senate have been unseated by Republicans, and liberal Republicans have lost their seats to Democrats.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s also increasingly rare for members of either party to break party lines when voting, both for ideological reasons and as strategic moves in an increasingly intense competition for party control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/flipped-polarization-slider/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing US legislators becoming more polarized.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/flipped-polarization-slider/\">Graphic showing US legislators becoming more polarized.</a> </figure>  <p>Voters\u2019 ideas are also becoming more homogenous and more in sync with their chosen party\u2019s platform. In 1994, Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/\">found</a> that only about one in 10 Americans expressed views across a range of issues that were either consistently conservative or consistently liberal. Today that number is one in five. Both parties\u2019 median ideologies have also drifted apart between 1994 and 2016, which means there is less common ground between the parties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polarization-area/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing Democrats and Republicans becoming more polarized in their ideology.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polarization-area/\">Graphic showing Democrats and Republicans becoming more polarized in their ideology.</a> </figure>  <p>In addition to increasing ideological differences and greater ideological sorting, Republicans and Democrats have much more animosity toward one another today compared to 20 years ago. </p> <p>In another 1994 <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016/\">Pew survey</a>, about one in five Americans on either side of the political aisle reported having a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d view of the opposing political party. Today that number has increased to three in five. When just \u201cunfavorable\u201d views are added in, around 90% of Americans report having unfavorable or very unfavorable views of their political opponents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polarization-line-chart/\" data-alt=\"Graphs showing both parties' increasing unfavorability among members of the other party.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polarization-line-chart/\">Graphs showing both parties' increasing unfavorability among members of the other party.</a> </figure>  <p>Americans\u2019 strong distaste for the opposing party and growing ideological gap mean that today\u2019s voters aren\u2019t likely to switch between parties frequently, if at all. </p> <p>But the way a state votes is not immune to long-term change. Demographic shifts \u2013 including growing urbanization, migration and an ageing population \u2013 mean that the swing states of the future may be different than the swing states of today. But unless politics become vastly less polarized, swing states are here to stay.</p>"
