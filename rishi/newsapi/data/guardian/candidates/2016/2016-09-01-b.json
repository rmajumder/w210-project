  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration\">Obama administration</a> has insisted that the terms of a nuclear agreement signed last year with Iran were being upheld after a Washington think tank alleged that Tehran had been granted secret exemptions. </p> <p><a href=\"http://file///Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/JCPOA%20Exemptions%20Revealed_1Sept2016_Final1.pdf\">A report</a> by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding waste material in Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be used in a nuclear warhead.</p> <p> The institute\u2019s director and co-author of the report, David Albright, said that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/life-iranians-nuclear-deal\">After the nuclear deal, the west should not disappoint Iranians for the third time | Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these cases,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIf the joint commission has so many powers to change this deal, shouldn\u2019t we know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p> <p>The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), had been breached. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the JCPOA,\u201d spokesman John Kirby said.</p> <p>He added the only violation of the terms of the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran\u2019s export of heavy water (which can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium), but that had been corrected.</p> <p>Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year\u2019s deal, signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), the EU and Iran.</p> <p>\u201cThis is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission\u2019s work should be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,\u201d Kirby said. </p> <p>However, while he repeatedly stated there had no been \u201cno exceptions\u201d to the quantitative limits set down in the agreement, Kirby did not respond directly to the question of exemptions.</p> <p>Albright\u2019s report claimed certain waste products and residues were not being included in the joint commission\u2019s inventory of nuclear materials.

Hot cells are special containers that allow technicians to handle radioactive matter with special gloves while being shielded. They can be used to separate plutonium from spent fuel on a small scale. </p> <p>Kirby noted that the joint commission was given the authority to approve larger hot cells than envisaged in the agreement. </p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t saying anything has been violated here,\u201d Albright said. \u201cBut the number of these hot cells is surprising. We don\u2019t know how many are being monitored by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], and again, why is this secret?\u201d</p> <p>Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that it was the norm for arms control agreements to have secret sections. </p> <p>\u201cSecret doesn\u2019t mean evil. It\u2019s just standard operating procedure, and as this report says itself, Obama notified Congress. Congress has known this from the beginning,\u201d Walsh said. On the question of the \u201chot cells\u201d, Walsh added: \u201cThe report admits these are being used for producing medical isotopes. There is no plutonium reactor in Iran. A reactor is years away, so allowing the existing hot cells is not a proliferation danger.\u201d </p> <p>James Acton, the co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: \u201cThe more complicated and comprehensive your arms control agreement, the more questions it throws up in implementation.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Chemical Weapons Convention, the US had to destroy its stockpile by 2012, but it wasn\u2019t possible to meet that deadline. People didn\u2019t see that as an attempt to undermine the convention, and a pragmatic solution was found,\u201d Acton said. \u201cThere is the same principle at work here.\u201d </p>",

And Mexico will pay for the wall ... They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re gonna pay for the wall.\u201d This, after Pe\u00f1a Nieto had tweeted that he\u2019d told Trump from the beginning of their conversation his country wouldn\u2019t be paying under any circumstances.</p> <p>Speaking on NBC\u2019s Today show on Thursday morning, Hillary Clinton\u2019s veep pick Tim Kaine knocked Trump\u2019s performance as \u201camateur\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-trump-makes-support-mass-deportation-clear-n641256\">saying</a>: \u201cYou can\u2019t say different things to different audiences.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting knock coming from Kaine, who\u2019s known for speaking differently to different audiences, sometimes speaking in English, other times in his dad-like Spanish. </p> <p>A fundamental difference: Kaine changes how he talks but not the substance of what he promises.</p> <p>Tweaking how you talk depending on the audience \u2013 code switching \u2013 is actually the sign of a good listener, an <a href=\"http://ologists-claim.html/\">empathetic human being</a> and, very often, a skilled politician. But it can be difficult for politicians to walk the line between authenticity and connecting with different populations. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has been teased for affecting a drawl while speaking to black audiences, and Michael Steele has been mocked for saying things like \u201coff the hook\u201d. Even Obama, a guy Zadie Smith has praised <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22334\">for his mastery</a> of the cultural pivot, gets criticized for it sometimes. After a speech before a mostly black audience in 2007 in which he took on a preacherly tone of voice, for instance, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson pointed to it as evidence of pandering. \u201cThis accent is absurd,\u201d he concluded in a segment on Sean Hannity. \u201cThis is a put-on.\u201d</p> <p>It can also be done well, though. Bill Clinton was known as the first black president in part because he knew how to affect a southern twang. George W Bush was beloved by voters in no small part for being likably folksy \u2013 <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/benedetto/2004-09-17-benedetto_x.htm\">the guy voters wanted to have a beer with</a> \u2013 if not respected. As African American writer Eric Deggans <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/10/176234171/learning-how-to-code-switch-humbling-but-necessary\">put it</a> in a 2013 column for NPR, code switching is an important way to make sure you\u2019re understood across cultures.</p> <p>It can go wrong when it veers into the territory of pandering, as when Marco Rubio was accused of saying something more pro-immigration on Spanish language TV than he was saying elsewhere. Specifically he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arTUEdwCw7s\">accused</a> by Ted Cruz of supporting President Obama\u2019s program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to allow some young people to remain in the US by giving temporary legal status to immigrants who came to the states illegally as children. Politifact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/17/ted-cruz/did-marco-rubio-say-spanish-univision-he-would-not/\">found the claim</a> half-true on the grounds that Cruz didn\u2019t include the full context of the discussion, but it still didn\u2019t play well for Rubio.</p> <p>The sometimes blurry line between form and substance switching are on display now, when we look at the differences between how Trump changes his speeches to reach different audiences, and how Kaine does.<br></p> <p>Trump can be a highly skilled code-switcher in ways that are valuable to him as a politician. It\u2019s what allowed him to read the Republican base better than anyone in the party establishment and construct a campaign that would resonate. But in altering the substance of what he says depending on audience, he takes the tactic too far. </p> <p>With Kaine we don\u2019t have to worry about any such thing. On the contrary, it\u2019s respectful to learn another culture\u2019s language in the melting pot America is increasingly becoming. The way Trump alters his message isn\u2019t code switching, per se. It\u2019s not \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d, and it certainly isn\u2019t respectful to his audience. It\u2019s just more lying.</p>",

  "<p>Nothing in this world can be said to be certain except death and taxes, Benjamin Franklin once observed. Islam Karimov appears to have challenged that rule.

His younger daughter declared that he had suffered a brain haemorrhage but was recovering.

Such evasions are probably impossible to pull off in an age of rolling news, social media and hacking. As Hillary Clinton could testify, even non-facts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\" title=\"\">can trigger speculation about health issues</a>. <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\" title=\"\">Being well </a>is no longer enough.</p> <p>In any case, blurring the truth is one thing; there are degrees of health and incapacity. Erasing the line between life and death is another, possible \u2013 and necessary \u2013 only in secretive authoritarian systems (the Taliban, too, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34105565\" title=\"\">kept back the news</a> of their leader Mullah Omar\u2019s death for two years). Everything must be settled before the public are allowed to glimpse it, in case they might be tempted to seek some say: who rules them is none of their business. Even death can be held back for official convenience; the truth does not exist until determined by the state. We cannot say with any certainty whether Mr Karimov is dead or alive.

  "<p>Americans know that a functioning democracy relies on a basic trust in the validity of the process. Russia, a country that has thoroughly undermined trust in its own democratic process, now appears to have every incentive to do the same to ours.</p> <p>US intelligence officials <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russians-hacked-two-u-s-voter-databases-say-officials-n639551\">told</a> NBC News this week that Russian-based hackers have stolen data on thousands of registered voters in Illinois and unsuccessfully attempted to do the same in Arizona. They have suggested that the hackers in question may be directly tied to the Russian government. <br></p> <p>These claims come in the wake of recent suspected Russian cyber-attacks on the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Foundation and Washington thinktanks, as well as Donald Trump\u2019s possibly sarcastic but alarming request for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server.</p> <p>Claims of this nature are inherently murky, and it\u2019s worth noting that cybersecurity experts have been warning that election infrastructure in the US is vulnerable to hackers with far fewer resources than the Kremlin. Still, stipulating that Russia may be behind a pattern of cyber-attacks, the question becomes: why?</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that Putin is rooting for Trump. Putin is no fan of Clinton, but he\u2019s also no fool, and he understands that a hostile but conventional Clinton administration is more predictable than a friendly but erratic Trump administration. He also understands, like anyone else following the latest polls, that Trump is very unlikely to win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/15/donald-trump-russian-dnc-hack-itself-us-election\">Donald Trump claims DNC itself, not Russians, masterminded hack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But even if Russia doesn\u2019t want to help tip the scales in Trump\u2019s favor, there are plenty of other reasons why they might want to interfere with the US political process. As Russian troops amass on Ukraine\u2019s border for a possible new offensive, it is in Russia\u2019s interest to ensure that Clinton is a weak and embattled president, and cyber-attacks are a cheap and plausibly deniable way to do just that.</p> <p>Consider the fallout from the DNC email hacks, released by WikiLeaks, which further established the Democratic party\u2019s contempt for Bernie Sanders and clear preference for Clinton. While no one watching the primaries closely could have been very surprised by this, it nonetheless exacerbated the bitterness between Clinton and Sanders supporters on the eve of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia and was an unwelcome headache for the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>This incident shows how easily Russian hackers could amass politically damaging information and distribute it to independent organizations like WikiLeaks to be released at sensitive moments.</p> <p>Obtaining voter data is also useful for undermining public trust in the political process. The concern isn\u2019t so much that Russia could meaningfully alter election results, as no one believes Illinois\u2019s electoral votes will go to anyone other than Hillary Clinton. But even marginal interference with the vote count could be used to bolster Trump\u2019s claims that the election in November could be rigged. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/25/russia-dnc-hack-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-us-election\">Putin is surely backing Trump, whether or not Russia was behind DNC hack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arizona, for instance, is a state that typically votes Republican but that is considered a possible target for Clinton thanks to Trump\u2019s unusual weaknesses as a candidate. If Clinton were to win Arizona by a slim margin, even the appearance of malfeasance could be used to undermine the legitimacy of her victory.</p> <p>Russia has a habit of using cyber-attacks and misinformation campaigns to cause political chaos in countries like Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine \u2013 all former Soviet republics with which Russia has had major geopolitical disputes. To extend these tactics to the US would be bold, but the unprecedented unpopularity of both Clinton and Trump presents an opportunity. <br></p> <p>Americans already distrust their leaders, and any bit of damaging information, true or not, that emerges only worsens this distrust, creating space for Russia to pursue its objectives with potentially diminished American interference.</p> <p>The US, of course, is not above using hackers and misinformation campaigns. Any evidence put forward by US intelligence officials has to be taken with a grain of salt. And perhaps all is fair in cyberwarfare, and the only thing to be done is to bolster security measures against hackers. But bolstering voter\u2019s faith in democracy? That is a whole other challenge. <br></p>",

  "<p>The Clinton campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/hillary-clinton-necono-republican-endorsements-donald-trump-policy-issues\">has now spent months</a> trying to convince relatively obscure former Republican officials to endorse her campaign while also adopting many Republican slogans and arguments in her quest for the presidency. </p> <p>One has to wonder how much long term damage she is doing to progressive policies by deploying this strategy, even if she beats Donald Trump along the way. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/hillary-clinton-derides-donald-trump-mexico-trip-american-legion\">gave a speech in Ohio</a> on Wednesday with yet another former Bush official, James Clad. The speech was billed as touting \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d, one of the more repellent nationalistic concepts that Republicans have used to shame progressives in the past. She <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/clinton-stress-american-exceptionalism-ohio-41764569\">spoke mostly about foreign policy</a>, a subject in which Clinton \u2013 with her penchant for supporting foreign wars and beefed up US military presence everywhere \u2013 seemingly has more in common with mainstream Republicans than the Obama administration.</p> <p>Last week, Clinton again handed legitimacy to the Republican party through the way she has decided to attack Trump. She gave a speech in which she praised prior GOP candidates for their treatment of Muslim Americans, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_hooks/status/768934791622209536\">George W Bush</a>, in an attempt to rhetorically separate Trump from these other supposedly upstanding Republicans. In the process, she is kneecapping Democratic candidates around the country who are attempting to retake the House and Senate. </p> <p>Instead of hanging Trump around all Republicans\u2019 necks, she is cleaving him off from other GOP candidates and giving them an easy out, despite the fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/29/donald-trump-monster-gop-polls\">is a direct product of the GOP\u2019s pandering</a> to classist and racist elements of society for a decade. (Leaked Democratic National Committee emails show that at least some <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/293428-leaked-emails-show-dem-split-on-linking-trump-to-gop\">Democrats were worried</a> about this exact scenario.)</p> <p>Whether Clinton\u2019s strategy of trying to peel off a small percentage of Republicans to win the presidency will actually work remains to be seen. There seems to be scant evidence in the polls that a significant amount of Republicans will support her; Clinton\u2019s advantage mostly stems from the fact that black and Hispanic Americans understandably oppose Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">in historic numbers</a>. But if the strategy hinders Democrats from retaking Congress, the damage is going to be seen for years.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the outreach and compliments to normally detestable Republicans that are the problem. Clinton and the Democratic leadership are latching onto abhorrent concepts and arguments that Republicans have been deploying for decades.</p> <p>Take House Democrats, for example, who on Tuesday <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/31/congressional-dems-call-on-fbi-to-investigate-their-political-adversaries-kremlin-ties/\">called on the FBI to investigate</a> the Trump campaign for its alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. What a great idea! It\u2019s not like calling for a law enforcement investigation into your political enemies for nebulous connections to the Kremlin <a href=\"http://www.coldwar.org/articles/50s/senatorjosephmccarthy.asp\">has ever backfired before</a>. </p> <p>And then there\u2019s the Clinton campaign\u2019s response to questions about large donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments that seem to coincide with the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/why-did-the-saudi-regime-and-other-gulf-tyrannies-donate-millions-to-the-clinton-foundation/\">state department approving large weapons deals</a> to dictatorships like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The Clinton camp has <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/why-did-the-saudi-regime-and-other-gulf-tyrannies-donate-millions-to-the-clinton-foundation/\">essentially been arguing</a> that since there\u2019s no evidence of quid pro quo, there\u2019s nothing wrong. Many commentators (including <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/25/12615340/hillary-clinton-foundation\">a lot of ethics experts</a>) have said that this comes very close to corruption, and it sounds an awful lot like the GOP\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/768788364514435077\">long-held defense of Citizens United</a>.</p> <p>This is the same logic, too, that the Clinton camp used against Bernie Sanders when he continually pointed out the large number of bank and oil lobbyists who were giving money to the network of Clinton Super Pacs and interest groups during the primary. As campaign finance expert Lawrence Lessig <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-clintons-citizens-united-and-21st-century-corruption/2015/05/08/7f11a0d6-f57b-11e4-b2f3-af5479e6bbdd_story.html?utm_term=.a2896f9ab837\">has previously pointed out</a>, this tactic is further entrenching big corporate money into our political system, even though Democrats have spent years pointing to the dissent in Citizens United that made clear the fundamental problem with corporate money in politics <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/715918806800080896\">is much broader than explicitly buying a vote</a> on a specific issue. </p> <p>Clinton may think that a shift toward the right is her best way to defeat Trump. But given that it\u2019s likely Trump will go down in flames anyway, it should be a cause of concern to all candidates who are attempting to defeat other Republicans along the way.</p>",
  "<p>There was Kevin Maas and Shayne Spencer. Joba Chamberlain, Phil Hughes and Hideki Irabu. Shelley Duncan and Greg Bird. The Yankees can boast the most championships in major league history and also that the franchise is the greatest of all-time at producing overhyped prospects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/18/why-the-new-york-yankees-cant-lose-even-when-they-try-to\">Why the New York Yankees can't lose even when they try to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any Yankees minor-leaguer who arrives in the Bronx with a bit of pedigree or touch of early success is inevitably elevated to future legend status. Maas was the next Lou Gehrig when he hit 21 home runs in half a season in 1990. He only hit 44 more home runs with the Yankees over the next three seasons, becoming more the next Steve Balboni than Gehrig. So it\u2019s easy to eye-roll whenever a Yankees rookie starts grabbing headlines. The natural reaction is to ignore it and wait for the inevitable collapse to come.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re doing that this year you\u2019re missing a Yankees rookie that actually happens to be worth watching. Gary Sanchez, called up to the big club in early August as the Yankees embarked on their youth movement, is doing legendary things. It\u2019s hard to find a hitting record the 23-year old catcher doesn\u2019t hold for the first month of a career. He\u2019s the first player to hit 11 home runs in his first 23 games, has the highest OPS in history through a player\u2019s first 100 plate appearances, is leading baseball in WAR since the start of August and is the first American League player to win three consecutive player of the week honors since Albert Belle in 1998. There\u2019s no over-hyping total dominance. You can say we\u2019ve seen it before with a Yankees call-up, but baseball hasn\u2019t seen anything quite like this in history.</p> <p>Sanchez is playing so well that he\u2019s helped the Yankees stay on the fringe of the wildcard race more than a month after the front office completely gave up on the season. And while his production at the plate draws all the attention, his play behind the plate is outstanding compared to most 23-year olds at the position. He can hold a spot in the majors on that alone even when he stops hitting major league pitching like he\u2019s a 6ft 2in kid in the Little League World Series. The Yankees undoubtedly have their catcher of the future and they may even have a guy who can develop the \u201cleadership\u201d and \u201cintangibles\u201d that made Derek Jeter\u2019s name holy words in the Bronx. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElGarySanchez/status/769364788686172160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New Yorkers never quit.

He wasn\u2019t playing good baseball, so they sent him to play baseball somewhere else. In his rookie year of 2013 his teammate skills were no better, but his OPS was .925. If Puig ever gets to speak to his younger self, he should tell Young Puig to stay really good at baseball because then he can behave however he wants to.</p> <h2>Who\u2019s closer to victory: Donald Trump or the Cubs? </h2> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s unfavorable numbers are <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-clinton-unpopularity-high-par-trump/story?id=41752050\">way up again</a> after her latest email controversy , forcing the world to again face the truly terrifying prospect of a President Trump. The Cubs keep rolling along, but they\u2019ll have to get through a postseason tournament that includes nine other very good teams. Trump just has to beat one Hillary Clinton to win it all. That\u2019s like the Cubs only having to get past the Twins to win the World Series. This week\u2019s advantage goes to Trump. <br></p> <h2>How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week? </h2> <p>Three minor league players, two in the Pirates system and one with the Tigers, got in an altercation at a bar in Toledo, Ohio, this week when a bartender reportedly dumped out the drink of Indianapolis infielder Gift Ngoepe at last call. No one can speak for Goose Gossage here \u2013 speaking for someone is likely against a code \u2013 but I think we can all agree that a bartender dumping out a patron\u2019s drink unprovoked is wrong. The three players ultimately were arrested and charged with assault, but at least they will never be charged with violating the unwritten rules of going to a bar.</p> <h2>Nine thoughts in order</h2> <p>1. Tim Tebow held his (much-anticipated?) baseball workout on Tuesday in Los Angeles. One National League scout said off-the-record that he \u201csucked,\u201d while <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/08/30/mlb-scouts-weigh-in-on-tim-tebows-baseball-workout/\">another NL scout</a> said \u201che hit some bombs, just bombs. Talk about exit speed off the bat. It was amazing.\u201d No one knows where Tebow\u2019s career will take him next, but we can be sure that no matter what he does, exactly half the people will think he\u2019s great and the other half will insist he\u2019s the worst ever.</p> <p>2. A pitcher in the KBO named Lim Chang-yong came up with a great new way to hold runners on the base without needing fielders to cover the bag: just throw the baseball at the baserunner\u2019s head. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MyKBO/status/770229369004363776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">KIA&#39;s Lim Chang-yong&#39;s been suspended for 3 games &amp; must complete 120 hours of community service for this &#39;pick-off&#39; <a href=\"https://t.co/VXRx1P6sVK\">pic.twitter.com/VXRx1P6sVK</a></p>&mdash; Dan (@MyKBO) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyKBO/status/770229369004363776\">August 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A three-game suspension for innovation?

As baseball continues to search for ways to speed up the game, this fact presents a fairly obvious one: in all Max Scherzer games, just skip the first five half-innings in which he would pitch. That\u2019s 30 minutes saved right there. You\u2019re welcome, baseball.</p> <p>4. Bartolo Colon had two hits in his last start to become the second-oldest Mets player in history to get two hits in a single game. Colon will break Julio Franco\u2019s record during the 2021 season when he is 48 and hits two triples.

The Rangers are now 30-8 in one-run games this season, putting them on pace to best the 2012 Orioles for the best winning percentage in one-run games in baseball history. Impressive. But that Baltimore team didn\u2019t make it out of the first round of the playoffs. And despite having the best record in the American League and the second-best mark in all of baseball, the Rangers are only tied for 13th in run differential at plus-9. Run differential is the stat that tells if a team is truly dominant \u2013 the Cubs are plus-221, for example \u2013 while winning one-run games is often a function of luck. The Rangers are going to make the playoffs, but they\u2019re going to need a lot of luck to do anything there. For a team that has never once had even a hint of postseason luck, that\u2019s a daunting fate.<br></p> <p>6. Carlos Beltran spent the last two and a half seasons with the Yankees before getting traded to the Rangers at the deadline.

Major League rosters expand today, giving teams the option to grow from 25 players to 40. It\u2019s an odd time as contending teams suddenly have their playoff fates tied to lesser players who days ago were toiling away in forgotten towns. Or maybe it\u2019s not that odd. MLB lets the Twins and Braves and Reds have an impact on World Series homefield via the all-star game, so why not spread that approach out over an entire month.<br></p> <p>9. Colin Kaepernick\u2019s refusal to stand for the national anthem is probably the biggest sports-related anthem controversy since Roseanne Barr screeched the song \u2013 punctuating the performance with a crotch grab and spit \u2013 before a San Diego Padres game in 1990. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls1YVhcLD2c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ls1YVhcLD2c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It was so bad that then-president George HW Bush called it \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t without its positive qualities.

His own family (original name: Drumpf) came from Germany, settling in the US a little more than a decade before the first world war.</p> <p>And yet, Candidate Trump proposed what he called \u201cideological certification\u201d of immigrants to check their real intent. That was the only way to weed out criminals and terrorists, who somehow blended into one giant alien blob in his combed-over cranium.</p> <p>Trump painted a portrait of a nation overrun by hordes of unassimilated aliens stampeding across the southern border, determined to butcher innocent Americans.</p> <p>Never mind that most undocumented immigrants enter the country by plane and overstay their visas.

The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\u201d</p> <p>No, we\u2019ve never seen that \u2013 except in one presidential candidate\u2019s recent trip to Mexico. <br></p> <p>Trump thinks of himself as a tough negotiator who knows the art of the deal. So when he travels to Mexico to confront the leader of a country that he thinks is ripping us off with bad trade deals, and sending its bad guys over the nonexistent border, we know exactly what to expect.</p> <p>A polite and friendly conversation that doesn\u2019t discuss his plan to force the Mexicans to pay for the wall he wants to build.</p> <p>This is clearly a cunning negotiation tactic. He has already confused the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who told the world that Mexico would not pay for the Great Wall of Trump. \u201cI made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d the president said bluntly.</p> <p>Trump himself had a different take. \u201cWe did discuss the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That will be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting. I think it was an excellent meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Other people hear \u201cno\u201d and think it means \u201cno\u201d. Other people negotiate by trying to move the other side closer to their own price. Other people speak up in a discussion. </p> <p>Not Trump. He negotiates by saying the discussion never happened. That\u2019s what \u201cvery preliminary\u201d means. An \u201cexcellent meeting\u201d is one where you lull the opposition into a false sense of victory.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion, and a relationship-builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior communications advisor to the nominee. \u201cIt was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>More appropriate was what came out of Trump\u2019s mouth when he returned to the land of the free. \u201cWe will build a great wall along the southern border,\u201d Trump told his cheering supporters in Phoenix, Arizona. At this point, he walked across the stage and applauded himself. </p> <p>\u201cAnd Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>No, they clearly don\u2019t know it. But there were some clues left by some Trump staffers.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration.<br></p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate doubled down on his hardline stance in a speech on Wednesday night which delighted core supporters and dismayed his few remaining Latino allies who had expected a tack towards moderation.</p> <p>Speaking hours after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">lightning visit to Mexico</a>, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, he was sticking with his plan for a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to intercept illegal border crossers and hunt down criminal \u201cillegal aliens\u201d already in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">In Arizona we saw the real Donald Trump: the one we already knew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are going to take our country back,\u201d he said, repeating a mantra from the primary campaign.</p> <p>Speaking largely from a teleprompter, he also reiterated his vow to make Mexico pay for a 2,000-mile wall which, he said, would bristle with sensors, towers and guards. \u201cWe will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls with just 69 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides had recently fuelled expectations of a \u201csoftening\u201d of immigration policy, prompting speculation about a flip-flop.</p> <p>Instead the speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City, where Trump met President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.</p> <p>The GOP nominee roused the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage \u201cangel moms\u201d whose children were killed.</p> <p>He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gives work permits to about 800,000 young immigrants who came to the US as children \u2013 a stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach.</p> <p>Anybody who entered the US illegally would be subject to deportation and there should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, he said. \u201cThere will be no amnesty.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/01/compare-and-contrast-trumps-night-of-changing-rhetoric-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xyc2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692523\"            data-video-name=\"Compare and contrast: Trump\u2019s night of changing rhetoric \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c7f945e4b0f6cb85628c58\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160901trumpcompare_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160901trumpcompare.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/01/160901trumpcompare_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/01/compare-and-contrast-trumps-night-of-changing-rhetoric-video\">Compare and contrast: Trump\u2019s night of changing rhetoric</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump also promised ideological tests for would-be visa applicants, a \u201csunset\u201d on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years and a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don\u2019t deport undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The rhetoric trampled over the hopes of Trump\u2019s dwindling band of conservative Latino supporters. \u201cThis is how I feel: disappointed and misled,\u201d tweeted Alfonso Aguilar, head of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles.

My first hour in office, those people are gone.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ambiguity over the fate of non-criminal undocumented immigrants marked a tacit retreat from Trump\u2019s earlier vows to swiftly deport all 11 million people. The lack of clarity allowed supporters and critics to fill in the blanks with their own wishes and anxieties.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s policy could in theory yet resemble that of Obama, who has deported millions, and GOP rivals such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, whom Trump accused of supporting de facto amnesty.</p> <p>The speech capped a whirlwind day of political theatre in which Trump, after a year of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">denigrating Mexican immigrants</a> as rapists, murderers and drug dealers, met President Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City, triggering a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-memes-cartoons-pena-nieto\">backlash </a>from Mexicans who denounced the New York businessman as a tyrant, and worse.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-memes-cartoons-pena-nieto\">'C\u00e1llate, imb\u00e9cil': the best Mexican responses to Donald Trump's visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump emerged from the private meeting at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, heaping praise on Mexican immigrants. \u201cThey are amazing people, amazing people ...

In a late evening television interview, an angry-looking Pe\u00f1a Nieto said: \u201cHis policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing.</p> <p>\u201cThat risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations.\u201d </p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, sidelined by another day of Trump drama, seized on the discrepancy: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn\u2019t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.\u201d</p> <p>The unexpected visit \u2013 Trump\u2019s first meeting with a head of state since he became a candidate \u2013 yielded presidential optics in the form of a podium and marble backdrop in an international setting. Speaking beneath a Mexican flag the casino owner-turned reality TV star sounded restrained and diplomatic.</p> <p>That evaporated when he bounded onto the podium in Phoenix, 200 miles north of the border, and seemed energised by the crowd, even though the cavernous convention centre was half-empty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rorycarroll72/status/771161654868324353\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump?src=hash\">#Trump</a> takes the stage: &#39;what a crowd..

  "<p>Brazil\u2019s first female president Dilma Rousseff has been thrown out of office by the country\u2019s corruption-tainted senate after a gruelling impeachment trial that ends 13 years of Workers\u2019 party rule.</p> <p>Following a<strong> </strong>crushing 61 to 20 defeat<strong> </strong>in the upper house, she will be replaced for the remaining two years and four months of her term by Michel Temer, a centre-right patrician who was among the leaders of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/brazil-michel-temer-dilma-rousseff-impeachment\">the campaign against his former running mate</a>.</p> <p>In a separate vote, the senate voted 42 to 36 not to bar Rousseff from public office for eight years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeachment-brazil-what-you-need-to-know\">Dilma Rousseff impeachment: what you need to know \u2013 the Guardian briefing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his first address to the nation after being sworn in by Congress last night, Temer said it was time to unite the country, vowing to work to rescue an economy mired in recession and guarantee political stability for foreign investors. <br></p> <p>Rousseff was defiant after being ousted. \u201cThey think they\u2019ve defeated us, but they\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said from her official residency, her voice cracking and eyes moist with emotion. \u201cI know we will all fight.\u201d <br></p> <p>Despite never losing an election, Rousseff \u2013 who first won power in 2010 \u2013 had seen her support among the public and in congress diminish as a result of a sharp economic decline, government paralysis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeachment-brazil-what-you-need-to-know\">a massive bribery scandal that has implicated almost all the major parties</a>.</p> <p>For more than 10 months, the leftist leader fought efforts to impeach her for frontloading funds for government social programmes and issuing spending budget decrees without congressional approval ahead of her reelection in 2014. The opposition claimed that these constituted a \u201ccrime of responsibility\u201d. Rousseff denies this and claims the charges \u2013 which were never levelled at previous administrations who did the same thing \u2013 have been trumped up by opponents who were unable to accept the Workers\u2019 party\u2019s victory.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DilmaRousseff/videos/1190517181001871/\">Speaking to her supporters</a> from the presidential palace after the vote, Rousseff pledged to appeal her impeachment, which she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dilmabr/status/771052983966728193\">called</a> a parliamentary coup. The ousted president also called on her supporters to fight the conservative agenda now bolstered by her removal from office. <br></p> <p>\u201cRight now, I will not say goodbye to you. I am certain I can say, \u2018See you soon,\u2019\u201d she told supporters in Brasilia. </p> <p>In keeping with her pledge to fight until the end for the 54 million voters who put her in office, Rousseff \u2013 a former Marxist guerrilla \u2013 ended her presidency this week with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/brazil-president-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-trial\">a gritty 14-hour defence of her government\u2019s achievements</a> and a sharply worded attack on the \u201cusurpers\u201d and \u201ccoup-mongers\u201d who ejected her from power without an election.<br></p> <p>Her lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, said the charges were trumped up to punish the president\u2019s support for a huge corruption investigation that has snared many of Brazil\u2019s elite. This follows secret recordings of Romero Juc\u00e1, the majority leader of the senate and a key Temer ally, plotting to remove the president to halt the Lava Jato (car wash) investigation into kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras.</p> <p>While Rousseff was in the upper chamber, her critics heard her in respectful silence. But in a final session in her absence on Tuesday, they lined up to condemn her. As in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\">an earlier lower house impeachment debate</a>, the senators \u2013 many of whom are accused of far greater crimes \u2013 clearly revelled in the spotlight of their ten-minute declarations. Reflecting the growing power of rightwing evangelism, many invoked the name of God. One cited Winston Churchill. Another sang. Another appeared to be in tears. </p> <p>\u201cI apologise to the president, not for having done what did, because I could not have done anything else, but because I know her situation is not easy,\u201d claimed a sobbing Jana\u00edna Paschoal, one of the original co-authors of the impeachment petition. \u201cI think she understands I did all this in consideration of her grandchildren.\u201d<br></p> <p>The result was never in doubt, though Workers\u2019 party figurehead and former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/brazil-ex-president-luiz-ignacio-lula-da-silva-interview\">who also faces a trial of his own</a> \u2013 had lobbied hard until the last moment to try to swing enough senators to avoid impeachment.</p> <p>At the end of the marathon 16-hour session of speeches, the final nail was hammered in by the former Brazilian footballer Rom\u00e1rio, who had been rumoured to be among the few senators who might change their minds and save the president. Instead, he wound up the debate by confirming that he would once again vote for impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad moment when you decide to remove a president,\u201d he told the chamber. However he said he was convinced that Rousseff had committed a crime of responsibility.<br></p> <p>Ahead of the verdict, senator Vanessa Grazziotin, of the Communist Party of Brazil, arrived with a sense of resignation. \u201cI\u2019ve worn a mixture of red [for the Workers\u2019 party] and black because today is a day of mourning,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry.\u201d However, she and other Rousseff allies hoped they could minimise Rousseff\u2019s punishment.<br></p> <p>Workers\u2019 party senator Lindbergh Farias said the president\u2019s accusers were cowards. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how everyone who didn\u2019t have the gall to look Dilma in the eyes, spoke so bravely today in her absence,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindbergFarias/status/770700380242083840\">he tweeted</a>.</p> <p>The final result was comfortably more than the two-thirds (54 seats) needed to finalise the president\u2019s removal from office.</p> <p>Shortly after <a>1.30pm</a>, suspense filled the floor as senators watched as the upper house reached a quorum. Among the last to vote was the Workers Party\u2019s Jorge Viana as a hush fell across the packed room. There were cheers of \u201cBrazil!\u201d from the pro-impeachment camp as the numbers flashed up on the screen before a group of senators burst into a rendition of the national anthem. </p> <p>There were modest exchanges of \u201ccongratulations\u201d and backslapping between impeachment supporters as Juc\u00e1, who was drawn into the Lava Jato corruption scandal, said he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the result.</p> <p>Edison Lobao, of the PMDB, who voted for Rousseff\u2019s ouster, said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have voted differently regardless of who was the president. I would have voted for the impeachment of any president who acted outside the law.\u201d</p> <p>The musician and democracy activist Chico Buarque, who was among Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the gallery, said the debate was rigged against her. \u201cIf the game were clean, she would have won,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/midianinja/status/770392899125063680?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">he told local media</a>.</p> <p>Others noted that Rousseff\u2019s removal from office less than halfway through her mandate reinforced the impression that the country\u2019s political class remains uncomfortable with democracy although more than 30 years have passed since the end of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Only two of the last eight directly-elected presidents have completed their terms. Two have been impeached, one removed in a military coup, one killed himself, one died before taking power and another resigned.</p> <p>It also marks a dramatic downfall of a woman who was once one of the world\u2019s most popular politicians with approval ratings of 85%. But she had struggled with a hostile congress and a dire financial climate. When Rousseff took office in January 2011, the economy was growing at a quarterly clip of 4.9%. <a href=\"http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&amp;id=1&amp;idnoticia=3245&amp;busca=1 \">It has been downhill ever since and she leaves the presidency with output shrinking by 4.6%</a> though this is partly because the price of Brazil\u2019s oil exports is now below half of its peak in 2011.</p> <p>Rousseff\u2019s achievements in office were mainly an expansion of equality policies put in place by her predecessors, particularly the <em>bolsa familia</em> poverty relief program, <a href=\"http://aplicacoes.mds.gov.br/sagi/RIv3/geral/relatorio.php#\">which now reaches almost 14 million households</a>. </p> <p>Thanks to affirmative action and wider access to higher education, university enrolments <a href=\"http://portal.inep.gov.br/superior-censosuperior-sinopse\">jumped 18% during her first term</a>. Since 2009, 2.6 million homes have been delivered by <a href=\"http://www.brasil.gov.br/infraestrutura/2016/03/minha-casa-minha-vida-chega-a-3a-fase-com-2-milhoes-de-novas-moradias-ate-2018\">the government housing program \u2013 <em>Minha Casa Minha Vida</em></a>. But her record in other key areas is mixed. After falling in her first two years in power, deforestation of the Amazon <a href=\"http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/index.php\">has started to rise again</a>. Her replacement has a lot to do.<br></p> <p>Temer \u2013 who was widely criticised for appointing an all-male, all-white cabinet when he took power on an interim basis in May \u2013 was sworn in again on Wednesday afternoon and is set to continue until the next presidential election in 2018, when he has promised he will not stand. </p> <p>After being sworn in, Temer promised a \u201cnew era\u201d for Brazil during a televised cabinet meeting. </p> <p>\u201cFrom today on, the expectations are much higher for the government. I hope that in these two years and four months, we do what we have declared \u2013 put Brazil back on track,\u201d he said. Regarding his upcoming trip to China, he said it was important to show that stability had returned. \u201cWe are traveling precisely to reveal to the world that we have political and legal stability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to show that there is hope in the country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Temer received support from the United States, which implicitly rejected claims that Rousseff had been removed in a coup. US State Department spokesman, John Kirby said, \u201cWe are confident we will continue our strong bilateral relationship. This was a decision made by the Brazilian people and obviously we respect that ... Brazilian democratic institutions have acted within its constitutional framework.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the ceremony, he is due to fly to China to attend the G20 summit in Hangzhou, where he will hope to restore some of the credibility of an administration that has been battered by accusations of treachery and three ministerial resignations due to corruption scandals.<br></p> <p>He has promised to introduce austerity measures that will restore Brazil\u2019s credit ratings, which under Rousseff fell to junk levels. This is popular with investors, but not with the public. His approval ratings are only a fraction above those of his predecessor and he was roundly booed during the Olympic opening ceremony.<br></p> <p>During the final stages of the senate trial, there was no repeat of the mass rallies in Brasilia that marked earlier stages of the process. However, a small group of Rousseff supporters staged a candlelit vigil in the main esplanade. Bigger protests have been seen in other cities this week. In S\u00e3o Paulo anti-impeachment protesters and riot police <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/08/1808669-manifestantes-pro-dilma-entram-em-confronto-com-a-pm-em-sao-paulo.shtml\">clashed on Monday night</a>. Demonstrators claim the security forces made excessive use of tear gas and percussion grenades in what they fear will be a precursor of more clampdowns on opposition. Police claimed the protesters \u2013 many from the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement \u2013 blocked roads and detonated a home-made bomb.<br></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury</em></p>",

It\u2019s pretty long. Here are just a couple:</p> <h2><strong>On people illegally in the US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201cThey\u2019re treated better than our vets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the risk of being removed from the country.</p> <p>Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.</p> <p>The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.</p> <h2>On the number of people in the US illegally</h2> <p><strong>Trump:</strong> \u201cOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> The government actually has an idea. The homeland security department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.</p> <p>The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The government compares the number of people whom the census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government.</p> <p>Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7967be4b0df5f040dc160\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T03:00:52.067Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today in Campaign 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Let\u2019s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump\u2019s speech:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44/0_0_4128_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a \u201csoftening\u201d - as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential candidate in the modern era.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a \u201csunset\u201d on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don\u2019t deport undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to reporters after the speech\u2019s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen Bannon was instrumental in the speech\u2019s crafting.</p> <p>The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump\u2019s own aggressive rhetoric on undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general election.</p> <p>Not all conservatives are pleased, however.</p> <p>A member of Donald Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Extremely disappointed.</p>&mdash; Tony Suarez-NHCLC VP (@tonysuarez80) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c795c3e4b0f6cb85628bed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T02:45:53.618Z\">3.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Donald Trump, in conclusion:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.

And it must be solved - it must be solved quickly. Not fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber two: having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial. We rec the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, weapons and drugs,\u201d Trump said. The move is \u201cparamount to both the United States and to Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber three: Dismantling drug cartels,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis can only be done with cooperation, and intelligence and intelligence sharing.</p> <p>\u201cImproving Nafta, number four. Nafta is a 22-year-old agreement that must be update to reflect the realities of today,\u201d Trump said, which would make both countries \u201cstronger and keep industry in our hemisphere. We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world. Keep it in our hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber five: Keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere. When jobs leave Mexico, the US or Central America and go overseas, it increases poverty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bond between our two countries is deep and sincere, and both our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI call you a friend.

The visit is also a timely distraction from embarrassing reports, which have dominated recent headlines, that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">plagiarized</a> his law degree thesis. </p> <p>This week\u2019s bad press, which includes the <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20160830-mexico-federal-police-chief-sacked-drug-cartel-executions-michuacan\">sacking</a> of Mexico\u2019s police commissioner following allegations of cartel executions, follows months of looming scandals plaguing his own administration. These include large teacher strikes, allegations of the use of torture on ordinary citizens and most recently<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/mexico-first-lady-florida-property-government-contractor-documents-reveal\">reports</a> that the Mexican first lady\u2019s home is owned by a potential government contractor. All of the above have sent Mexican confidence in its president plunging.</p> <p>The embarrassing thing is that we can actually see Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s logic at work in real time as this disaster unfolds. The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy. There\u2019s only one problem with this plan. Trump may well hijack that narrative, frame the meeting to his advantage and then straight-up lie about the details in Arizona with a straight face.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/pena-nieto-mexico-visit-trump-approval-ratings-backfire\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto's making a dangerous gamble with Trump's Mexico visit | Daniel Pe\u00f1a</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:40:45.113Z\">at 6.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c70edae4b0f6cb85628b1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:11:10.748Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Democrats\u2019 <strong>efforts to swipe a US senate seat in Wisconsin are looking good,</strong> in a new Monmouth University poll of likely voters that has challenger (and former senator) Russ Feingold up 13 points, 54-41, on incumbent Republican Ron Johnson. </p> <p>Clinton leads Trump in the poll by a much smaller margin, five points, in a four-way race:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771031136751521792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wisconsin (Monmouth)<br><br>Clinton 43%<br>Trump 38%<br>Johnson 7%<br>Stein 3%</p>&mdash; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771031136751521792\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771032155409481728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last Republican to win WI was Reagan in 84, but there have been two very near-misses: W lost by 5k votes (0.2%) in &#39;00 and 11k (0.4%) in &#39;04</p>&mdash; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771032155409481728\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771032339099033600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Solid result for Trump, through mainly bc Clinton low <a href=\"https://t.co/ZeYyxRdbYF\">https://t.co/ZeYyxRdbYF</a></p>&mdash; Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771032339099033600\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cThe current presidential election race in Wisconsin is looking a lot like the 2012 contest right now,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.</p> <p><strong>Update: and Marquette University </strong>has issued a new poll, minutes after the Monmouth poll, with a five-point lead for Clinton among registered voters in Wisconsin but only a three-point lead among likely voters:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pbump/status/771035873509052416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Marquette in Wisc.: <br>Clinton +5 (RV)<br>Clinton +3 (LV)<br>Was Clinton +15 w/ LV on 8/7, Clinton +4 w/ LV on 7/10<br>Farewell, convention bump.</p>&mdash; Philip Bump (@pbump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pbump/status/771035873509052416\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MULawPoll/status/771036116199804928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Huge percentage&quot; of electorate not supporting any of the four candidates, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PollsAndVotes\">@PollsAndVotes</a> says. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mulawpoll?src=hash\">#mulawpoll</a></p>&mdash; MULawPoll (@MULawPoll) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MULawPoll/status/771036116199804928\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:30:30.875Z\">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c70d32e4b04fe839bc5303\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:01:17.945Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former president Fox stays after Trump on Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/771029599098589184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> will explain the &quot;unexplainable&quot;?

At a press stop with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian crisis, claiming that he didn\u2019t discuss with the Mexican president his infamous pledge that Mexico would pay for a border wall.</p> <p>It turned out this was only technically true \u2013 there was no discussion, but only because the Mexican president had immediately begun their conversation by saying he would not pay.</p> <p>In his Phoenix speech Trump brushed all that off. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump renewed his call for what he called a deportation taskforce. Without using its title he yet again endorsed Operation Wetback, the infamous Eisenhower-era policy of mass deportation, while lamenting shortcomings. \u201cThey would drop them across, right across, and they\u2019d come back.\u201d Instead Trump pledged to take those he deported \u201cgreat distances\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He repeated testimonials from the parents of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants, using these to frame the issue not as humanitarian or even economic, but about crime and \u201cthe wellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>Trump did not explicitly call for the all-out deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 something he has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">signaled support</a> for in the past despite even most immigration hawks opposing the idea. But he still insisted: \u201cAnyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not touch on the controversial topic of birthright citizenship, which he has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/19/birthright-citizenship-history-law-donald-trump-republicans\">opposed in the past</a>, even to the point of claiming this constitutional provision can be reversed with an act of Congress \u2013 a view few credible legal scholars would endorse.</p> <p>The theater around the speech felt like a reversion to Trump\u2019s rowdy ways in the primary race. \u201cThis will not be a rally speech per se,\u201d he said at the outset. But nor was it a detailed policy rollout. Much of it comprised traditional talking points and railing against Hillary Clinton, while taking detours to mock \u201cmedia elites\u201d who viewed \u201cglobal warming\u201d as a problem.</p> <p>Down to the \u201cMake Mexico Great Again Also\u201d hats, worn by the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, it was a return to the unpredictable showmanship that has defined Trump\u2019s campaign. Red meat for his party\u2019s conservative base, with nothing to attract moderate suburbanites, let alone Latinos or African Americans, who have been alienated by his harsh rhetoric.</p> <p>It represented the final chapter in what has been a back and forth debate within his campaign about whether Trump should try to act like a conventional candidate or simply be himself. That debate outlasted multiple campaign managers, the Republican primary itself, and continued well into the general election.</p> <p>It is now over. There will not be a more moderate Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump.</p> <p>Instead the same candidate who announced that Mexicans are \u201cbringing drugs, bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists\u201d is the one who will appear before voters in November.</p>",

  "<p>Following a successful run in the United States, a vibrant stage production reimagining American political history as a rollicking musical has arrived in Australia.

Remember that?</p> <p>This is a play concerned with the infamous hardening of a Clinton (just not the Clinton we usually think of when we think of that word). And while Hillary\u2019s rise may be presented as merely a consequence of Bill\u2019s betrayal, no one leaving the theatre will be unclear about who pulls the strings in the relationship. </p> <p>Australian playwrights Michael and Paul Hodge deconstruct the contradictions of William Jefferson Clinton by dividing him into two separate characters, with the positively presidential WJ (Simon Burke) at odds with his sunglasses-wearing, sax-playing, dress-ruining alter ego, Billy (Matt Dyktynski).
