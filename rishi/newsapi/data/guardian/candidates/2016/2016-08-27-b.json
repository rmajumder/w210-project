  "<p>Donald Trump on Saturday spelled out new details of his immigration policy. He did not, however, answer lingering questions about whether he favors deportation for all undocumented migrants.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">Donald Trump politicizes death of Dwyane Wade's cousin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking at a fundraiser for the Iowa senator Joni Ernst, the Republican nominee for president went beyond his now famous promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico. </p> <p>If elected, he said, he would \u201cinstitute nationwide <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify\">E-Verify</a>, stop illegal immigrants from accessing welfare and entitlements, and develop an exit-entry tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed\u201d. </p> <p>Although these policies were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-mexico-economy\">in an immigration plan</a> proposed in August 2015, they have been rarely addressed since then, as the real estate developer as gone from long shot to major party nominee.</p> <p>Trump offered no clarity on whether he would after all push for the deportation of all 11 million undocumented migrants currently in the US, a long-term and successful campaign promise. Uncertainty on his stance on the issue took hold this week, after he reportedly told Hispanic leaders at a roundtable meeting that he might be willing to support a path to legal status. </p> <p>Trump subsequently told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity</a> that he would be willing to allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the US.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll pay back taxes,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have to pay taxes, there\u2019s no amnesty, as such, there\u2019s no amnesty, but we work with them.\u201d </p> <p>Of his views on the immigration question, he added: \u201cThere could certainly be a softening.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee had long pledged to support \u201ca deportation force\u201d to remove all 11 million undocumented migrants. On Thursday, he seemed to flip-flop on the issue again, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">telling CNN</a>: \u201cThere\u2019s no path to legalization unless they leave the country. When they come back in, then they can start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and then come back.\u201d</p> <p>In Iowa on Saturday, Trump attacked the media for focusing on the deportation question instead of other aspects of his immigration policy. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.\u201d </p> <p>Trump claimed that law enforcement agencies knew about every single illegal immigrant, \u201cthe good ones and the bad ones\u201d, and said that on day one of his administration all \u201ccriminal illegal immigrants\u201d would be \u201cswiftly removed\u201d. </p> <p>The deportation of illegal immigrants who commit crimes has bipartisan support and has long been a priority of the Obama administration. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has suggested that he will soon deliver a definitive immigration speech, clearly stating his position.</p>",

The CLP had retained just two. Three independents had won, and it would likely be four.</p> <p>David Tollner, former treasurer and member for Fong Lim, who was not preselected for this election, predicted there would be more independents in parliament than CLP members.</p> <p>The official Labor event, held at the Waratahs sporting club on the outskirts of Darwin\u2019s CBD, was full of Labor faithful as well as city and suburban candidates.</p> <p>Around the corner the CLP gathered in Cullen Bay. The food was better but the mood was sombre. The leader had remained in Alice Springs.</p> <p>Gunner entered the Labor room to shouts and chants of congratulations, and he walked a slow gauntlet of hugs and high-fives, but the audience\u2019s attention waned during his speech and rarely a moment went by without people talking and others shushing them.</p> <p>In one resonating moment, Gunner spoke of his lifetime association with the NT. He is the first territory-born chief minister to be elected since self-governance in 1978.</p> <p>\u201cA boy born in Alice Springs, who grew up in public housing Tennant Creek, who now stands here as chief minister of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory\">Northern Territory</a>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn the Northern Territory you can dream big.\u201d The crowd erupted.</p> <p>Gunner said he would work with the independents and CLP opposition, and pledged unity and consultation \u2013 two things the electorate had indicated were missing during the CLP term.</p> <p>\u201cYou all deserve access to us and we will govern for all Territorians.

  "<p>The UK is putting elephants at risk of extinction through its broken promises on the ivory trade, according to campaigners. Before the last election, the Conservative party pledged to shut down the UK\u2019s domestic ivory market: at the time 30,000 elephants a year were being slaughtered for their tusks. But no action has been taken.</p> <p>While bans on the international trade in ivory exist, a failure to observe similar measures at a national level is being exploited by criminal gangs who smuggle ivory into the UK, where it can be passed off as antique. Now, in the run-up to a major conference, <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/global_ivory_ban_loc_en2/?pv=95\">more than 1.6 million people have signed a petition on the Avaaz activist website</a> calling for the world\u2019s domestic ivory markets to be closed down for good.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s broken promises to ban ivory sales in Britain are being paid for in the blood of African elephants,\u201d said Avaaz campaign director Bert Wander. \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s most vocal advocates against the illegal wildlife trade, the UK must now practise what it preaches. Otherwise, China and other ivory hotspots will see no reason to put in place the permanent ban on ivory we need to stop elephants being wiped from the face of the Earth.\u201d</p> <p>Avaaz hopes the petition will put pressure on politicians, wildlife experts and conservation groups attending next month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cites.org\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> in Johannesburg, where they will consider a range of measures to protect endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cThe existence of these domestic markets definitely has had a negative impact on African elephant populations,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cSimply put, if it were illegal to sell ivory \u2013 whether in China, Japan, the US, or the UK \u2013 there would be far less incentive for traffickers and organised criminal syndicates to traffic ivory, making it much harder for them to launder illegal ivory, and giving far less incentive to poachers.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/apr/30/kenya-burns-largest-stockpile-of-ivory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4tnvd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2496838\"            data-video-name=\"Kenya burns largest stockpile of ivory - video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP/ Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5724d0b3e4b0f300275c806a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11461808&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/apr/30/kenya-burns-largest-stockpile-of-ivory-video\">Kenya burns largest stockpile of ivory</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Conservatives gave manifesto commitments to close down the trade in ivory in the UK in 2010 and 2015 and the government promoted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/12/illegal-wildlife-trade-50-nations-london-summit\">conference on the illegal wildlife trade</a> in February 2014 which pushed for the measure.</p> <p>A large number of African nations have promised to outlaw domestic ivory markets, while France, the US and, crucially, China have introduced their own bans or are in the process of doing so.</p> <p>Between 2009 and 2014, 40% of all customs seizures in the UK were ivory items. Last year about 110kg of ivory was stopped at Heathrow alone. \u201cThe UK is really lagging behind,\u201d said Jonathan Baillie, conservation director at the Zoological Society of London. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand why exactly. We were in a very strong leadership role. There are some potential barriers to introduction, but the Americans seem to have been able to deal with all the issues.\u201d</p> <p>Ivory is prized for a variety of reasons. In Japan it is used to make family seals; in the Philippines it is used for religious artefacts. Baillie said elephants would be protected only if all nations observed a domestic ban. \u201cTo take the economic value out of ivory it really requires everyone to play ball. If you have a number of countries that don\u2019t go along with it, it really weakens the incentives for those nations to maintain their commitments.\u201d</p> <p>Lieberman said a UK ban would be symbolically important. \u201cI personally have had Chinese government officials say to me, \u2018Why should we close our markets, when we can find ivory very easily across London?\u2019 The UK needs to show it is serious about stopping poaching of elephants and trafficking in ivory.\u201d</p> <p>Under the ban, owners of ivory could hand it on to others but not sell it. There would be exceptions \u2013 such as the sale of particular antique instruments that use ivory.</p> <p>Experts say the ban is urgently needed. There are about 450,000 African elephants left. But 30,000 a year are being slaughtered. \u201cI worked in central-west Africa in 2001,\u201d Baillie said. \u201cIf I went back there would be less than half the number now than were there then. If we can close the international trade and the domestic markets there is going to be no reason for people to go in and kill these elephants.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the government was working on its pledge to implement a total ban on ivory sales. \u201cThe illegal wildlife trade is a global issue and will only be solved through global cooperation. That is why we continue to lead the international community to protect the world\u2019s most iconic wild animals and to stop the organised criminal networks behind this brutal and unnecessary trade.\u201d</p> <p>Lieberman conceded that prohibition was not a magic bullet. \u201cCertainly it won\u2019t stop smuggling 100%, into the UK or elsewhere, but if the UK closes its market it will be far harder for illegal ivory to be laundered as legal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Even as the partisan divide on gun rights widens in the US, an overwhelming majority of both Clinton and Trump supporters say they support several of the gun control reform proposals that have failed to pass Congress over the past few years, according to a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/26/opinions-on-gun-policy-and-the-2016-campaign/?utm_source=adaptivemailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=16-08-26%20guns&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=229&amp;lea=26626&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=\">new national survey</a> from the Pew Research Center. </p> <p>Seventy-five percent of Trump supporters said they favor background checks on private gun sales and sales at gun shows, as did 90% of Clinton supporters.

Twice as many, 65%, said gun ownership does more to \u201cput people\u2019s safety at risk\u201d than it does to protect them, the survey found. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/pew-gun-by-party/\" data-alt=\"Compared with 2000 and 2012, the partisan gap in support for gun control is widening.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/pew-gun-by-party/\">Compared with 2000 and 2012, the partisan gap in support for gun control is widening.</a> </figure>  <p>Asked simply whether gun rights or gun control is more important to them, Americans showed a dramatic partisan split: 90% of registered voters who support Trump said protecting gun rights was more important than controlling gun ownership, and only 9% said they prioritized controlling gun ownership. <br></p> <p>Clinton supporters said the opposite: 79% of the Democratic nominee\u2019s supporters said that controlling gun ownership was more important, compared with 19% who said they put more value on protecting gun rights. </p> <p>The 70-point partisan gap in support for gun control over gun rights has nearly doubled since the 2012 presidential election, when only 62% of Barack Obama\u2019s supporters said they prioritized gun control, and a much larger 21% of Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s supporters agreed. </p> <p>But these dramatic partisan divides over gun rights disappeared when Americans were asked about some specific gun control policies, including whether they supported \u201cmaking private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks\u201d.</p> <p>In all, 83% of respondents said they supported this policy.

Military-style semi-automatic rifles are rarely used in overall American gun murders, but they have been used in several high-profile mass shootings. </p> <p>Overall, only about half of respondents supported these bans. But 74% of Clinton supporters favored a ban on assault-style weapons, which the candidate has endorsed, compared to 34% of Trump supporters. </p> <p>The survey also found clear demographic differences in support and opposition to bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, with a majority of women supporting the bans and a majority of men opposing them. Respondents with a college degree were most likely to support a ban on assault-style weapons. The ban also has relatively strong support among people who said they had a gun in their household: 45% said they supported a ban, compared to 61% of people in non-gun-owning households. </p> <p>The Pew survey also found that Republican support for an assault weapon ban has continued to shrink in the wake of a series of high-profile mass shootings. Last year, 44% of respondents who were Republican or leaned Republican said they supported a ban on assault-style weapons. This year, only 35% of them said they supported a ban. </p> <p>The Pew report\u2019s findings are based on a telephone survey of a national sample of 2,010 adults conducted in early August. </p> <p>Gun control has become a fiercely contested campaign issue between Clinton, who labeled the NRA one of her top enemies, and Trump, who was endorsed early by the NRA, which continues to champion him. The next president will likely determine the partisan balance of the supreme court, a decision that could affect how the court interprets the limitations of Americans\u2019 constitutional right to own and carry guns.

  "<p>In a US election cycle of unprecedented absurdity, much of 2016\u2019s best political comedy has simply allowed the candidates to speak for themselves. Satirist Vic Berger regularly takes unedited comments by Donald Trump and amplifies their lunacy with the aid of hyperactive visual editing and the odd airhorn sound effect. Film-maker Mike Diva\u2019s recent viral video Hillary Clinton: Meme Queen satirised the former secretary of state\u2019s desperation to appeal to young voters by having a lookalike instruct them to \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls\u201d. Believe it or not, the line was a direct quote from a recent Clinton stump speech.</p> <p>Berger and Diva are among the bright sparks over at <strong>Super</strong> <strong>Deluxe</strong>, a \u201ccommunity of creative weirdos\u201d responsible for some of the strangest viral hits and video series on the web. Mini Last Meals parodies the current YouTube fad for cooking tiny versions of popular dishes, only with miniature reproductions of serial killers\u2019 final meals. Stoned Mode offers such strangely therapeutic sights as artisanal head shaving, neon sign bending and clowns shooting firearms in the desert. The History Of Butts is exactly what it sounds like.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl8NUwCeDrs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jl8NUwCeDrs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Central to Super Deluxe\u2019s success, however, is its political content. Since the brand\u2019s relaunch last December, at a time when the presidential primaries were only just beginning to descend into farce, Vic Berger has been on a one-man mission to refit political satire for the Snapchat era. In the vein of Britain\u2019s Cassetteboy, Berger\u2019s work often features no original material whatsoever, instead turning politicians\u2019 own speeches, debate performances and social media efforts against them. A pandering video of Jeb Bush answering a series of tech-themed either-or questions thereby becomes a dead-eyed recitation of Apple\u2019s product line, while one of Donald Trump\u2019s quotidian self-aggrandisements mutates into a boast about his ability to form a clenched fist.</p> <p>Of late, Berger has stepped in front of the camera to anchor the Vic Berger Election Special, in which he brings the Super Deluxe ethos direct to the Democratic and Republican national conventions. Across 45 glorious minutes, our host strives courageously to pick up his press credentials, has more than one encounter with right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and unsuccessfully schemes to get 60s chart-topper Chubby Checker inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Directed by Tim Heidecker of comedy duo Tim &amp; Eric, the two-part video is every bit as riotous and ridiculous as the election itself. If the most polarised presidential race in a generation isn\u2019t doing much for the state of contemporary political discourse, at least it\u2019s making satire great again.</p>",
  "<p>What happens when political language fails? When the rage and incomprehension boil over, and we run out of a common vocabulary and sufficient trust in each other\u2019s words to be able to sit down and work through what unites and divides us? Don\u2019t expect much comfort from history. From the fall of Athens to the rise of totalitarianism, observers from Thucydides to George Orwell have associated a breakdown in public language \u2013 or rhetoric, to give it a more traditional name \u2013 with the failure of democracy, loss of freedom, civil strife and, ultimately, tyranny and murder.</p> <p>We are children of the Enlightenment, brought up to believe that we must always dig below the surface to get at the truth, and that nothing could be more of the surface than rhetoric, that slap of paint politicians use to cover who knows what. No wonder we usually want to work back from deficiencies in the way we hear political ideas expressed to what we take to be more fundamental causes \u2013 ideology, group values and affinities, the major economic and social challenges of the day. But there have been periods, in both ancient and modern history, when observers have come to believe that the causality can flow in the opposite direction, and that it is when public language fails that politics as whole starts to fall apart.</p> <p>So let\u2019s talk about 2016. In Britain, the ugly shambles that passed for a once-and-for-all national debate about our place in Europe. In the US, an official candidate for the presidency seemingly capable of any exaggeration or untruth \u2013 including wondering aloud if the US\u2019s gun owners couldn\u2019t do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">something to stop Hillary</a> Clinton \u2013 but still retaining the support of tens of millions of voters. In continental Europe, the extremists gaining ground in many countries, the ultra-rightist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/norbert-hofer-austria-presidential-hopeful-rightwing\">Norbert Hofer</a> within millimetres of the Austrian presidency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> polling well in the run-up to next year\u2019s French presidential race. And almost everywhere \u2013 whether in the debating chamber, on prime time TV or the smartphone in your pocket \u2013 a sense of a public discourse that is losing its power to explain and reconcile, or indeed to express anything beyond hatred and division.</p> <p>These trends have many social, economic and political causes, but public language \u2013 the language we use when we discuss politics or policy, or make our case in court, or try to persuade anyone of anything else in a public context \u2013 seems to me to be at the heart of the matter. Indeed, I believe we are living through what amounts to a crisis in public language.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s not make the mistake of\u00a0confusing anti-rhetorical \u2018truth-telling\u2019 with actually telling the truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The crisis is playing out in many ways, but perhaps the most important is the failure of conventional political rhetoric in almost every western country. The gap between the claims and promises of political leaders and the facts on the ground \u2013 about inequality, globalisation and the crash of 2008, about immigration, about the west\u2019s unhappy wars in the Middle East, and much else besides \u2013 became insupportably wide. As opinion polls in the US, UK, France and elsewhere demonstrate, many voters have simply stopped believing a word of it.</p> <p>But the death of a political rhetoric is not like a royal succession, with the crown passing smoothly from one monarch to the next. We\u2019re living in a disputed interregnum, with many politicians refusing to accept that the old queen is dead and strange pretenders popping up everywhere \u2013 anti-politicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, mavericks from within existing political structures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz\">Ted Cruz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> \u2013 each with their own rhetorical recipe for fame and glory.</p> <p>Of course, the pretenders would deny that they were in the rhetoric business at all. If they mention the word, it is only in the context of the detested public language of the establishment. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t abide it\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d that Trump-before-the-fact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a> once remarked. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in what needs to get done.\u201d Trump\u2019s own appeal depends more than anything on the belief that he is a truth-teller untainted by the lying ways of conventional politicians: early in the primary campaign, one representative Fox News poll found that 44% of a sample of US voters, and 62% of Republicans, agreed with the statement: \u201cHe tells it like it is, and we need that now in a president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46a3e01d23e1f78ad34b2e862a131f813aa363e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46a3e01d23e1f78ad34b2e862a131f813aa363e7/0_71_3108_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedian, actor and political activist Beppe Grillo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaking out \u2026 comedian, actor and political activist Beppe Grillo.

One of the advantages of noisily rejecting any notion of rhetoric is that, once listeners are convinced you\u2019re not trying to deceive them in the manner of regular politicians, they may switch off the critical faculties they usually apply to political speech and forgive you any amount of exaggeration, contradiction or offensiveness. And, if rivals or the establishment media then point this out, your supporters may dismiss it as spin. Here is Florida voter Yolanda Esquivel, quoted by the BBC in November 2015, rejecting criticism of Trump for his outspokenness: \u201cI\u2019m looking at what candidates can do, not the picky little things they say that people want to make a big deal of.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Gove\u2019s statement that \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d was a more fine-grained attack on the conventional rhetoric of the establishment. At first blush, it sounds like \u2013 and was immediately and bitterly condemned as \u2013 an attack on expertise as such. I see it rather as an attack on the sound of modern technocratic government, a claim that the public are sick and tired of we-know-best lectures from economists and others, lectures that are couched in impenetrable jargon and that, despite their weighty tone at the time, frequently turn out to be wrong.</p> <p>The difficulty that ordinary voters have in making sense of the language of elite policymakers is a real issue. One Ipsos MORI survey identified what the researchers called a \u201cpresumption of complexity\u201d on the part of many respondents, which meant they thought it was hopeless to even try to understand the issue in question. But is Gove\u2019s proposed solution to the problem to fire the experts en masse? It seems unlikely: in the education department and elsewhere Gove was a notably technocratic minister, steeped in data and expert advice. Is it rather to hang on to the technocrats, but to hide them from public view so that their complicated ideas no longer irritate non-expert listeners? That\u2019s scarcely a recipe for restoring public confidence. Or should we see his statement as a piece of instrumental rhetoric itself, a cynical way of rubbishing the legions of pro\u2011Remain economists while simultaneously presenting the speaker himself not as a paid-up member of that hated elite, but as one of those simple souls who prefers honest ignorance to the slipperiness and insufferable superiority of the overeducated?</p> <p>Gove took care throughout the Brexit campaign to speak with more directness and less of qualification than is usual among senior British politicians. Asked on the same occasion whether he would stand to be Tory leader, he just said: \u201cCount me out.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine anything clearer or more straightforward \u2013 a refreshingly candid response from a post-rhetorical politician. Within days, that statement was no longer \u201coperative\u201d, to use the term coined by Nixon\u2019s press secretary Ron Ziegler. Clarity and straightforwardness are no guarantee that something is true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4b5390773bb49d1548148016a8561a775ad1155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b5390773bb49d1548148016a8561a775ad1155/0_0_4016_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan for Review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan for Review</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: EDWARD CARVALHO-MONAGHAN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the west, anti-politicians from outside the mainstream, and those mainstream politicians who hope to use some of the anti-politicians\u2019 populist mojo to advance themselves and their causes within conventional political structures, are trying to strike this \u201clet\u2019s cut through the rhetoric\u201d pose. But, whether or not they and their supporters are aware of it, anti-rhetoric is itself a classic move in the rhetorical game \u2013 indeed, in the right circumstances, it can be the most persuasive move of all. And, like any other form of public language, we can unpack it to find out what makes it tick. Here\u2019s Trump addressing a stadium of supporters in Dallas in September last year:</p> <p>I made a beautiful speech. I thought it was wonderful. Everything was fine. A week and a half later, they attacked me. In other words they went through \u2013 and then they lied. They made it up. I\u2019m talking about illegal immigration \u2026 We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it. [Cheers and applause] We have to do it. Have to do it. [Audience: USA! USA! USA! USA!] And when I hear some of the people that I\u2019m running against, including the Democrats, we have to build a wall, folks. We have to build a wall. All you have to do is go to Israel and say, \u2018How is your wall working?\u2019 Walls work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All rhetoric is\u00a0designed for a particular time and place, and above all for a particular audience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those super-short sentences emphasise certainty and determination, but build up layer by layer towards a climax with a kind of emotional logic. It\u2019s a style that students of rhetoric call parataxis. This is the way generals and dictators have always spoken to distinguish themselves from the cavilling civilians they mean to sweep aside. Julius Caesar\u2019s famous summary, not of his invasion of Britain, but of his victory in the Battle of Zela \u2013 \u201cVeni vidi vici\u201d, \u2018I came, I saw, I conquered\u2019 \u2013 is a classical example of parataxis. Today listeners are more likely to associate it with the successful entrepreneur or chief executive.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s style of parataxis is almost infinitely compressible, as his intuitive mastery of the micro-rhetorical world of Twitter shows: \u201cLightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chokker [sic]! Mr Meltdown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLightweight\u201d, \u201cchoker\u201d, \u201cMr Meltdown\u201d \u2013 this is personal in every sense of the word, and written personally on the spur of the moment or dictated in real time to a thick-fingered aide, if that last miskeyed \u201cchokker\u201d is anything to go by. But it contains no fewer than three different summaries of the Trump view of Senator Rubio, each of which is immediately and eminently retweetable. Twitter seems to have influenced Trump\u2019s set piece oratory as well; often he obsesses over a single word or a phrase, like someone feverishly circling something objectionable in a newspaper. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was accusing Barack Obama of creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s the founder of Isis. He\u2019s the founder of Isis. He\u2019s the founder. He founded Isis. I would say that the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5af5959f120f6dfc99e3bb7da44759a85d42f56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5af5959f120f6dfc99e3bb7da44759a85d42f56/31_0_2923_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump in Austin, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Telling it \u2018like it is\u2019 \u2026 Donald Trump in Austin, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he actually mean it when he says things like this? Nodding to a concept in quantum mechanics, the Urban Dictionary defines a \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s douchebag\u201d as someone who makes an unacceptable remark and then waits to see the reaction before declaring retrospectively whether they meant it for real or were \u201cjust joking\u201d. But perhaps in Trump\u2019s case the indeterminacy is genuine, and the words just tumble out of his mouth without him even bothering to decide at the time whether they are to be taken at face value or as a sarcastic, fantastic throwaway.</p> <p>The fluidity, the way the words follow a still-emerging train of thought, adds to the sense of spontaneity and candour. Perhaps because of that (and to the despair of many of those around him), he has so far largely refused to abandon this style of speaking in favour of prepared texts and the Teleprompter. In that Dallas speech, he starts an idea \u2013 \u201cIn other words they went through \u2026 \u201d \u2013 presumably intending to say something like, \u201cThey went through my speech and twisted what I said and presented it out of context.\u201d But this is exactly the kind of whiny complaint which conventional politicians make, so halfway through he drops it in favour of the far punchier \u201cand then they lied\u201d. Isn\u2019t lying what these political and media enemies are all about? Cut to the chase. \u201cAnd when I hear some of the people that I\u2019m running against, including the Democrats\u201d, sounds as if we\u2019re about to get a paragraph attacking other would-be Republican nominees, or the Democratic contenders, or both. But Trump doesn\u2019t want to waste time pointing out the different ways in which Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are defective candidates. In fact he doesn\u2019t sound very interested in other candidates at all. So he simply leaves it out and jumps, mid-sentence, to the main thing on his mind: \u201cwe have to build a wall, folks\u201d.</p> <p>The immoderation is calculated. Professional politicians have traditionally wanted to be viewed as wise counsellors; mastering the detail and carefully weighing up the options before making a policy proposal; at least seeming to listen to serious objections made to them by opponents. Trump speaks as if the truth and the right policies were blindingly obvious, and the so-called wise counsellors who claim that the world is a complex place, and that policymaking needs to take account of that complexity, are idiots or in somebody\u2019s pocket. Saying the \u201cunsayable\u201d is the clearest possible way of signalling this contrary stance. But for Trump, stamping on political correctness is not just effective positioning. He has found a wanton ecstasy in it, a joyous spasm of indignation in which supporters are only too happy to lose themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s douchebag makes an unacceptable remark and gauges the reaction before declaring whether they meant it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Trump style eschews any kind of rhetorical cleverness. The shocking statements are not couched in witty or allusive language. His campaign slogan \u2013 Make America Great Again! \u2013 could hardly be less original or artful. Everything is intended to emphasise the break with the despised language of the men and women of the Washington machine. There is a wall between them and you, Trump seems to say to his audience, but I am on this side of the wall alongside you. They treat you as stupid, but you understand things far better than they do. The guarantee that I see the world as you do is the fact that I speak in your language, not theirs.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">British EU referendum</a> campaign lacked the mad fireworks of the current US presidential cycle, but it too rapidly descended into wild exaggeration and insult, with the public looking on in palpable bewilderment. \u201cWhat we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides on this,\u201d was the weary verdict of Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie MP in the days before the vote. \u201cI think it\u2019s confusing the public, it\u2019s impoverishing political debate.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/25/donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton-campaign-live-coverage\">Trump's campaign CEO once charged with domestic violence, reports say \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet clear rhetorical winners and losers still emerged. The Remain camp never found an emotionally compelling way of expressing the case for continued membership of the EU; there was no idealism nor even \u2013 at least from the most prominent leaders of the campaign \u2013 evidence of an iota of enthusiasm to put alongside the 10 plagues of Egypt with which they sought to scare off anyone contemplating departure. The Brexit messaging was both more chaotic and more irresponsible \u2013 Nigel Farage beaming in front of a poster depicting a sea of refugees worthy of Josef Goebbels himself, promises made during the campaign cheerfully revoked within hours of the votes coming in \u2013 yet the Leavers also found language with a power and cogency that eluded their adversaries. Take back control. Independence Day. Both these phrases offer the listener agency and at least the prospect of opportunity and hope. Dismissed as absurd, not just by the opposing politicians but by much of Britain, they nonetheless pushed Brexit over the top.</p> <p>Perhaps you find this kind of phrase-making glib and repellent and are amazed that anyone could be taken in by it. Perhaps you regard the success of Trump\u2019s novel style of oratory as nothing more than final confirmation that many Americans have lost their wits. Yet all rhetoric is designed for a particular time and place, and above all for a particular audience \u2013 it is a supremely tactical, contextual art \u2013 and these words probably weren\u2019t intended for you. And you must accept that by the same token the public language that most persuades you, whether it\u2019s the fierce rhetoric of rights and inclusion or the measured rationality of evidence-based policymaking, and whether delivered with the soaring inspiration of the young Obama, the dogged persistence of a Bernie Sanders or a Jeremy Corbyn, or the authoritative and affectless calm of an Angela Merkel or a Theresa May, can ring every bit as hollow in other ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b876b6534b1b1daf900917a6d6c51cc34651bbd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b876b6534b1b1daf900917a6d6c51cc34651bbd4/0_0_2902_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukip leader Nigel Farage poses in front of a poster depicting refugees during the EU referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukip leader Nigel Farage poses in front of a poster depicting refugees during the EU referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how did we get here \u2013 and what, if anything, can we do to begin to put things right? I\u2019m sceptical of any theory that is predicated on the wickedness or insanity of any one set of actors in this drama. It\u2019s easy to blame politicians and parties with whom you happen to disagree, but this doesn\u2019t account for the fact that similar changes are taking place in public discourse in radically different political cultures and across ideological polarities: the mainly leftwing critics of Andrew Lansley\u2019s attempt to reform the NHS under a Tory-led coalition in this country used some of the same rhetorical tactics as the conservative opponents of Obamacare in the US. For me, the loading of all blame on to the political other is not a diagnosis but a symptom of the disease. Nor do I believe, as Tony Blair suggested in his 2007 \u201cFeral Beast\u201d speech, that the principal culprits are the media. That is also too simplistic \u2013 not that I think that my profession is entirely blameless.</p> <p>I believe instead that the crisis in our public language springs from a set of interlocking political, cultural and technological forces \u2013 forces that go beyond any one ideology, or interest group, or national political situation. The first factor is the changing character of western politics, with previous affiliations based on class and other forms of traditional group identity giving way, especially after the end of the cold war, to a more complex and uncertain landscape in which political leaders struggle for definition and differentiation. With policy platforms more arguable and coalitions of interest more transient, it\u2019s hardly surprising that political rhetoric has become more fissiparous and \u2013 because, when tribal loyalties recede, the character of individual politicians becomes more salient \u2013 more personal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet has opened a Pandora\u2019s box of extremism and fury, and the vitriol spills back into real-world politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second factor is that widening gulf between the worldview and language of the experts who make modern policy and those of the public at large. Modern government is inescapably technocratic and \u2013 precisely because western societies have already made gigantic gains in many areas \u2013 the trade-offs involved in any new policy proposal are more finely balanced than they used to be: it was far easier to decide in the aftermath of the second world war that London needed a major new airport than it is to decide today whether that airport should have an additional runway. The ranks of economists, statisticians and planners assemble vast quantities of evidence to support the political decision-making process, but neither they nor ministers seem to believe it is feasible, or perhaps even desirable, to try to share much of this with the public. As a result, there are often two quite distinct discourses about a given policy question: a sophisticated, evidence-based conversation between the illuminati who sit behind the closed doors of Whitehall, the European Commission and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">IMF</a>; and an instinct-based and often emotional wrangle in the realm of retail politics. One way of thinking about the Brexit debate is as a clash between these two modes of political discourse, with that of the professional policymakers coming off a poor second.</p> <p>The next factor is digital technology and its impact both on pre-existing media and on the wider dissemination and discussion of political ideas. Over three decades or so, technology has driven an astonishing expansion of media choice and it has democratised the generation and dissemination of political opinion. It has also disrupted legacy business models, squeezed investment in newsrooms and in specialist journalistic expertise, and left most news publishers, whether venerable analogue-era institutions or digital startups, edging towards economic survival mode \u2013 chasing audiences, optimising headlines, courting shock and controversy. Apart from a handful of players, seriousness, restraint and a sense that journalists have a duty to make major public policy choices intelligible to the public have all been in retreat.</p> <p>The web and the major social platforms have also allowed anyone who wants to take part in a new 24/7 worldwide discussion of politics, culture and pretty much everything else. Alas, alongside much that is thoughtful and constructive, the new technologies have opened a Pandora\u2019s box of (often anonymous) abuse, extremism, intimidation and fury. And the vitriol spills back into conventional media and real-world politics \u2013 I saw it myself in July at the Republican convention in Cleveland (\u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d was the least of it). The internet has set a new dark standard for the expression of strong opinion, which some politicians, activists and commentators are only too happy to meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/death-of-neoliberalism-crisis-in-western-politics\">Neoliberalism has had its day. So what happens next? | Martin Jacques</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fourth force at work is related to our understanding of how persuasive language works. Over the course of the 20th century, empirical advances were made in the way words are used to sell to goods and services. They were then systematically applied to political messaging, and the impressionistic rhetoric of promotion increasingly came to replace the rhetoric of traditional step-by-step political argument. The effect has been to give political language some of the brevity, intensity and urgency we associate with the best marketing, but to strip it of explanatory and argumentative power.</p> <p>What can we do? The forces at work are formidable and tend to reinforce each other. We are adaptable creatures and we know that our life together depends on our being able to resolve our differences at least most of the time, so it\u2019s reasonable to hope that one day this difficult and disruptive period of political, social and technological transition will yield to a new equilibrium and a recovery of the public language on which the health of our democracies depends. We can\u2019t know for sure if or when that will happen, but there are some steps we could take right away.</p> <p>Politicians could treat the public like grownups and share some of their actual thinking about policy, including those painful trade-offs, with the people they want to vote for them. Reciprocal altruism might even lead them to shout less and allow their opponents to finish the sentence more often so that those same opponents extend the same courtesy to them. The media too could cut fewer corners and take more chances with the journalism that costs more \u2013 international reporting, investigations \u2013 but may ultimately make for a better business. Without in any way going soft, it could allow politicians more space to address the public in their own words. As for the public themselves? Let\u2019s teach our children rhetoric. Teach them how words and images are used, and abused, to sell packaged goods, political parties and wars, holy or otherwise.</p> <p>Of course, any programme of reform has to begin with an acknowledgement that there is a problem. If this weird and unsettling year has nothing else to teach us, we can still hope that 2016 will go down as the moment we took that crucial first step.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Thompson is CEO of the New York Times and former director general of the BBC.
