The CPD\u2019s polling averages were Hillary Clinton (43%), Donald Trump (40.4%), Gary Johnson (8.4%) and Jill Stein (3.2%).</p> <p>Clinton and Trump will therefore be the only candidates to take part in the first debate, at Hofstra University on 26 September. </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, will not take part in the vice-presidential debate, which will be contested by Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia on 4 October.</p> <p>Johnson and Stein could still qualify to appear in the second and third presidential debates, on 9 October at Washington University in St Louis and on 19 October at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. The CPD said the 15% standard would be reapplied closer to those dates.<br></p> <p>Johnson has said it will be \u201cgame over\u201d for his campaign if he does not make the presidential debates, two more of which follow the opener at Hofstra. He has been <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">averaging around 8%</a> in national polling, but believes the debates could help him reach a much wider audience.<br></p> <p>In a statement released on Friday, he said: \u201cThe CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys \u2018only\u2019 9% or 10% in their hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the total population of Ohio and most other states. </p> <p>\u201cYet, the Republicans and Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of Americans.\u201d<br></p> <p>Johnson has been critical of the debate selection process, arguing that the criteria for candidates to make the stage is skewed in favor of Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cI would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate,\u201d he said on Friday, \u201cbut I\u2019m not. After all, the commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see. </p> <p>\u201cAt the time of its creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that they didn\u2019t want any third-party intrusions into their shows.\u201d</p> <p>In September 2015 Johnson and Stein <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/29/libertarian-and-green-parties-sue-commission-presi/\">filed a lawsuit</a> against the CPD, arguing that candidates be included if they are on the ballot in enough states to have a chance of securing 270 electoral college votes and are eligible to serve. The suit <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/05/media/debate-lawsuit-gary-johnson-jill-stein/\">was dismissed</a> by a federal judge in August.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump on Friday named one of the nation\u2019s top anti-abortion activists to his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential candidate has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/17/restricting-abortion-republican-controlled-congress\">fully embraced Republicans\u2019 typically harsh stance against abortion</a>.</p> <p>Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the Republican nominee. Trump\u2019s campaign also announced that he would commit to a law banning public funding of abortion.</p> <p>The appointment is a sharp about-face for both Dannenfelser, formerly one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics, and the Republican presidential nominee. Although he has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">espoused harsh anti-abortion positions</a>, Trump has nevertheless spent much of the campaign out of step with the anti-abortion establishment \u2013 praising Planned Parenthood and, conversely, calling for the punishment of women who have abortions illegally. </p> <p>In response, anti-abortion groups have sometimes accused Trump of being ignorant of their positions. </p> <p>On Friday, Dannenfelser signaled that her group considered Trump\u2019s policies to be wholly in line with the anti-abortion movement\u2019s priorities. Trump \u201cdoubled down [on his] commitments to the pro-life movement\u201d, Dannenfelser said. \u201cThe contrast could not be clearer between the two tickets, and I am proud to serve as national chairwoman for Donald Trump\u2019s pro-life coalition.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement is a further sign that Trump has succeeded in wooing social conservatives who once viewed the Manhattan real estate magnate with suspicion and chimes with his choice of Mike Pence, governor of Indiana, as his running mate. The former congressman is credited with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/mike-pence-republicans-defund-planned-parenthood-abortion\">drawing up the blueprint for the Republican party\u2019s crusade against Planned Parenthood</a>. </p> <p>Trump has only recently claimed to oppose abortion. In 1999, in his last public statement on abortion before he flirted with a presidential run, Trump proclaimed himself to be \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d. He first declared he was \u201cpro-life\u201d in 2011 at an annual conservative confab.</p> <p>During the Republican primaries, Dannenfelser was one of the loudest voices to oppose Trump, calling on Iowa caucus-goers in a January <a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\">letter</a> to \u201csupport anyone but Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cWe are disgusted by Mr Trump\u2019s treatment of individuals, women, in particular,\u201d the letter read. \u201cTrump \u2026 has through the years made disparaging public comments to and about many women.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92a130ab512f8f7cd51153936612a3b4f12195dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a130ab512f8f7cd51153936612a3b4f12195dd/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reproductive rights groups immediately condemned Marjorie Dannenfelser\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reproductive rights groups immediately condemned Marjorie Dannenfelser\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her comments came as Trump repeatedly equivocated on abortion rights and one of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s most cherished goals, the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>A little more than a year ago, Trump said he could not commit to defunding Planned Parenthood without weighing whether the group was \u201cgood for women\u201d.

In April, he further angered anti-abortion groups by saying he believed abortion should remain legal. \u201cThe laws are set,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we have to leave it that way.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/mike-pence-republicans-defund-planned-parenthood-abortion\">How Mike Pence wrote the Republican Planned Parenthood attack playbook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His campaign in both cases quickly sought to undercut his comments, claiming the candidate believed in punishment only for abortion providers and saying Trump would appoint anti-abortion nominees to the supreme court.</p> <p>In Friday\u2019s announcement, Trump committed for the first time to signing the Hyde amendment into law. The amendment is an annual budget rider that prohibits federal Medicaid funding from paying for abortion services. Making the amendment law is the strictest position Trump has staked out on abortion funding, although it is not surprising.

  "<p>When Donald Trump went to Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday in his first visit to the city since lead was detected in the water in 2014, he began, inappropriately enough, with a joke.</p> <p>\u201cIt used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint,\u201d Trump said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-visit-water-plant-tour\">Flint residents bristle at Donald Trump's visit to beleaguered city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his appearance at a Methodist church Wednesday, Trump added that the lead poisoning \u201cwould have never happened if I were president\u201d. On the contrary: under a president Trump, what happened in Flint could happen everywhere. It would be the inevitable outcome of what is quite possibly the only Trump policy we can be sure of: radical deregulation.</p> <p>Look at what happened in Flint in the 1980s: when nearly all of General Motors\u2019 plants in the city were either deemed to be noncompliant or flagged for potential noncompliance with EPA regulations, GM started closing its plants rather than face increasing labor and cleanup costs, according to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11117022/flint-michigan-water-crisis-lead-pollution-history\">an investigation</a> into the source of the Flint water contamination by the Verge. (Industry is not to blame for the whole water-poisoning debacle, but neither is it innocent.)<br></p> <p>Local officials were more worried about saving money than protecting the safety of Flint residents. But they didn\u2019t poison the water to begin with \u2013 a whole structural array of forces did, including Trump\u2019s beloved private sector dumping untreated waste.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the best check on the kind of gross state and local government mismanagement that we saw in Michigan is the EPA. The problem in Flint was not what the EPA did; it\u2019s what it didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s that the EPA was by an order of magnitude far too weak and inactive.<br></p> <p>As Joel Beauvais, head of the agency\u2019s water office put it in <a href=\"http://www.clickondetroit.com/live/watch-live-house-oversight-committee-holds-hearing-on-flint-water-crisis\">his testimony</a> before the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, the EPA urged local authorities to address the lack of corrosion control in Flint\u2019s water, \u201cBut (the EPA) encountered resistance.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump had his way, the agency would be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-says-hed-eliminate-department-of-environment-protection/article/2584908\">gutted</a> entirely. And that gets to the heart of what\u2019s so terrifying about a potential Trump presidency.</p> <p>Set aside the outlandish racism \u2013 the calls to build a wall on the border and seize oil in the Middle East \u2013 and his campaign is still in essence a Mitt Romney-esque embrace of right-wing deregulation.</p> <p>He\u2019s not trying to hide that fact. After leaving Flint, he turned around the very next day to condemn the EPA\u2019s Clean Water Rule in a speech in New York Thursday, and earlier this year, Trump lackey Chris Christie discussed Trump\u2019s desire to fire federal workers at the EPA and other regulatory agencies, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">replacing them with CEOs</a>.</p> <p>As New York magazine <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">noted at the time</a>, \u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, progressives won\u2019t have to worry about former banking executives regulating their old colleagues \u2014 active CEOs will be doing that for their current ones.\u201d (You might replace \u201cprogressives\u201d with any old human worried about being poisoned.)</p> <p>Perhaps Christie\u2019s own abysmal record on clean water is worth mentioning as well. He recently vetoed a bill aimed at protecting children from lead poisoning in a cost-cutting measure that protects his budget, uncannily similar to the cardinal sin of local officials in Flint. Under Christie\u2019s administration, environmental inspections and enforcements have been slashed by at least 60%, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/02/flint_can_happen_in_nj_with_christie_siding_with_water_polluters_opinion.html\">according to</a> the New Jersey Star-Ledger. </p> <p>But let\u2019s keep the focus on Trump. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">the John Doe papers</a> leaked in the Guardian this week, Trump donated to the third-party group of a special prosecutor accused of coordinating with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s recall campaign along with, guess who? The head of a lead paint company facing millions in lawsuits from poisoned residents.</p> <p>Walker would later sign off on legislation granting effective immunity to the lead paint industry (the law was later <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/report-scott-walker-wisconsin-club-for-growth-received-support-from/article_b805be8e-b7f7-5b07-a7a6-682e1f4847f8.html\">blocked</a> by a federal court). And though Trump was not directly involved with that issue, he was broadly on their side of the political battle, donating $15,000 to the group at the center of the investigation. As in Flint, the population most affected was poor children.</p> <p>Defunding federal regulatory agencies like the EPA is simply easier to do as the country\u2019s chief executive than anything else Trump is proposing \u2013 Congress is <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245137-house-panel-approves-3017b-bill-to-cut-epa-funds-block-climate\">already halfway there</a>. The upshot is the most tangible policy behind the plan to make America Great Again at this point is to let America\u2019s kids be poisoned, again. The proof is looking at us in Flint.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump on Friday attempted to resolve an issue that is thought to have caused him significant damage with minority voters by admitting that Barack Obama was born in the US after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-movement-election-live\">Trump finally admits Obama was born in the US \u2013 campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Speaking in the presidential ballroom of his new luxury hotel in Washington, Trump boasted about his new establishment, trotted out over a half-dozen generals to fawn over him and then almost casually remarked that he now thinks the president was born in the US, before walking swiftly away in what bore more resemblance to a dog and pony show than a campaign event.</p> <p>Trump finally said the words \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period\u201d after <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/05/fact-check-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-birther-movement-obama/83968036/\">falsely blaming</a> Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign for starting the rumor, an accusation that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/?tid=a_inl\">the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker called</a> \u201cridiculous\u201d.</p> <p>Although Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement on the topic last night, the Republican nominee had never publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.</p> <p>Trump had long fanned the flames of this conspiracy theory, known as \u201cbirtherism\u201d. He spent much of spring 2011 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/donald-trump-birther-obama.html?_r=0\">garnering media attention</a> by constantly claiming without any evidence that Obama might have born overseas.

  "<p>The Liberal Democrats are poised to become the first major political party to back a dedicated new tax to help rescue the NHS from its deep financial problems.<br></p> <p>The party is about to start examining the wisdom and practicalities of introducing a ringfenced tax which would involve a one pence increase in either income tax or National Insurance. </p> <p>The party has recruited a panel of senior doctors and NHS experts to advise it on how what it calls \u201ca dedicated NHS and care tax\u201d would help ease the health service\u2019s decade-long financial squeeze. </p> <p>Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem health spokesman, will on Saturday tell party activists gathered at its annual conference in Brighton that there is a very strong case for embracing the move, despite the political risk inherent in a tax rise. </p> <p>\u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that we are falling further behind other European countries in how much we spend on health and care. So let\u2019s look at the case for a dedicated health and care tax, shown on your pay packet,\u201d Lamb will say. </p> <p>\u201cWe must be honest with the British people. If we believe that more money is needed, if we conclude that we all need to pay perhaps an extra penny in the pound, then we must be prepared to say it. We must give this [idea] proper consideration,\u201d he will add. </p> <p>The Treasury has estimated that a 1p rise in income tax would raise \u00a33.9bn this year, rising to \u00a34.5bn next year and then \u00a34.6bn in 2018-19. Without major reforms to how care is provided, the NHS in England is facing a \u00a322bn gap in its finances by 2020-21. </p> <p>The party\u2019s \u201cnew Beveridge group\u201d of advisers will include Dr Clare Gerada, the outspoken ex-chair of the Royal College of GPs, who recently defected to the Lib Dems from Labour; Prof Dinesh Bhugra, an ex-president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists; and Prof Nick Bosanquet, an expert in health economics at Imperial College London who has also worked with Reform, the right-of-centre thinktank that works on public sector reform. </p> <p>Prof Chris Ham, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund thinktank, welcomed the Lib Dems\u2019 consideration of the move as a sign of realism at Westminster that the NHS in England cannot survive intact without receiving more money than the \u00a310bn extra it is due by 2020-21. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not possible for the NHS to continue to meet rising demand for services and maintain current standards of care without additional funding,\u201d said Ham. \u201cIncreasing funding for health and social care is affordable if hard choices are made about how to find the additional resources needed.</p> <p>\u201cAs the party conference season begins, it is essential that all the parties face up to the need for an honest debate about how to provide adequate funding to meet future needs for health and social care,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Lamb will tell delegates that health and social care need special treatment in government spending because, unlike other public services, the costs involved are rising relentlessly by about 4% a year, due to the ageing and growing population and rise of lifestyle-related conditions such as obesity and lung diseases. </p> <p>Sir David Nicholson, the chief executive of the NHS in England until 2014, has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/sep/19/david-nicholson-need-new-tax-fund-nhs\">backed</a> the idea of a ringfenced NHS tax. Last month Dr Dan Poulter, the Conservative MP who was a health minister until the 2015 general election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/27/uk-needs-new-tax-to-save-nhs-social-care-from-collapse\">threw his weight</a> behind it too. <br></p> <p>Government sources indicated that ministers were unlikely to embrace an NHS-specific tax rise any time soon. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: \u201cOn the back of a strong economy, we are giving the NHS the \u00a310bn it asked for to fund its own plan for the future, including almost \u00a34bn this year to transform services and improve standards of care. </p> <p>\u201cWe know the NHS is under pressure because of our ageing population, but we rightly expect hospitals to have a grip on their finances and continue to ensure patients get treated quickly.\u201d </p> <p> </p>",

  "<p>On Thursday, Jimmy Fallon had Donald Trump on the Tonight Show and ended the segment by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BYqzdiuJc\">saying</a>, \u201cDonald I want to ask you, because the next time I see you you could be the President of the United States. I just want to know if there is something we could do that\u2019s just not really presidential, really \u2013 can I mess your hair up?\u201d Trump let him and the NBC audience roared with laughter. But, for many of us, this is very far from being a joke. </p> <p>Giving comic cover to Trump just isn\u2019t funny when he\u2019s unleashed forces of anti-blackness and anti-immigrant sentiment. He\u2019s labelled Mexicans rapists, raised the prospect of a ban on Muslims, patronized and insulted African Americans while pretending to be a potential new hope. As a result, Fallon managed to come over as one powerful white man protecting another.</p> <p>Not only was it not funny. It didn\u2019t do anything to take Trump down a notch (if it was even meant to). Instead, it humanized him, boosting him on that stupid metric so many Americans use when choosing a president: \u201cHey, he\u2019s a guy I\u2019d want to have a beer with! Look at him, letting Fallon have fun with him!\u201d</p> <p>Fallon had real power last night and squandered it. I can\u2019t imagine Chelsea Handler, Trevor Noah or the recently departed Larry Wilmore building up Trump like that. </p> <p>By smoothing over Trump\u2019s hatefulness with comedy, he allowed the Republican candidate\u2019s supporters to say \u201cHey, can\u2019t you all take a joke?!\u201d I have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/hate-trump-still-hold-clinton-accountable\">highly critical of Hillary Clinton</a>, but the misogyny directed at her by his supporters, who sell \u201c<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/25/trump-clinton-misogynistic-merch/\">Trump That Bitch!</a>\u201d shirts and who scream \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/29/politics/donald-trump-lock-her-up/\">lock her up!</a>\u201d is terrifying and wrong.<br></p> <p>Trump was handed a chance to change the story on a day when his conspiracy-minded views on President Obama\u2019s nationality were back on the agenda. The routine smoothed the way for Trump to say he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/776808050875371521\">now believes</a> Obama <em>was</em> born in the US, dashing off before answering any questions about his long espousal of birtherism \u2013 which he now blames on Clinton. </p> <p>Jimmy Fallon, you\u2019ve given permission for all of this to be chalked up as one big joke.<br></p> <p>The writer Sarah Schulman recently <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarah.schulman.56/posts/10157468767695188?pnref=story\">asked</a> whether it was \u201cthe TV entertainment class that has sold out this country to Donald Trump\u201d. CBS president Les Moonves basically admitted as much when <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464\">he said</a> Trumpism \u201cmay not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS\u201d. Now, NBC seems to concur. In January of 2015, NBC <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/nbc-cuts-ties-donald-trump-immigrant-remarks-article-1.2275244\">admirably cut ties </a>with Trump on the Apprentice and Miss Universe when he called Mexicans rapists. But like most corporations, when they saw how much power he wielded \u2013 that he could wind up in the Oval Office \u2013 it wanted access. And so last fall they <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/donald-trump-monologue/2933530\">let Trump host Saturday Night Live</a>, Fallon\u2019s old stomping ground, before allowing him to engage in good humored chat with Fallon last night.</p> <p>We see you, Jimmy Fallon. You are as \u201capolitical\u201d as the wretched Jay Leno was, a champion of the status quo. You think the idea of Trump in the White House is as harmless as your face on a pint of Ben and Jerry\u2019s. </p> <p>Maybe it is to you, as a powerful white man on TV who doesn\u2019t have to worry about life as a woman, Muslim, Black or Latin person, immigrant, or queer American living under Trumpism (an era which has already begun and will continue, regardless of whether Trump is elected). Your skit was nothing like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1fMvLbE85E\">Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Great Dictator</a>, which brilliantly skewered a rising leader of the right. In fact, you did the opposite, making Trump seem more palatable. When history looks back on this moment, we may well say: Jimmy Fallon, you helped build a monster. </p>",
  "<p>All real Donald Trump press releases sound like they were composed of lines cut from satirical Donald Trump press releases.

Far from it. That an American psycho stands but one remove from the White House is as deadly serious as it gets, and those opposed to Trump\u2019s hideous and historically ominous ideology must do everything they can to stop him. I do not mean to sound defeatist. But I am constantly staggered at how staggeringly ineffectual those who were once the best and the brightest are in the face of post-fact posturing.</p> <p>I wish it were otherwise, but there is something very dating about the mere act of engaging with Trump\u2019s lies, like watching a respected comedian misfire with an out-of-touch bit about Snapchat. To watch a pundit even begin to pick apart that birther non-apology is to watch a human being age 10 years on screen in the time it takes to get to \u201cDonald J Trump is a closer\u201d. You might as well have a Socratic debate with a fart.</p> <p>A decade or so ago, I remember reading a statistic about how pretty much everyone under a certain cut-off age instinctively rang doorbells with their thumb \u2013 raised on games consoles and mobile phones and whatnot \u2013 while pretty much everyone over the age still used an index finger.

But with the greatest of respect to these viewpoints, I can\u2019t help feeling that a good portion of our best hope for countering Trumpvision lies in the hands of that younger (to me) generation, who reflexively seem to understand what in the name of insanity is happening now far better than their elders, and increasingly seem more likely to find a way of countering it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">Rick Astley: Never Gonna Give You Up</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Youth isn\u2019t always wasted on the young, and even the most self-regarding old hands must concede that Trump has almost all of them looking flatfooted.

Perhaps truth in politics will return ironically, like dad jeans or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/04/rick-astley-live-review\" title=\"\">Rick Astley</a>. Whether truth will ever be the market leader again, however, seems less certain with every hour of this mesmerically modern US presidential campaign (just as it did, in a smaller and even more post-imperial kinda way, during the Brexit referendum).</p> <p>Then again, perhaps anxiety about the absence of truth is far older than we neophytes care to imagine, there being precisely nothing new under the sun. \u201cIf truth be not fled with Astraea,\u201d remarked Jonathan Swift all the way back in 1711, \u201cshe is certainly as hidden as the source of the Nile itself, and can be found only in Utopia.\u201d Perhaps she can once again be found in the 24-hour political news cycle \u2013 though at present, you certainly wouldn\u2019t rule it in.</p>",
  "<p>On the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/09/15/donald-trump-health-dr-oz-sot-nr.cnn\">The Dr Oz Show</a> Thursday, Donald Trump spent only a fraction of the hour discussing his health, on his own terms. There\u2019s still a lot that he \u2013 and, for that matter, Hillary Clinton \u2013 still haven\u2019t told us, but a superficial, televised chat did little to change that.</p> <p>Dr Mehmet Oz started off his interview by asking Trump how he stayed healthy. Oz didn\u2019t delve much into the candidate\u2019s diet, though Trump has bragged that he loves <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/donald-trump-diet.html\">fast food</a>. With a <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm\">body mass index</a> of 29.5, Trump is overweight \u2013 practically obese. </p> <p>As for exercise, Trump says he golfs, but hasn\u2019t much lately, and poked fun at President Barack Obama\u2019s time on the green. \u201cHe could play on the PGA tour,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>During a commercial break, Dr Oz explained that lack of sleep has been linked to weight gain, heart disease and some cancers. He went on to say that sleep helps regulate your immune system and strengthens your memories. But when Trump told Oz he doesn\u2019t need much sleep, Oz didn\u2019t delve into it. </p> <p>An occupational hazard of running for president is all the handshaking, which exposes candidates to innumerable viruses and bacteria at a time when they\u2019re exhausted. Trump, a self-professed <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hand-shaking-germ-exposure_us_5702c1cee4b0daf53af06a8f\">germaphobe</a>, no doubt carries his own stash of alcohol-based hand sanitizer on the road, as Obama does on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQKUtEAULi8\">advice of his predecessor</a>, but Oz didn\u2019t inquire about that either.</p> <p>Dr Oz then moved on to the \u201c<a href=\"mailto:https://meded.ucsd.edu/clinicalmed/ros.htm\">Review of Systems</a>,\u201d a long checklist of symptoms that\u2019s usually part of the form you fill out in your doctor\u2019s waiting room. It\u2019s a tool doctors use to jog patients\u2019 memories and elicit additional symptoms of concern. It was cursory, at best.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s blood pressure and labs were all in the normal range, though his blood glucose, if fasting, was concerning for prediabetes. This would have been a great opportunity for Oz to educate his audience about the links between obesity, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, kidney and liver disease and various other medical conditions. Absent from <a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_Medical_Records_.pdf\">Dr Harold Bornstein\u2019s report</a> on Trump\u2019s health was a complete blood count and kidney function tests, labs most doctors would order before checking liver and thyroid function tests or a testosterone level. Absent signs or symptoms of disease, <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations/\">it\u2019s unclear that Trump needed some of the tests he\u2019s had</a>, such as the EKG, chest x-ray and echocardiogram.</p> <p>As for Clinton, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/05-physician-letter/HRC_physician_letter.pdf\">her blood pressure was even lower</a> than Trump\u2019s and both have cholesterol levels in the normal range. Clinton\u2019s calcium score \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/details/results/rsc-20201923\">the higher the number, the higher the risk of heart attack</a> \u2013 was zero in contrast to Trump\u2019s 98. In other words, her risk of a heart attack is very low while he\u2019s at moderate risk. Clinton has had a normal breast cancer screening, but there\u2019s no mention of her having colonoscopies. Trump\u2019s doctor reports he last had a normal colonoscopy in 2013.</p> <p>Still, neither candidate has released anything close to their complete medical records. Releasing a letter or two from one\u2019s personal doctor, as Trump had prior to his Dr Oz appearance, doesn\u2019t come close to releasing complete medical records. Nowhere in Bornstein\u2019s letter about Trump\u2019s health did he mention anything about the bone spurs that supposedly sidelined him during the Vietnam Conflict. Trump, who described sex in the 1980s as his own \u201c<a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diary/Anteater/2016/02/17/trumps-vulgar-admission-avoiding-stds-women-personal-vietnam/\">personal Vietnam</a>,\u201d must have taken tests for sexually transmitted diseases over the years. Trump reports having been hospitalized once for an appendectomy at age 11, but we haven\u2019t seen those records.<br></p> <p>As for Hillary Clinton \u2013 who wasn\u2019t involved in the Dr Oz broadcast but whose health status became part of the news cycle when she was diagnosed with pneumonia \u2013 where are the records of her healthy child visits and childhood vaccinations? Of the prenatal care, including STD tests, she received when pregnant with Chelsea? In recent years, Clinton has suffered from falls, which could all be due to exhaustion or dehydration, but could also be a sign of an abnormal heart rhythm or other heart condition. And we don\u2019t know why she takes coumadin, a blood thinner.</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/09/13/risks-in-full-disclosure-of-presidential-candidates-health-records/\">does the public need full access</a> to a candidate\u2019s medical records to determine if candidate is healthy enough to serve as Commander in Chief? Or is this just to satisfy our own prurient interests?</p> <p>What is relevant is whether either candidate has a chronic or life-threatening medical condition that would prevent them from doing their job or would lead to their untimely death while still in office. </p> <p>We all get the occasional cough or cold. Sick with intestinal flu, Former President <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/jan-11-1992-president-bush-sick-japan-9357727\">George HW Bush famously vomited and collapsed</a> at a state dinner given in his honor at the home of Japanese Prime Minister. It was embarrassing, but he recovered. What I want to know is what Trump\u2019s going to do to avoid developing full-blown diabetes or having a heart attack, and how Clinton\u2019s going to take better care of herself so she doesn\u2019t drive herself to the point of exhaustion.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s health are really a demand for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/arts/television/on-dr-oz-trump-offers-placebo-transparency.html\">transparency</a>, but neither Trump nor Clinton is offering anything close to that. Both candidates have long relationships with their personal physicians. Doctors want to help their patients and may be biased, whether consciously or not, in reporting on their health when so much is at stake. </p> <p>The best way to give voters the answers they need isn\u2019t a data dump of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/05/23/ST2008052300934.html\">thousands of pages</a> of medical records. Even then, those records may not be complete and still need to be interpreted in the context of an up-to-date interview and physical exam. Early in the campaign, candidates should submit to examination by objective third party physicians \u2013 whether they be <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/09/13/risks-in-full-disclosure-of-presidential-candidates-health-records/\">former Surgeon Generals</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/hill-physician_pulled_into_2012_politics-207714-1.html\">attending physician for Congress</a> \u2013 so that they are all held to the same standards. </p> <p>We need a system that respects patient privacy, even when those patients are our presidential candidates, while answering voters\u2019 reasonable questions about a candidate\u2019s ability to serve.</p>",

Which makes Heather Donahue\u2019s experience rather unique \u2013 star of a smash film, but in hiding so that nobody will know she is in fact an actor, and is in fact very much alive. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"577ad9968b783526434dc0f55f633797f3b6a9a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577ad9968b783526434dc0f55f633797f3b6a9a8/0_0_1922_1410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A promotional \u2018missing\u2019 poster used to coincide with the US release of The Blair Witch Project in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional \u2018missing\u2019 poster used to coincide with the US release of The Blair Witch Project in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the reboot out this week it was a pleasure to get her perspective on the phenomenon \u2013 and while I was never the biggest fan of the original (absolutely chilling final shot aside) it has certainly whet my appetite for this new Blair Witch. <br></p> <ul> <li>Do you remember the film the first time round?

It\u2019s such an arresting image, taken by New York photographer Joni Sternbach, and is in contention for the 2016 Taylor Wessing prize. Sternbach uses processes used in 19th century early photography to give images a strangely disorientating look. Two other photographers are shortlisted: Kovi Konowiecki for his series on Orthodox Jews around the world; and Claudio Rasano for a student in his school uniform.

People generally, acting together through mechanisms such as participatory budgets or citizens' assemblies chosen by lot - are far wiser than elites chosen by elections. Everything stems from this - not least the accepted lunacy mindset that locks us into policies of economic growth versus stable-state economies.</p> <p>Without changing our disastrously dysfunctional governments - and very rapidly too - we are doomed as a species.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <ul> <li>What do you think?

The 56-year-old former businesswoman will have to contend with a party riven by infighting between various factions, including Farage loyalists, a circle around the former Conservative cabinet minister Neil Hamilton, and others close to Douglas Carswell, the party\u2019s only MP.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>James has exerted her authority over the party by axing planned conference speeches by Neil Hamiltion, leader of the Ukip group in the Welsh assembly, Lisa Duffy, her main rival for the leadership, and the other leadership candidates. </strong>Hamilton, and to a lesser extent Duffy, are seen as critics of the Farage wing of Ukip with which James is loosely associated.

Whoever succeeded Nigel Farage was likely to plunge Ukip into charisma deficit but, on the basis of that speech, Diane James seems remarkably bland. To her credit, though, she acknowledged quite openly that she was not a colourful character. \u201cI am not Nigel-like, I am not even Nigel-lite,\u201d she said. You certainly can\u2019t argue with that.</p> <p>Still, dull and sensible is not always a bad thing in politics and, although James did not say anything particularly specific in her speech, she did give some indication as to what sort of leader she will be. She stressed the importance of Ukip having a credible manifesto and she said the party should be offering \u201cpragmatic\u201d solutions to the country\u2019s problems. That means the era of bonkers ideas like<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/04/15/ukip-2015-manifesto_n_7068920.html\"> compulsory uniforms for taxi drivers </a>is definitely over. By Ukip standards it was a remarkably moderate speech. The only line that slightly jarred was her claim that Ukip was the \u201copposition party in waiting\u201d (a touch of David Steel telling the Liberals to go back to their constituencies and \u201cprepare for government\u201d?) But she compensated for that with a reasonably good line about the Conservatives and \u201cmagpie May\u201d stealing Ukip policies.</p> <p>But that only raised the question that Alexander Phillips (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c#block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c\"> 9.51am)</a> and others have been asking: if Theresa May is adopting Ukip policies, then what is the role for Ukip? Like Farage earlier, James said Ukip would be insisting that Brexit does actually materialise, but she sounded far less suspicious on this front than Farage did and her demands (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dbebcce4b0e813b694da80#block-57dbebcce4b0e813b694da80\">1.57pm) </a>sounded much the same as Liam Fox and David Davis\u2019s. In fact, about the only thing she said that would have sounded out of place in a speech at the Conservative party conference was her attack on first-past-the-post.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why Labour will be pleased by the speech. Ukip lead by a working-class leader with a northern accent committed to blue collar issues would have been a huge threat to Jeremy Corbyn. A party led by someone who sounds like a Tory is much less of a worry.</p> <p>But in one respect, at least, James\u2019s election should make Labour feel uncomfortable. The Tories are on their second female leader, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the DUP all have female leaders, the Greens have one too, but the only parties yet to get in on the act are the UK\u2019s two biggest \u201cprogressive\u201d ones, Labour and the Lib Dems. Quite why this should be is a bit of a mystery.

(See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dac330e4b0e813b694d5b0#block-57dac330e4b0e813b694d5b0\"> 9.18am.) </a>It is very rare to see a politician stand down having succeeded so completely in his own terms and, if this speech was triumphalist, then that was understandable. But in fact it was more reflective than smug, and Farage was very interesting as he reminisced on how Ukip had emerged from nothing, and how PR (for the European elections) was absolutely crucial to the party\u2019s success. Whether electoral reformers will regard that as good or bad for their case is another matter.</p> <p>Otherwise, by Farage\u2019s standards, it was relatively low key. Apart from taking a swipe at Neil Hamilton, he avoided the temptation to engage in internal party score-settling. (Perhaps he got that out of his system<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/farage-on-carswell-i-dont-know-why-he-joined-10579532\"> with Sky.) </a>Instead he gave us some clues as to what he will be doing next: supporting leave movements in other EU countries, and building up a profile in the US. He repeated his claim that Ukip has a huge opportunity to take votes from Labour. And, interestingly, he set three tests for Brexit. Two of those may well be achieved by 2020: British passports (preferably old-style blue, hard-cover, inconveniently-sized ones, he implied) and withdrawal from the single market. But the chances of Britain having exclusive access to fishing waters up to 200 miles off the coast are slight because EU countries almost certainly would not accept this, and the threat of retaliatory measures would make it not worth the risk (<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7669\">see this House of Commons briefing paper)</a>. So it may be that Farage is already setting the conditions for a \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d narrative that Ukip could use in the 2020 general election.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T11:54:22.357Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57dbd45de4b0e813b694d9f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T11:16:25.903Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Farage is getting an adulatory standing ovation.</p> <p>And now they are giving him three cheers - which is very Ukip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dbd430e4b0e813b694d9f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T11:15:38.010Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Farage ends by saying that, now he is no longer constrained by office, he will be free to speak his mind.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dacc3ee4b0e813b694d5de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T11:14:45.819Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Farage says he will help parties in other EU countries campaigning to leave the EU</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Farage says he is not leaving politics.

The party is at once libertarian and authoritarian. It preaches individual freedom but contains admirers of Vladimir Putin. It wants to privatise the National Health Service, apart from when it does not. It has flirted with both a tax on luxury goods and deep tax cuts for the richest. It hems and haws on gay marriage, halal food and the burkini. It is vague about what sort of immigrants Britain should let in, and in what numbers. Even on the EU it is utterly divided: some (like Mr Carswell) want Britain outside the union to become a European Singapore, while others (like Aaron Banks, the forthright businessman who bankrolled the party\u2019s pro-Brexit efforts) want something more like a return to the 1950s.</p> <p>All parties, and especially populist ones, contain a range of views. Yet they tend to congregate around certain stretches of the political spectrum. Founded in pursuit of Brexit alone, UKIP has no such common ground. On sprawling, defining themes like the vocation of the state, the meaning of nationhood, the interaction of public and private spheres, and the roles of pluralism, globalisation and citizenship in modern societies it has no continuity and is irredeemably at odds with itself. That inhibits it from establishing and sticking to the sort of long-term strategy it needs to become and remain more professional.</p> <p>This points to a grim cycle. The last time Mr Farage resigned, UKIP tumbled. For 11 ignominious months Lord Pearson, a languidly aristocratic former Tory, trashed his party\u2019s prospects: in a television interview shortly before the 2010 election he appeared not even to have read its 14-page manifesto. All of which may now repeat itself. \u201cOne quite plausible possibility is we end up with a re-run of the Lord Pearson experience: a year or two of messy and incoherent leadership under a figure not cut out for the big leagues, then Farage comes back,\u201d suggests Robert Ford, a UKIP expert at Manchester University. The fact is that UKIP\u2019s weaknesses point to Mr Farage\u2019s weird genius. Besides the quest for Brexit, his unique schtick was all the party had. Now, again, it may be its only salvation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57daccf8e4b067ad3008811c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T09:00:54.697Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nigel Farage on Ukip's NEC</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier I quoted what<strong> Nigel Farage</strong> had to say about Ukip\u2019s national executive committee.

It is called the National Executive Committee. Many of its current crop are among the lowest grade of people I have ever met. To them, being a member of the governing body of Britain\u2019s third-largest political party is the equivalent of scaling Everest.</p> <p>People with no qualification in business or politics make the ultimate decisions of whom should be our candidate at a by-election. Or whether the former disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton should be given a route back to public life via being elected as an Assembly Member in Wales. It may sound odd to many but I have been a moderniser in Ukip. I have been fought at every step of the way by total amateurs who come to London once a month with sandwiches in their rucksacks, to attend NEC meetings that normally last seven hours.</p> <p>The new Leader of Ukip should bypass the vanity of such people and make big decisions about Ukip\u2019s future via direct polling of the membership. Yes of course, it brings risk but in a way we get back to the Brexit referendum result. Do you trust the political class or the people? Ukip must trust its members. Whoever wins, if they have the courage to transform the management of our party they will have my wholehearted support.</p> </blockquote> <p>It says a great about Farage that he views having sandwiches for lunch as a key indicator of someone\u2019s essential worthlessness. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyashton/another-bottle-please?utm_term=.fya7kRKmMD#.is3j5Jb0Xa\">Farage, of course, is a champion of the PFL - the \u201cproper fucking lunch\u201d.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T08:51:08.949Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/nigel-farage-aide-says-ukip-supporters-have-flocked-to-tories\">her interview with my colleague Anushka Asthana</a>, <strong>Alexandra Phillips</strong>, the former Ukip communications chief who has defected to the Tories, explained why Paul Nuttall is right to worry about more Ukip supporters switching.

Its supporters would claim that it is the most successful party in the history of British politics. Its detractors would claim that it is one of the most shambolic and useless. Both descriptions are reasonably accurate.</p> <p>Ukip has only won one national election (the European elections in 2014) and it only has one MP, but if you judge a party by whether it has achieved its key objective, then Ukip\u2019s record is hard to fault. Just over 20 years after it was founded, it got exactly what it wanted: a referendum on EU membership, and a vote to leave. No other party can make this boast. There is an argument to be had about quite how important a part Ukip played in the EU referendum campaign itself. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/douglas-carswell-im-having-far-too-much-fun-lo-leave-ukip\">(Douglas Carswell, Ukip\u2019s only MP, told the Guardian at the weekend that leave only won because Vote Leave ignored the approach favoured by Ukip\u2019s leader Nigel Farage.)</a> But Ukip was decisive in ensuring that the referendum was held in the first place. David Cameron has a hearty dislike for Farage and Ukip, and he conceded a referendum because he was under pressure to do so from Tory MPs, but those Tories had leverage because the Ukip started soaring after the 2010 general election and Cameron concluded that, without offering a referendum, the Conservative party could not win in 2015 (and/or he could not survive as leader).<br></p> <p>But, organisationally, Ukip is also a total disaster. In fact, it is so riven with hate and feuding that it makes Labour relatively harmonious. The intricacies of who loathes who are not straightforward (BuzzFeed\u2019s Emily Ashton wrote <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyashton/seriously-what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-ukip-right-now\">a very good, lengthy analysis a few weeks ago)</a> but essentially it is Farage, the outgoing leader who sought to run the party as a one-man dictatorship versus his enemies, not least those on Ukip\u2019s national executive committee, \u201camong the lowest grade of people I have ever met\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/08/01/ukip-needs-to-play-the-long-game-and-bypass-the-total-amateurs-on-the-national-executive-committee/\">as he describes them.</a><br></p> <p>Farage has had two stints as leader and he resigned for the second time (or the third if you included the 2015 resignation followed by the \u201cunresignation) after the Brexit vote.

  "<p>Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110,000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/14/outgoing-obama-plans-to-increase-refugees-by-twenty-nine-percent-next-year/\">furious</a> reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history.</p> <p>As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the \u201cJacobin\u201d ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than fairer-skinned immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone.</p> <p>Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama\u2019s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10,000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state.</p> <p>Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40,000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy.</p> <p>As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110,000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America\u2019s goal has been 85,000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States. </p> <p>In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25,000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canada\u2019s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups, parent-teacher associations and other non-governmental organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools. </p> <p>Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the president\u2019s modest proposal.</p>",

  "<p>To boost Donald Trump\u2019s prospects of becoming president, the National Rifle Association is poised to pour more than $15m into ads in several battleground states to defeat Hillary Clinton, the most vocal pro-gun-control presidential candidate in years, according to an NRA board member.</p> <p>The NRA has already plowed almost $6.5m into TV spots in several key states bashing Clinton and one NRA board member told the Guardian that the pro-gun goliath will spend \u201cmultiples\u201d of that figure by election day on the presidential contest.</p> <p>Next week, the NRA is slated to launch another seven-figure round of TV ads in Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Last month, the NRA made a $3m ad buy in these states that branded Clinton as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for accepting secret service protection, while calling for more gun control, which the ad charged \u201cwould leave you defenseless\u201d. An earlier NRA ad buy attacked Clinton on Benghazi.</p> <p>In 2012, the NRA spent $15m in the hope of making Barack Obama a one-term president, and this year\u2019s spending to defeat Clinton is expected to surpass that sum, according to the board member and another NRA source. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/gun-control-activists-dc-rally-nra-congress\">Gun control activists at DC rally pledge to vote NRA supporters out of Congress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The five million-member NRA\u2019s embrace of Trump, who once backed more gun control measures, has been spurred in part by its intense fear of a Clinton presidency. </p> <p> Democrats running for president have traditionally shown \u201ctrepidation\u201d about calling for more gun control, notes Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. But this year, Schlapp told the Guardian, \u201cthe NRA and gun enthusiasts are faced with the specter of a Democrat running for the White House embracing additional gun control\u201d.</p> <p>The NRA disdains Clinton\u2019s advocacy of moderate gun control measures \u2013including expanding background checks on gun purchases and reinstating a ban on assault weapons to curb mass shootings \u2013 but is fearful that she would nominate supreme court justices who do not concur with the NRA\u2019s staunch opposition to new gun controls.</p> <p>\u201cThis race is probably more about the supreme court than anything else from the NRA\u2019s perspective,\u201d said the NRA board member. </p> <p>The supreme court stakes are high: the vacancy created by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia is likely to remain open until the next president takes office. And the NRA is especially concerned that a more liberal court might overturn an earlier supreme court decision, known as Heller, which established an individual\u2019s right to keep a handgun in the house for self-defense.</p> <p>Significantly, the NRA\u2019s endorsement of Trump in May at its annual convention came earlier than usual: Mitt Romney and John McCain had to wait until October in 2012 and 2008 to get the NRA\u2019s blessing.</p> <p>The NRA\u2019s commitment to Trump was underscored when Chris Cox, the NRA\u2019s top lobbyist gave a primetime speech at the GOP convention this summer, a first for the increasingly GOP-oriented pro-gun lobbying behemoth. A senior GOP operative noted that historically the NRA \u201ctries to stay assiduously non-partisan. The dynamics of speaking at a convention are a little dicey.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/donald-trump-nra-guns-terrorism-watch-lists\">Trump to meet with NRA over barring guns for those on terrorism watch lists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NRA\u2019s big campaign blitz has been partly fueled by an aggressive fundraising operation which in recent years has targeted mega-donors. In 2014, for instance, the NRA received $4.9m from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the financial hub of the conservative advocacy network backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. The NRA is hoping to pull in another seven-figure grant this year, say two NRA sources, although nothing has come in yet and the Koch network itself is not focusing on the presidential race and Trump has been sharply criticized by Charles Koch.</p> <p>The NRA\u2019s entree to the Koch world stems in part from bonds that the gun group\u2019s top officials have forged. One donor who goes to the twice-a-year policy and fundraising retreats hosted by the Koch network, told the Guardian that the NRA\u2019s top executive, Wayne LaPierre, has attended them on a couple of occasions, affording him a chance to pitch and schmooze with big network donors such as investor Foster Friess.</p> <p>Another key big-money link involves the hedge fund tycoon Robert Mercer, who has given a pro-Trump Super Pac at least $2m, and is also a lifetime NRA member and a Koch network donor. This year Cambridge Analytica, a voter data firm in which Mercer is a key investor, has worked with the Herald Group, a DC-based consulting firm, to implement the NRA\u2019s \u201cTrigger the Vote\u201d drive to register new voters and get them to the polls. i360, a big voter data firm that is closely tied to the Koch donor network, has also been involved in the Trigger the Vote campaign. </p> <p>The pro-Trump blitz comes despite the real estate mogul\u2019s earlier backing for a ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods for background checks with gun purchases, ideas that the NRA has rejected. But Trump\u2019s high-decibel anti-gun-control rhetoric this year seems to have ingratiated him with the NRA brass, and coupled with the strong pro-gun records of Trump\u2019s two sons, proved instrumental in winning the NRA\u2019s backing.</p> <p>Trump and the NRA parted ways briefly earlier this year, when Trump responded to the Orlando massacre by suggesting that if the nightclub where it took place had allowed its guests to bring in arms, then the killings could have been averted. The NRA quickly shot back to distance itself from Trump: speaking to an ABC news show, the group\u2019s top lobbyist, Cox, said that Trump\u2019s calls for arming people in clubs \u201cdefies common sense. It also defies the law.\u201d</p>",

In contrast, Duterte was not only swift to deliver aid to Tacloban, one of the worst-hit areas but personally visited the devastation, giving a tearful speech criticising local government\u2019s inertia.</p> <p>Similarly, days after his now infamous \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx8MG5z5PPAhUIIsAKHU65CKoQFggkMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2016%2Fsep%2F06%2Fson-of-a-whore-was-not-meant-to-be-personal-duterte-tells-obama&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRJdKz0TW-x5wRo_rAnM-DziQqzA&amp;sig2=DXMnux7sEHPbWO0Hphv5gw\">son of a whore</a>\u201d comment to President Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/deadly-blast-philippines-night-market-davao\">a bomb blast in Davao City killed 15</a>. Within hours of the attack, photos of Duterte at the scene talking to victims were circulating on social media, again praising him for being on the ground. As indisputably dangerous as Duterte is, he is a foul-mouthed, cracking-jokes-about-shooting-people breath of fresh air the Philippines has never experienced before.</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s mass execution of the low hanging fruit in the Philippines drug trade will serve only to highlight how drugs have filled the vacuum created by successive governments. Filipinos did not vote for Duterte; they voted for a jab at the establishment that has, for the past five decades, consistently let them down.</p>",

The false allegations that Obama was born in Kenya were widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle.</p> <p>Obama was born in Honolulu on 4 August 1961.</p> <p>In a 2014 interview, Trump\u2019s oldest son Donald Jr, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-jr-in-2014-praised-his-dads-moral-conviction-on-obama?utm_term=.ohLMe1Dxy#.tc8qA2orM\">praised</a> the New York real estate developer\u2019s birtherism as a sign of his father\u2019s integrity. \u201cDon\u2019t we want politicians to have strong opinions about things that aren\u2019t swayed by public opinion,\u201d asked the younger Trump.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Clinton was quick to cite Trump\u2019s initial refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division.</p> <p>Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push conspiracy theories surrounding Obama\u2019s birthplace.</p> <p>\u201cHe still wouldn\u2019t say Hawaii.

When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\u201d</p> <p>In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no innuendo or dog whistles any more,\u201d Clinton said of the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s all right out there in the open now.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day Trump reiterated his economic vision, pledging to voters that he would \u201clower your taxes beyond any number you thought possible\u201d at a rally in New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>The promise came just hours after Trump unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-jobs-vision-25-million-economic-policy\">the latest iteration</a> of his fiscal policy at the New York Economic Club in a speech where he said he outlined the ambitious goal of creating 25 million jobs over the next 10 years. The Republican nominee promised to drastically slash taxes with savings coming from reducing federal bureaucrats whom his campaign has derided with phrases like \u201cthe FDA Food Police\u201d. Trump pledged that the result would increase economic growth from 2% to 3.5% and \u201cturn America into a magnet for new jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s remarks came after her four-day absence due to pneumonia. Before the Washington event, she first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">returned to the campaign trail</a> with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. Taking stage to James Brown\u2019s I Feel Good, the former secretary of state said she took sick days to \u201creflect\u201d. </p> <p>Clinton told the crowd: \u201cBeing on the trail does not encourage reflection. It\u2019s important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what this campaign is all about.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, who has been reluctant to take questions from reporters on the campaign trail, later held a brief press conference after her speech where she dodged repeated questions about when she told running mate Tim Kaine about her diagnosis. </p> <p>The subject of health was relevant for both candidates as an interview of Trump with television personality Dr Mehmet Oz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">aired on Thursday.</a> There, Trump brandished a doctor\u2019s letter and insisted that, although he could lose a few pounds, he was in peak health. In December, Trump\u2019s doctor, Harold Bornstein previously published a letter that said Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. The Republican nominee is a septuagenarian fond of fast food who doesn\u2019t exercise. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also continued his hostility towards reporters. Trump bragged at his New Hampshire speech that his travelling press pool wasn\u2019t able to attend, which he called \u201creally good news\u201d and proclaimed to a cheering crowd: \u201cI love it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, he called for the New York Times to fire their respected national political correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmartnyt?lang=en\">Jonathan Martin</a> while also railing against CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, a debate moderator, because Cooper was \u201cvery biased\u201d and worked for \u201cthe Clinton News Network\u201d.</p> <p>Donald Jr joined in on the act when he told a Philadelphia radio station that \u201cthe media has been [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] number one surrogate in this\u201d. The Trump son added \u201cwithout the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic], on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign quickly bashed Donald Jr\u2019s comments as \u201cinsensitive, divisive, and reckless\u201d. In a statement, the campaign added \u201cthe bottom line is this \u2013 offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, especially from a presidential campaign\u201d.</p>",
