  "<p>Donald Trump has said the 2016 presidential election is \u201cgoing to be the last election that the Republicans can win\u201d, because if he is not victorious undocumented migrants \u201clegalised\u201d under a Hillary Clinton presidency will \u201cbe able to vote and once that happens you can forget it\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the last election that the Republicans can win,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www1.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2016/09/09/brody-file-exclusive-donald-trump-says-this-will-be-the-last-election-that-the-republicans-have-a-chance-of-winning\">told the Christian Broadcasting Network </a>on Friday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win this election, you\u2019ll never see another Republican and you\u2019ll have a whole different church structure. You\u2019ll have a whole different supreme court structure.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Trump has made immigration a central issue of his campaign, promising to build a wall on the southern border, to be paid for by Mexico, although Mexican leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">rejected </a>the idea. His promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">deport some 11 million </a>undocumented migrants who live in the US have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">recently been thrown into doubt</a>, however.</p> <p>CBN host David Brody asked Trump whether he was referring to \u201cwhat Michele Bachmann was talking about\u201d, which was Clinton providing potential citizenship for \u201cmany of these illegals\u201d, because \u201cthat means Texas and Florida could be gone\u201d.</p> <p>Bachmann, a former congresswoman from Minnesota who made a brief run for the White House in 2012 and is <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bachmann-boasts-role-trump-adviser-multiple-issues\">an adviser</a> to the Trump campaign, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/michele-bachmann-2016-last-election-demographic-change\">last week told CBN</a>: \u201cIf you look at the numbers of people who vote and who live in the country and who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to bring in to the country, this is the last election when we even have a chance to vote for somebody who will stand up for godly moral principles. This is it.\u201d</p> <p>Both Texas and Florida have large populations of undocumented people, relative to other states, and the latter has been tightly contested in recent elections.</p> <p>Trump repeated: \u201cI think this will be the last election if I don\u2019t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning because you\u2019re going to have people flowing across the border, you\u2019re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they\u2019re going to be legalised and they\u2019re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it.\u201d</p> <p>Two successive presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, have failed to pass immigration reform plans through Congress that would have created very gradual paths to citizenship. Despite steady support by moderate Republicans for such plans, Trump has consistently rejected citizenship unless migrants leave and return to the US.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have one Republican vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s already a hard number. Already the path is much more difficult for the Republicans. You just have to look at the maps.\u201d</p> <p>In the Real Clear Politics <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">head-to-head</a> poll average, Clinton leads Trump 45.6% to 42.9%. The same site\u2019s poll average for <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">Florida</a> puts the Democrat up by 44.8% to 44.5%. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/tx/texas_trump_vs_clinton-5694.html\">Texas</a>, Trump leads by 45.7% to 37.3%.</p> <p>Data journalism site FiveThirtyEight has <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">forecast</a> that Clinton has a 71.3% chance of winning the White House. The website makes Florida the state most likely to tip the election, with an 18.7% chance. Solidly Republican Texas, it says, has a 0.7% chance of deciding who makes it to the White House.</p>",
  "<p>The Trump campaign on Friday released 10 years of running mate Mike Pence\u2019s tax returns, covering the years <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/governor-mike-pence-tax-returns\">2006 through 2015</a>. No tax information has yet been released regarding the Republican presidential candidate himself.</p> <p>The Indiana governor\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/2015_Pence_Tax_Return.pdf\">latest tax filings</a> show that in 2015 he paid an effective tax rate of 12.4% \u2013 the second-lowest tax rate of the past decade for the governor and his family \u2013 on an income of $113,026. Pence donated $8,923 to charity, almost equal to the $8,956 he paid in federal income tax.</p> <p>\u201cThe Pence family has been honored to serve their state and their nation for the past 16 years, while raising three great children and putting them through college,\u201d Marc Lotter, Pence\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThese tax returns clearly show that Mike and Karen Pence have paid their taxes, supported worthy causes, and, unlike the Clintons, the Pences have not profited from their years in public service.\u201d</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-tax-returns\">her 2015 personal tax return</a> in August, as well as that of running mate Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, who released 10 years of their returns.</p> <p>Those figures showed that Hillary and former president Bill Clinton earned nearly $11m in 2015, paying an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2%. Adding effective state and local income tax at 9%, the couple\u2019s tax rate totaled 43.2%. The Clintons donated $1,042,000, or 9.8%, of their adjusted gross income to charity.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has released tax records <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-releases-eight-years-of-tax-returns-120882\">dating back to 1977</a>.

In 1973, Richard Nixon released his tax returns <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/11/pf/taxes/nixon-trump-tax-returns/\">while they were under audit</a>.</p> <p>Also revealed in the latest tax filings was Karen Pence\u2019s unsuccessful stint as a small business owner. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/karen-pence-towel-charm_us_578cce86e4b03fc3ee51594f\">That\u2019s My Towel Charm</a>, which sells markers meant to ensure that bathers do not confuse their towels, lost $3,407 last year.</p>",

She said that she \u201cagreed with a lot\u201d of what Trump said, particularly about \u201creligious liberty\u201d. But Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and couldn\u2019t commit to voting for him, although she was \u201choping\u201d she could find a reason to do soby November.</p> <p>Vernon Lewis of Marshall, Texas, was further along in the process. </p> <p>Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump, but after Trump granted him and other Christians a private meeting in New York, as well as seeing his speech on Friday, Lewis said he was enthusiastic.</p> <p>\u201cHe is a very gentle guy.\u201d</p>",

But can they actually feel it?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had so many conversations with my own kids about this, about the shock, the terror, the outrage. Can they feel the sense of bereavement \u2013 at losing almost 3,000 Americans in a single morning? I don\u2019t think they can. But that makes it our generation\u2019s burden. We lived through that terrible day. And we will never forget that terrible day.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ryan spoke of the firefighters who rushed into danger and the flags that appeared on overpasses as if \u201cto bind up the nation\u2019s wounds\u201d. He added: \u201cThese are the stories that we can pass on. We can turn our burden of grief into a gift of grace \u2013 because our children may not fully understand the horror of it all. But they can admire the heroism.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/congress-911-rememberance-ceremony-capitol\">'9/11 belongs to compassion': Congress marks 15th anniversary on Capitol steps</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d32a72e4b013613fffbc06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-kutsch\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T21:32:55.494Z\">10.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Having a newly discovered parasitic flatworm named after you may not be the world\u2019s most illustrious honor, but it\u2019s something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> nonetheless has the pleasure of adding to his presidential legacy.</p> <p>Enter <em>Baracktrema obamai</em>, the flatworm that infects Malaysian freshwater turtles, a species and genus of parasite discovered by Dr Thomas R Platt, an expert on turtle parasites, who wanted to bestow the president with a gift of adding his namesake to the animal kingdom.</p> <p>\u201cThis is clearly something in my small way done to honor our president,\u201d Platt, who recently discovered that he was also a distant relative of Obama, told the Associated Press.<br></p> <p>\u201cI have named a number of species after people I admire, from my father-in-law, my PhD adviser, and good friends who are academics and/or amateur naturalists,\u201d Platt said in a press release. \u201c<em>Baracktrema obamai</em> will endure as long as there are systematists studying these remarkable organisms.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/barack-obama-parasitic-flatworm-name-honor\">Barack Obama's latest honor: a parasitic flatworm to bear his name</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d326dde4b07ac3d446aa81\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T21:18:23.257Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Senator John McCain gave Donald Trump\u2019s military credibility a wide berth during an appearance at the Heritage Foundation, a Thatcherite free market think tank in Washington.

He recalled: \u201cPeople flying in the air and bursting in the street like water balloons; hearing a boom and seeing the entire tower come down on our heads.\u201d</p> <p>Lipscomb said in the years since he had suffered a stroke and two heart attacks while his business went bankrupt. \u201cWhat happened afterwards was as devastating as what happened on the day.\u201d</p> <p>But not all was dour. \u201cI just pray the spirit that happened that day is going to start building again and we start showing love to each other,\u201d Lipscomb said. \u201cOn the day they tried to put terror in our hearts, they put strength in our hearts and we need to start building on the strength.\u201d</p>",

Describing his position of third in the polls as \u201ca good beginning\u201d, he insists he can be the catalyst to disrupt and break the classical outmoded left-right political blocs.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s remarks on passporting run counter to claims made by both Philip Hammond, the chancellor and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, that passporting rights will be preserved. Hammond told MPs this week that any attempt by the EU to split off euro-denominated clearing would not benefit the EU, with business instead drifting to New York.</p> <p>Johnson has insisted the UK\u2019s financial services sector will not be stripped of the passporting rights, which exist within the single market, saying that the City of London will remain a global financial centre.</p> <p>But Macron said: \u201cWe have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the EU? For me, definitely not.\u201d</p> <p>He added the EU could not wait months and months for the UK to start Brexit talks. \u201cProcrastination is not the right answer. We have to be extremely strict on the implementation of Brexit so there is a common approach between member states. We must avoid a sector by sector or country by country approach, and ask the UK to be clear.\u201d</p> <p>He also spurned the concessions on free movement as a price for access to the EU single market. \u201cIf you accept such caveats, the more you can damage the EU and it will be an open door for whoever has doubts about Europe, and so reduce the incentive to be pro-European. </p> <p>\u201cI was completely against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/17/four-eu-states-shun-camerons-benefits-plan-politics-live\">agreements signed with the UK in February</a>; it just said \u2018OK if you give me more, then I will stay in the club\u2019. That is the beginning of the dismantlement of Europe. Now just because there is a leave vote, should we rewrite the rules of the club for one country. It\u2019s a very strange defeat for Europe if people accept that.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said he is trying to develop a programme on economic dynamism, married to social protection, equality of opportunity and security: \u201cI am not just a liberal movement. I come from the progressive left.

A national debate on this was the best way to divide the country\u201d.</p> <p>He said that the middle classes were losing their sense of cultural security, but that issue could not be solved by national laws and bans.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy who killed people in Nice was not a Muslim. Daesh [Islamic State] want civil war in our country. They want to divide the country. But they are not in a position to break our country unless we decide to enter into this game and organise a civil war. It is crazy to think the best way to defeat Daesh is to fight Muslims. We have 5.5 million Muslims in France\u201d.</p> <p>But he said there was a deeper issue about unintegrated Muslims in France, especially Salafists who regarded Islamic law as superior to French secular law. He estimated that between 25\u201330% of French Muslims, close to 2 million, thought in this way, and the answer lay in enforcing French secular law.</p> <p>French Muslims had to become less dependent on preachers from Algiers and Morocco, he said. But he added that measures such as the burkini ban, or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/france-bans-burqa-and-niqab\">wearing the veil</a>, risked disenfranchising Muslims and risking their ability to be fully aligned with the Republic.</p>",
  "<p>What once prompted shock now brings something closer to weariness: news of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\" title=\"\">North Korean nuclear test</a>, followed by a round of international condemnation and probably, in due course, tightened sanctions. But while this is the fifth test since North Korea began detonating nuclear devices in 2006, it is also the second in just a year. Today\u2019s device was the most powerful the&#xa0;country has set off and, while its claims to&#xa0;have miniaturised a nuclear warhead capable of being mounted on missiles should be taken with a pinch of salt, its programme is&#xa0;clearly progressing. It will not be stopped by more sanctions.</p> <p>Kim Jong-un\u2019s unpredictability, like his nuclear programme, has served North Korea well. No one likes it, but everyone has to care about it, and no one wants to mess with it. Fearful of the outside world \u2013 the elite want to protect themselves; the country was flattened by US bombs in the Korean war; and George W Bush named it in his axis of evil \u2013 North Korea has no reason to halt its programme.</p> <p>Already, Beijing is being urged to rein in its ally. It greeted the test as shocking and unwise, but called for restraint. China does not hide its increasing distaste for Mr Kim. It&#xa0;is also deeply unhappy that his actions have prompted South Korea\u2019s recent agreement to host a Thaad anti-missile unit at&#xa0;the invitation of the US. But North Korea does not&#xa0;listen and China is not about to turn&#xa0;off the tap. Cut off the oil and North Koreans would have even less heating and could end up starving.</p> <p>China has a hammer, not a lever; it cannot guide the state\u2019s policies and has no desire to see it collapse. It does not want a huge influx of refugees, nor US forces on its doorstep in a unified Korea; it fears infighting between factions with access to arms and nuclear material. Nor does it want to expend its resources to push the North Koreans into talks with Americans.</p> <p>The US government was burnt by 2012\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-usa-leap-idUSBRE82T06T20120330\" title=\"\">Leap Day deal debacle</a>, when the North Koreans launched a satellite weeks after agreeing a moratorium on long-range missile launches and nuclear tests in exchange for targeted food aid. The US saw it as a clear breach of the agreement; Pyongyang did not.</p> <p>Now the administration appears to be waiting it out. Though it no longer favours the term \u201cstrategic patience\u201d \u2013 mocked as \u201cpatience, without a strategy\u201d \u2013 its actual approach <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/06/485_206813.html\" title=\"\">appears unchanged</a>. It does not regard Pyongyang as a priority, and is not sure what to do about it. That will not change in its remaining weeks.

I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\u201d</p> <p>The political world according to Trump is much like hiring a lawyer or accountant. He pays up; they follow his orders. The art of this deal is straightforward: the buyer enjoys considerable leverage over the seller.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s explanations of his donations are helpful context for understanding at least two curious payments to state attorneys-general.</p> <p>Both Pam Bondi of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas (now the Texas governor) were the lucky recipients of Trump donations.

Both Abbott and Bondi deny any impropriety.</p> <p>Bondi\u2019s office ended the review without taking any action against the so-called university, that reports suggest was little more than a high-pressure sales opportunity for a worthless investment seminar.</p> <p>Trump also handed over cash <a href=\"http://www.twcnews.com/tx/austin/politics/2016/06/2/ap--greg-abbott-given--35k-gubernatorial-campaign-donation-after-trump-university-probe-in-texas-dropped.html\">to Abbott</a> to support his gubernatorial campaign in Texas. That was three years after Abbott dropped its investigation into the business that the New York attorney general has called \u201cstraight-up fraud\u201d.</p> <p>Proving corruption is notoriously difficult in a court of law, and campaign finance laws are just as notoriously difficult to enforce. So for now, we must be thankful to the Internal Revenue Service \u2013 and the reporting of the Washington Post \u2013 for uncovering the mysterious circumstances of the Bondi payment.</p> <p>Trump paid Bondi\u2019s campaign through his tax-exempt family foundation, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">in violation of tax laws</a>. Strangely, the donation was initially listed as going to a Kansas charity with a similar name to Bondi\u2019s political group. \u201cAn honest mistake,\u201d said the Trump Organization.</p> <p>That honest mistake cost Trump a $2,500 penalty to the IRS. It might also cost him his self-proclaimed position as an outsider who can upend the political system; and as a relentless critic of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s approach to donations.</p> <p>Instead, Trump looks more and more like the political insider he professes to disdain.</p> <p>Of course, he doesn\u2019t call Pam Bondi of Florida \u201cCrooked Pam\u201d. That would be a little ungenerous since she spoke so eloquently on his behalf at the Republican convention in Cleveland.</p> <p>\u201cWinning this election means reclaiming something to which I\u2019ve dedicated my entire career: the rule of law. Laws that make our neighborhoods safe. Laws that make our economy strong. Laws that apply equally to everyone,\u201d Bondi explained to the delegates in the hall.</p> <p>Bondi <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/transcript-of-attorney-general-pam-bondis-speech-to-the-republican/2286207\">accused</a> Clinton of being \u201ca former secretary of state who believes the laws don\u2019t apply to her \u2026 This lawlessness must stop. Right here. Right now. Donald Trump will stop it.\u201d</p> <p>After one passing reference to Clinton\u2019s private email server, the crowd began chanting, and Bondi happily responded in kind.</p> <p>\u201cLock her up,\u201d said the attorney general. \u201cI love that.\u201d</p> <p>This is the rule of law seen through Alice\u2019s looking glass. A wonderland where a state\u2019s chief law enforcement officer loves the notion of locking up an elected official without charge or trial.</p> <p>A topsy-turvy state of affairs where lawlessness will be stopped by a man who is being sued for fraud.</p> <p>It would be too much to say that Trump is a hypocrite. You see, he hasn\u2019t promised to fix the broken system. He only pointed out that he bought other politicians. He only hinted that he has so much money that he can\u2019t be bought by other donors. Reform was never his rallying cry.</p> <p>A real reform candidate could have worked wonders in this presidential cycle. An outsider with unimpeachable credentials and a decent claim to credibility might have ripped through both the primaries and the general election. That was, in part, the appeal of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Instead, the Republican party nominated someone who openly admits to buying politicians, and whose relationship with the truth looks like a comb-over.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s pitch to voters isn\u2019t that he\u2019s cleaner than his supposedly crooked opponent. It\u2019s that he\u2019s paid so much for the broken system that he doesn\u2019t need to sell himself.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t your typical pay-to-play scheme. Trump has paid the politicians for years, and now he\u2019s trying to play the voters.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Philip Green has suffered a further blow to his reputation after the BHS scandal crossed the Atlantic thanks to Vanity Fair.<br></p> <p>The renowned US magazine has included a lengthy feature about the billionaire tycoon in its latest issue, describing him as \u201cBritain\u2019s Donald Trump\u201d on its cover.</p> <p>The article is headlined <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/how-sir-philip-green-outraged-an-entire-nation\">\u201cHow Sir Philip Green made an outrageous fortune and outraged an entire nation\u201d</a>. It describes the furore the collapse of BHS has caused in the UK and examines Green\u2019s background, quoting supporters of the tycoon in the US but also critics such as Labour MP Frank Field.</p> <p>The coverage of the scandal in the US is significant because Green has expanded Topshop into large American cities and the US private equity firm Leonard Green owns 25% of the chain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/boredom-scavenging-stifling-heat-final-days-of-bhs-philip-green\">BHS collapsed into administration in April, with the last of its 164 shops closing last month.</a> The demise of the retailer led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit.</p> <p>Green sold the department store chain for \u00a31 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell 13 months before it collapsed. The tycoon, his family, and other BHS investors collected more than \u00a3580m from the company during the 15 years he ran it.</p> <p>The Vanity Fair article likens Green to Trump because of his \u201cflowing white curly locks, perma-tan, and unshakeable brashness\u201d. William D Cohan, the award-winning journalist who wrote the article, claims that Green called him while he was writing it to say: \u201cYou\u2019re on trial. Let\u2019s see how well behaved you are.\u201d</p> <p>The feature finishes with another quote from Green. The tycoon is quoted as telling Cohan: \u201cYou\u2019re going to find England, unfortunately, is a place where you get a lot of jealous, envious, you know, negative people. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p> <p>Green has denied putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator and dragging his feet over reaching a settlement concerning the pensions of 20,000 former BHS workers. He said on Friday he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sir-philip-green-i-am-working-every-day-on-the-bhs-pension-crisis\">working to resolve the problem every day</a> and that the process took time because it was highly complex.</p> <p>Green said he felt compelled to deny allegations about his conduct during negotiations over a deal. He said Field, chairman of the parliamentary committee that investigated the demise of BHS, was wrong to accuse him of obstructing a settlement.</p> <p>\u201cMr Field suggested in the House of Commons on Wednesday there was a lack of willingness on my part to reach a settlement with regard to the pension fund. This is untrue, totally inaccurate and unhelpful in solving this issue,\u201d Green said.</p> <p>He also denied reports he was <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/sir-philip-green-makes-conditional-offer-to-plug-bhs-pension-hole-10554303\">trying to extract concessions from the Pensions Regulator in return for injecting money into the BHS pension scheme</a>. \u201cThere have also been suggestions in the press that I have tried to pressurise the regulator, or, as was stated on the front page of one newspaper, \u2018blackmail\u2019 it. This is wholly untrue. I am not in control of the process. I am following the process which has been set down by the regulator,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer\">Green told MPs in June he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit</a>, which threatens to severely reduce the pensions of the chain\u2019s former employees. He and his family took more than \u00a3400m out of BHS during 15 years of ownership.</p> <p>The businessman said he and his team had been cooperating with the Pensions Regulator for 17-18 months. He said he had always intended to secure a better outcome for pensioners than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/pension-protection-fund-bhs-retirement-ppf\">Pension Protection Fund</a> could achieve.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI would like to apologise sincerely to all the BHS people involved in this sorry affair. Contrary to all the coverage I have been working on this issue on a daily basis, and will continue to do so with my best efforts to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all involved as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Green and Field have been at war over BHS for months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/30/philip-green-blasts-frank-field-for-turning-inquiry-into-kangaroo-court\">after Field criticised Green before he attended a parliamentary inquiry into the chain\u2019s collapse</a>. Green is battling to hold on to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/sir-philip-green-knighthood-under-review-bhs\">knighthood, which is under review after complaints about his ownership of BHS</a>.</p>",

The trip up to the Stonewall lookout in Montana is, as you\u2019d expect, gorgeous. But also stark. A big fire scorched the forest in 2003 and it\u2019s still recovering.

Labour's dead. And it wont take a long time before the tories realise that the same thing is going to happen to them. The party's been captured by the hard right-wing and, at some point, the centrists will become a complete irrelevance.</p> <p>What we may see is a fragmentation, even atomisation, of mainstream political parties. In both the case of Labour and the Tories, the parties are increasingly becoming representative of narrow interest of core members. Tory members have always been very euro-sceptic and held a strong anti-immigration line. The brexit vote has legitimised those views and those euro-sceptic MPs who were once on the fringes and largely dismissed by their peers are now the ones calling the shots. The narrow victory by the Leave campaign has given them the confidence to push forward policies and ideas that are hugely divisive in the mistaken belief that these policies are supporters by a broad church. The way in which the Tory party has framed the Brexit vote as an almost exclusively anti-immigration vote and have pushed for grammar schools (despite the fact it was not in their manifesto) are good examples of this phenomenon. With Labour, you have a so-called social movement which <i>demands</i> that <i>all</i> MPS reflect the views of the majority of the membership, instead of looking to reflect the wide spectrum of interest and views of Labour voters. Just like the Tories they believe that this narrow movement holds great support across the UK. If only the media would give them a fair shot. If only the MPs would support the leader. If, if ...</p> <p>There is of course no need to have parties that act as broad and inclusive churches. There's nothing wrong with having parties that represent very specific and narrow interest. But if the political system is dominated by such parties then you need a system of proportional representation. And we wont get that until the Tories realise its in their interests to have one.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904934\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1864914\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JHarris\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JHarris</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904934\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:17pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>It's not quite that Labour's dead, which is why I talk about the end of the Labour Party <b>as we know it</b>.

The Paralympics does to much to educate society about disability and imparts a really positive message, but it also leads people to be more dismissive of real physical and mental conditions that are real and do need to be taken into account. The DLA or PIP is essential for some disabled people who need extra help. Disability already saps one's confidence because you effectively cannot trust your body, or indeed other's reactions. I have been made fun of for having no hair- having no eyelashes and eyebrows makes one look strange but also abused simply for having to stop walking suddenly because I felt my legs give way and someone pushed me aside. The Job Centres need to stop bullying disabled people into work they simply cannot do or can only do on a good day, by alluding to the Olympics and &quot;can do&quot; attitude.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think? <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T12:30:58.586Z\">at 1.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d2a7c6e4b013613fffb9a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T12:19:16.249Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More thoughts on the left from below the line:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904377\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4019864\" title=\"View PSmd\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4019864\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for PSmd\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4019864\" title=\"View PSmd\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">PSmd</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904377\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:10pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The left will always have a future. Especially in a country where inequality is becoming less popular.</p> <p>However, what does this mean for Labour party? The Labour party was the party of progress of the 20th century. Great party. But ultimately, undone by the breakdown in 1970's. Wilson's voters. don;t forget, remembered the depression and world war 2. Today's baby boomers have no memory of those things, just the 1970's and 1980's. Left boomers remember 1980's as unemployment, pit closures, factory closures. The right boomers remember the property ownership, share ownership, white collar jobs. And they were in the majority. Neoliberalism, polarised, because it widened wealth gaps, and as a result, many areas became more left wing (merseyside, glasgow etc). But they were minority by geography. Most Brits liked neoliberalism and did well out of it.</p> <p>Right wing baby boomers have such bad memories of the 1970's, that they'll insist on the economics that took us to the 1930's.<br />Where does this leave the labour party? Divided by geography. The party became a monopolist on left politics, and like monopolistic corporations who become bad for capitalism, the Labour party at it's electoral height, 1997-2010 became bad for socialism. The future may lie with Greens, or it may lie with various community action groups. The electoral and economic geography of this country is too difficult to consolidate for labour. In effect, they have pander to and to win the votes of, people who don't give two shits about low wage workers and renters, while holding onto the votes of people who do. Can;t be done anymore, I'm afraid.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>And a response ... <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904646\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1864914\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JHarris\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JHarris</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904646\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:14pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Pretty good, that.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Some of you have been talking about <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-crushed-sheffield-election-just-8796901\">a council by-election in Sheffield yesterday</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82903636\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16499314\" title=\"View Roel1963\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16499314\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Roel1963\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16499314\" title=\"View Roel1963\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Roel1963</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82903636\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The Mosborough (Sheffield) Byelection result, where a Labour safe seat was lost, must come as a wake-up call for all who wish Labour to thrive.</p> <p>Losing Labour candidate was Julie Grocutt from Stocksbridge, an anti-Corbyn, pro-Smith groopie, who previously also put her 2 cents in regarding the Brick-through-&quot;Eagle's&quot;-window incident.</p> <p>Clearly, reality has just gobsmacked the claim by the rebel PLP and their right-wing handlers, that they and only they are &quot;electable&quot;, whilst Corbyn is not.<br />Put simply: in the UK there's two simultaneous political bottom-up revolutions going on.

Is Labour dead? What would a new party look like? Here is his response.</em><br></p> <p>The most basic point that arises from what my piece says is that the revival of the political left, here and across the world, is probably going to be a long haul. The break-up between social democracy and the new radical left (e.g Podemos in Spain, elements of Syriza in Greece, many of the forces behind the Bernie Sanders campaign) has only just happened. Debate and thought about how much economies have changed and what the left should do about it is still in the foothills. <br></p> <p>If you want a sense of what a long political haul looks like, start with the historian <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1045411/the-road-to-1945/\">Paul Addison\u2019s book</a> The Road To 1945. My stock example of what it deals with is that campaigning for universal Child Benefit began in 1917, and it arrived nearly 30 years later. The same will apply to a Universal Basic Income (or UBI), which I think has to be the core of any new left politics \u2013 given that it addresses insecurity rooted in technology, and holds out the prospect of automation being a liberating rather than a destructive force. Ditto the fight for Proportional Representation. This isn\u2019t to say that elections in the meantime aren\u2019t worth fighting, but that the left should be thinking strategically, and understanding what an onerous task it faces.</p> <p>As to which political forces will be involved as this goes on \u2013 who knows? Personally, I have a sense that the Labour party as we know it is probably finished. The current battle over its control will be one chapter in a series of ruptures: over time, you\u2019ll probably see elements now seen to be hostile to each other coming together, and others falling away (for flavour of this, look at some former New Labour insiders and supporters who support UBI and PR, or the people working creditably hard for Jeremy Corbyn whose politics are a bit more forward-looking and radical than his). There will also be lots of people involved from beyond Labour, which is why I think one of the most interesting initiatives right now is the <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/the-urgent-need-for-a-progressive-alliance/\">Progressive Alliance idea</a> being pursued by Compass, which involves Labour people, Greens, Lib Dems, people from the SNP etc etc.</p> <p>This is a time when politics is changing in front of our eyes, and uncertainty rules. My own belief is that the values of equality, solidarity and a world beyond the market will endure. But what form they will take is still to become clear.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T11:27:57.020Z\">at 12.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d243ebe4b07ac3d446a696\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/johnharris\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T11:23:25.718Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Does the left have a future?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Below John Harris comments on the biggest questions that came to mind when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/does-the-left-have-a-future\">writing his long-read on whether the left has a future</a>.</em></p> <p>One of the biggest themes in the piece was about the changing nature of work, the roots of that change in technology, and the idea that in a world of temporary employment and the gig economy, work can\u2019t be the main way we give people security and stability.

  "<p>North Korea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\">latest nuclear test</a>, once again, seems to have taken everyone by surprise. </p> <p>Coming only nine months after its last nuclear detonation and following ever-advancing ballistic missile tests, including a successful submarine launch just two weeks ago, Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest wake-up call to world leaders will be hard to ignore.</p> <p>But why now? And, for a leadership recently experiencing a flurry of high-profile defections, what does the latest test mean about stability in Pyongyang?</p> <h2>1. Why now?</h2> <p><strong>Duyeon Kim, visiting senior fellow, Korean Peninsula Future Forum</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dc50b3c9b85fc40b0401d9bd573178386aa4990d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc50b3c9b85fc40b0401d9bd573178386aa4990d/0_0_2006_3000/669.jpg\" alt=\"Duyeon Kim.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This apparent nuclear test is not surprising, because we have been \u2013 and should continue to expect \u2013 North Korea to continue testing its nuclear devices and missiles. </p> <p>Pyongyang has every technological, political and strategic reason to continue testing, and continued launches will only help perfect its technology.</p> <p>Today\u2019s timing is also politically advantageous, because it coincides with the anniversary of the regime, Founding Day, and a series of international summits in the region. </p> <p>I\u2019d be curious to learn if this was one or two simultaneous tests. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/11/newsid_3664000/3664259.stm\">India tested two nuclear devices</a> together before calling it quits, and I have wondered if or when North Korea would think about following suit.</p> <p><strong>Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"129f82e0bdcd81f5a507b29c5fbcebb51a37fb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/129f82e0bdcd81f5a507b29c5fbcebb51a37fb76/0_0_500_700/357.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Klingner\" width=\"357\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Korea watchers endlessly debate the timing and motivation of North Korean actions, looking for a linkage to anniversaries, potential regime instability, or a supposed response to US or South Korean movements. </p> <p>Such debate is the lifeblood of analysts but is ultimately worthless.</p> <p>Instead, the focus should be on the North Korean actions \u2013 which are provocations, violations of UN resolutions or laws, or deadly attacks \u2013 rather than the array of possible regime motivations. </p> <p>Perhaps the latest nuclear test was indeed timed to celebrate North Korean Founding Day, a major national holiday, but more important than the timing is that the test is another blatant defiance of UN resolutions and the international community must respond.</p> <h2>2. What does this signify about the regime?<br></h2> <p><strong>Bruce Bennet, RAND</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f15a77f1dc5721c81653673b146092f48ab8ba5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15a77f1dc5721c81653673b146092f48ab8ba5b/0_0_420_420/420.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Bennet\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>During Kim\u2019s four-year reign, Pyongyang has conducted 37 missile tests, more than twice as many as his father Kim Jong-il did during 17 years in office.</p> <p>The nuclear test is not reflective of regime stability or instability, but is rather the manifestation of Pyongyang\u2019s decades long quest to develop, augment, and refine its nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver them via missiles against the US and its allies.</p> <p>This year North Korea has engaged in a rapid-fire series of tests. In addition to the two nuclear tests, Kim has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, a road-mobile intermediate-range missile, a submarine-launched ballistic missile, upgraded medium- and short-range missiles, re-entry vehicle technology, a new solid-fuel rocket engine, and an improved liquid-fuel ICBM engine.</p> <p><strong>Cha Du-Hyeogn, Korean Institute of Reunification</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"060bd3574fae22893c6a229e304d791d42163901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/060bd3574fae22893c6a229e304d791d42163901/0_0_292_292/292.jpg\" alt=\"cha-du-hyeogn\" width=\"292\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This North Korean test is a cynical message to the Seoul government, which has been claiming that the North is undergoing an internal breakdown.</p> <p>We do not have the confirmed data on its magnitude yet, but if the result is significantly better \u2013 for example, twice as stronger than before \u2013 then its message [of strength] will carry far more weight.</p> <p><strong>Eom Sang-Yoon, The Sejong Institute</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea45df2d3b65c885131818fe32ff214a30cf1251\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea45df2d3b65c885131818fe32ff214a30cf1251/0_0_120_150/120.jpg\" alt=\"Eom Sang-yoon\" width=\"120\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eom Sang-yoon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NK News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The test can consolidate internal unity. However, the impact on regime stability would have been greatest after their first test. This is the fifth test (so it will have a smaller ripple effect), but Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t have any other option available to him to consolidate his power.</p> <p>In reality, the best way to stabilise the regime is by developing economy and making people live well. However, Kim has limited options, and boasts his leadership through military armaments.</p> <h2>3. What does this mean for South Korea and the US?</h2> <p><strong>John Delury, associate professor of Chinese Studies, Yonsei University</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"97d4cddcbc1d0baaeb959dcabe54a211ee1529e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d4cddcbc1d0baaeb959dcabe54a211ee1529e9/0_0_280_360/280.jpg\" alt=\"john-delury\" width=\"280\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The North Korean regime is very aware of American politics.

It would allow the return of humanitarian convoys into besieged cities, something that the Syrian government has been blocking, leading to huge frustration among aid groups.</p> <p>But it is also designed to restart substantive peace talks. The Syrian high negotiations committee produced this week its detailed democratic blueprint for a transition away from the Assad regime to a new unitary state, but the plan, praised by the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was ridiculed by the Syrian government.</p> <p>Previous talks about a transition in Geneva in the spring ground to a halt as the Syrian government stonewalled and played for time. There is little public sign that Russia, or the military balance in Syria, has changed the political dynamic sufficiently for a breakthrough if any fresh talks do get under way. </p> <p>This week Johnson described Syria as the single most urgent political issue facing the world. But for many the future of Syria may not lie in Geneva, but instead in the talks Hillary Clinton holds on Friday with a group of highly experienced security advisers.

For five years, he had been methodically sifting through internal CIA accounts of its infamous torture program, a process that had begun after the committee learned \u2013 thanks to a New York Times article, not the agency \u2013 that a senior official had destroyed videotapes that recorded infamously brutal interrogations. The subsequent committee inquiry had deeply strained a relationship with Langley that both sides badly wanted to maintain. The source of that strain was simple: having read millions of internal emails, cables and accounts of agency torture, Jones had come to believe everything the CIA had told Congress, the Bush and Obama White Houses and the public was a lie. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/dan-jones-cia-torture-cover-report-senate\">Senate investigator breaks silence about CIA's 'failed coverup' of torture report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was one document in particular that proved it. Jones and his team had found it years before, placed mysteriously onto a shared computer network drive the Senate intelligence committee investigators were using in northern Virginia, not far from CIA headquarters. But they hadn\u2019t appreciated its full significance until the agency, in an attempt at refuting a report that was still far from publication, told Barack Obama\u2019s staff that the committee was pushing a hysterical interpretation of the agency\u2019s fateful post-9/11 embrace of torture. The document, prepared for Leon Panetta when he was CIA director, had reached the same conclusions about the torture program that Jones had. As long as Jones had it, he would be able to show that the agency knew full well how brutal the torture was; how ineffective its torturers considered it to be; and how thoroughly the CIA had covered all of that up. </p> <p>As long as Jones had the document, that is. Lurking in the back of his mind was the event that had led him to devote five years of ceaseless work, through nights and weekends: the CIA had already destroyed evidence of torture. It did that before the Senate had launched an investigation, and long before that investigation had turned acrimonious. </p> <p>Inside the small room in Virginia the CIA had set up for the Senate investigators, Jones reached for his canvas messenger bag. He slipped crucial printed-out passages of what he called the Panetta Review into the bag and secured its lock. Sometime after 1am, Jones walked out, carrying his bag as he always did, and neglecting to tell the agency security personnel what it contained. After years of working together, no one asked him to open the bag. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fd6c9ed82f59e3ff35077ad63534ef26283125ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd6c9ed82f59e3ff35077ad63534ef26283125ac/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McClean, Virginia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Outside the CIA satellite office in Virginia</h2> <p>Jones walked to the parking lot until he found his black Porsche Boxster. He tossed the bag onto the passenger seat and drove across the Potomac river, not stopping until he reached the Hart Senate office building on Capitol Hill. It was hours before dawn, but Jones walked into the building, sped to the second floor where the committee did its work, and placed the locked bag into a committee safe. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We had crossed a bridge. For the first time we had knowingly violated a CIA agreement</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jones, by accord, had significant access to classified agency material. He would not be leaking the Panetta Review to the public. He was ensuring its preservation so Congress could exercise its constitutionally mandated oversight on an agency with a vivid recent history of document destruction on precisely this issue. But Jones, in his first-ever interview, acknowledged to the Guardian: \u201cWe had crossed a bridge. For the first time we had knowingly violated a CIA agreement.\u201d </p> <p>It was an unfathomable turn of events, and it would have severe repercussions. Jones had years of training and experience handling classified material: before joining the Senate committee staff, he was an FBI counter-terrorism analyst. The Senate committee was not favorably inclined toward absconding with intelligence documents: its leadership was spending summer 2013 excoriating NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden as a traitor.

The episode would spill out publicly the following March, when top committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who had already taken a huge political risk in pushing the torture inquiry, accused the CIA on the Senate floor of triggering what she called a constitutional crisis. Both sides requested the justice department pursue a criminal investigation on the other. The bitterness would nearly overshadow a landmark report, a fraction of which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released\">released to the public in December 2014</a>, that documented in chilling detail the depravations CIA inflicted on terrorism suspects after 9/11. </p> <p>The CIA has stopped defending its torture program but not its personnel. While it has reknit its relationship to the committee, thanks to a GOP leadership that has all but disavowed the torture investigation, it continues to maintain that the torture report is inaccurate. Obama, whose trusted aide John Brennan runs the CIA, kept the report at arm\u2019s length, with his administration declining even to read it. </p> <p>But the CIA has gone beyond successfully suppressing the report. In a grim echo of Jones\u2019s fears, the agency\u2019s inspector general, Langley recently revealed, destroyed its copy \u2013 allegedly an accident. Accountability for torture has been the exclusive province of a committee investigation greeted with antipathy by Obama. While Obama prides himself on ending CIA torture, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has vowed if elected to \u201cbring back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/donald-trump-waterboarding-republican-debate-torture\">a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding</a>\u201d. Key CIA leaders defending the agency against the committee, including Brennan and former director Michael Morrell, are reportedly seeking to run Langley under Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>This is the inside story of the Senate investigation into torture and the crisis with the CIA it spurred. It is formed from interviews with critical players in the drama, supported by voluminous internal reports and publicly available documents. Jones agreed to provide new details but would not discuss classified information with the Guardian.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When it came time for Brennan to talk publicly about the Senate inquiry, long after Jones\u2019s predawn drive, he spent five minutes fitting the CIA\u2019s torturers into the context of 9/11. But 9/11 changed Jones\u2019s life as well. </p> <p>A native of central Pennsylvania, Jones, now 41 years old, taught in Baltimore in his early 20s as part of the Teach for America program encouraging service in inner-city schools. After 9/11, he recalled, he wanted to influence public policy over the emerging war on terrorism, and sought work on Capitol Hill. An aide to Tom Daschle, then the Senate Democratic leader, advised Jones to instead spend several years at a counter-terrorism agency, like the CIA or FBI. The aide would eventually cross paths with Jones in a different capacity \u2013 he was Denis McDonough, the Obama confidant who would become White House chief of staff.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Jones arrived at the FBI in 2003 and spent the next four years there. The bureau was in the midst of a transformation: a generation after Congress had drastically reduced its domestic intelligence-gathering functions, following Nixon-era scandals, 9/11 had compelled its re-entry into the business of pre-empting homegrown terrorists. Jones set up shop in the counter-terrorism division as an analyst, primarily focused on al-Qaida and Sunni extremist groups and occasionally traveling overseas for his work. At one point, he was even detailed to the CIA. </p> <p>But his future in the bureau was always limited, as he wasn\u2019t a special agent, the field operatives who form the heart of the FBI. Sticking to his plan, Jones arrived on the Hill in January 2007, where his intelligence credentials helped find him a place working for Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat and the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. </p> <p>Rockefeller told the Guardian that while Jones\u2019s FBI experience qualified him to work on counter-terrorism issues on the committee, Jones\u2019s time as a Baltimore teacher attracted Rockefeller\u2019s interest.</p> <p>\u201cHis decision to make this contribution before he began his career in national security told me something about his character and it was something to which I could relate. He impressed me then and I have only come to admire him more in the years since,\u201d Rockefeller, who retired from the Senate in 2015, said. </p> <p>The intelligence committee is a culture all to itself. Unlike most congressional panels, the vast majority of its work occurs in secret. The byzantine rules of classification restrict staffers who might bolster legislators\u2019 knowledge from accessing significant relevant information. Membership, particularly on committee leadership, instantly boosts the profile of ambitious legislators, who become de facto surrogates for intelligence officials on cable news. All of this means that a committee tasked as the primary avenue for imposing accountability on secret agencies faces the ever-present risk of becoming captive to the agencies they oversee. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90e4805e4a21be2f1af37a851c0357ddeb49ce7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e4805e4a21be2f1af37a851c0357ddeb49ce7a/549_255_1435_861/1000.png\" alt=\"Daniel Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Each element of the 16-agency intelligence community responds to the committee differently. As every intelligence service carries an inherent risk of scandal, they all have an abiding interest in keeping the panel on its side. The National Security Agency, the most powerful and technically sophisticated aspect of US intelligence, tends to send briefers to the Hill who wax loquaciously about the complicated details of its digital surveillance \u2013 which lends them an advantage over legislators afraid to admit what they don\u2019t understand. The CIA, however, tends to duck uncomfortable questions by telling senators they\u2019ll send responses later, the better to ensure accurate answers, and secure in the knowledge that busy legislators won\u2019t often follow up. Yet its high-handed style tends not to provoke legislators who would prefer a close relationship with an agency many are inclined to see as performing unsavory tasks for the greater national good. </p> <p>The committee\u2019s internal politics also operate outside the partisan straightjackets that the broader Congress eagerly wears. Aside from the vanishingly few public hearings it holds \u2013 an annual threat briefing, a budget briefing, nominations for senior intelligence appointees \u2013 its work occurs in secret. That secrecy prevents the public from knowing the overwhelming amount of activity about its intelligence services. It also affords committee members the leeway to take positions in tensions with party leadership or to ask questions of intelligence briefers that don\u2019t track conveniently with what their more ideological constituents would prefer. While there is a limit to how bipartisan or cross-ideological the committee will behave \u2013 former staffers are quick to point out that their work still occurs on the hyper-partisan Hill \u2013 both senators and staff describe the closed-door committee work as a venue where unity concerning national security can occur. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely what people hope Congress is,\u201d Jones recalled. </p> <p>The torture report began in such a manner. </p> <p>In November 2005, a senior CIA official named Jose Rodriguez destroyed 92 videotapes depicting the brutal 2002 interrogations of two detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abdel Rahim Nashiri. Rodriguez\u2019s tapes destruction remained a secret to his congressional overseers for two years, until a 6 December 2007 New York Times article <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06cnd-intel.html\">revealed it</a>; they barely even knew the CIA taped interrogations at all. Outrage was swift and, while tilted toward the Democrats, bipartisan, to include the \u00e9minences grises of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/washington/22intel.html\">9/11 commission</a>. Even the US justice department began an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/09/AR2010110904106_2.html?sid=ST2010110904198\">ultimately fruitless inquiry</a>. The Senate committee, then controlled by the Democrat Rockefeller, demanded an explanation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"efe57abe026f4ea565120df1ccf03594f197b56d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efe57abe026f4ea565120df1ccf03594f197b56d/26_0_587_734/400.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Zubaydah.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Zubaydah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Hayden, the CIA director, provided an assurance. The CIA did not destroy evidence, Hayden told them, because the agency had extensive records of the interrogations, from field cables, memoranda and internal emails. It was the first time the committee had learned about the documentation of one of the agency\u2019s major operations. Jones, a committee lawyer named Alissa Starzak and two Republican staffers were tasked with combing through Langley archives and documenting what would have been on the destroyed tapes. </p> <p>Both Jones and Starzak \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 knew they would be looking through a soda straw. (The GOP staffers stopped coming to Langley after two or three visits, Jones recalls.) The material they reviewed covered only April to December of 2002. It occurred around only one black site, in Thailand, and concerned just two detainees. The heavily redacted material went only one way: cables back to headquarters, containing nothing about what agency leaders instructed their field operatives to do. Yet the material was extensive: the paper documents the agency permitted the staffers to see looked to Jones like an Encyclopedia Britannica.</p> <p>What they found, over a half a year\u2019s work examining just two detainees\u2019 interrogations from the first year of the torture program, shocked them. It was widely known by 2008 that Abu Zubaydah was tortured. But Jones and Starzak did not expect to see internal accounts detailing, by the minute, what the CIA did to him. They didn\u2019t know, for instance, that interrogators had tortured him to the point that he would obey, like a dog, when they would snap their fingers, nor that they left a man suspected of knowing al-Qaida\u2019s secrets alone for 47 days. The cables describe Abu Zubaydah as kept naked, filthy, stinking, shaking with fear, shoved inside a filth-riddled wooden box, defecating on himself. Agency personnel, in the official communications, get emotional and request transfers rather than continue torturing men they come to believe lack relevant information on terrorism. It immediately raised the question of what the CIA was really doing to dozens of other detainees at its black sites. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the CIA even knew what they were giving us, to be honest,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>\u201cThese cables were the most graphic of all the cables to exist. Later on, as you go through the program, the cables get less and less detailed. To the credit of the agency personnel who were working on it, they were very detailed. \u2026 Everything that we were told was basically the opposite of what happened.\u201d </p> <p>That detail gave Jones his first recognition of the gulf between what the CIA actually did and what it told everyone outside of Langley that it did. Jones ended up creating a 29-page Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the early days of CIA torture. </p> <p>Behind closed doors in the Hart building, Jones presented his findings to the committee on 11 February 2009. Both Republicans and Democrats were shocked by \u201cthe incredible brutality of the program at a level beyond which anybody imagined,\u201d Jones said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9b39305333e39d182f916668ed1757f46439ea6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b39305333e39d182f916668ed1757f46439ea6b/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"senate-building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">senate-building</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Morris/This is a test</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Hart Senate office building. 11 February 2009</h2> <p>\u201cAt the back of the report, for what we called the \u2018tapes investigation\u2019, the staff created a chart that depicted the most torturous 17 days of Abu Zubaydah\u2019s interrogation. It was almost a minute-by-minute chronology of what the CIA was doing to Abu Zubaydah, and how Abu Zubaydah reacted,\u201d recalled Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cI think everyone on the committee \u2013 Democrat and Republican alike \u2013 was quite taken by this section of the report. It was hard to deny the ineffectiveness of the CIA interrogations, the brutality, or the fact that the committee had been deeply misled by the CIA.\u201d</p> <p>Some senators, particularly Republicans, were taken aback at the idea that the CIA would perform such acts. But Jones\u2019s presentations that CIA interrogators knew the torture was useless \u2013 contradicting years of agency spin \u2013 did not attract significant interest from the senators.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, I thought that\u2019s what people would be taken with \u2013 holy shit, we\u2019ve been sold a bill of goods,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what they were really taken with was the brutality. \u2026 There was a bipartisan consensus that this can\u2019t be the end, there\u2019s got to be a final product, there\u2019s got to be more here.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think the CIA even knew what they were giving us</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Less than a month later, on <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/press/feinstein-bond-announce-intelligence-committee-review-cia-detention-and-interrogation-program\">5 March 2009</a>, the committee voted 14-1 to expand the investigation, the dissenting vote being Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss. Instead of examining Rodriguez\u2019s destruction of the videotapes, now the Senate committee would investigate the entire torture program. Part of Jones\u2019s new mandate was to assess whether the CIA \u201caccurately described\u201d its torture program within the Bush administration and to Congress. Still, some of the Republican members imposed limits on the investigation\u2019s scope: Jones couldn\u2019t look at the Bush White House, just the CIA. </p> <p>The announced inquiry came at an uncomfortable time for the CIA and the White House. Since Obama won the presidency in November, human rights groups had spent four months pressing for a reckoning with torture.</p> <p>While Obama shut down the torture program on his second day in office, he also said that his focus as president would be to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html\">look forward as opposed to looking backwards</a>\u201d. A senior campaign aide and former senior CIA official, John Brennan, became his chief White House adviser for counter-terrorism, a signal that Obama did not wish to have antagonistic relations with Langley. His choice for CIA director, after Brennan\u2019s equivocations on torture raised red flags for liberals, was Leon Panetta, a longtime Democratic congressman and consummate insider. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K27oIJlAlA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0K27oIJlAlA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>President-elect Barack Obama in January 2009.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Obama\u2019s eagerness to turn the page on torture alarmed some of his allies. The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate judiciary committees, Patrick Leahy and John Conyers, were pushing for broad investigations into both torture and mass surveillance. </p> <p>In February 2009, Antonio Taguba, the army major general who blew the whistle on Abu Ghraib, joined a coalition of 18 human rights groups pressing Obama and the Democratic Congress for an <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/feb/18/detainee-commission-021809/\">independent truth commission</a> on torture. They had support from very <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124052866000950327\">senior Democratic legislators</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24535555.html\">House speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, Senate judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy and House judiciary chairman John Conyers. Activists petitioned attorney general Eric Holder to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/quarter-million-americans-demand-torture-prosecutions\">appoint a special prosecutor</a> for the agency. </p> <p>If the White House and the CIA didn\u2019t like the intelligence committee looking into the CIA\u2019s recent past, they would like an unpredictable 9/11 Commission-style panel and an independent prosecutor far less. The secretive panel, with its longstanding ties to Langley and its Democratic leadership, seemed like a safer option. An added political benefit was the committee\u2019s new chair: Dianne Feinstein of California, who had a long history of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2007/09/23/feinstein/\">disappointing liberals over national security</a>.</p> <p>Still, the CIA had some caveats. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Usually, when the Senate committee investigates the intelligence agencies, it does so on its home territory. The business of the committee, to include investigations, occurs in secure, locked rooms at the Hart building. Members and staff leave their phones outside; staff who lack the appropriate security clearances do not enter. The entire premise of the intelligence committees, established in the 1970s, was their unique fitness within Congress to handle classified material in order to provide accountability on secret agencies.</p> <p>Panetta wanted a different arrangement. The CIA was forecasting the provision of between three and six million pages of relevant documents. Panetta\u2019s aides voiced concern that they could not abide names of operatives, locations of black sites and countries cooperating in the torture program transiting to Capitol Hill. Either the committee would have to wait on the delivery of the documents until after the agency painstakingly redacted its material \u2013 a process with no defined endpoint and likely to last months, if not years \u2013 or it could set up shop in a satellite CIA facility in northern Virginia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fc098d88879eb7f50244ed2d055df3c3c92e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fc098d88879eb7f50244ed2d055df3c3c92e59/0_279_5160_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Panetta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At CIA headquarters in Langley in February 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEvery other investigation the committee conducted when I was chairman was done from the intelligence committee\u2019s offices \u2013 offices that are fully secured and certified to hold the most sensitive and classified information that exists,\u201d said Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program was the exception.\u201d </p> <p>The proposed arrangement discomfited the committee.

Her meetings with Panetta, whose \u201c<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/111/chrg/shrg52741/CHRG-111shrg52741.htm\">intelligence and integrity</a>\u201d she praised in his confirmation hearing that February, showed a hard edge. Behind closed doors, in early June, Feinstein pressed Panetta for access to documents. Panetta, a salty politician, raised his voice, referenced their long history together, and said she was asking for unprecedented access. Feinstein raised hers back, and threatened to send subpoenas to the CIA. Here were two fixtures of decades of California Democratic politics, sizing each other up to determine who would dominate whom.</p> <p>But the committee had to consider the reality of the task it was confronting. It had taken over a year to investigate just two interrogations related to the tapes, and in truth, primarily one, as Nashiri did not come into CIA custody at the Thai black site until December 2002, the tail end of the period Jones and Starzak investigated. The CIA did not produce any documents until the middle of 2008. How much time would they lose if they waited for the agency to redact at least 3m documents concerning more than 100 detainees? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything that we were told was basically the opposite of what happened</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The CIA offer came to look acceptable. Jones and his team would drive out to the satellite location. They would have an office, lit bright white and windowless, in its basement. While there, Jones believed, they would receive access to a computer network, known as RDINet \u2013 for \u201cRendition, Detention and Interrogation\u201d \u2013 hived off from the internet, accessible to them alone, onto which the CIA would place the documents. It was unusual, but they found, compared to the alternatives, they could live with it. Jones\u2019s team set to work at the site on 18 May. </p> <p>Days later, Panetta and Feinstein came to a final agreement on access. Several letters document their accord, with a final one from Panetta on 12 June saying \u201can agreement was reached between CIA and SSCI staff personnel regarding operating procedures for the SSCI review of material related to the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation programs.\u201d The letter said the CIA would establish \u201ca walled-off network share-drive\u201d that only the Senate staff would access for work, and that \u201cCIA access to the walled off network shared drive will be limited to CIA information technology staff, except as authorized by the committee or its staff.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d33d29227fdae8db471876524973ef8dce177ff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d33d29227fdae8db471876524973ef8dce177ff4/0_0_1275_1650/773.jpg\" alt=\"CIA\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Letter dated 12 June 2009 from CIA director Panetta to Dianne Feinstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CIA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An earlier accord, dated 28 May, also referred to establishing a \u201cshare-drive [that] can be segregated with only SSCI access and walled-off CIA IT administrators, except as otherwise authorized by SSCI.\u201d That document was titled Memorandum of Understanding Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\u2019s Review of CIA\u2019s Detention and Interrogation Program \u2013 something agency reviews would later claim, as controversy over the inquiry reached a crisis point, did not exist.</p> <p>Ironically for an agency whose concerns were premised on security breaches, now it had to hire IT contractors to set up the network for the committee staff. Documents did not actually arrive until 22 June, and then, they were maddeningly difficult to search through, as the agency insisted on using an obscure and not terribly functional search tool. The staff the CIA posted to liaise with the investigators were \u201copenly hostile\u201d, Jones said, and dragged their feet on responding to Jones\u2019s concerns.</p> <p>Then the CIA was hit by what seemed like a bombshell. In August 2009, US attorney general Eric Holder expanded the remit of the prosecutor looking at the tapes destruction, John Durham, to include the torture program, much as the Senate committee had. The justice department\u2019s new mandate was not as broad as the Senate\u2019s. It would only concern itself with torture that exceeded the boundaries set for the CIA by the Bush-era justice department. Still, for all of Obama\u2019s emphasis on looking forward and not backward, now the CIA had to face its greatest fear since launching the torture program: possible prosecution. </p> <p>Holder\u2019s decision, ironically, would ultimately hinder the committee more than the CIA, and lead to a criticism that the agency would later use as a cudgel against the Senate. </p> <p>Typically, when the justice department and congressional inquiries coincide, the two will communicate in order to deconflict their tasks and their access. In the case of the dual torture investigations, it should have been easy: Durham\u2019s team accessed CIA documents in the exact same building that Jones\u2019s team did. </p> <p>But every effort Jones made to talk with Durham failed. \u201cEven later, he refused to meet with us,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Through a spokesman, Durham, an assistant US attorney in Connecticut, declined to be interviewed for this story.</p> <p>The lack of communication had serious consequences. Without Durham specifying who at CIA he did and did not need to interview, Jones could interview no one, as the CIA would not make available for congressional interview people potentially subject to criminal penalty. Jones could not even get Durham to confirm which agency officials prosecutors had no interest in interviewing. \u201cRegrettably, that made it difficult for our committee to do interviews. So the judgment was, use the record,\u201d said Wyden, the Oregon Democrat on the panel.<br></p> <p>But when the Senate investigators discovered discrepancies between what the cables they read indicated and what CIA leaders represented internally or publicly, they would be unable to solicit answers from the people in question. </p> <p>Durham\u2019s investigation led to the first partisan break on the committee. The committee\u2019s vice-chairman and top Republican, Kit Bond of Missouri, informed Feinstein that GOP members and staff were withdrawing. The special prosecutor had put the committee \u2013 and CIA officials \u2013 in an untenable position, Bond said publicly on 25 September: \u201cWhat current or former CIA employee would be willing to gamble his freedom by answering the committee\u2019s questions?\u201d</p> <p>By then, the Republican staff had largely withdrawn from the investigation already, with many not bothering to show up to the Virginia facility. Feinstein had already complained about that to Bond in early April. And other strains were evident in the committee\u2019s bipartisanship: a top Republican aide, Kathleen Rice, maintained it would be too onerous to require the CIA to list for the investigators all its black-site detainees.</p> <p>Bond did not stop at withholding Republican support for the investigation.</p> <p>In early April 2010, Feinstein, frustrated with the lack of access to agency personnel, wrote to Panetta requesting interviews. It was a preliminary step: at that point, she sought little more than Panetta\u2019s assurance to begin processing interviews on the committee\u2019s behalf. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2de5bcc88d7f713c2139b633847a00fd7169d78c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2de5bcc88d7f713c2139b633847a00fd7169d78c/0_208_4416_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dianne Feinstein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bond rejected Feinstein\u2019s request \u2013 not only in a letter to her two weeks later, but in a letter to Panetta a few days after that, urging him not to make CIA officials available to the committee. His stated rationale was the same: steering agency employees out of criminal danger. But as Bond also objected to document requests of the sort Panetta had already agreed to provide, Jones suspected other motives.</p> <p>Jones had lost the support of the committee Republicans. \u201cAt this point, they\u2019re working on behalf of CIA,\u201d he said. Bond did not reply to a request for an interview.</p> <p>Panetta, and his successors, never approved any interviews the committee sought with agency personnel. It wasn\u2019t only officials involved in the program who were constrained in speaking with Jones. In October 2009, during a visit to Langley, Jones sought to interview staff from the inspector general\u2019s office, which had investigated interrogations in 2004. Stephen Preston, the CIA\u2019s lead attorney, stood in the hallway outside his office and insisted he be able to attend the meeting, explicitly to monitor what they discussed on behalf of Panetta. Voices were raised, and Jones\u2019s team marched out of Langley rather than hold the meeting on those terms. Preston \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 finally relented, and an unmonitored meeting occurred the following month. </p> <p>\u201cWhen Director Panetta agreed to provide [the committee] with unprecedented access to CIA documents to pursue its review, the Office of General Counsel was established as the sole conduit for requests and responses to the committee,\u201d said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a meeting with [committee] staff and OIG where the General Counsel participated in that role. It is our understanding that when topics moved to issues unrelated to the review, the General Counsel left and the meeting between [committee] staff and the OIG proceeded.\u201d</p> <p>Jones\u2019s fight with the CIA was just beginning. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It turned out that those contractors the committee thought the CIA hired to aid in collecting responsive documents were also acting as gatekeepers. They would review torture documents three times before disseminating them to the investigators to determine not only relevance, but whether higher-ups ought to make the call to turn them over. In some cases, the chain went up to the White House, to review for executive privilege \u2013 advisory conversations with White House staff, a broad category that typically keeps a record within the hands of an administration.</p> <p>White House counsel Greg Craig, his successor Bob Bauer, and Don Verilli were involved in the review, with their colleague Kate Shaw trekking to the off-site location. The attorneys would describe the documents flagged for them to Jones and Starzak, case by case, and ask if they were interested in them. In several cases, the volume of documents meant the CIA had already unwittingly turned over copies of documents flagged for executive privilege review \u2013 and, once informed of that, the White House attorneys would roll their eyes and move on.</p> <p>The White House involvement helped Feinstein navigate the first outright crisis in CIA-committee relations over the torture inquiry. In March 2010 Jones and his colleagues started noticing that they had difficulty accessing documents they knew they already had. Simple search terms weren\u2019t retrieving certain records anymore. </p> <p>\u201cWe noticed they were gone right away,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>It would have been easy to disappear documents, even in substantial amounts. The agency had provided millions of pages. The only way it could have happened was for the agency to have removed the information from a computer network the CIA set up for the Senate that Jones did not know the agency could access. </p> <p>Confronted, the CIA pointed to the tech consultants. Then they pointed the finger at the White House, suggesting that Obama\u2019s attorneys ordered them to remove the documents \u2013 a much bigger accusation, with serious implications. Feinstein, alarmed, turned to the White House, and on 12 March, Jones met with White House lawyers, who denied ordering the removal of anything. </p> <p>In a process that remains opaque to Jones, the CIA investigated internally and, months later, determined they had removed <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/Redacted-December-2014-Agency-Accountability-Board-Report.pdf\">over 900 documents</a> from the committee. It happened twice \u2013 with another, smaller wave of removals occurring in May, months after Feinstein first brought the issue to the White House. And it was a violation of the agreements the agency had reached with the committee about the conduct of the inquiry.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis really upset us early on, because it would never have happened if we had conducted this investigation like we conducted every other CIA and intelligence community investigation, which is that it happens at our location, on our computers,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Ultimately, new White House counsel Bauer conveyed verbally to the chairwoman that the CIA would not remove any more documents. On 17 May, the CIA apologized to Feinstein as well. The committee never got the removed documents back, but at least had alternate copies of some .</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, we thought, they would enter into our computers and search them, or go through them,\u201d Jones said, with a wry laugh.</p> <p>Around then, the CIA\u2019s contractor staff largely turned over. The new crew were \u201cmore cordial, open, informal\u201d, Jones remembered. (\u201cThose working relationships were professional and I am unaware of any need for bolstering,\u201d the CIA\u2019s Trapani said.) They dragged their feet on document requests less. Some would even complain, in shared frustration with Jones\u2019s team, that their superiors were taking too long to release material. </p> <p>Jones attempted to accommodate his CIA counterparts. Agency officials would occasionally come to him, expressing concern that some documents they provided were marginally related to interrogations, but they contained information about ongoing and unrelated operations. Some of them contained material that was especially sensitive, particularly for contemporary agency activities, but didn\u2019t shed significant light on torture. He let them \u201cpull the documents \u2026 This happened throughout, even up until the very end.\u201d</p> <p>The agency made other changes that eased the committee\u2019s task. Later in 2010, CIA got rid of the clunky old search tool, following longstanding complaints from both Jones and Durham\u2019s investigators, and replaced the network search function with a Google interface. Easier sifting was \u201chugely important\u201d, Jones said, as the agency kept piling material on. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This would never have happened if we had conducted this investigation \u2026 at our location, our computers</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The year 2010 gave way to 2011 and 2012. Panetta left to run the Pentagon and David Petraeus, the retired general, took his place. Petraeus seemed \u201csupportive\u201d of the inquiry, recalled Jones. Yet as the committee staff worked nights and weekends at the satellite CIA office, some wondered if the deluge of documentation was a tactic to ensure the investigation collapsed under the weight of accumulated material. </p> <p>Even with the glut of documentation, the Senate team did not have sufficient evidence to give an account of a major aspect of the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 apparatus: rendition. </p> <p>Renditions, used before 9/11, were extrajudicial transfers of captured people; after 9/11, a variant, called \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d, sent captives to the custody of allied intelligence services, neither American nor the country of a detainee\u2019s origin. Some of the CIA\u2019s closest rendition partners worked for the world\u2019s most brutal dictators: Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi, Pakistan\u2019s Pervez Musharraf, Egypt\u2019s Hosni Mubarak. <br></p> <p>The rendition infrastructure was even bigger than that of the black sites, which the CIA itself ran. More detainees ran through it than the at least 119 held at the black sites. But once detainees moved into a different intelligence service\u2019s custody, the records the CIA retained of them were scant, or secondhand, or both. It posed a problem for an investigation that sought rigorous internal documentation for every claim it would make. The more time the Senate spent attempting to run down rendition leads, the more it would delay its investigation of the CIA\u2019s interrogations and detentions. And after all, the mandate for the inquiry set by the committee was to determine what the CIA did to men it detained, not what its partners did. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt was a killer not to cover it, but you\u2019ve got to draw a line,\u201d Jones said. Much CIA documentation the committee had referring to rendition amounted to \u201chearsay\u201d, not enough to responsibly present.<br></p> <p>\u201cThose rendition records don\u2019t involve people who were technically detained by the CIA. These are transients. The records are just not there.\u201d </p> <p>But the consequence of that decision was profound. While ultimately the classified version of Jones\u2019s report would contain information on CIA renditions, the vast majority of the CIA\u2019s renditions operations \u2013 operations that left still-untold numbers of people disappeared, severely wounded, and likely worse \u2013 have been lost to history. </p> <p>Among legislators, the inquiry became background noise. Bond had relinquished the vice-chairmanship to Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who in 2009 had been the only dissenting vote against launching the investigation. Feinstein, on five different occasions, asked the GOP to rejoin the inquiry, to no avail. </p> <p>It took until August 2012 for the CIA to cease the bulk document production. (The CIA disputes this, and Trapani said it continued to \u201cfacilitate and support\u201d Senate document access until December 2014.) By then, the staff estimated they had the equivalent of two urban libraries. Jones had been writing the classified report incrementally. Starting in October 2011, Feinstein had him send pieces of the report to the committee, Democrats and Republicans, so no one was taken by surprise. </p> <p>In December 2012, Jones finished the report. It was at that point 6,200 pages long and entirely secret. In a sign of the diminished partisan consensus around torture, the vote to adopt the report was 9-6, with Maine moderate<strong> </strong>Olympia Snowe the only Republican to assent. Now would come the next fight: to declassify the report. </p> <p>But since the committee had a more immediate task, Feinstein and the Democrats decided to leverage it. On 7 February 2013, Obama confidant John Brennan had his confirmation hearing with the panel to run his beloved CIA. By now, the CIA had overcome its major fear over torture accountability: Durham\u2019s investigation had concluded in summer 2012 and had prosecuted no one. There would be no criminal accountability for torture, and it was an open question whether the public would ever read Jones\u2019s report. The committee sought Brennan\u2019s attitude toward the inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edb1b0d04a3d852bd679fdb2e6cc2e7219a15e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edb1b0d04a3d852bd679fdb2e6cc2e7219a15e4/0_100_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brennan is sworn in to testify at his confirmation hearing on 7 February 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brennan equivocated on torture throughout the hearing. Although he was the agency\u2019s deputy executive director when the program began, he minimized his knowledge of it. (A former CIA officer who has long known Brennan and who has since criticized torture, Glenn Carle, told the Guardian: \u201cHe has never been a proponent of this stuff.\u201d) Brennan called waterboarding \u201creprehensible\u201d but would not, under repeated questioning, call it torture. He promised outright to provide the committee with his \u201cfull and honest views\u201d after reading the torture report, but when pressed on declassifying it, said: \u201cI would have to take that declassification request under serious consideration, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>No response was forthcoming to the declassification request. But on 27 June 2013, the CIA sent a 100-plus page response to the committee raising a host of objections to the Senate\u2019s conclusions. </p> <p>The agency dissented from the conclusion that torture \u201cdid not produce unique intelligence that led terrorist plots to be disrupted, terrorists to be captured, or lives to be saved.\u201d That \u201cflawed conclusion\u201d led to another, the agency claimed: that the CIA \u201cresisted internal and external oversight and deliberately misrepresented to Congress, the executive branch, the media, and the American people\u201d the truth about its torture. </p> <p>Rejecting an assessment that the agency \u201cmisrepresented\u201d the program \u2013 lied about torture, less euphemistically \u2013 the agency said: \u201cThe factual record maintained by the agency does not support such conclusions.\u201d </p> <p>Jones was stunned, and for a very particular reason. For years, he had been in possession of a specific agency document that not only supported those conclusions, it reached them itself \u2013 what a senator on the committee, Mark Udall of Colorado, would later call a \u201csmoking gun\u201d.</p> <p>The document was the Panetta Review. Much of it remains a mystery to Jones even today: whether he or another staffer found it on the network, whether the agency meant them to receive it, or if an agency whistleblower slipped it onto the Senate drive. Nor does the CIA have an answer to the puzzle: \u201cCIA does not know how [Senate] staff acquired the unauthorized documents,\u201d Trapani said. But Jones recalls discovering it around 2010 and \u201cpretty immediately\u201d understanding its significance. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we saw this document, we weren\u2019t like, \u2018Oh, great, we got the CIA.\u2019 It was: \u2018Oh, Jesus Christ, thank God \u2013 we\u2019re not crazy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThis was high stakes. A lot was riding on it. It was a relief.\u201d </p> <p>They called it the Panetta Review because the agency prepared a summary of its renditions, detentions and interrogations work for Director Panetta, who had come to Langley after Obama shut the program down. One version was a Microsoft Word document, clearly a draft, with the function allowing users to see each others\u2019 changes enabled. Another version, apparently more final, was a PDF. Iterations by CIA were clear on view: \u201cYou could see the attorneys looking at it and saying, \u2018Well, let\u2019s make sure we can back this up, can you add more citations?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The final version of the Panetta Review, Jones said, was more than 1,000 pages long. The CIA has represented it as \u201csummaries of documents being provided to the [committee] \u2026 highlighting the most noteworthy information contained in the millions of pages of documents being made available,\u201d as agency attorney Martha Lutz would tell a court after Vice reporter Jason Leopold sought to acquire the still-classified document. Jones said that description is incorrect.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a narrative, plain and simple. \u2018This is Abu Zubaydah\u2019s interrogation.\u2019 \u2018This is KSM [Khalid Shaikh Mohammed].\u2019 They\u2019re topic oriented: \u2018These are the inaccurate things we told the president.\u2019 It\u2019s a final findings document. It has 13 findings. And one is, basically, they provided inaccurate information to support the use of EITs,\u201d or enhanced interrogation techniques, the agency\u2019s preferred euphemism for torture.<br></p> <p>Lutz would later tell a federal court that \u201ceven the post polished versions remained drafts and were subject to change\u201d. The CIA stopped compiling the Panetta Review in 2010 after Durham told Preston that CIA risked complicating any prosecution if it \u201cmade different judgments than the prosecutors had reached\u201d, Charlie Savage reported in his 2015 book Power Wars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s so shocking about that is that we thought this problem \u2026 was limited to the Bush administration</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Useful as the document was, it took on brand new significance now that the CIA was denying the conclusions that it had endorsed in the Panetta Review. </p> <p>\u201cI did not think they were going to say: \u2018None of this is right, you\u2019re all wrong.\u2019 I expected to receive the Panetta Review,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so shocking about that is that we thought this problem \u2013 the CIA providing inaccurate information to the president \u2013 was limited to the Bush administration, to [ex-directors] Tenet, Goss and Hayden.

DC Leaks has posted over 2,500 documents reflecting our grant-making strategies over the last decade, prompting a flurry of press reports from far-right news sites in the US and around the world.<br></p> <p>Earlier this summer, a shadowy organization called DC Leaks, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-11/russian-hackers-of-dnc-said-to-scoop-up-secrets-from-nato-soros\">believed by authorities to be a front for Russian operatives</a>, posted internal communications from the Democratic National Committee. The group also targeted a retired Nato commander, <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/12/russian-hacking-campaign-hits-republicans-too/\">Republican state officials</a> and staffers for several US senators. In recent days, there have been reports of attempted hacks of the New York Times and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-says-foreign-hackers-penetrated-000000175.html\">evidence of a breach of election databases in two states</a> \u2013 prompting the homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, to urge state elections officials to shore up security of their voting systems, in anticipation of possible attempts to interfere with US elections in November.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure all of us targeted by DC Leaks feel angry about the intrusion and worried about the damage it may do. Steal enough documents, and you\u2019re bound to find some unguarded speculation and harsh judgments. But most of what DC Leaks is publishing, at least about the Open Society Foundations and our grantees, is work we\u2019re proud to be doing. Indeed, all the targets of the hacks this summer \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, generals, newspapers and election officials \u2013 are champions of democracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/cyberstalking-online-stalking-email-threats-laurie-gough\">What it's like to be cyberstalked: when you can't escape the untraceable threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These cyber-attacks can be truly damaging, as US General Philip Breedlove, the retired Nato commander, learned when his personal emails were published, including one in which he complained about White House officials. Most famously, the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, lost her job because the leaks revealed staffers apparently tilting the party machinery against Bernie Sanders. But most of what DC Leaks has publicized is neither sinister nor shameful. The supposed controversies are elevated by being \u201cexposed\u201d through stolen messages and documents, even if what is revealed was already widely known. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Consider the \u201crevelations\u201d with which we at the Open Society Foundations have had to contend since DC Leaks stole documents from an online community of ours. One headline reads: \u201cSoros Paid Al Gore MILLIONS to Push \u2018Aggressive US Action\u2019 On Global Warming.\u201d Indeed, for over a decade the Open Society Foundations have supported several efforts to spur aggressive action on climate change. We were also accused of opportunistically seeking to improve police accountability in Baltimore\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-investigation-baltimore-police-department\">an idea endorsed by the Department of Justice</a>. </p> <p>Other headlines decry our work internationally: our support for the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel and fixing the broken European migration system. All true, as is our support for the reform government of the new Ukraine, and our opposition to Islamophobia in both Europe and the United States. This and much more have been \u201crevealed\u201d by DC Leaks, information aptly described in <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/editorial_cyber_insecurity\">a Sunday editorial by the Boston Herald</a> as: \u201cthe category of just because it\u2019s hacked doesn\u2019t make it news\u201d.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: being hacked is a terrible invasion and it does real harm. We are scrambling to protect the lives of grantees working in dangerous places. We also need to repair relationships where our candid views made public may have caused offense. We will work around the clock to safeguard every grantee and heal every breach. But we also know why we\u2019ve been attacked: because \u2013 like the others in the hackers\u2019 sights \u2013 we believe in human rights, democracy and open societies, and we\u2019re willing to act on our principles. </p> <p>Today\u2019s political hackers remind me of the Watergate burglars, only now they\u2019re breaking into servers instead of offices. Now, as then, the political bosses behind these break-ins hope to use the stolen material to embarrass or discredit their enemies. But the lesson of Watergate is that this tactic can easily boomerang, bolstering the democratic credentials of those attacked, and bringing the real discredit back on the dirty tricksters. </p> <p>Think of the organizations whose work has been stolen by DC Leaks as a new \u201cEnemies List\u201d \u2013 reminiscent of the roster President Nixon maintained of 20 journalists, lawyers, politicians and other public figures whom he reviled. It was certainly dangerous to be among the president\u2019s 20 enemies, but as Nixon\u2019s power waned, being on the list became a badge of honor. </p> <p>At least a couple of those included later described it as among their greatest achievements. Yes, you had been under surveillance and perhaps worse: maybe your office was burglarized, your phone calls tapped or your career derailed. But inclusion was also a mark of effectiveness: you had been speaking up enough to disturb a president who himself proved to be the true enemy of American democracy. </p> <p>These recent intrusions, and I expect there will be more, are a symptom of an aggressive assault on democratic principles that is taking place globally. As a private philanthropy, we have the independence to persist. We will learn from DC Leaks and will continue to support open society no matter whose enemies\u2019 lists we land on.</p>",

  "<p>It was 26 August 2003, almost two years since 9/11, and the sickening plume of smoke that hung over Ground Zero in lower Manhattan had long since dissipated. But steam was rising from the steps of city hall, three blocks away, where Hillary Clinton was venting her rage at the Bush administration for having lied to the American people.<br></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us expected that our government would knowingly deceive us about something as sacred as the air we breathe,\u201d she said, her voice tightening in anger. \u201cThe air that our children breathe in schools, that our valiant first responders were facing on the pile.\u201d</p> <p>Surrounded by firefighters and the doctors who were treating them for respiratory and other illnesses incurred when they worked on the massive mound of Ground Zero rubble \u2013 the \u201cpile\u201d, as it was known \u2013 the junior senator from New York was incandescent. Audiotape recorded at the time by <a href=\"http://wnyc.org/\">WNYC</a>, the city\u2019s public radio affiliate, captures a Clinton quite unlike the controlled public figure who is now a step away from the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Hillary Clinton, City Hall New York, August 2003\">  <iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"130\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/wnyc/#file=/audio/json/661422/\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/people/andrea-bernstein/\">Andrea Bernstein</a>, senior editor politics and policy for WNYC, listens back to Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments in the wake of 9/11. <em>If you are experiencing audio issues in Safari please try an alternative browser.</em></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton who emerges from the WNYC tapes is passionate, raw and unrestrained. Above all, she is livid. She had just learned that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/27/nyregion/clinton-and-nadler-seek-inquiry-into-epa-response-to-sept-11.html\">Bush administration</a> instructed officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reassure New Yorkers after 9/11 that the air over Ground Zero was safe. In fact, they had a pretty good idea that it was a toxic pall of asbestos, cement, glass dust, heavy metals, fuels and PCBs.</p> <p>\u201cI am outraged,\u201d Clinton went on. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath, the first couple of days, nobody could know. But a week later? Two weeks later? Two months later? Six months later? Give me a break!\u201d</p> <p>Of all the varied chapters of Clinton\u2019s tumultuous 30 years in public life, the story of her response to the attacks on the twin towers is one of the richest in terms of the clues it provides as to what to expect from a Clinton presidency. It reveals elements of her character, of her domestic policy strengths, as well as her tendency to lean towards the hawkish side in international affairs.</p> <p>As the 15th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, the memories of those days, and her role in them, remain fresh for many who stood by her side. Richard Alles was on the smoldering pile on 12 September, the day after the attacks, when Clinton turned up and proclaimed: \u201cThis attack on New York is an attack on America, it\u2019s an attack on every American.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed07223da4d56bc87413c73ba204421215789557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed07223da4d56bc87413c73ba204421215789557/0_23_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton greets New York City firefighters at the funeral for department chaplain the Rev Mychal Judge, who died at the World Trade Center.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton greets New York City firefighters at the funeral for department chaplain the Rev Mychal Judge, who died at the World Trade Center.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then a uniformed firefighter with battalion 58 in Canarsie, Brooklyn, Alles arrived at Ground Zero 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed. He stayed there for two days and nights, seeking survivors amid the ruins. What struck him most about Clinton that day, he said, was what he called her \u201ccompassion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe really went out of her way to speak to the first responders on the site to reassure them,\u201d he said. \u201cI never forgot it.\u201d</p> <p>Alles was also struck by how Clinton quickly grasped the potential health risks of Ground Zero, and how doggedly she pursued treatment for those who suffered. \u201cWe all knew from the get-go that the air was contaminated,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we had a job to do so we kept on working. Senator Clinton was at the forefront over dealing with it, she showed herself to be a fighter.\u201d</p> <p>On 9/11, Peter Gorman was president of the <a href=\"http://www.ufoa.org/\">Uniformed Fire Officers Association of New York City</a>, a union that represents largely white, blue-collar workers of the sort who today might back Donald Trump. The union had pointedly put its weight behind Clinton\u2019s opponent in the 2000 senatorial race, Republican Rick Lazio. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It took Clinton to put a spotlight on the issue and change the frame</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Chevat</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Gorman recalls being pleasantly surprised by Clinton\u2019s commitment, both in terms of her mastery of policy detail and on a personal level. \u201cShe would call me on my cellphone to ask how I was doing, how my members were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOne time I was pumping gas at a Texaco station, it was Christmas Eve, and she wanted to know how things were going. When a senator calls someone on my level, that\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p> <p>That same personal care made a profound impression on <a href=\"http://laurenmanning.com/\">Lauren Manning</a>, one of very few people who survived severe injuries from the planes crashing into the towers. She was engulfed by a fireball of jet fuel as she was entering the elevators in the north tower to go up to work at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 105th floor.</p> <p>She was burned on 83% of her body; 658 of her colleagues died.</p> <p>A few months later, Manning was in treatment at the Burke rehabilitation hospital in White Plains, New York, when she had a visitor. Clinton walked into her small hospital room and \u201cembraced me as best she could\u201d, she said. \u201cShe was kind and gentle, and she very specifically said to me that she was here for me and that she would remain at my side.\u201d</p> <p>Manning, who gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7M5veiz4RY\">keynote speech</a> on behalf of Clinton at the Democratic national convention in July, said that her most vivid memory was of the senator\u2019s eyes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d82baa7bdc816d3b2c9724da8fc27f394b10454d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82baa7bdc816d3b2c9724da8fc27f394b10454d/0_168_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton attends a memorial event at Ground Zero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton attends a memorial event at Ground Zero.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer S.

They were wide open and expressive, and they remained on mine. She didn\u2019t lose sight of what I was saying to her. To me, that was the mark of somebody who is sincere, who you want on your side.\u201d</p> <p>Having declared 9/11 to be an attack on all Americans, Clinton soon discovered that the national response was not entirely united or favorable to struggling New Yorkers. The head of the EPA at the time, Christine Todd Whitman, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/22/AR2008042202807.html\">repeatedly insisted</a> the air at Ground Zero was safe even as early as three days after the towers collapsed, as did Mayor Rudy Giuliani despite <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html\">worries within City Hall</a> that they were facing thousands of liability claims. </p> <p>Confronted by this wall of denial, Clinton was one of the most powerful voices warning of an impending health crisis. Ben Chevat, chief of staff to congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York on 9/11, recalls the impact. </p> <p>\u201cThe Bush administration was saying, \u2018There\u2019s no problem, move along\u2019,\u201d he said, \u201cand so it was hard work getting any traction in the media. Yet we knew there was a problem because people were getting sick with respiratory diseases and cancers.\u201d</p> <p>Chevat, now executive director of 9/11 Health Watch, said: \u201cIt took Clinton to put a spotlight on the issue and change the frame.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018She was a sponge for knowledge\u2019</h2> <p>Clinton and her allies started small but over time succeeded in dramatically expanding the health program for those who became ill after<strong> <br></strong>9/11. Within weeks of the attacks she had helped secure $12m for a pilot project at Mount Sinai hospital, screening some 9,000 workers with suspected Ground Zero illnesses.</p> <p>By April 2004 the program had grown to a $90m fund offering three free medical exams a year to 50,000 first responders and residents of lower Manhattan. In 2010, Clinton having passed on the baton to her successor in the US senate, Kirsten Gillibrand, reluctant Republicans in Congress were cajoled into passing the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/nyregion/23health.html\">$4bn Zadroga Act</a>, covering the health costs of those impaired by the toxic fumes. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/zadroga-act-reauthorization-finally-passes-congress-article-1.2470110\">program was extended</a> for 75 years, and <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/ataglance.html#overall\">now serves</a> 65,000 emergency responders and almost 10,000 9/11 resident survivors.</p> <p>Philip Landrigan, who hosted the first World Trade Center medical program at Mount Sinai, puts this success story in no small part down to Clinton\u2019s relentless pursuit of the subject coupled with her attention to detail. </p> <p>\u201cShe was angry at the Washington political leaders who would come to Ground Zero, have photos taken and then go back to DC and do nothing,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d111ac54e43f26fd8d6bea618007889fc5a7d3f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d111ac54e43f26fd8d6bea618007889fc5a7d3f5/0_31_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton tours the site of the World Trade Center the day after 9/11 with mayor Rudolph Giuliani and governor George Pataki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton tours the site of the World Trade Center the day after 9/11 with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governor George Pataki, left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert F Bukaty/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe became deeply knowledgable on the subject, not just fiscal and administrative details, but also about medical and mental health problems. She was a sponge for knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s powerful engagement in the 9/11 health cause makes for a strong contrast with how her presidential rival, Donald Trump, spent his time in the wake of the terrorist attacks. He used a loophole in federal funding to help small businesses hurt by the disaster to claim <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-9-11-funds-program-net-150g-payday-article-1.2641951\">$150,000 in subsidies</a> for a Wall Street real estate project.</p> <p>Yet when it comes to this year\u2019s presidential race, several of the people who worked closely with Clinton after 9/11 said they were puzzled by her struggle to win over voters. As a senator operating on the ground, and one to one, she came across as an effective and empathetic leader, they said. Writ large across the nation, her persona struggled to come across.</p> <p>\u201cShe may not be the most natural politician,\u201d said former firefighters union president Peter Gorman. \u201cI regret that sometimes she doesn\u2019t come across well in front of a crowd as people don\u2019t know her as so many of us do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While they were growing up all [younger officers] heard was this bad stuff about Clinton \u2013 the damage has been done</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Alles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alles, the firefighter, put her troubles with popularity in 2016 \u2013 she has an <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">unfavorable rating</a> of 55%, according to the RealClearPolitics.com average of polls \u2013 down to the criticism she has endured from political opponents and enemies over decades, from Whitewater in the 1990s to Benghazi and the email controversy today.

The controversial decision \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/may/19/hillary-clinton-iraq-war-mistake\">the hardest of her political life, she has said</a> \u2013 was predicated on her response to the collapse of the twin towers.</p> <p>As she told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer, the 9/11 attacks \u201cmarked me, and made me feel [fighting terrorism] was my No1 obligation as a senator\u201d.</p> <p>Micah Zenko, senior fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/\">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, who has studied Clinton\u2019s changing approach to Iraq, suggested her views were more nuanced and thoughtful than she has been credited for.

That she continues to wrestle with this vexed subject, and her record on it, was shown on Wednesday night when she used a foreign policy town hall in New York City to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy\">state bluntly</a> that she would not put US ground troops into Iraq \u201cever again\u201d.</p> <p>That has not assuaged anti-war campaigners who were active in 2002 and 2003. They are still angry about Clinton\u2019s pro-war vote, given the warnings they raised at the time.</p> <p>\u201cThere were many concerns raised, and one of the biggest was that little wars lead to big wars and big wars lead to bigger wars and this is going to be a quagmire,\u201d said Leslie Cagan, co-chair of the anti-war coalition United for Peace and Justice. \u201cThere is no endgame here \u2026 and of course that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p> <p>As early as 2004, Clinton was back on the Brian Lehrer show slamming the Bush administration again, this time for having misled the American people over weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein\u2019s purported links to al-Qaida. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been a vote \u2026 if everything we knew now had been known then,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But that further peeves the anti-war campaigners because it ignores the fact that before the invasion happened they were sounding the alarm about precisely those issues. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-commemorate-15th-anniversary-911-ground-zero-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52h36\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2709051\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton and Trump commemorate 15th anniversary of 9/11 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"NY POOL\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d567c7e4b07ac3d446b123\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/11/160911TrumpClinton911_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/11/160911TrumpClinton911.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/11/160911TrumpClinton911_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-commemorate-15th-anniversary-911-ground-zero-video\">Clinton and Trump commemorate 15th anniversary of 9/11</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Cagan put it: \u201cThere were many warnings: don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t go into Iraq, don\u2019t start a war that doesn\u2019t need to be started.

Guyula, a Liya-dh\u00e4linymirr Djambarrpuy\u014bu man, former pilot, and former lecturer at Charles Darwin University on Yolngu studies, ran on a campaign which included calls for a treaty between the NT government and Indigenous groups, and greater self-governance for Indigenous people.<br></p> <p>Guyula had spoken out about a lack of funding and resources reaching remote Indigenous communities, particularly in Arnhem Land, which contains the seat of Nhulunbuy.</p> <p>He has served as spokesman for the Yolngu Nations Assembly group, pushing for a treaty.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone knows we have sought a treaty from Australian governments since the Barunga Statement of 1988, and with two later petitions in 1998 and 2008,\u201d he said prior to the election.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments have largely ignored these diplomatic gestures, so we decided to stop waiting and get started.\u201d</p> <p>Gunner criticised Guyula last week over <a href=\"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/customary-law-push-from-likely-seat-winner/news-story/1a4ddb07207a06d134b0ea60c91b017b\">comments he made to the NT News</a> that domestic violence orders broke up families and the legal system favoured women.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything against women but it needs to be fair because a lot of the time, women start the fighting and men end up in jail,\u201d Guyula had said.</p> <p>Gunner said he couldn\u2019t agree. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way it\u2019s been put to me by the men and women working with the scourge of family violence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Walker, who held the seat since 2008, on Wednesday said Guyula\u2019s Yolngu background may have helped in the predominantly Indigenous electorate, but refuted that she could not represent her Yolngu constituents.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not Yolngu, I know that, I can\u2019t be Yolngu, but over the years I\u2019ve worked really hard to engage with Yolngu community and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Yolngu,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-07/lynne-walker-nhulunbuy-seat-could-lead-to-challenge/7820448\">she told the ABC</a>.</p> <p>The federal Labor member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, congratulated the two new Labor members, Wakefield and Nelson, calling the result \u201chistoric\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a credit to their stamina, their determination and commitment that voters in Braitling and Katherine had a valid alternative to the indifferent, scandal-ridden representation offered by the CLP.\u201d<br></p>",

The centre-right tribes are fractured, which creates difficulties when attempting to seek an organising principle, a campfire of common values.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s personal objective over the last year was simple: wrest back the leadership of the Liberal party from Tony Abbott, then try not to repeat the mistakes of his last period of opposition leadership. Rather than bend the Liberal party to his will, this time he would try to build some bridges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/02/malcolm-turnbull-can-avoid-a-slow-political-death-on-his-knees-by-living-on-his-feet\">Malcolm Turnbull can avoid a slow political death on his knees by living on his feet | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The concessions first up \u2013 bowing to the culture war preoccupations of the party\u2019s conservative wing: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/the-plebiscite-is-a-device-to-destroy-turnbull-and-delay-marriage-equality\">keeping the marriage equality plebiscite</a>, the hat-tipping to George Christensen on the safe schools program, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/supportive-malcolm-turnbull-in-deal-with-bob-day-to-defer-18c-push/news-story/3e0e3afc1a48abfb1373b5bab9189d78\">a wink and a nod on reforming the Racial Discrimination Act</a>, keeping climate change on the absolute down-low.

It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were petty power struggles obvious enough to spill over into the public domain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone could at least agree on that.</p> <p>With the emphatic sweep of Team Turnbull back into power in the capital, confidence was to be king. We moved into the Exciting Times, and the relief around the country was palpable. It was as if a dark cloud, slung low across the landscape, misting out the sun, had suddenly lifted. Business could barely contain its rejoicing, the polls soared, the country was permitted to think beyond the cartoonish black and white propositions of the Abbott era. A quick package on science and innovation, a couple of passions. Then a swerve into the tax reform debate, which was supposed to be about reinforcing Turnbull\u2019s intrinsic strengths as some kind of futurist guru, a seer with the mental acuity and entrepreneurial capacity to know how to recalibrate Australia\u2019s economy from a mining boom to something else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"534130db5ea0442dfe8bbb2971bce3e2f8724355\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534130db5ea0442dfe8bbb2971bce3e2f8724355/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull announces his new cabinet at a press conference with Julie Bishop on 20 September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull announces his new cabinet at a press conference with Julie Bishop on 20 September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the tax debate quickly fell into chaos. Turnbull\u2019s tendency to want 100 flowers blooming simultaneously, his venture capitalist instincts to extend mightily, contract sharply when reaching the limits of a concept and recalibrate instantly into the next thought, looked more unsteady than bold. The brash and the rash collided inelegantly into the punishing demands for simple answers generated by a news cycle that throbs in the thrall of the new, lives to punish, and never sleeps.</p> <p>It also became clear that Turnbull and his treasurer, Scott Morrison, were not really on the same page. There were petty power struggles obvious enough to spill over into the public domain. Then competitive federalism enjoyed a short boom, bust cycle. The states would levy their own income taxes. Actually they wouldn\u2019t, because they didn\u2019t want to.</p> <p>The gloss was coming off, and the stampede to an early election was gathering pace. Magic bullets started to look enticing \u2013 a Senate reform debate, presaging a run to a double dissolution election, that would deliver that magic mandate where everything could become a little easier.</p> <p>The mandate was supposed to be emphatic. It was an illuminated landmark on the horizon, encouraging steady marathon swimming in choppy waters.</p> <p>But of course the mandate didn\u2019t materialise. After an eight week campaign that comprehensively failed to detect and speak to the national mood, Turnbull is back in power by a whisker. His fury at the apparent indifference of fate to what is supposed to be the inexorable rise of Malcolm rang out just after midnight on election night on 2 July: shock, anger, disbelief, utterly unvarnished; the director\u2019s cut. Once seen, never forgotten.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fc7398e1c6bac8e961646f113289074bce2b989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc7398e1c6bac8e961646f113289074bce2b989/0_0_4500_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull addresses party members during the Liberal party election night event at the Sofitel Wentworth hotel in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull addresses party members during the Liberal party election night event at the Sofitel Wentworth hotel in Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The complexity of governing in the contemporary era swallows prime ministers whole. Being freed of responsibility confers a kind of lightness. While Turnbull has been executing his complex gambit, Tony Abbott has been running his own.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s last term in office tells us all we need to know about the dangers of former prime ministers remaining on in public life, thwarted political ambition metastasising into some hydra-headed monster. We know how the story can go, the recent experience remains visceral.</p> <p>Abbott spent a period lying low after his public execution, watching the Turnbull ascendancy soaring overhead, watching on unhappily as colleagues trashed his period in government as an abject disaster, which, of course, it was. The conservative wing, apart from the loyal old factional generals, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews, switched over into post-Tony mode, moving on to next generation options, cutting their losses with a person who had failed their common cause.</p> <p>But Abbott is a politician of vaulting ambition. As a person, he\u2019s driven and hyper-competitive. He pushes himself to physical extremity. The events of last September proved to be not an end, but the opening of a new phase.</p> <p>Abbott\u2019s first cycle of rapprochement with colleagues has been contrition. The second has been public forays that are designed to have demonstration effects: they are designed to show that he can lob simple rhetorical bombs that resonate with the base, and pierce the default distraction of ordinary voters going about their lives. Colleagues are invited by inference to compare and contrast the style with the current occupant of the Lodge. </p> <p>Word around the Coalition is Abbott is writing a book about how to be a conservative political party, a new manifesto post Battlelines. The internal feedback in the Coalition suggests Abbott is currently feeling out the landscape, working out where various people are, building bridges, trying to cultivate networks.</p> <p>But Abbott is not the only person positioning out of a calculation that the Turnbull experiment won\u2019t last.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s relationship with his deputy, Julie Bishop, suffered a blow post-election when he very obviously hung her out to dry during the cabinet deliberation about whether or not to anoint Kevin Rudd as Australia\u2019s candidate to lead the United Nations. Bishop is an incredibly hard worker who is assiduous with the backbench, doing what needs doing, being where they need her to be, and in politics, that counts for a lot.</p> <p>Peter Dutton is the most important conservative figure in the parliament. Scott Morrison\u2019s ambition is ever present on Ray Hadley\u2019s morning program on 2GB, more present, in fact, than the consistency of his performance as treasurer.</p> <p>In the next generation Josh Frydenberg is a man on the move if we\u2019ve ever seen one, an relentless networker, a builder of bridges between the moderate wing and the conservative wing. It was notable Turnbull gave Frydenberg climate change when he refashioned his ministry post election, something of a poisoned chalice. A meaty conundrum to occupy a fellow of momentum.</p> <p>Christian Porter also has a lot of fans internally because of his grasp of complex and complicated policy issues. Of the generation beyond, Angus Taylor is one of those parliamentarians who succeeds in putting himself on a travelator, understanding the art of the calculated intervention on issues that colleagues care about.</p> <p>This catalogue of ambition is not meant as one of those dispiriting race call assessments that now pour out of Canberra in substitution for investigations or deep policy analysis, it is not meant to be another manifestation of our apparently endless appetite for instability \u2013 in truth, I\u2019m exhausted by it. The whole system feels diminished and frayed and rudderless.</p> <p>Politicians live to plot, but the political class is also exhausted by the relentless zero sum of the past few election cycles. That exhaustion factor is one component that makes Turnbull\u2019s future hard to predict.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turnbull has been too preoccupied righting the wrongs of 2009 to understand that he\u2019s now in a wholly different phase</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But a few things are clear one year down the track.</p> <p>There were always people inside the Liberal party who were going to resist the Turnbull experiment, because they view him as an interloper, a person in the wrong party, too centrist, too dismissive of conservative shibboleths, too unbound by the conventions of the institutional game of politics, a person without a power base, a person too intent on a frolic of his own.</p> <p>Those people were never going to shift. They were never going to be pacified by charm, or appeasement, by genuflection, or collaboration, they would take it as weakness, and use the weakness to wear him down before tearing him down.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.  But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can\u2019t blame people for thinking that.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Humans of New York (@humansofny) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-08T17:08:40+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 8, 2016 at 10:08am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the post, Clinton recalled sitting down to take a law school admissions test at Harvard.

So that\u2019s kind of where the idea of the national student poet programme came from.\u201d</p> <p>Obama also recalled the first White House poetry jam in 2009 where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFf7nMIGnE\">Lin-Manuel Miranda rapped about Alexander Hamilton</a>, soon to be expanded into the hit musical Hamilton, \u201cone of the most extraordinary pieces of art that I - and probably so many others - have ever seen\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFf7nMIGnE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WNFf7nMIGnE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But it was a poetry medley by students past and present, beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the state dining room, that moved Obama to the brink of tears on Thursday. \u201cIf we ever wonder...\u201d she began, sighing with emotion, \u201cif what we do makes a difference, it does.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice still low and unsteady, Obama added: \u201cThank you everyone for all of this.

In August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/us-jobs-report-august-economy\">US created 151,000 jobs</a> - about 30,000 below expectations. However, on average the US economy added about 230,000 a month over the last three months. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation- longest streak on record. It was also the 77th consecutive month of private sector job growth.</p> <p>The Obama administration insists that the jobs added over the past few months tend to be good, middle class jobs rather than \u201cbad jobs\u201d as Trump described them. According to US labor secretary Tom Perez, education and health sectors have added the most job in the last year, followed by professional and business services.</p> <p>\u201cI use these two examples to highlight what we are seeing in this recovery, which is over the last two to three years, not only do we see a growth in the quantity of jobs but we are seeing a distinct growth in the quality of jobs. More and more middle class and above jobs are being created in the last two to three years,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cAnother sector that is really rebounding - especially in the last few months is government, which during the early stages of the recovery it usually recovers really fast but it didn\u2019t. And now we are seeing some real rebound in government jobs, which tend to be solid middle class jobs. I am heartened not just by the number of jobs we are creating but by the quality of jobs that are being created.\u201d</p> <p>One of the main reasons for the delay in recovery in government sector is the sequester - the automatic budget cuts that were included in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Had it been not for the budget cuts championed by Congress Republicans after the 2008 economic crisis, unemployment rate might have been higher, said Perez.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had the investment rates that we saw during the Reagan administration now, we would have an unemployment rate that would be probably two to three tenths of a percent lower than it currently is,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/barack-obama-us-minimum-wage-republicans-tom-perez\">he said</a>. The US unemployment rate is 4.9%. \u201cBut the lingering effect of sequester has a dramatically negative impact on government hiring and it also had on a federal level and on state and local level.\u201d</p> <p>Despite better jobs being created, there are still more than six million Americans who want full time jobs, but are only working part-time at the moment. Additionally, there are 7.5 million Americans who are working more than one jobs to make ends meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/us-economy-recession-republicans-hillary-clinton-policy\">Republicans have themselves to blame for the slow economy, study says</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1c2eee4b013613fffb61f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T20:01:40.739Z\">9.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Esquire Magazine has added an editor\u2019s note to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">a profile of Donald Trump</a> that the Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly cited as proof that he never supported the invasion of Iraq, calling the characterization inaccurate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The following story was published in the August 2004 issue of Esquire.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.  But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can\u2019t blame people for thinking that.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Humans of New York (@humansofny) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-08T17:08:40+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 8, 2016 at 10:08am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T17:51:24.189Z\">at 6.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d19e70e4b08465d44feb8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T17:24:02.881Z\">6.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Clinton finishes her speech, to cheers.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appeared back-to-back on TV Wednesday night to take questions about foreign policy, veterans\u2019 affairs and, in Clinton\u2019s case, her emails. </p> <p>Clinton was criticized for not getting to her points quickly enough for the tight format. Trump was criticized for not having any points to make, instead ordering \u201coff his familiar campaign menu of word salads\u201d, as Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers.
