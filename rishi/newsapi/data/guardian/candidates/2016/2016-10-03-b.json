  "<p>A federal appeals court has issued a stinging ruling dismissing as \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d Indiana governor Mike Pence\u2019s attempt to deter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/refugees-drc-congo-us-syria\">Syrian refugees</a> from settling in the state because of terrorism fears.</p> <p>The decision by the seventh circuit on Monday was the latest legal setback to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/indiana-syrian-refugees-resettlement-blocked\">efforts launched by Donald Trump\u2019s running mate</a> in the wake of last November\u2019s Paris terrorist attacks to stop Syrian refugees from coming to Indiana by denying them aid.</p> <p>Like many other states, Indiana receives money from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and contracts with humanitarian groups to provide local welfare services to refugees. Under federal law, such help must be provided \u201cwithout regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/connecticut-welcomes-syrian-refugee-family-indiana-governor-says-no\">Connecticut welcomes Syrian refugee family after Indiana governor says no</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, though, specifically attempted to exclude refugees originating from Syria on the basis that they might be terrorists. He ordered the state not to reimburse groups for the costs of providing aid to Syrians. According to the court, 174 Syrian refugees came to Indiana in the past fiscal year.</p> <p>While this hardline stance may have chimed with the views of Trump, whose immigration policies have included proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, it was rejected by the three-judge appeals court panel in a six-page ruling that echoed a lower court\u2019s decision earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion adds that Pence\u2019s claim that he is not discriminating based on nationality but purely acting based on safety concerns is \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome was expected after Indiana\u2019s plan was received less than warmly in court during oral arguments last month. Courthouse News reported that Judge Frank Easterbrook <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/09/14/indiana-ban-on-syrian-refugees-draws-mockery-from-7th-circuit.htm\">said</a>: \u201cWhen a state makes an argument that\u2019s saying we\u2019re differentiating according to whether somebody is from Syria, but that has nothing to do with national origin, all it produces is a broad smile.\u201d Posner asked: \u201cAre Syrians the only Muslims that Indiana fears?\u201d</p> <p>Ken Falk, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said in a statement: \u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision underscores what we have said throughout this litigation \u2026 Governor Pence may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.\u201d The ACLU represented Exodus Refugee Immigration, a not-for-profit agency that brought the lawsuit.</p> <p>With immigration and battling Isis key issues in the forthcoming presidential election, leading Republican politicians have accused the federal government of failing to adequately screen refugees and several states have tried to exert more control over who is resettled inside their borders, though immigration is a federal matter.</p> <p>Last Friday, Texas became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/texas-withdraws-federal-refugee-resettlement-program-syrians\">latest state</a> to opt out of the federal refugee resettlement programme, following New Jersey and Kansas earlier this year.</p> <p>But the move will not stop the arrival of refugees from Syria or anywhere else in the Lone Star state. The federal government and aid agencies will instead work to formulate an arrangement that circumvents the state\u2019s administration of the process.</p> <p>The Obama administration has pledged to increase the number of refugees arriving in the US from Syria and other nations. The president <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/us-narrowly-misses-refugee-limit-for-2016/3533782.html\">announced last month</a> that the US would accept 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 \u2013 up from 85,000 in 2016, of which more than 12,500 were Syrian.</p> <p>Pence faces off against Tim Kaine, his Democratic opponent, in the vice-presidential debate in Virginia on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Wells Fargo is guilty of \u201cegregious corporate behavior\u201d, Hillary Clinton said while speaking at a rally in Ohio on Monday. Her speech came on the same day as Illinois became the second state to cut ties with the bank. </p> <p>The Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s criticism was part of a speech focusing on a new proposal that would make it easier for consumers to sue companies that might have wronged them. </p> <p>\u201cReally shocking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clinton said about Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices, adding that the bank had bullied thousands of its employees into committing fraud, opening millions of accounts without customers\u2019 permission and knowledge and misusing personal information. \u201cWe are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and lose with the law.\u201d</p> <p>Wells Fargo came under scrutiny from US regulators and lawmakers last month when it announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/wells-fargo-settlement-illegal-sales-accounts\">a $185m settlement</a> for opening more than 2m accounts without customers\u2019 permission from 2011 to 2016.</p> <p>The unauthorized accounts were opened in order to meet quotas imposed on the bank\u2019s employees for generating new business. Bank officials insist the employees acted on their own and that their actions were not part of an \u201corchestrated effort\u201d. As of this weekend, Wells Fargo had terminated sales quotas for its retail banking products, such as credit cards, checking accounts and overdraft insurance. </p> <p>Clinton said that Wells Fargo\u2019s actions are an example of \u201cegregious corporate behavior\u201d. She promised that if elected president, she would hold accountable \u201cbad actor\u201d companies that scam their customers and abuse their employees. One way to do that would be to end to mandatory arbitration clauses that companies often insert into their contracts. These clauses prohibit customers from suing companies and instead mandate that disputes be resolved in arbitration. </p> <p>Companies like Wells Fargo \u201cuse these fine-print gotchas to escape responsibility\u201d, said Clinton. \u201cWe are going to rein that in across everybody.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/wells-fargo-clawbacks-outraged-us-congress\">'School for scoundrels': Wells Fargo cuts not enough for outraged US Congress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, John Stumpf, was asked about the bank\u2019s arbitration clause last week on Capitol Hill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/wells-fargo-clawbacks-outraged-us-congress\">when he testified</a> before the House financial services committee.</p> <p> \u201cIf [your customers] want their day in court, will you screw them out of that?\u201d California congressman Brad Sherman asked. Stumpf attempted to answer, saying \u201cNo, but \u2026\u201d before being interrupted by Sherman, who ended his questioning by calling for the break-up of the big banks.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s speech came just hours after the Illinois state treasurer stood before a room full of reporters and announced that his state was terminating its dealings with Wells Fargo for the next 12 months. Over the past year, Illinois had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.illinoistreasurer.gov/TWOCMS/media/doc/October2016IllinoisStateTreasurerFrerichsPulls$30BillionfromWellsFargo.pdf\">more than $30bn in investment</a> activity with the bank. The move ensures that millions of dollars in associated fees will go to other financial institutions instead of Wells Fargo. </p> <p>Illinois is not the first state to impose a year-long ban on investing with Wells Fargo. Last Wednesday, California <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/28/wells-fargo-customers-accounts-scandal-california-treasurer-ban\">announced a similar ban</a>. Both states have suspended investments in Wells Fargo securities and use of Wells Fargo as a broker/dealer for purchases of their investments. </p> <p>When the one-year period is up, both states will re-evaluate their relationship with Wells Fargo and review whether the bank has put in place proper internal controls.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s statements about \u201cbankers playing fast and lose with the law\u201d were unfair, according to Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. </p> <p>\u201cWhen people blanket a whole class of people by making statements, I think that\u2019s just unfair to everybody. I could do the same thing about media, I could do the same thing about politicians or lawyers. They are just never accurate,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/783020731856588800\">Dimon said</a> in an interview with CNBC following Clinton\u2019s rally. He went on to say that the banking industry is full of qualified, smart and ethical people. \u201cPeople broke the law, they should be punished but let\u2019s take a deep breath,\u201d he said. </p>",

  "<p>On 28 September the Stockport NHS Watch group presented an analytical account of the way in which the Conservative government, starting with the Health and Social Care Act 2012, has been transforming the NHS into a US-style insurance scheme.</p> <p>The Conservatives have a guarantee of another four years to carry out this programme, another six years if they win a snap election in 2017. John Harris (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/labour-party-of-the-future-labour-conference-momentum\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 29 September) writes that a \u201cnew modernised movement is taking place\u201d on the left in which a \u201cremodelled Labour party might eventually emerge\u201d.</p> <p>By 2020? By then it will be too late. By then the degree of damage to the NHS and the extent of transformation of it into private health care will be immense. We will be back to 1947, before the NHS. Harris speaks of \u201cLabour\u2019s predicament\u201d. He can say that again. There is only one solution: it is unity of opposition to the Tories now and defeat of them at the next election whenever it comes. That requires one almighty transformation into cooperation between the PLP and Momentum.</p> <p>The whole parliamentary Labour party must now pledge support to Corbyn and offer itself entire for places in the shadow cabinet, and Momentum must abandon deselection of MPs. It is the sacrifice by both sides that has to be made.</p> <p>The 1948 NHS is the jewel in the crown of this country\u2019s achievements. Only unity can save it for the people. What else is the Labour movement in existence for?<br><strong>Michael Knowles</strong><br><em>Congleton, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Mandatory reselection of Labour MPs, abolished under Tony Blair, is simply basic democratic accountability. Trade union general secretaries stand for election every five years and lay union representatives, working hard to represent their members while facing facility time cuts, between one and three years.</p> <p>The sense of entitlement and concern for their careers that has anti-Corbyn MPs hyperventilating at the prospect of mandatory reselection will not restrain them from colluding with the pro-corporate establishment to conduct smear campaigns or organising coups to ensure their party leader is subjected to yearly mandatory reselection through doomed but divisive leadership challenges.<br><strong>John McInally</strong><br><em>National vice-president,</em> <em>Public and Commercial Services union</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>It is sadly appropriate that the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader has coincided with a escalation of the appalling assault on the people of Aleppo by Assad\u2019s regime and Russia, dropping a barrage of napalm, chlorine and barrel bombs, murdering citizens sheltering underground and destroying what remains of their hospitals and shattered medical facilities (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/30/syria-un-aid-convoys-more-than-four-fifths-blocked-delayed-september\" title=\"\">Report, 1 October</a>).</p> <p>It is three years since Labour, pressured by the Stop the War campaign (chaired by Corbyn), won a vote in parliament preventing the government from supporting President Obama\u2019s proposal to use military action to stop Assad using chemical weapons. Obama then dropped his proposal, which clearly gave Assad\u2019s regime and Russia confidence that they could do whatever they liked to the people of Syria, with the devastating consequences we are now seeing. The current bombing is to be followed, it seems, by a massive ground assault, which is likely to see a huge escalation in mass killing. The troops preparing for this murderous onslaught come in large part from those Corbyn has called his \u201cfriends\u201d in Hezbollah. Hezbollah has in fact invaded Syria from Lebanon and is itself an agent of another foreign power \u2013 Iran.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s supporters like to tell us all that he is thoroughly decent, a man with principles. But these are principles that have enabled many on the left today to ignore and collude with what are not just war crimes (it is after all a war of the state against its own people), but also crimes against humanity, if not genocide. We now urgently need to reassert the core socialist values of solidarity with those suffering injustice, oppression and facing annihilation.<br><strong>Philip Spencer</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor in Holocaust and genocide studies, Kingston University</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy Corbyn made his name as a peace campaigner. The children of Aleppo only know the peace of the grave. Corbyn looks for moral high ground to occupy rather than supporting an intervention that would have saved them. The devastating consequences of the commons vote in August 2013 still appear to be too sensitive a subject for any journalist to raise with him.<br><strong>Brian Devlin</strong><br><em>Galashiels, Scottish Borders</em></p> <p>\u2022 David Owen\u2019s suggestion (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/peace-syria-possible-turkish-forces-nato-russia\" title=\"\">Opinion, 30 September</a>) that \u201cpeace in Syria is possible\u201d through a direct Turkish military assault upon Syrian government forces is Orwellian. The US, UK, Turkish and Saudi governments have already poured billions of dollars in cash, weapons and training into rebel forces since 2012. If David would like them to escalate, he can write that, but he shouldn\u2019t insult readers by talking about paths to peace.<br><strong>Daniel Green</strong><br><em>Boston, USA</em></p>",
  "<p>Like the Gulf stream, or a young Republican who doesn\u2019t wear beige chinos, we know Mike Pence and Tim Kaine exist \u2013 we just don\u2019t really see them.</p> <p>With the media focused on Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-interview-bill-hillary-clinton.html\">near daily</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/trump-overnight-media-tweets/\">indiscretions</a>, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/hillary-clinton-twitter-national-service-scholarships-trump\">various</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-affairs-joel-benenson-229046\">responses</a> to those indiscretions, both the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential nominees have been forced into the shadows.<br></p> <p>But no more. Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate will be Kaine and Pence\u2019s first chance to show us all what we\u2019ve been missing. Here\u2019s why it will definitely be exciting \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Finding out which is which</strong></h2> <p>Both vice-presidential candidates are middle-aged white men. Both have single-syllable first and last names and five-letter last names. Both have grey hair. Both of them were <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/poll-mike-pence-trump-vp-pick-225553\">largely</a> <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/07/22/tim-kaine-vice-president-pick-hillary-clinton/\">unknown</a> to the public before they were chosen as running mates.</p> <p>Tuesday night is an opportunity for Americans to play spot-the-difference. Kaine and Pence will introduce themselves at the beginning of the debate \u2013 clearing up, once and for all, which one is Kaine and which one is Pence.</p> <p>If you happen to miss those opening introductions: Pence\u2019s hair is almost white and he has the straight-backed bearing of a mid-ranking military man. He is the governor of Indiana and is Trump\u2019s running mate.</p> <p>Kaine\u2019s hair is not as white as Pence\u2019s. He has the happy, contented face of a God-fearing village baker. He is a US senator for Virginia and is Clinton\u2019s running mate.</p> <h2><strong>The names Kaine and Pence are excellent starting points for puns</strong></h2> <p>Will Kaine prove Abel to take debate tupPence? What if a faulty Mike leads to a Pence-ive performance? Wow your family and friends with some pre-cooked headline puns based on the vice-presidential candidates\u2019 names. Like these:</p> <ul> <li>Mike proves master of sus-Pence<br></li> <li>\u2018Bring back the Kaine!\u2019 \u2013 Virginia senator calls for return to corporal punishment<br></li> <li>Value of Pence drops after pound-ing<br></li> <li>Remark of Kaine<br></li> <li>Indiana governor Pence-ive in face of Hurri-Kaine<br></li> <li>Kaine Abel to make his mark, Mike Pence-ive<br></li> <li>Mike attributes sniffles to misplaced EpiPence<br></li> <li>Spend more Pence<br></li> </ul> <p>You might notice I was running out of ideas towards the end.</p> <h2><strong>Can Pence get back on message?</strong></h2> <p>The pressure is on Pence to hew to Trumpian beliefs, after repeatedly being caught off-message in a recent weeks.</p> <p>In September Pence broke with Trump protocol by <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/09/pf/taxes/mike-pence-taxes/\">releasing his own tax returns</a>. Worse, they showed that he had never lost $1bn in a single financial year, and therefore is not a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/trump-no-income-tax-spin/502643/\">genius</a>. Worse still, they showed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/us/politics/mike-pence-tax-returns.html\">evidence of charitable donations</a>. </p> <p>Pence is also yet to tweet baseless accusations about Miss Universe 1996. In fact, he is yet to post to any social media platform regarding any of the 65 Miss Universes. </p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s debate is a chance for Pence to tilt back to Trump. Although he already seems to have made a misstep <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/pence-trump-debate-prep/\">by actually preparing for the debate</a>.</p> <h2><strong>A relaxing evening in front of the television</strong></h2> <p>The first Clinton-Trump debate was mostly described in boxing terms.</p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s jabs put Trump on defensive\u201d, <a href=\"http://english.almanar.com.lb/43976\">said the The Washington Post</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-worst-debate_us_57e9e5fce4b024a52d2a3b61\">the Huffington Post noted</a> that Trump was left \u201creeling from blow after blow\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-first-debate-scorecard/\">The Los Angeles Times declared</a> that \u201cClinton outpunched Trump\u201d.</p> <p>But a lot of people don\u2019t want to watch boxing on the television. Literally or figuratively. They want a nice sit-down with something banal and inoffensive, like Dancing with the Stars or the Big Bang Theory or something to do with singing.</p> <p>Kaine-Pence promises to be along those more sedate lines. Not so much watching paint dry, but watching paint that has already dried continue to stay in place on a wall. Lovely.</p>",
  "<p>This is a public service announcement.</p> <p>Despite all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-reaction-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">drama of the debates</a>; despite all that\u2019s at stake for the world\u2019s security and stability; despite all the breathless coverage; this election is about as small as it gets.</p> <p>A little more than a month away from election day, what have we really debated through this long contest?</p> <p>We have dissected the midnight tweets of a delusional, failed businessman. We have watched in awe at his man-child tantrums and eruptions. We have investigated emails that the National Archives will never see. We have fretted about a candidate\u2019s bacterial infection.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be honest. We have not debated war and peace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/death-of-neoliberalism-crisis-in-western-politics\">capitalism and socialism</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\">surveillance and privacy</a>. More than anything else, we have simply obsessed about the psychopathic freak show that is the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Let the historians of the future know that the great Trump-Clinton contest of 2016 was much like the famous Seinfeld pitch to NBC: it\u2019s a show about nothing.</p> <p>In that sense, we have to recognize something profound about this point in time. The blame is not entirely on the candidates or the campaigns, or even on our own shallow nature.</p> <p>For this is an election at a time of relative peace and prosperity. Yes, it\u2019s true: peace and prosperity. And our failure to admit the obvious is hurting our ability to sustain an adult conversation about our politics.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t already pressed the publish button on your comments below, or tweeted your outrage to the world, it\u2019s time to consider the facts.</p> <p>Yes, of course there are unacceptable levels of gun violence and isolated acts of homegrown terrorism. And the squeeze on the middle class \u2013 as well as the gap between rich and poor \u2013 is a profound challenge to us all.</p> <p>But back in the Seinfeld era, our cities saw far higher murder rates. There were the large-scale terrorist attacks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/apr/20/usa.iankatz\">Oklahoma City</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/olympic-park-bombings-atlanta-1996-richard-jewell\">Atlanta Olympics</a>, the first attack on the World Trade Center and the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>The first internet bubble created millionaires and billionaires overnight, while the manufacturing decline that began in the early 1980s continued to hollow out the rust belt.</p> <p>So we rolled into an election at the end of the 1990s that bears a remarkable similarity to this one: a contest between two candidates who thrilled nobody in particular.</p> <p>A wonkish Democrat who wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail politics, seeking a third term after a popular and charismatic president. A simplistic Republican gun-slinger who promised a return to the Reagan era of even greater wealth and military superiority. Reporters (including this one) considered which of the two they would rather share a beer with. Meanwhile younger voters thought both candidates were hopelessly irrelevant to their lives and tiresomely similar in their politics.</p> <p>Of course the political differences between George W Bush and Al Gore were obvious and catastrophically so. As we now know, within a year of taking office, President Bush had decided to invade Iraq \u2013 a decision almost unthinkable for a President Gore. With a Gore White House, the US would have led the world on climate change more than a decade before President Obama struck the Paris agreement.</p> <p>But back in 2000, at another time of relative peace and prosperity, it didn\u2019t seem to matter whether voters cast a few ballots for Ralph Nader or even got confused and chose Pat Buchanan. And so the infinitely wise supreme court decided the course of the planet on the basis of 537 votes in Florida.</p> <p>The Trump-Clinton election isn\u2019t like 2004: a contest about national security, playing out in the bloodbath of the Iraqi civil war, while Osama bin Laden was still at large. It\u2019s nothing like 2008: an election that unfolded as the economy plunged into freefall in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p> <p>It may have some echoes of 2012, when a wealthy businessman who liked the idea of self-deportation went up against a mainstream Democrat on issues of gender equality. But that was a presidential re-election effort, and both the president and the economy were very far from where they are today.</p> <p>Today unemployment stands at 4.9%. That\u2019s lower than it was during George W Bush\u2019s election in 1988, Clinton\u2019s re-election in 1996, and Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004. Four years ago, as Obama ran for the second time, it was 7.8%.</p> <p>The only recent election with a lower rate: Bush v Gore in 2000, when unemployment was 3.9%.</p> <p>Household incomes surged 5.2% last year, the largest gain since records began in 1967. If incomes continue to grow this year, they will have made up all the lost ground since the Great Recession of eight years ago and will be close to the all-time high reached in \u2013 when else? \u2013 1999. Gas prices are lower than they were in the last two elections, and the president\u2019s job approval ratings are above 50%.</p> <p>And while there are still thousands of US troops deployed across the world, not least in Afghanistan, combat deaths are a fraction of what they were in the last three presidential cycles.</p> <p>None of which is to say that this election should remain substance-free. After all, it certainly is not consequence-free. Donald Trump\u2019s election would throw the world\u2019s economy and its security framework into disarray.</p> <p>There are many factors to blame for this Seinfeld election: the capitulation of responsible Republicans to an extremist fringe; the small-bore politics of campaign strategists in a divided nation; and of course the brain of the GOP nominee himself.</p> <p>But you should also blame our stubborn inability to recognize the relative peace and prosperity that exists today. Until we turn the page on our mindset of recession and war, we are condemning ourselves to an election that is entirely Trumped up.</p>",

Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply.</p> <p>Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f266bde4b0ff53b531bbb3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:40:16.310Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament. Helena Smith reports from Athens </p> <blockquote> <p>The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. </p> <p>Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d </p> <p>That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7/0_0_4826_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors clash with police in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors clash with police in Athens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA W/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f269d8e4b0328d7eb88c9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:25:39.387Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, </strong>according to Reuters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2682ce4b0ff53b531bbbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:17:42.344Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation.

With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger growth appears to be diminishing...</p> <p>With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no significant changes to Fitch\u2019s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the US in particular it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].</p> <p>\u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton].</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations.</p> <p>Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term.</p> <p> The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. </p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. Russia\u2019s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23db1e4b05962fdf4a67d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:39:15.161Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Factories fly, but pound slides</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae#block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae\">Activity in Britain\u2019s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won\u2019t trigger a recession</a>.</strong></p> <p>Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the weak pound helps firms sell overseas.</p> <p>Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.</p> <p>Capital Economics, for example, say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit vote well.

But we live in a world where every other project takes precedence.\u201d</p> <p>A New Yorker who has lived and worked in Europe for over 20 years, Mendoza had gained attention in the city for a series of controversial projects. Earlier this year, he moved a family house from Detroit\u2019s low-income 8 Mile Road area into a permanent exhibition at the Verbeke Foundation in Belgium. In another provocative project, Mendoza restyled two abandoned Detroit homes so that light shining through bullet holes at night displayed the names of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Mendoza\u2019s work brings to mind that of the influential late US artist Mike Kelley, who in 2012 built a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/arts/design/a-model-of-mike-kelleys-ex-home-as-art-in-detroit.html?_r=0\">faithful mobile replica</a> of his Detroit childhood home. </p> <p>Mendoza said he wanted to \u201cmake the building into a work of art without violating the building as a document\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While he described himself as an \u201cimperfect candidate\u201d for the project and said \u201cit should be somebody in the black community doing this\u201d, he argued that McCauley and he had had a simple choice between the building being preserved or demolished. The final remains of the house were pulled down at a ceremony attended by the local community, including the last surviving neighbour from Parks\u2019 time.</p> <p>McCauley said she hoped young people in Europe would look at the house and let it strengthen their spirit. \u201cIf a small little lady can fight for justice until the end of her life, what is wrong with the rest of us?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Uncertainty about the size of a penalty for a decade-old misselling scandal knocked shares in Deutsche Bank lower on Monday amid renewed doubts about the ability of Germany\u2019s biggest bank to withstand the cost of any settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).</p> <p>With Germany\u2019s stock market closed for a public holiday, its shares traded lower in New York as a stock research firm warned that Deutsche might want to tap shareholders for more cash in the wake of a fine. The bank\u2019s shares had surged on Friday following reports that the settlement with the DoJ would be $5.4bn (\u00a34.2bn) rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/european-banking-shares-unsettled-by-deutsche-bank-fine-fears\">the $14bn first suggested a fortnight ago</a>.</p> <p>However, the absence of further news rattled US investors on Monday and Deutsche shares had fallen 3% by the time European markets were closing.</p> <p>Speculation about the prospect of a deal with the DoJ over the misselling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) between 2005 and 2007 has been fuelled by the plans of John Cryan, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, to attend the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting in Washington DC. This is regarded as an opportunity to thrash out a settlement ahead of the US general election next month.</p> <p>But as Cryan prepared to attend the high-profile gathering he faced criticism from Germany\u2019s minister for economic affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, for blaming speculators for the dive in the bank\u2019s shares to 30-year lows.</p> <p>\u201cI did not know if I should laugh or cry that the bank that made speculation a business model is now saying it is a victim of speculators,\u201d Gabriel said.</p> <p>He was responding to the memo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/market-fears-forces-deutsche-bank-to-issue-assurances-over-financial-health\">Cryan sent to 100,000 employees on Friday blaming \u201cforces in the market\u201d for destabilising the bank</a>. Cryan is in the process of restructuring the bank and, according to reports, is close to achieving the agreement with local unions to cut 1,000 jobs.</p> <p>Cryan has insisted that he does not need the help of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to prop up the bank, which has lost more than half its value on the stock market this year and is regarded by the IMF as the world\u2019s riskiest bank. </p> <p>A research note by brokers at Autonomous, cited by Bloomberg, said investors regarded a rights issue \u2013 a cash call on existing shareholders \u2013 as the \u201cmost likely tool management will use\u201d to bolster market sentiment. </p> <p>But the ratings agency Moody\u2019s said it regarded any deal with the DoJ as more likely to knock profits rather than undermine its financial strength. Peter Nerby, senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, calculated that Deutsche could face a settlement of between $1.1bn and $5.7bn by analysing the size of agreements the DoJ has reached with US banks.</p> <p>Even at the higher end, Nerby said: \u201cThis would require an addition to our assumed DoJ settlement reserve of \u20ac2.4 bn, which would dent 2016 profitability but would not significantly impair its capital position.\u201d</p> <p>Friday\u2019s report by the news agency AFP that Deutsche might pay $5.4bn helped bolster its shares, although the Wall Street Journal cautioned on Monday that neither the DoJ or Deutsche had yet agreed on a deal.</p> <p>Deutsche is one of a number of European banks \u2013 including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 that face settlements with the DoJ. RBS, which could face a bill of \u00a39bn from the DoJ, is in the process of tackling as many as 20 lawsuits relating to the matter. On Monday, the state of Connecticut said the 73% taxpayer-owned bank had agreed a $120m settlement over misselling RMBS.</p>",

The prosecutors began an investigation the same year into whether the governor\u2019s campaign coordinated with conservative groups on advertising during the recall without reporting the groups\u2019 contributions.</p> <p>Those groups challenged the investigation and in 2015 it was halted by conservative-leaning justices who control the Wisconsin supreme court, who ruled that the groups and the campaign coordinated on ads that did not expressly call for a candidate\u2019s election or defeat. The state court said such coordination amounted to free speech and was not subject to disclosure requirements.</p> <p>The controversy attracted renewed attention recently when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-corporate-cash-american-politics\">the Guardian</a> reported that a leading manufacturer of lead that was once used in paint was among a host of corporate leaders who donated to Wisconsin Club for Growth, a conservative group that helped Walker and Republican legislators fight the recall challenges.</p> <p>Wisconsin Club for Growth received $750,000 in 2011 and 2012 from Harold Simmons, the billionaire owner of NL Industries. The company produced lead that was used in paint before such practices were banned. </p> <p>Walker and his fundraisers also solicited money from hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen, who gave the club $1m; Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, who gave $25,000; and hedge-fund manager and Manhattan Institute for Policy Research chairman Paul Singer, who gave $250,000.</p> <p>Walker, who briefly ran for the Republican presidential nomination, has called the information contained in the leaked documents \u201cold news\u201d and insisted he has done nothing wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/03/supreme-court-opening-cases-post-scalia-era-duane-buck\">The six US supreme court cases that could set the tone for the post-Scalia era</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Walker declined immediate comment on Monday through his spokesman, Joe Fadness.

But Sand\u00e9 is still standing tall, and the comeback starts here, before a partisan audience in the cloistered surrounds of Glasgow\u2019s beautiful \u00d2ran M\u00f3r auditorium. </p> <p>It\u2019s apt that Sand\u00e9 begins a tour of intimate venues and a cautious live rebaptism in support of her forthcoming second album, Long Live the Angels, at a converted church. There is much religious symbolism at work. Wearing a shimmering silver cross necklace, she sings sparse, gospelly scene-setter Intermission with laser-guided precision. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=883yQqdOaLg\">Heaven</a> is blasted at the rafters, before Give Me Something speaks to an inward search for \u201csomething I can believe in\u201d \u2013 a song, she explains, that represents \u201cthe spiritual journey I\u2019ve been on\u201d.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6KiMJikri4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_6KiMJikri4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6KiMJikri4\">Listen to Emeli Sand\u00e9\u2019s new single Hurts</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If they gave out platinum discs for being nice, Sand\u00e9\u2019s trophy wall would still gleam. But there\u2019s a whiff of overearnestness now too, an artist whose in-between-song patter seems to mistake toe-curling sincerity for profundity (\u201cSpread your light, don\u2019t be ashamed to love,\u201d she evangelises at one point). In spite of her personal trials, there are moments in which her melancholy would seem unfairly cruel to all those struggling singers with none of her sales figures to show for their graft. <br></p> <p>Sand\u00e9 has also phased out the drum\u2019n\u2019bass breakbeats that became her calling card; most new songs instead err towards the downtempo and the dramatic. Where a guest verse by a grime star might once have slotted in nicely during Happen, there\u2019s instead a widdly, Clapton-esque guitar solo. There\u2019s a touch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/30/mary-j-blige-411-hillary-clinton-apple-music\">Mary J Blige</a> about half-rapped R&amp;B shuffler Babe. But moreover Sand\u00e9 projects a sense of moving closer to Adele\u2019s blockbusting adult-orientated Kleenex soul (Long Live the Angels was rumoured to have been delayed to avoid clashing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/adele-25-album-review\">Adele\u2019s 25</a>). </p> <p>No singer possessing Sand\u00e9\u2019s obvious gifts need work in the slipstream of another, and her solo performance at the electric piano to pin-drop silence, in particular during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OHX_PA25Ok\">Clown</a>, is showstopping evidence of that. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaAVByGaON0\">Read All About It</a> is played with devotional zeal, as her voice bends notes, vaults octaves and shakes stained-glass windows with luxurious ease. She may be back to say nothing especially refreshing about the pains of success, but Sand\u00e9 does at least have an exquisite way of saying it.<br></p> <ul> <li>At the Tunnels, Aberdeen, 3 October, and touring to Manchester and Hackney (all sold out).<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Azerbaijan\u2019s oil riches have turned its capital, Baku, into a gaudy showcase city.

It\u2019s changing.\u201d <br></p> <p>But Goyushov and others agree that the political changes feel cosmetic, merely a tactical shift aimed at securing concessions from the west. </p> <p>They say that whatever political retreat the Azerbaijani state has made is the result of the economic crisis. For the last 15 years, soaring oil prices and substantial Caspian Sea<strong> </strong>deposits had bankrolled a massive government spending spree, a windfall that helped Azerbaijan pull itself out of the catastrophe it suffered in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>The government thoroughly rearmed the military, held high-profile international events such as the Eurovision song contest and the first European Games, and invested in architectural prestige projects, <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-baku-heydar-aliyev-center-fire/24651102.html\">such as the $250m Zaha Hadid</a> building in the shape of the signature of the former president, Aliyev\u2019s father. </p> <p>But the recent oil price collapse has inflicted serious damage. Over the last year and a half the currency, the manat, has lost half its value. Baku is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/imf-starts-talks-with-azerbaijan-on-possible-financial-aid\">angling for loans and bailouts from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund</a>. <br></p> <p>According to Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter and the best-known of the political prisoners released this spring, the Azerbaijani government \u201cneeds money \u2026 and western institutions that can give it will probably do it conditionally\u201d \u2013 by demanding transparency and the rights of private groups to monitor them. </p> <p>\u201cThis is why the government is now trying to give more space to NGOs, but it\u2019s all an imitation.

His \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic plan, for instance, is as regressive as they come, setting out to slash taxes for the wealthy, bring those on corporations down from 35 to 15%, and repeal the estate tax on couples with more than $10.5m to pass to their next of kin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-income-tax-returns-published\">Trump campaign faces biggest crisis yet after tax documents published</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like so many others, the tax system is already rigged in favour of Trump and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general\" title=\"\">comrades at Mar-a-Lago</a>.

First-time director Richard Tanne fleshes out just why this is the case. It is not simply their brilliance as orators. There is a sense, as much as one can get this from a screen, that they were once normal, perhaps not quite like you and I, but at least existing on a continuum that feels familiar. When you hear the names of George Osborne or Bush or indeed Donald Trump, that sense of connection just isn\u2019t there. The magic of the Obamas has been that they seem able to understand the concerns of ordinary people. They can relate and are in turn relatable.</p> <p>Tanne\u2019s film also presents us with an opportunity to think about diversity, or the lack of it, in cinema. Watching two African-American leads in a film targeted at mainstream audiences raises the question of why equal representation on the big screen is still an issue.</p> <p>Unless your cinematic diet consists strictly of Bollywood extravaganzas, one image of romantic relationships dominates. It\u2019s a pretty white heterosexual boy meeting and falling for a pretty white heterosexual girl. This archetype is what the rest of us are asked to imagine ourselves into. The romantic leads are supposed to be relatable because of a flimsy claim to universality. The truth is that love stories in the real world exist in breathtaking diversity.

  "<p>On the day I finished reading this book, two newspaper articles caught my attention. A former head of the armed forces warned that the UK could not withstand a Russian attack; on the US presidential campaign trail, more evidence emerged of Vladimir Putin\u2019s support for Donald Trump.</p> <p>Of the many accounts written about the Russian president, Mikhail Zygar\u2019s insider\u2019s guide to his court is one of the most compelling. Zygar, a prominent journalist, has clearly earned the confidence of many. He tiptoes carefully; a number of journalists and their sources who have tried to disclose details of the cash that Putin and his henchmen have squirrelled away have ended up dead or in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/where-was-vladimir-putin-when-jeremy-corbyn-needed-him\">Where was Putin when Corbyn needed him? | Stewart Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book charts not just the machinations of the various players \u2013 indeed some of the detail may be perplexing to non-Kremlinologists. It also acutely traces the evolution of Putin\u2019s mind. The former KGB operative in East Germany did, even as he clamped down on the domestic media, initially try to woo the west. After Iraq and particularly the colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, Putin felt betrayed.</p> <p>The \u201cfat decade\u201d, as the 2000s were known, was the period when Russians (or at least some of them) maxed out on conspicuous consumption. \u201cRussia was clumsily learning how to be a rich country,\u201d the author writes. It was not just the oligarchs; the civil service quadrupled in number, a ready cash cow. \u201cThere was scarcely any politics, no public life, just solid hedonism.\u201d The most common form of bribery was a family holiday abroad, worth a few thousand, in return for rubber-stamping a contract worth millions. The state officials grew wiser and developed a taste for proper luxury. \u201cWhy take hand-outs from billionaires if you can become a billionaire yourself?\u201d That is when the power nexus shifted. What mattered was access to the top, and increasingly that meant one man only.</p> <p>In foreign policy, Putin took a binary approach to friend and foe. George W Bush (at first) was the tough guy who knew how to buy elections; Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was the dependable friend who sought \u2013 and received \u2013 a big job in Russian business. The favourite, naturally, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a>. The two families were extremely close. \u201cPutin found it so much easier to deal with European cynics,\u201d Zygar notes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Putin never let Medvedev forget his betrayal. When he sought re-election, Putin sent out the order to destroy him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for the present pack, he loathes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barackobama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> (and the feeling is mutual); he sees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> as the ringleader for a tougher European response to Russia. Hence the constant support Russia gives to Trump and France\u2019s far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, and the delight registered over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>. Russia will use every possible means to shake the status quo and undermine Europe. One of the many amusing anecdotes was how Putin would bring his huge black Labrador to meetings with Merkel; she is frightened stiff of dogs.</p> <p>Few of the cardinals around the president emerge with credit. The most pitiable role is ascribed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dmitry-medvedev\" title=\"\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, the man on whom the west briefly pinned some hopes. Plucked from nowhere by Putin (just as Putin was by Boris Yeltsin), his job was to keep the presidential seat warm. Putin needed to step down after two terms, but assumed that as prime minister he&#xa0;would continue to run the show.</p> <p>For a year or two his protege struck out; he not only brought in his own people, he tried (a little) to introduce some constitutional order into the criminal state and he sought a rapprochement of sorts with the west. Obama\u2019s team privately mocked Medvedev and his obsession with western gadgets. They and the Europeans were pleasantly surprised when the Russians did not object to the bombing of Libya. Putin, however, was furious and would never let Medvedev forget his betrayal. When the president briefly contemplated running for re-election, Putin sent out the order to destroy him. Parliament, security services, media and the business community did the rest.</p> <p>By 2012, firmly ensconced in his third term as president, Putin controlled everything and everyone. Within a couple of years of his new tenure, he had seen off the liberal protest movement, annexed Crimea and occupied eastern Ukraine. He had won back some global authority with his clever scheming in Syria.</p> <p>Such was the power he wielded that during his strange (and still unexplained) two long absences from the Kremlin, nobody knew what to do. Western sanctions hit his circle hard, but nobody dared argue with him, \u201cbecause they knew that he was the source and guarantor of their wealth. Putin\u2019s good favour was what gave them legitimacy\u201d. He had by this point become obsessed with victimhood \u2013 Russia\u2019s diplomatic and spiritual comfort blanket.</p> <p>Yet, while emphasising the court\u2019s dependency on Putin, Zygar\u2019s conclusion is more nuanced. Putin became what he is because those around him saw it as the simplest path for their own enrichment and job security. \u201cIn trying to divine the intentions of their leader, his associates effectively materialised their own wishes.\u201d In other words, Putin is more of a phenomenon than a leader.</p> <p>The perennial neurosis about slavophilia versus westernism is therefore a false choice. Russia, the author suggests, seeks solace and confidence in definition against others. \u201cEach of us invented our own Putin.

The Nobel committee was reportedly considering a peace prize for Colombia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/colombia-referendum-rejects-peace-deal-with-farc\">Colombia referendum rejects peace deal with Farc guerrillas</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But when put to a popular vote, Colombians on Sunday said no, even if by a razor thin margin. Only 37% of eligible voters cast a ballot. Of those who did 50.2% voted against the peace deal, to the yes vote\u2019s 49.7%.</p> <p>Like the EU referendum in Britain, it was a risk that Santos was not obliged to take: a yes/no vote over a complicated deal which had strong international support but tapped into and stirred a visceral resentment among many ordinary voters against the Farc. The difference is that this vote aimed to stop a war. </p> <p>The result stunned the government, the Farc, analysts and even some no supporters. \u201cThis is a reality check,\u201d said Kristian Herbolzheimer , a conflict resolution expert with Conciliation Resources, a UK-based peace consultancy. </p> <p>Seeking to assuage fears of a return to war, both government and Farc quickly said that despite the setback they would insist on peace. Santos said a bilateral ceasefire in effect for just over a month would continue while the Farc said they would use their words as their weapons. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/27/farc-guerrillas-last-days-of-blood-in-colombia-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4eemq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2412152\"            data-video-name=\"Farc\u200b guerrillas\u200b: last days of blood\u200b in Colombia \u2013 video\u200b\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/23/1448294269948/KP_600681_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5653378fe4b0fb5ee39cb9cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/23/1448294269948/KP_600681_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/12/02/151123FarcGuerillas3_KP-26156444_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/12/02/151123FarcGuerillas3_KP-26156444_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/12/02/151123FarcGuerillas3_KP-26156444_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10983005&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/12/02/151123FarcGuerillas3_KP-26156444.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/27/farc-guerrillas-last-days-of-blood-in-colombia-video\">Farc guerrillas: last days of blood in Colombia \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Herbolzheimer says that the peace process will now continue under new parameters. \u201cIt won\u2019t just be a dialogue between the government and Farc anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have to look for creative solutions that could turn them into multi-party talks.\u201d </p> <p>Santos has called for a dialogue with all political factions, including the no campaign led by his fiercest critic, former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe. Although Santos was Uribe\u2019s defence minister the two have become bitter enemies after Santos, following his election as president, did not continue Uribe\u2019s hardline policies against the Farc, instead sitting down to negotiations with the rebels. </p> <p>The deal they came up with included provisions for the Farc to sever their ties to the drug trade, lay down their weapons and transition into a political movement. While rank and file fighters would have been granted amnesty, leaders would face a special tribunal where, if they confessed, they would have been sentenced to punishments stopping short of imprisonment. </p> <p>Uribe said that the deal reached with the Farc granted impunity to leaders responsible for serious crimes, rewarded criminals by allowing them to participate in politics and eroded Colombia\u2019s constitution and institutions. </p> <p>But whether a new deal can be made is unclear. \u201cThe burden now will be on Uribe to prove that he can come up with a better plan,\u201d Herbolzheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say what is possible and what is not.\u201d </p> <p>Analyst H\u00e9ctor Riveros said a direct meeting between Uribe and Farc leader Timochenko may happen soon, although Uribe rejected a Farc invitation in May to talks in Havana. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/why-colombians-voted-against-peace-farc-president-santos-better-deal\">Why Colombians voted against peace with the Farc | Isabel Hilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They do have one interest in common though. Both the guerrillas and Uribe have called for a constituent assembly to rewrite the 1991 constitution.

Even before the plebiscite, renegade members of one rebel unit had said they would not join the peace deal. </p> <p>\u201cNow the Farc are completely vulnerable and open to profound divisions,\u201d Giraldo said. \u201cThey are going to be afraid that this could all fall apart at any moment.\u201d </p> <p>Despite the outcome, Herbolzheimer said he doesn\u2019t think it was a mistake to put the deal to a popular vote. \u201cIt they hadn\u2019t had the plebiscite those opposed would have, for the rest of history, blamed Santos for everything that might have gone wrong.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile analyst Fernando Cepeda said the unexpected situation Colombia finds itself in may prove advantageous.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that this may be a great opportunity to build a peace with a national consensus,\u201d he said. <br></p>",
