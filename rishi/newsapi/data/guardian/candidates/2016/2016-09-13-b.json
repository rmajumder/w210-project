  "<p>On 15 September 2011 David Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/15/cameron-sarkozy-libya-leader-tripoli\">flew into a newly liberated Tripoli</a> with the then president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, to be mobbed by rebels grateful for Nato airstrikes that had helped them secure victory over Muammar Gaddafi.</p> <p>Beaming with delight in the sunshine, Cameron declared: \u201cYour friends in Britain and France will stand with you as you build your country and build your democracy for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Back then, optimism was in the air. In rebel camps, coffee bars, hotels already jammed with foreign businesspeople \u2013 even amid the shattered concrete ruins of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/27/best-of-the-bunkers-gaddafi-hitler-saddam\">Gaddafi\u2019s giant Bab al-Azizia compound</a> \u2013 the talk was of progress. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention\">MPs deliver damning verdict on David Cameron's Libya intervention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back-of-the-envelope calculations showed Libya would undoubtably have the brightest future of any of the emerging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/15/arab-spring-badly-wrong-five-years-on-people-power\">Arab Spring states</a>. It had Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves and only 6 million souls to share it. Democracy was on the way. What could go wrong?</p> <p>As it turned out, everything. </p> <p>Libya\u2019s politics soon polarised into a battle dominated by the two most organised factions \u2013 Islamists on one side, and former regime figures on the other. But that polarisation comes with complicated cross-currents. The tribe is the basic political unit in Libya, creating an ever-changing tapestry of alliances and feuds.</p> <p>Libyans have a saying: \u201cIn Libya it is region against region; in the regions, tribe against tribe; in the tribes, family against family.\u201d The five years following the revolution gave grim confirmation to that proverb.</p> <p>Libyans voted in massive numbers for the first transitional government, the general national congress (GNC). But hopes that this government could muddle through were shattered in September 2012 when jihadi gunmen over-ran the US consulate in Benghazi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\">murdering the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three others</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5add717fec3675bd77b51b7742a7d9b5d6f5333\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5add717fec3675bd77b51b7742a7d9b5d6f5333/0_121_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gutted US consulate in Benghazi after the attack in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gutted US consulate in Benghazi after the attack in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ibrahim Alaguri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Terrorism, it became clear, was a post-revolution fact of life. In Tripoli, chaos reigned in parliament as the revolutionary dream rapidly turned into a nightmare. Powerful militias refused to disarm, instead establishing themselves as political players in their own right.</p> <p>And Libyan politics remained trapped in the climate of suspicion and mistrust seeded by Gaddafi, who had kept power through more than four decades by setting tribe against tribe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/libyas-democration-dream-near-collapse-return-war\">With Libya's return to war, democratic dream is all but ruined</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2014 the GNC fractured and, at the urging of Britain and other western states, Libyans voted for a new parliament \u2013 the house of representatives \u2013 and a new start. But anger and hostility dominated the election buildup.</p> <p>Shortly before those elections, one diplomat complained that paranoia was now the order of the day among the factions. \u201cThey are all so terrified of each other,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The elections saw a sharp defeat for the Islamist-Misratan coalition, which then formed the Libya Dawn militia alliance and captured Tripoli. The rest of the new parliament, as divided among themselves as they were opposed to Libya Dawn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/libya-dawn-civil-war-tripoli-tobruk\">decamped to Tobruk</a>, triggering the current civil war.</p> <p>Britain has played a key role in Libya ever since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/25/libya.politics\">Tony Blair\u2019s 2004 meeting in the desert</a> to welcome Gaddafi back into the international community. </p> <p>British politicians and businesspeople, including Blair, took a leading role in helping Gaddafi invest his oil wealth.

I don\u2019t think they will,\u201d Pyne told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Asked whether the opposition would support a colours ban, a spokeswoman said: \u201cThe LNP is currently examining the 455-page bill. We will not support any weakening of existing laws.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/08/queensland-bikie-victims-have-mixed-feelings-about-gang-crackdown\">Queensland bikie victims have mixed feelings about gang crackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pyne welcomed moves to stop the refusal of trade licences \u2013 including in the tattoo industry \u2013 to people without criminal convictions because they were members of bikie gangs.</p> <p>This could open up the return to tattooing of bikies like Mick Kosenko, a Rebels president and renowned tattooist who has been forced to shut his business and find work in the Northern Territory.</p> <p>However, bikie clubhouses closed under the former Newman government, many of them on properties owned by clubs, would remain closed. But bikies could open clubhouses in new places and it would no longer be an offence for them to be there. The penalty for bikies recruiting new members would be lifted to up to five years jail, but this would only apply to those subject to organised crime control orders.</p> <p>The government would phase in its new regime over two years, which leaves the status of existing prosecutions against bikies under Vlad or for gathering in public \u2013 such as the \u201cYandina Five\u201d case \u2013 uncertain.</p> <p>The attorney-general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, told parliament that the new regime \u201cheralds a return to traditional criminal law approaches and well-proven methods of crime detection, investigation and prosecution\u201d.</p> <p>D\u2019Ath said its initiatives were \u201cnot limited to outlaw motorcycle gangs because \u2026 serious criminal activity and organised crime extends far beyond those gangs\u201d.</p> <p>However, the blanket ban on \u201ccolours\u201d followed an acceptance by the Wilson taskforce \u201cthat members of the public have the right to enjoy themselves in licensed premises free from any fear or intimidation\u201d caused by bikies in colours.</p> <p>\u201cThe government considers that the same should apply to public places generally,\u201d D\u2019Ath said.</p> <p>\u201cThe wearing of colours is tightly controlled by [outlaw motorcycle clubs]. They make a deliberate statement of membership and are designed to create a climate of fear and intimidation among members of the general community with an implicit threat of violence in the event of any confrontation with the wearer. </p> <p>\u201cThis can facilitate criminal activity by members of OMCGs because of a reluctance of the public to report crime committed by such members. </p> <p>\u201cThe Queensland police service has advised of several incidents where witnesses have been reluctant to come forward due to the fear and intimidation caused by the wearing of colours.\u201d</p> <p>The consorting offence, which would penalise anyone who met twice or more with convicted criminals who received jail sentences of five years or more, would apply only to people aged over 18 years.</p> <p>Ther would be \u201ca specific defence that allows for participation in civic life\u201d such as sporting clubs, D\u2019Ath said.</p> <p>The maximum penalty for drugs trafficking \u2013 including cannabis \u2013 would be lifted to 25 years, but with judges regaining sentencing discretion as mandatory terms of 80% of head sentence scrapped. </p> <p>In practice, the courts have rarely given the state\u2019s largest drug traffickers more than 14 years. </p> <p>In a response to the growth of \u201cboiler room\u201d or organised investment fraud, particularly on the Gold Coast, a new circumstance of aggravation for fraud of more than $100,000 would carry a maximum of 20 years.</p> <p>New offences targeting administrators of websites carrying child pornography would bring up to 14 years jail, while those who involved children in making exploitation material would have their maximum sentence lifted from 14 years to 20 years.</p> <p>D\u2019Ath said the regime was \u201c built to withstand all stages of the criminal justice system and, ultimately, is designed to secure actual convictions of serious and organised criminals\u201d.</p> <p>Tim Nicholls, leader of the LNP opposition, said the proposed laws \u201cwatered down\u201d LNP gang laws that other states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/02/anti-bikie-laws-are-getting-public-used-to-loss-of-civil-liberties-academic-warns\">South Australia</a> had \u201calready copied ... in whole or in part\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf Annastacia Palaszczuk is so against them, why is she taking two years to wind them back?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull is marking his first year as prime minister. We take a look back at the major moments of the past 12 months.</p> <h2><strong>Advocacy: not slogans. Catharsis of the leadership change</strong></h2> <p>On September 14 2015, Malcolm Turnbull strode into a parliamentary courtyard and declared he was moving against Tony Abbott. The Coalition had been behind Labor in 30 consecutive Newspolls, a fact Turnbull noted in his rationale for the leadership change.</p> <p>His pitch was simple. Abbott had proved himself incapable of providing economic leadership. \u201cIt is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975/0_0_4900_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there was a promise of grown-up government. \u201cWe need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people\u2019s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\u201d</p> <p>The effect was immediate. Turnbull\u2019s oft-repeated optimistic declaration that there had never been a more exciting time saw the Coalition recover in the polls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/globetrotting-turnbull-stretches-his-wings-but-will-the-diehards-clip-them\">Turnbull changed the national tone instantly on issues like national security</a>, moved quickly to produce a science and innovation package as well as reopening a tax reform debate that had stalled under Abbott and Joe Hockey.<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018If something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>One month after taking the leadership, Turnbull did his first round of sit-down media interviews. He was keen to project a sense of pragmatism and compromise, to draw a contrast with the unrelenting conflict atmosphere promulgated by his predecessor. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/23/the-malcolm-turnbull-interview-if-something-isnt-working-chuck-it-out\">Turnbull said during a conversation with Guardian Australia</a> on 23 October. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of people saying, it\u2019s a backdown, or a backflip. An agile government is prepared to abandon policies that don\u2019t work.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2230278f7538802b4bab5093abf2321faabccc39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2230278f7538802b4bab5093abf2321faabccc39/362_810_4410_2646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull in his Parliament House office on 23 October 2015, during an interview with Guardian Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull in his Parliament House office on 23 October 2015, during an interview with Guardian Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull was flagging that he would have a high tolerance for floating and then killing various reform proposals \u2013 a tendency which was, in some respects, a welcome change from the highly controlled, scripted modus operandi of most prime ministers \u2013 but a tendency that would get him into political trouble as the tax reform debate began to gather pace early in 2016.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer. Fairer is what is it all about</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull in October 2015</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turnbull during his opening gambit also acknowledged that the political conversation around budget repair needed to address equity \u2013 again an explicit point of contrast with the 2014 budget, which was a political disaster for Abbott. \u201cWe should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cFairer is what is it all about. Fairness has got to be the key priority.\u201d He gave his first signal about where the government would ultimately land with the controversial superannuation reforms it would unveil in the May 2016 budget. He suggested tax concessions for the wealthy had to be pared back as well as government spending programs primarily benefiting the lower paid.</p> <h2><strong>The first summit season</strong></h2> <p>Two months after the leadership change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/20/presidents-planes-and-paris-inside-the-whirlwind-of-malcolm-turnbulls-first-world-tour\">Malcolm embarked on his first summit season</a>. His first stop was Jakarta \u2013 an investment in improving the bilateral relationship with president Joko Widodo. The relationship with Jakarta had been battered and bruised over asylum boat turnbacks and also the revelation that Australia\u2019s spy agencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/australia-tried-to-monitor-indonesian-presidents-phone\">had attempted to listen-in on the calls</a> of the previous Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and his inner circle. Much was made of the attempted rapprochement and rebalancing in the relationship early in the new Turnbull term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a3de32d86021dab7efa9e2ab8cb564917123826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a3de32d86021dab7efa9e2ab8cb564917123826/0_93_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the US president, Barack Obama, after their bilateral meeting alongside the Apec summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the US president, Barack Obama, after their bilateral meeting alongside the Apec summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull went on to Berlin and was in the German capital when the Paris terror attacks unfolded on November 14. He flew on to Turkey for the G20 gathering, which was dominated by the worsening security situation in Syria. Turnbull met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at the Antalya gathering \u2013 the first substantial contact between Canberra and Moscow since Tony Abbott had famously threatened to \u201cshirtfront\u201d the Russian president. Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/apec-summit-malcolm-turnbull-says-syria-solution-hinges-on-power-sharing\">noted a political solution in Syria would require the inclusion of Sunni groups</a> that had felt disenfranchised by the Assad regime and had consequently been left vulnerable to overtures from Islamic State. In Turkey he met the leaders of Japan, Singapore, the EU, India and China.</p> <p>Turnbull then winged his way to Manila and the Apec summit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/17/malcolm-turnbull-and-barack-obama-hold-first-meeting-and-promise-to-ramp-up-fight-against-isis\">where he had his first substantial bilateral with the US president, Barack Obama</a>. Obama invited Turnbull to visit Washington and courted Australia\u2019s support in the hotly disputed region of the South China Sea, where Australia had resolved to walk a middle course diplomatically, carefully balancing the relationship between most important strategic ally and largest trading partner.</p> <h2><strong>Early concessions to conservative enemies</strong></h2> <p> Turnbull lost the leadership of the Liberal party in 2009 for two reasons \u2013 he was seen by colleagues as dragging the Coalition in too progressive a direction and his leadership style was regarded as high-handed.</p> <p>Turnbull entered the leadership in 2015 determined to be more consultative and he vowed to restore good cabinet processes, which was partly an explicit apologia about his own mistakes in the past and a more contemporary acknowledgement that one of the things that had undone Abbott as prime minister was a \u201ccommand and control\u201d leadership style out of the prime minister\u2019s office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7/0_108_5154_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull with the education minister, Simon Birmingham.

They offered a number of concessions after a brief backbench storm over the Safe Schools anti-bullying program.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early in the piece Turnbull made it clear he would keep the plebiscite as a means of resolving whether to legalise same-sex marriage, even though he was a supporter of a parliamentary vote. He also made it clear that there would be no change to the Coalition\u2019s climate change policy before a planned review in 2017, despite broad criticism about the effectiveness of the Direct Action scheme.</p> <p>After a brief backbench storm over the Safe Schools anti-bullying program in March, Turnbull and fellow moderate, the education minister Simon Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/18/turnbull-government-unveils-dramatic-changes-to-safe-schools-program\">offered up a number of concessions</a>, such as requiring parental consent for student participation and requiring the agreement of parental bodies to decide whether, and how, a school will participate in the program.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and they corroded his personal standing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the chief critics of the program, the LNP backbencher George Christensen, later declared victory. \u201cIt\u2019s all going,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cBoys in girls\u2019 school uniforms, girls and boys using the same toilets, classroom role plays where kids imagine they have no genitalia or they\u2019re gay ... I doubt the Safe Schools Coalition \u2013 who came up with with the weird and wonderful elements of this, attempting to instil queer theory, sexual liberation and Marxism into classrooms \u2013 will accept this. And if they don\u2019t, the funding will be cut.\u201d</p> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and, progressively, they corroded his personal standing with voters. Voters had welcomed the leadership change, believing that Turnbull would be less ideological than his predecessor, would move the Coalition back to the political centre and was a politician prepared to sacrifice ambition for principle.</p> <h2><strong>Tax reform debate: the brief life of a GST hike, and competitive federalism</strong></h2> <p>Reopening the government\u2019s stalled tax reform debate was an early marker that the prime minister intended to prosecute a broad-ranging economic policy discussion. A possible rise in the GST had been, as Turnbull liked to say, \u201ckicked off into the long grass\u201d under Abbott. The new prime minister elected to put the GST back on the political agenda.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/24/gst-debate-scott-morrison-backs-need-for-option-to-raise-tax-as-part-of-reforms\">opened the political new year in 2016 by softening Australians up for an increase in the GST,</a> arguing that reform needed to be on the table if voters want personal income tax relief and a cut to corporate tax to boost economic growth. Two state premiers, Mike Baird in New South Wales, and Jay Weatherill, the Labor man in South Australia, were resolved to give Turnbull political cover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414/0_87_2758_1655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Labor had spent the summer working up a marginal seats campaign for the election year predicated around opposing the GST and that rattled the government backbench. While Morrison continued to roll forward, Turnbull began to roll back. It was the first sign that the relationship between prime minister and treasurer wasn\u2019t entirely harmonious.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/turnbull-rules-out-gst-change-election-policy/7172294\">A GST increase was dumped formally in February.</a> \u201cAfter you take into account all of the compensation that you would need to ensure the change was equitable, it simply is not justified in economic terms,\u201d the prime minister told reporters.</p> <p>A second phase of tax reform played out somewhat chaotically in the lead-up to a Council of Australian Governments meeting in late March 2016. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/29/states-offered-5bn-hospitals-funding-income-tax-raising-powers\">Turnbull floated the idea that state governments would be able to levy a portion of income tax</a> and service delivery would be devolved back to the states. The premiers shot the concept down in flames. Turnbull put the defeat more delicately. \u201cThere was not a consensus among the states and territories to support further consideration of the proposal that would enable states to levy income tax on their own behalf,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>A budget, Senate reform and a sprint to a double dissolution</strong></h2> <p>Having turned into an election year, and with political momentum clearly on the wane, Turnbull set about putting together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/senate-voting-reform-stirs-up-hornets-nest-between-likely-winners-and-losers\">reforms to the Senate voting system</a> that were designed to reduce the chances of micro-party candidates being elected on small percentages of the vote. This change reflected the government\u2019s frustration with a Senate crossbench that had worked to thwart many of the government\u2019s proposals for cutting expenditure since 2013.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dcbf87a1a0e66140ea8dd52412db92755cf8482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcbf87a1a0e66140ea8dd52412db92755cf8482/0_0_3052_2069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull outside Parliament House in Canberra the day after Morrison delivered the federal budget\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull outside Parliament House in Canberra the day after Morrison delivered the federal budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Mooy/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reform was widely seen as a springboard to a double-dissolution election that the government would call as a consequence of being unable to pass two pieces of industrial relations legislation: restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the registered organisations bill.</p> <p>But the other springboard for the election was to be <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/\">the budget of 2016</a>, which was handed down in the week Turnbull called the eight-week winter election. The budget was styled not merely as a budget but pitched rather more grandly as an \u201ceconomic plan\u201d for the nation, where cuts to business taxes would generate more economic growth and jobs (although the fine print on the tax cut made it clear the growth dividend was small and would take many years to arrive). Somewhat bravely for an election budget, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/budget-2016-jobs-and-growth-pitch-costs-wealthy-retirees-smokers-and-multinationals\">no goodies for people on average incomes</a> between $37,000 and $80,000.</p> <h2><strong>The winter of Malcolm\u2019s discontent</strong></h2> <p>By the conclusion of budget week, Malcolm Turnbull resolved Australians would go to the polls for a double-dissolution election on 2 July. Looking over the heads of colleagues to the voters, Turnbull told people watching on Mother\u2019s Day he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/17/election-2016-malcolm-turnbull-liberal-party-coalition-profile\">seeking a personal mandate</a>. He was \u201cseeking the mandate of the Australian people to continue and complete [the government\u2019s] national economic plan, because that is the key to us achieving and realising the great opportunities of these exciting times\u201d. The pitch went to the crux of what Turnbull required to steady his political fortunes \u2013 an affirmation from the voters that they wanted him to be prime minister.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4nhqz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2591592\"            data-video-name=\"Malcolm Turnbull: \u2018I\u2019m confident that we can form a majority government\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC News 24\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5777e1b9e4b0c5b1280f315f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video\">Malcolm Turnbull speaks on the night of the federal election, saying he is \u2018confident that we can form a majority government\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was an unusual election campaign at a number of levels.

  "<p>This isn\u2019t something that can be said very often, but the NCAA actually got something right for a change. On Monday, the oft-maligned governing body for college sports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/ncaa-north-carolina-anti-lgbt-law-hb2-college-sports\">announced</a> that it would be moving seven events, most notably the opening round of the men\u2019s basketball tournament, out of North Carolina due to the passing of House Bill 2 earlier in the year. The NCAA\u2019s decision comes several months after the NBA made the decision to move the all-star game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/21/nba-moves-all-star-game-charlotte-hb2-law\">from Charlotte</a> to New Orleans. </p> <p>The NCAA made it immediately clear that this was not a move they were making without putting much thought into it. In a <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-relocate-championships-north-carolina-2016-17\">detailed press release</a>, the NCAA explained their decision to move all seven events scheduled to take place in North Carolina throughout the 2016-17 academic year. Most of their reasons detail the blatantly discriminatory nature of HB2, which makes it illegal for transgender individuals to use restrooms that differ from the sex on their birth certificate, invalidating local laws that would protect LGBT individuals while effectively legalizing governmental discrimination against them. All in all, it mostly reads as the NCAA taking a praiseworthy stance against LGBT discrimination.<br></p> <p>This is certainly how they\u2019re going to frame this decision, making a particular point in relating it back to their nominal role as an educational institution. NCAA president Mark Emmert, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2016/09/13/mark-emmert-ncaa-north-carolina-hb2-house-bill/90295710/?hootPostID=56f7447cebc8f9785bb9c8c4bebf6db2\">speaking with CBS This Morning</a>, said \u201cthis is an issue to an issue that\u2019s fundamental to higher ed ... Fairness and inclusion are at the heart of what the NCAA does and what universities do. For our university presidents, this was a proverbial no-brainer.\u201d</p> <p>That all sounds nice but the NCAA is, 501c3 nonprofit status notwithstanding, a business organization and, from that perspective, there was probably considerable more debate about this decision. First of all, it could end up damaging their relationship with a region that has been practically synonymous with college basketball for decades: no state has hosted <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/sports/ncaa-moves-championship-events-from-north-carolina.html?_r=0\">more tournament games</a> than North Carolina. While both Duke University and the University of North Carolina have <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/duke-unc-ads-state-support-of-ncaa-in-north-carolina-tourney-ban/\">released statements</a> supporting the NCAA\u2019s decision, they run the risk of alienating a significant percentage of customers.</p> <p>It\u2019s bigger than just North Carolina, though. The NCAA\u2019s announcement comes during a heated political climate dominated by discussions of bigotry and discrimination. Unsurprisingly, this decision has been received quite differently by those on opposite ends of the aisle. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twitter feed blandly praised the NCAA\u2019s decision:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/775683074747199488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAA\">@NCAA</a> is right to pull tournament games from North Carolina because of the anti-LGBT HB2 law.

I made sure it was not a parody account. <a href=\"https://t.co/BD8Ak8Rx0q\">pic.twitter.com/BD8Ak8Rx0q</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Carter (@_andrewcarter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_andrewcarter/status/775505479862743040\">September 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Coming at a time where half the country is absolutely outraged over a backup quarterback\u2019s choice of posture, the NCAA had to be aware that this decision would make them a target for conservative criticism. It\u2019s encouraging that this ultimately didn\u2019t dictate their decision.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t make it in a vacuum. After breaking down the numerous ways HB2 was discriminatory and inconsistent with their stated beliefs, the NCAA acknowledges that there was also a logistical aspect at play. It became increasingly difficult to keep the events where they were because \u201cfive states plus numerous cities prohibit travel to North Carolina for public employees \u2026 which could include student-athletes and campus athletic staff.\u201d In other words, the fact that these states (New York, Minnesota, Washington, Vermont, Connecticut) barred government travel to North Carolina in the wake of HB2\u2019s passing forced their hand somewhat. <br></p> <p>It also probably isn\u2019t a coincidence that they made this decision after the NBA announced that it was moving the 2017 all-star game. It\u2019s impossible to imagine the board agreeing to move multiple championships if the NBA had decided it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to relocate a single event. The NCAA also knew that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2016/04/13/135391/north-carolinas-discriminatory-h-b-2-threatens-more-than-half-billion-dollars-in-economic-activity/\">other businesses</a> had already decided to stop doing business there.<br></p> <p>Basically, every state government, business or organization that made the decision to stay out of North Carolina as long as this discriminatory law was in effect made it that much easier for the NCAA to take this rather drastic step. The hope now, at least for those who believe that applying economic pressure is the most effective way in getting HB2 rewritten or repealed altogether, is that this latest high-profile boycott will embolden others to join in.<br></p> <p>For that reason, the NCAA should be commended for taking a stance against discrimination here. Even if it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d in an ethical sense, it could still end up being a costly one for the NCAA, both in terms of the expense and hassle of actually relocating the events and in terms of the inevitable backlash to come.</p> <p> Of course, they do have plenty of experience in dealing with the latter, the only thing they will have to adjust to is being on the right side of criticism for once.<br></p>",

The suspicion of some of those supportive of Van Praag, the capable administrator who failed in a bid to challenge Blatter earlier this year and threw his weight behind the similarly doomed Prince Ali of Jordan, is that the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, may have had some influence in the decision to allow Platini to speak.</p> <p>As outlined in an excellent, lengthy summary on the <a href=\"http://twohundredpercent.net/democracy-uefa-style/\" title=\"\">Two Hundred Percent website</a>, the latter stages of the campaign have been studded by the usual wearying claims of backroom dealing.</p> <p>Ceferin, a 48-year-old lawyer who has been president of the Slovenian FA since 2011, is said to enjoy the backing of Infantino, who until he was unexpectedly pitched into the Fifa race was Uefa\u2019s secretary-general.</p> <p>The Fifa president was alleged by the Dutch newspaper De Volksrant to have sent an adviser to a meeting of northern European FAs to lobby on Ceferin\u2019s behalf before the Champions League final on 28 May. Ceferin had been invited to the meeting to discuss his plans for his prospective candidacy. Before Ceferin had even announced his campaign, the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish FAs had come out in favour of his candidacy.</p> <p>The adviser sent to the May meeting was the Norwegian FA\u2019s secretary-general Kjetil Siem, who was announced as Infantino\u2019s \u201cdirector of strategic affairs\u201d on 18 May. Fifa said Siem was still working for the Norwegian FA at the time of the meeting.</p> <p>An investigation by the Norwegian football magazine Josimar detailed allegations that Siem worked to gather votes for Ceferin and in return promised seats on Uefa\u2019s board and favourable consideration for tournament bids. Ceferin angrily called the claims \u201calmost completely not true\u201d and said it was \u201ca lie\u201d Siem had pledged Infantino\u2019s support.</p> <p>Ceferin is the favourite, with the confirmed support of at least 17 smaller nations as well as France, Germany and \u2013 perhaps crucially \u2013 Russia. In total, as many as 35 federations are believed to have declared support for Ceferin. Like Blatter, he has pursued a strategy of positioning himself as the man who will stand up for the little guys. In a one-member, one-vote election it is a sensible move. Safe in the knowledge the recent Champions League deal that favoured bigger European clubs in order to head off breakaway threats cannot be unpicked, Ceferin can now afford to say he will stand up for smaller countries in future.</p> <p>\u201cThose changes are clearly not in favour of small and mid-sized associations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process was not good. The clubs didn\u2019t know anything about it and that should be changed in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the bare bones of his CV, little is known about Ceferin. In many ways he appears similar to Infantino \u2013 a plausible, multi-lingual lawyer with a smooth manner. That is less of a compliment than it once may have appeared in light of Infantino\u2019s increasingly egocentric approach to the huge challenges at Fifa.</p> <p>Those with a glass half-full mentality may harbour hopes a new man atop European football with an avowed mission to level the playing field could be a positive force. Those who have grown cynical watching the machinations at Fifa and Uefa down the years are instead wondering who is really pulling the strings. Even they, however, take some comfort from the fact the veteran Spanish Fifa executive committee member \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar Llona was forced to withdraw owing to lack of support.</p> <p>It was Villar Llona who was investigated in connection with an alleged vote swapping deal with Qatar during the tainted 2018-22 World Cup bidding process, before trying to shut down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/13/farce-fifa-michael-garcia-erroneous-ethics-report\" title=\"\">Michael Garcia\u2019s investigation</a>. His withdrawal was one final humiliation for the old guard.</p> <p>Yet even as Uefa has remained without a leader in light of Platini\u2019s enforced absence, the machine has rolled on. The expanded Euro 2016 made a huge profit despite concerns over the new format and, following much sabre rattling, that crucial deal over the future of the Champions League has been secured. In other words, behind the politicking the popularity of modern football means the cash continues to roll in as never before.</p> <p>The English FA finds itself in a familiar bind. On the one hand it has thrown its backing behind Van Praag in the knowledge his agenda is closest to its own. On the other, it is loath to create too many waves in the knowledge that thanks to the former Manchester United chief executive David Gill it has more clout in the Fifa and Uefa corridors of power than at any time for the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cHe is someone we have come to know very well and worked closely with in recent years, particularly because of our shared commitment to securing Fifa reform,\u201d said Gill, the FA\u2019s vice-chairman and Uefa executive committee member, explaining the decision last week. \u201cAs Uefa president, Mr Van Praag would be able to provide the strong and credible leadership European football requires at a crucial moment for the global game.\u201d</p> <p>The Football Association of Ireland has thrown its backing behind Ceferin. \u201cHe has been a very progressive and extremely innovative leader in his native Slovenia and his successful candidacy would be a very positive move for European football and the administration as a whole,\u201d said the chief executive, John Delaney.</p> <p>The manifestos of the candidates, both 17 pages long and crammed full of the sort of motherhood and apple pie sentiments that will be familiar to any student of global sports politics, provide little clue as to how they would approach the role.</p> <p>Even if, as in most recent elections, the FA ends up backing the loser there is confidence its hard-won influence will not be affected. As well as Gill, the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, and the chairman, Greg Clarke, will also travel to Athens.</p> <p>The first public engagement of the new president will be at a launch in London next week for Platini\u2019s one-off, continent-wide Euro 2020 competition, the semi-finals and final of which will be at Wembley.</p> <p>For those who hoped the lurid collapse of Fifa would herald a new age, the manoeuvrings of recent months have been a depressing reminder that the more things change, the more they appear to stay the same.</p>",

In one camp are the flag-waving jersey-burners who believe that \u201cpatriotism\u201d means unconditional, unconsidered cheerleading for anything \u201cAmerican\u201d (ie, anything that enforces the white, traditionalist status quo \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat\u201d America of yore), while tarring any dissent as \u201cun-American\u201d. This version of patriotism is more a sport than a political philosophy: root for the home team, even if we\u2019re cheating.</p> <p>The rest of us believe that our country is a collective that we have a duty to shape; that patriotism is earned, not owed; that if our nation is going to demand worship and supplication from its inhabitants, it needs to fulfil its mandate to protect and care for all of them. If you love something, you want it to be better, and you work for it to be better. Patriotism doesn\u2019t preclude protest; it demands it. \u201cI love America,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-kneels-national-anthem-protest.html\">Kaepernick said</a>. \u201cI love people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. I want to help make America better.\u201d</p> <p>I love so much about America. It\u2019s my home. It\u2019s beautiful and wild, and I don\u2019t want to live anywhere else. I am proud to have roots in a place that, at least on paper (however spectacularly we may fail), holds sacred the balance of personal freedom and social equality.</p> <p>There\u2019s a particular exuberance to the people here \u2013 an audacity. At our best we are outlandish and daring and optimistic and guileless and absurd. We are fun. I love that.</p> <p>But at our worst we\u2019re murderous and proud, incurious and spiteful. We tell marginalised people to sit down (unless that slave guy\u2019s special song is playing) and wait for equality. We insist their oppression is their fault because they refuse to chase the perpetually shifting goalposts of the \u201cright\u201d way to protest \u2013 ie, in any way that never disrupts or disturbs any white people whatsoever; ie, in any way that is actually effective; ie, in any way at all. We threaten Kaepernick\u2019s career in retaliation for his dissent, as though it\u2019s reasonable to expect black people to choose between their dreams and their humanity. Our citizens <a href=\"http://komonews.com/news/local/display-hanging-near-sutherlin-causes-stir-among-i-5-motorists\">hang Hillary Clinton in effigy</a> for not knowing her place, howl for the mass deportation of Muslims, demand a wall to keep out immigrants, insist to this day that Barack Obama isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d American, and do it all without shame on stolen land.</p> <p>How could we feel pride in any of that?</p> <p>Do we want an empty, performative, coerced pride? One that honours nothing and means nothing? I don\u2019t. I\u2019m proud of my country, but it\u2019s the dissent that makes me proud \u2013 the capacity for change and the resilience to demand it. Blanket, rah-rah patriotism is just a patch over the rot. It\u2019s a way for the privileged to avoid swallowing uncomfortable truths, like a child changing the subject in hopes you\u2019ll forget about his chores.</p> <p>The fact is that Kaepernick is unequivocally correct. People of colour in America \u2013 including Kaepernick and plenty of veterans \u2013 are being underserved by a government whose paychecks they write. Declining to stand and laud that country until these outrageous, deadly imbalances are repaired \u2013 until our flag actually does represent everyone \u2013 is a perfectly reasonable response. America gets my unreserved, hand-on-heart patriotism when it earns it.</p>",

On Wednesday, the Vote to End Hunger coalition plan to deliver a petition to Lester Holt, NBC newscaster and host of the first presidential debate, urging him to push the presidential candidates to address what they will do to alleviate poverty and end hunger in the US and worldwide. Holt will be moderating the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on 26 September.</p> <p>More than 42 million Americans, including 13.1 million children, struggled with hunger in 2015, the coalition said.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The drop in poverty and increase in household income was due to the strengthening labor market and growth in wages, according to Sheldon Danziger, president of Russell Sage Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cPoverty declined so much because employment increased steadily in 2015, with the annual unemployment rate at 5.3% compared to 6.2% in 2014. In addition, 21 states and the District of Columbia increased their minimum wage rates in 2015,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In both 2014 and 2015, the number of full time workers went up \u2013 with an additional 1.2 million men and 1.6 million women finding full time work in 2014 and another 1.4 million men and one million women finding full time work in 2015. This past month, the US economy added 151,000 jobs. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation \u2013 the longest streak on record. The US Federal Reserve has previously said that the labor market is nearing full employment.</p> <p>The data released on Tuesday also showed that gender wage gap still persists \u2013 with women earning about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2015. The gender wage gap has only decreased by one cent since 2014. While this is the smallest pay gap on record, it is no reason for celebration. </p> <p>\u201cWomen of America, if you are looking for a raise, don\u2019t get your hopes up: the wage gap closed by only a penny last year,\u201d said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cWhile a small step forward is better than standing still, over a 40-year career women still stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars to the wage gap. And for many women of color, the cost of the lifetime wage gap will still exceed a million dollars. We can\u2019t afford to close this gap one penny at a time.\u201d </p> <p>Black women working full time earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by white men. Hispanic women earned only 54 cents for every dollar earned by white men.</p>",
  "<p>Sitcoms, in the UK at least, are rarely written by renowned standups \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/19/jo-brand-going-forward-preview\">Jo Brand</a> is an exception, as are self-penned star vehicles Miranda and Count Arthur Strong. Plays by comedians are thinner still on the ground. But last week I saw both a sitcom pilot by James Acaster (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07v6hnc\">We the Jury</a>) and a play by Liam Williams (<a href=\"http://www.fightinthedog.co.uk/travesty/\">Travesty</a>). I was eager to see whether those standups\u2019 unmistakeable voices are as funny, or as striking, in others\u2019 mouths.</p> <p>We the Jury is derived from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/14/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-a-mindbending-comedy-cracker\">Acaster\u2019s 2015 show Represent</a>, which ostensibly recounted his experience of jury service. I say ostensibly because Acaster is a slippery customer. His standup isn\u2019t recognisably autobiographical: his jury service routine felt like a loopy metaphor and was probably fiction. But he clearly felt it had legs, because now we have a TV half-hour on the same subject, starring Ed Easton (of sketch troupe Gein\u2019s Family Giftshop) as dorky cinema worker William, whose dream comes true when he\u2019s summoned to sit on the jury at a croupier\u2019s murder trial. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/10/diane-morgan-comedy-genius-on-playing-philomena-cunk\">Diane (Philomena Cunk) Morgan</a> and Vivienne Acheampong \u2013 seen lately in Rainbow Class on the Edinburgh fringe \u2013 co-star as fellow jurors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/09/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-gags-pleasance-courtyard\">James Acaster at Edinburgh festival review \u2013 blissful gags about modern life's minutiae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019re a fan of Acaster\u2019s standup, as I am, you can\u2019t watch We the Jury without playing back at least a few of its lines in his own fastidious Kettering tones. I can easily imagine an Acaster routine about the phrase (which crops up here) \u201cYou\u2019re a poet and you don\u2019t know it\u201d \u2013 he\u2019d get 10 good minutes out of that. As for the trial of an auctioneer that was open and shut double-quick because the witnesses were all auctioneers, and they speak really fast? Well, that crack bears its maker\u2019s mark very visibly indeed.</p> <p>The show\u2019s brand of heightened reality, too, is analogous to the not-quite-real world Acaster occupies in his standup. But it\u2019s less successful. Onstage, Acaster is totally in control of his askew reality, and of the vast importance assumed there by trivial things. In his pilot, the tone feels less certain: it\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re meant to find William this much of a berk, given that everyone else seems pretty juvenile too.</p> <p>That may come, if We the Jury ever sees the light of a series. No such possibility for Travesty, a self-contained two-hander stage play from Williams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/liam-williams-review-edinburgh-festival-2014-capitalism\">whose 2014 show Capitalism</a> so blazingly and black-comically articulated anti-capitalist impotence and generational despair. Travesty traces a relationship from genesis to death throes and beyond. It\u2019s not a comedy \u2013 and yet Williams\u2019 voice is more recognisable here than Acaster\u2019s in We the Jury. The romantic-depressive outlook is recognisably his; so too the existential cri de coeur underpinning a play about a man only briefly rescued by love from life\u2019s meaninglessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be7fdffc947f8027d4a87e399dab1fc3f44fa473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7fdffc947f8027d4a87e399dab1fc3f44fa473/0_353_5596_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travesty by Liam Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Existential cri de coeur ... Pierro Niel-Mee and Lydia Larson in Travesty by Liam Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Haigh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike in Acaster\u2019s pilot, there\u2019s a character here who feels like a proxy for Williams. OK, so Ben is played by a woman (Lydia Larson; the play is cross-cast, although it\u2019s not clear why). But he speaks like Williams; you\u2019d swear Larson has adopted some of Williams\u2019 diffident mannerisms, and at one point the character even punches a wall, recalling Williams walloping the ceiling until his fist bled in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/08/liam-williams-edinburgh-festival-review-comedy-laughing-horse-free-sisters\">2015 show Bonfire Night</a>. There are countless jaundiced-philosophical turns of phrase that sound like the authorial voice (\u201cLove shouldn\u2019t be mediated through consumption\u201d, and so on). The problem is that the second character, Anna, has far less personality. And also that, unlike in Williams\u2019 standup, there\u2019s too little countervailing humour.</p> <p>What makes Williams exciting as a comedian is the unresolved tensions between depression and still-flickering faith, between finding himself tragic and finding himself ridiculous. In a sense, his standup voice is made up of several competing voices, those waging the arguments in his head. In Travesty, only one of those voices is loudly heard, and for the want of the others, a more conventional bland of bleakness wins out.</p> <p>Watching the two \u2013 the sitcom and the play \u2013 reminded me of how difficult and delicate it is to hone a strong comic voice, and how we can\u2019t assume it\u2019s easily transferable. Acaster has spoken about the evolution of his own stage persona; he didn\u2019t emerge fully formed, as those of us who saw his early work can attest. It\u2019s just as difficult to develop the skills required of a playwright or sitcom writer \u2013 notwithstanding that Acaster and Williams\u2019 achievements as writer-performers give them a pretty good head-start. At their best, We the Jury and Travesty offer glimpses of two inimitable comic voices. In neither case is it enough to (yet) produce work anywhere near as accomplished as their standup.<br></p> <h2>Three to see</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cde2c30339d5728b58fecd1a5b28fbe36c962bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cde2c30339d5728b58fecd1a5b28fbe36c962bf/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shape-shifters \u2026 The Pajama Men.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shape-shifters \u2026 The Pajama Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Pajama Men</strong><br></p> <p>A UK tour kicks off for one of the great double-acts in world comedy: the shape-shifting, darkly comic impro-sketch originals Mark Chavez and Shenoah Allen.

  "<p>With about two months remaining until the US Presidential Elections, and much at stake for Americans and the rest of the world, the time has come to examine how the election of each candidate might affect science and scientific research. </p> <p>Although relatively little has been said directly about science and science policy, both Democratic candidate <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/POSITIONS\">Donald Trump</a> have official websites with a list of their key policy issues, and how they will be addressed.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, who has made a number of statements broadly supportive of science and scientific research, has at least seven distinct issues on her website that directly relate to science and research. Clinton cites the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and related diseases, and the allocation of 2 billion dollars annually towards research in the field. </p> <p>She has a similar plan for the study of autism and HIV/Aids, with a commitment to eradicating Aids in the US and abroad. She specifically calls for an investment in brain behavioural research as part of broad-based support for research on brain development and human behaviour. She also supports research on addiction and substance abuse, as part of an overall plan to address these problems in American society. </p> <p>In addition, there is an overall goal of enhancing technology and innovation, which goes hand-in-hand with science. Clinton has also outlined a plan to protect animals and wildlife, and ensure that national parks and protected wildlife areas are not privatised. Finally, she has cobbled together a substantial plan to deal with the threat of climate change and global warming. Her website also lists a variety of substantial issues tangential to science policy concerns, including healthcare, Medicare, paid family and medical leave, and so on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated\">The scientific impact of Brexit: it's complicated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, has a very sparse and rather amateurishly composed list of policies on his website. None of them address science in any way. </p> <p>The public is not completely in the dark with regard to Trump\u2019s opinions on some matters of science, however, because he has made or tweeted key statements that illuminate his views on these important topics. </p> <p>For example, Trump tweeted: \u201cNBC News just called it the great freeze \u2013 coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years.

His comments about spreading out vaccine doses come from the annals of superstition, rather than informed views. There is no scientific evidence in support of the notion that vaccine doses, or the times between vaccines, affect autism; indeed, years of trials, data, research, experience and statistics have brought us to the current <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunization/Pages/Immunization-Schedule.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token\">American Association of Pediatrics</a> recommendations for vaccines. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/feb/22/making-the-meningitis-b-vaccine-available-for-all-children-makes-sense\">Making the meningitis B vaccine available for all children makes sense | Jenny Rohn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s approach is not science, it is bunk.<br></p> <p>A lot has also been said about the health of each of the two candidates, with Clinton and Trump at 68 and 70 years of age, respectively. Indeed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent pneumonia diagnosis and cancellation of her schedule for the next few days highlights the mortality of aging presidential candidates. So it would be worthy to look at statements made by the vice presidential candidates. </p> <p>While Democrat Tim Kaine is largely in line with Clinton, Republican Mike Pence has made statements that may even outdo those of Trump. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/15/mike-pence-donald-trumps-vp-pick-smoking-doesnt-kill.html\">Time for a quick reality check</a>,\u201d wrote Pence. \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill. Two out of every three smokers doesn\u2019t die from a smoking-related disease.\u201d </p> <p>So according to Pence, smoking doesn\u2019t kill, but a third of the smoking population DOES die from smoking. Am I missing something? It sounds like it\u2019s definitely time for Mr Pence to do a reality check.</p> <p>This upcoming election is like no other election in US history. Far more important than mere policy is the foundation on which science is based: truth. Science is, for the most part, objective, built on facts and the most likely explanation that those facts can provide at any given time. As more facts arise, models can be modified or expanded. Or revised altogether. But any model/theory/hypothesis must always fit the facts. And while all politicians tend to embellish and bend facts to some degree, more than any candidate ever in US history, Trump has been ignoring facts and promoting falsehoods. </p> <p>Paul Krugman of the New York Times wrote a recent opinion piece called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/opinion/donald-trumps-big-liar-technique.html\">Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Liar\u2019 Technique</a>. In this article, Krugman outlines how Trump repeatedly lies about points that are demonstrably false, and when challenged, merely repeats them. As one of many examples, he notes how Trump insists that he was against the war in Iraq \u2013 and yet, the only on-record statement he made prior to the invasion was that he was for it. Or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\">Trump\u2019s assertion that he saw thousands of cheering Muslims in Jersey City after 9-11</a>. It is Krugman\u2019s hypothesis that the sheer volume of lies has saturated and overwhelmed the American public and journalists. It is almost to the point where journalists no longer challenge yesterday\u2019s lies because they are so busy dealing with today\u2019s new round of lies.</p> <p>Trump, however, is not only adept about lying; he is a master of innuendo-based conspiracy theories. He will frequently use openings such as \u201cPeople tell me that \u2026\u201d to spread false rumours and lies. He will talk about President Obama\u2019s reaction to the murderous attack at the Orlando night-club and use phrases such as \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d as if suggesting that the president was part of a conspiracy involved in the mass shooting. And then drift away and watch his surrogates promote the conspiracy.</p> <p>A candidate who has such a loose and irreverent relationship with the truth will not be good for science, whether or not he has a solid policy to support science \u2013 and Trump does not. But science serves as a microcosm for everything else. </p> <p>If a candidate refuses to accept the advice of the vast majority of the most knowledgeable experts in a scientific field, such as those who have debunked any relationship between autism and vaccines, then why would this candidate pay any heed to foreign policy experts with regard to international affairs? Or experienced generals with regard to military issues? Indeed, Trump has already stated, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-intelligence-briefings.html?_r=0\">I know more than the generals about ISIS</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most serious concern about the Trump candidacy is that it heralds a new era that some are calling \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics\">post-truth politics</a>\u201d. Once the truth has become irrelevant to the American electorate, scientists may as well pack up their microscopes and test tubes and look for other careers. However, with two months until the election, there is still time to campaign for facts, truth \u2013 and yes, science.</p>",

At the same time there has never been any public evidence that any individual came to harm as a result.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27362037c77da492e88d39e06c3f4cccaf08daa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27362037c77da492e88d39e06c3f4cccaf08daa8/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators hold placards supporting Snowden during a 2013 protest against government surveillance in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold placards supporting Snowden during a 2013 protest against government surveillance in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although US presidents have granted some surprising pardons when leaving office, the chances of Obama doing so seem remote, even though before he entered the White House he was a constitutional lawyer who often made the case for privacy and had warned about the dangers of mass surveillance.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s former attorney general Eric Holder, however, gave an unexpected boost to the campaign for a pardon in May when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/30/eric-holder-edward-snowden-nsa-leak-public-service\">said Snowden had performed a public service</a>. </p> <p>The campaign could receive a further lift from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/snowden\">Oliver Stone\u2019s film, Snowden</a>, scheduled for release in the US on Friday.

On Monday he said that at that time he expected a \u201cdark end\u201d in which he was either killed or jailed in the US.</p> <p>More than three years on, he appears cheerful and relaxed. He has avoided the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/30/bradley-manning-wikileaks-judge-verdict\">fate of fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning</a>, who is in solitary confinement in the US. Snowden is free to communicate with supporters and chats online late into the night. </p> <p>His 2.3 million followers on Twitter give him a huge platform to express his views. He works on tools to try to help journalists. He is not restricted to Moscow and has travelled around Russia, and his family in the US have been to visit him.</p> <p>But Snowden still wants to return to the US and seems confident, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that it will happen. \u201cIn the fullness of time, I think I will end up back home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the officials, who felt like they had to protect the programmes, their positions, their careers, have left government and we start looking at things from a more historical perspective, it will be pretty clear that this war on whistleblowers does not serve the interests of the United States; rather it harms them.\u201d</p> <p>Snowden attracts lots of conspiracy theories. Early on, he was accused of being a spy for China and then a Russian spy. In August a cryptic tweet followed by an unusual absence prompted speculation that he was dead. He said he had simply gone on holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZgIkapmcOC\">pic.twitter.com/ZgIkapmcOC</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There had also been rumours that his partner, Lindsay Mills, had left him, which would have been embarrassing as their romance occupies a large part of the Stone film. Snowden said \u201cshe is with me and we are very happy\u201d.</p> <p>His revelations resulted in a global debate and modest legislative changes. More significant, perhaps, is that surveillance and the impact of technological change has seeped into popular culture, in films such as the latest Jason Bourne and television series, such as the Good Wife.</p> <p>Snowden also welcomed \u201ca renaissance of scepticism\u201d on the part of at least some journalists when confronted by anonymous briefings by officials not backed by evidence.<br></p> <p>He warned three years ago of the danger that one day there might be a president who abused the system. The warning failed to gain much traction, given that Obama\u2019s presidency seemed relatively benign. But it resonates more today, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s response to <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298664/trump-dnc-hacking-power\">the Russian hacking of the Democratic party</a>: that he wished he had the power to hack into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</p> <p>If Obama, as seems likely, declines to pardon Snowden, his chances under either Clinton or Trump would seem to be even slimmer. He described the 2016 presidential race as unprecedented \u201cin terms of the sort of authoritarian policies that are being put forward\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, many candidates in the political mainstream today, even pundits and commentators who aren\u2019t running for office, believe we have to be able to do anything, no matter what, as long as there is some benefit to be had in doing so. But that is the logic of a police state.\u201d</p> <p>He is even less impressed by the British prime minister, referring to Theresa May as a \u201ca sort of Darth Vader in the United Kingdom\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/theresa-may-review-snoopers-charter-surveillance-powers-concession\">whose surveillance bill</a> is \u201can egregious violation of human rights, that goes far further than any law proposed in the western world\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f843a406cd94dcc82a8f788f4eec6758e743458d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f843a406cd94dcc82a8f788f4eec6758e743458d/0_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Edward Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snowden has criticised May\u2019s surveillance bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snowden was initially berated by opponents for failing to criticise the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but he has become increasingly vocal. It is a potentially risky move, given his application for an extension of asylum is up for renewal next year, so why do it?</p> <p>\u201cWell, it would not be the first time I have taken a risk for something I believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a complex situation. Russia is not my area of focus. It is not my area of expertise. I don\u2019t speak Russian in a fluent manner that I could really participate in and influence policy. But when something happens that I believe is clearly a violation of the right thing, I believe we should stand up and say something about it.</p> <p>\u201cMy priority always has to be my own country rather than Russia. I would like to help reform the human rights situation in Russia but I will never be well placed to do so relative to actual Russian activists themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Might he end up as part of a US-Russian prisoner exchange, with Putin possibly more amenable to the idea if Trump was in power? \u201cThere has always been the possibility that any government could say, \u2018Well, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of human rights, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of law, it will be beneficial to use this individual as a bargaining chip\u2019. This is not exclusive to me. This happens to activists around the world every day.\u201d</p> <p>He said he saw the Stone film as a mechanism for getting people to talk about surveillance, though he felt uncomfortable with other people telling his story.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ty9f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2495625\"            data-video-name=\"Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Open Road Films\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5721dac1e4b02c55b6401323\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/28/160428snowden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11443130&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/28/160428snowden_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/28/160428snowden_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/28/160428snowden.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\">Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Snowden has toyed with writing his memoirs but has not made much progress.

Yes, there are chandeliers, gold rails and gold-rimmed glass tables evocative of the blingy hotels that Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi used to build. There is The Spa by Ivanka Trump. But the gaudy flamboyance of Las Vegas or Palm Beach has been dialled down to cream and grey walls \u2013 as befits understated Washington.</p> <p>The hotel opened its doors at 2pm on Monday after a two-year, $200m renovation. There was little fanfare: Trump and his family will attend a predictably grand opening ceremony next month. While the tycoon himself stayed away, there was a typical menu of divisiveness and surrealism.</p> <p>By 4.30pm, some 38 protesters had lined up outside the hotel to form a human wall in response to Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the Mexican border. They made speeches through a megaphone, chanted \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!\u201d and hoisted placards and banners that said, \u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall against racism &amp; bigotry\u201d and \u201cImmigrants &amp; Muslims are welcome here \u2013 Trump Hotel is NOT!\u201d</p> <p>In a district where Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/marco-rubio-trounces-donald-trump-in-washington-dc-presidential-primary\">badly beaten by Marco Rubio</a> and John Kasich in the Republican primary, some passing motorists tooted their horns in support of the protesters.

Johnny Rice, 49, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the candidate\u2019s face, blew a shofar (ram\u2019s horn). A woman in a cowboy hat positioned herself in front of the protesters and held box lids scrawled with the words \u201cI\u2019m a deplorable\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">referencing a recent Clinton gaffe</a>) and \u201cThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town and his name is Donald Trump.\u201d Two burly security guards told her to leave.</p> <p>Meanwhile, most bizarrely, a man in a full-length duck suit with bright orange hair prowled the scene. So did a man in tuxedo, bow tie and pig mask. Watching it all was a statue of founding father Benjamin Franklin, who now finds himself in permanent close proximity to the Trump brand.</p> <p>As this hot and anguished street scene played out against a backdrop of sawing and sandpapering, the inside of the hotel provided an air-conditioned refuge for the 1%. Liveried staff, racially diverse, glided under industrial steel girders and the dramatically high glass roof with canap\u00e9s and sparkling Trump wine. Of the hotel management, an affable Frenchman and urbane Irishman chatted to journalists. A steady trickle of guests arrived at check-in with luggage but were less willing to be interviewed about their first impressions.</p> <p>The hotel is nine stories tall and has 263 rooms, including 35 suites. Rooms start at an average of $895 a night. For the presidential inauguration in January of either Trump or Hillary Clinton, the biggest suite will cost $12,000 per night and must be booked for a minimum of five nights. Whether the presidential ballroom gets used that night probably depends on the outcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abd8b557a505765574becbd2974df3f8dd86670c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd8b557a505765574becbd2974df3f8dd86670c/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Staff members meet in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel just after it opened.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff members meet in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel just after it opened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, helped negotiate a 60-year lease with the US government and oversaw the building\u2019s revamp and design.

  "<p>The offices of feng shui masters Pun-Yin and her father Tin-Sun inhabit a dimly lit basement space, replete with lush plants and gurgling fountains, deep in New York City\u2019s Chinatown. </p> <p>Inside, framed photos decorate the walls, including one taken some 20 years ago.

And yet, according to Pun-Yin, for decades, incorporating those principles into his real estate holdings was one of Trump\u2019s foremost priorities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Trump's respected clients, a building lacking in feng shui could be a dealbreaker</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But his reasons were hardly spiritual. Beginning in 1995, Trump hired Pun-Yin and her father to assess the energy of his Int\u2019l Hotel &amp; Tower development project and make the necessary changes to its design, in a calculated move to tap into the burgeoning market of international investors in US real estate from China and Hong Kong. For such respected clients, a building lacking in feng shui could be a dealbreaker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fbe1b6b791cd5eeed51fdc746072211f31c745d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fbe1b6b791cd5eeed51fdc746072211f31c745d/0_0_1950_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pun Yin and Donald Trump in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pun-Yin and Donald Trump in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha von Oldershausen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it seems the famously bullheaded real estate developer met his match in Pun-Yin. An apprentice to her father for 15 years, Pun-Yin made a name for herself when she took on the project, for which Trump invested $230m in revamping the building. </p> <p>\u201cUntil I did this project and took off, it was not a female industry at all,\u201d Pun-Yin said, referring to the cult of mostly male feng shui masters. \u201cAs a woman, you have to be 50 to 60 years old. So I broke rank not only as a female but also as a young female.\u201d</p> <p>When Pun-Yin saw the Trump Int\u2019l Hotel &amp; Tower, the energy was so bad, she insisted that it had to be her way or the highway. She said, \u201cBy the time we went there and saw it, we said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do this project with you unless you follow us completely.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/may/27/digital-feng-shui\">Feng shui comes back into fashion to declutter the digital world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not one to miss out on a potential financial opportunity, Trump complied. \u201cIt\u2019s just another element in which you can have the advantage over your competitors,\u201d Trump told the New York Times for an article about feng shui in 1994. \u201cAsians are becoming a big part of our market and this is something we can\u2019t ignore.\u201d </p> <p>Keep in mind this is the same man who recently blamed China for \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world\u201d, and who perpetually accuses the country of manipulating its currency. Yet few have capitalized on the potential investment opportunity that China represents more than Trump. </p> <p>Today, some of the Trump International Hotel and Tower\u2019s most iconic features are the result of the counsel Pun-Yin provided at the time. The metal globe that stands before the building was intended to deflect the negative energy produced by the oncoming traffic in Columbus Circle. And the tower\u2019s tea-colored glassy exterior, which reflects the surrounding sky, was said to absorb the negative energy caused by the wind\u2019s sway upon the building.</p> <p>Pun-Yin also insisted that the entrance of the building face Central Park, which she refers to as the \u201cgreen dragon of New York City\u201d, instead of its original orientation, which faced Columbus Circle.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe instability of energy caused by traffic coming at the building \u2013 it\u2019s almost like bullets flying at you all the time.

There were 10 years of international media coming to me and talking about his project.\u201d</p> <p>She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why he became the most profitable real estate developer.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, Trump is neither the most profitable real estate developer, nor is he the largest. But the flurry of media attention from Trump\u2019s tower not only made a name for Pun-Yin, it also introduced the concept of feng shui into the mainstream. </p> <p>Soon after the project broke ground, the discipline \u2013 previously a foreign concept in the west \u2013 became a household name. A New Yorker <a href=\"http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/A-million-two-does-seem-a-bit-heavy-for-a-one-bedroom-at-first-but-this-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Prints_i8542186_.htm\">cartoon</a> from 1995 depicts a broker, who stands on the balcony of an apartment building with two prospective buyers and says, \u201cA million two does seem a bit heavy for a one-bedroom at first, but this unit has the best feng shui in the building.\u201d</p> <p>In the late 1990s, interior designers began appropriating elements of the philosophy for a western audience, while publishers put out accessible feng shui books with titles like \u201cDorm Room Feng Shui\u201d to provide college students with \u201cquick and inexpensive feng shui fixes\u201d like putting a pink seashell in the corner of the room to attract true love. But, Pun-Yin insists, much of the true meaning of feng shui has been lost on commercialized gimmicks. </p> <p>Nowadays, Bill Seto, a veteran New York broker who specializes in the Asian-majority market in Flushing, Queens, said that while it was once regarded as an obscure philosophy, feng shui is now a tool of the trade. \u201cIt\u2019s heavily practiced in Manhattan. Brokers are starting to take courses in feng shui because it helps them market their property better,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As for Pun-Yin, she has established a robust business for herself with a wide array of clients and projects, ranging from the CEO of fashion label Theory, Andrew Rosen, to projects commissioned by the local government.</p> <p>When I contacted her again \u2013 my first interview with her was two years ago \u2013 to divine her thoughts on the impending presidential election, I caught her between feng shui consultations. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to consult with my lawyers to comment on my client,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my plate is too full to take this on.\u201d</p>",

Despite giving the Tories an overall electoral boost, the plans could create a headache for Theresa May as up to 17 of her MPs would lose their current constituencies \u2013 the same number as the party\u2019s working majority.</p> <p>Osborne, the former chancellor, would have his Tatton constituency broken up; while cabinet ministers Priti Patel, Justine Greening and David Davis are also likely to be affected. Patel could potentially be parachuted into another Essex seat vacated by a retiring colleague.</p> <p>Johnson, the foreign secretary, would have to contest a new constituency in west London with more wards that have voted Labour, although his popularity is likely to mean he wins again.</p> <p>Corbyn would be affected by the loss of his Islington North constituency, but would be unlikely to face difficulty being selected for the reshaped seat. His aides said he would be able to contest a new Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington seat, although that could have a knock-on effect for his close ally Diane Abbott. \u201cI\u2019m very confident of the constituency changes that are suggested. But I have to say they are a long way off,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Labour is also worried about Wales, where every seat has been changed. Stephen Kinnock, who represents Aberavon, said the Welsh commission had divided his high street from the main shopping centre, and the Port Talbot steelworks from where its workers lived, in an \u201cabsurd\u201d decision. \u201cIt is a brutal mathematical strategy and a barefaced gerrymander,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Some Labour MPs have also expressed concern that the boundaries are based on registered voter numbers, not actual populations. In some seats, particularly inner-city or student-heavy ones, this can bring big disparities.</p> <p>Karen Buck, the Labour MP for Kensington North, commissioned research showing the number of electors in her constituency is 39% less than the actual population, a pattern reflected elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cIn parts of London and Birmingham, including my own constituency, the adult population is at least a third higher than the number registered to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIn other places, there is little or no variance. Yet MPs have to represent everyone living in their constituency. The rigidity of the new boundaries ignores that reality, and entrenches unfairness in the system.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservatives claim the changes will address a historic imbalance that favoured Labour unfairly. Chris Skidmore, minister for the constitution, said: \u201cEqualising the size of constituencies in the boundary review will mean everyone\u2019s vote will carry equal weight. Without such boundary reforms, MPs could end up representing constituencies based on data that is over 20 years old, disregarding significant changes in demographics, house building and migration. As it stands, some constituencies have twice as many electors than other constituencies and this cannot be right.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative chair and MP Patrick McLoughlin said his party would have a \u201cno colleague left behind\u201d policy under which MPs would be given the opportunity to stand in new seats.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Back in the 1840s, contracting pneumonia was a risk to America\u2019s presidential and political health. When William Henry Harrison fell ill a month after a famously chilly outdoor inauguration speech 175 years ago, his death sparked a constitutional crisis over the rules of succession.<br></p> <p>Fortunately, both medicine and law have come a long way since. Modern antibiotics mean Hillary Clinton\u2019s diagnosis at 68, the same age Harrison was, is unlikely to throw her off her stride for long. Campaign aides insist she may even be back on the trail by the end of the week.</p> <p>But though there is no indication that Clinton\u2019s health will require any change of plan for Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-campaign-regret-911-trump\">the brief scare</a> has underlined how relatively unclear the rules remain for replacing any candidate this late in a presidential campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/pneumonia-all-you-need-to-know-about-lung-condition-hillary-clinton\">Pneumonia: all you need to know about the lung condition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In theory, either the Republican or Democratic parties can meet to appoint a new candidate should the existing nominee be forced to pull out \u2013 something some conservatives are still calling on Trump to do. But in practice, there is little precedent and perhaps only a narrow window for such a dramatic change of heart for either party.</p> <p>Vice-presidential candidates were changed during the campaigns of 1912 and 1972, both with relatively little consequence, but <a href=\"http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/20431\">no presidential nominee has ever dropped out</a>, and the approach of early voting deadlines in a number of states makes it hard to imagine how this would work smoothly today.</p> <p>In the case of the Democratic National Committee, its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.democrats.org/Downloads/DNC_Charter__Bylaws_9.17.15.pdf\">rules stipulate</a> that a \u201cspecial meeting to fill a vacancy on the national ticket shall be held on the call of the chairperson, who shall set the date for such meeting\u201d. But the wording also allows a rules committee to set its own approach, and such a procedure may reopen barely healed wounds in the party, with supporters of Bernie Sanders arguing that he would have the clearest mandate to step in, while the party leadership and White House would be likely to favour Vice-President Joe Biden. </p> <p>Given time, either Biden or Sanders could prove effective at appealing to the working-class independents drawn to Trump. Both have shown a populist appeal sometimes seen as lacking in the Clinton campaign, which already has a far less certain lead in the polls than many Democrats would like at this stage.</p> <p>Some in the Clinton campaign may prefer that her vice-presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, step into any vacuum, particularly as the campaign messaging might then require less of an abrupt change. But even this alternative could cede vital momentum to Trump at a tricky time in the race for the White House.</p> <p>Many states would require court intervention to waive registration deadlines, something that could leave Republicans with the option <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/if-hillary-had-to-leave-the-ticket-this-is-how-a-n.html\">of legal challenge</a> if they wanted to frustrate the process or preferred to retain Clinton as an opponent.</p> <p>But the biggest obstacle would be apportioning votes that had already been cast for one of the existing candidates. Many states allow absentee balloting from early October, and some, such as North Carolina, started as early as last Friday.</p> <p>With a deadlocked supreme court and highly charged congressional atmosphere, a late change could result in a mess to compare to the 1841 Harrison succession row.</p>",

  "<p>A Donald Trump campaign rally was marred by violence yet again on Monday as the Republican nominee attacked Hillary Clinton for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">calling his supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d</a>.</p> <p>A Trump supporter apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/775467362195738624\">punched a protester</a> at a rally held at the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The scuffle was the first violent incident at a Trump rally in months. Although throughout the primary season, Trump campaign events had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies\">marked by violence</a> by both Trump supporters and protesters, culminating in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos\">near riots in Chicago</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-protests-san-jose-rally-violence-sanders-clinton\">San Jose</a>, California, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months. Prior to being punched, the protester reportedly directed an obscene gesture in Trump\u2019s direction.</p> <p>The incident happened as Trump attempted to attack Clinton for her statement that half of his supporters belong in \u201ca basket of deplorables\u201d.

The Republican nominee went on to repeat of Clinton: \u201cShe talks about people like they are objects, not human beings.\u201d</p> <p>The attacks come as Clinton has been forced off the campaign trail for health reasons. The Democratic nominee <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-campaign-regret-911-trump\">was forced to cancel</a> a campaign trip to California after being filmed losing her footing while abruptly leaving a ceremony to commemorate the 9/11 attacks on Sunday. Eventually, after initially claiming that she was \u201coverheated\u201d, the Clinton campaign admitted that the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. </p> <p>In a phone interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Clinton said she was feeling better and insisted that she did not faint on Sunday. The Democratic nominee said \u201cwe know the least about Donald Trump than any candidate in recent American history\u201d and that he should be held to \u201cthe same standard\u201d as any other candidate. </p> <p>She noted the only medical information released by Trump was a letter addressed \u201cto whom my concern\u201d that proclaimed, if elected, Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. Clinton said \u201cthat\u2019s not even serious\u201d and went on to hammer Trump for refusing to release his tax returns.</p> <p>Trump, who has long made jibes about Clinton\u2019s \u201cstamina\u201d, did not address his rival\u2019s illness on Monday night. Earlier in the day he had said he hoped she got better soon but added that her illness was \u201can issue\u201d. </p> <p>Instead, he continued his offensive against his opponent by claiming that she was running a pessimistic campaign of scare tactics. \u201cOur vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent\u2019s campaign of hate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign, with no policy, no solutions and no ideas. By contrast, I\u2019ve been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s statement was curious considering that his campaign has long focused on concerns about immigration and crime. He announced his campaign by saying Mexico was deliberately sending rapists to United States, accepted the Republican nomination by saying Americans were living in a \u201cmore dangerous environment than I have ever seen or anyone has ever seen\u201d, and has repeatedly suggested that if Clinton is elected, we will \u201cno longer have a country\u201d. Trump amplified this rhetoric on Monday by telling the crowd: \u201cYou can go to Afghanistan, you can go to war-torn countries and you will find that it is safer than some of our inner cities.\u201d</p> <p>Further, on most issues, Trump has been relatively light on policy. <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4b32e354f90741f5bbe01cc605b73d0c/trumps-deportation-waffle-highlights-campaign-weaknesses\">According to an Associated Press report</a> in late August, the Republican nominee has only posted seven policy proposals totaling 9,000 words on his website. In contrast, Clinton had released 112,735 words of proposals in 65 different issue fact sheets at the time. </p> <p>The rally took place in North Carolina, a state won by Mitt Romney in 2012 where Clinton and Trump are <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">neck and neck in polls.</a> The increasingly diverse Tarheel State is considered Clinton\u2019s best opportunity to turn a red state blue. In contrast, Trump is hoping to play the offensive in blue-collar industrial states in the midwest. </p>"
