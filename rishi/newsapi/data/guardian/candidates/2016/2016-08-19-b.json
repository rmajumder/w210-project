This has allowed Labor to coast through the campaign with little scrutiny. A leader\u2019s debate on Wednesday was won by Giles, as Gunner fell back on vague promises and platitudes.

  "<p>The post-disaster politicking got under way in earnest on Friday, as Donald Trump appeared in flood-stricken Louisiana to give his image a presidential burnish, and as the White House announced Barack Obama would tour the area next Tuesday.</p> <p>A day earlier Louisiana\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards, had warned Trump not to show up in Louisiana \u201cfor a photo op\u201d. Instead, he said, Trump should volunteer and make donations. </p> <p>Edwards also defended the delayed visit by Obama, who has come under heavy criticism locally for not interrupting his vacation to come tour the disaster area. </p> <p>The photo opportunity is a time-honored political maneuver after a natural disaster, and Trump put his own spin on it, traveling with an 18-wheel transfer truck full of supplies to hand out to crowds. </p> <p>Wherever he went, he created his own television-ready crowds. In St Amant, one of the hardest-hit areas between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Trump\u2019s convoy set up in a parking lot, and droves of people turned out to watch him hand out water bottles and diapers. </p> <p>\u201cIt was really something,\u201d said national guardsman Chris Ealy, who shook Trump\u2019s hand. The 25-year-old seemed dazzled by his encounter with national political machinery. \u201cI could tell they were in a hurry.\u201d</p> <p>Trump stayed about 15 minutes before the motorcade of black SUVs and motorcycles moved on. Within a few minutes the crowd had melted away. </p> <p>The brevity of the spectacle didn\u2019t matter. Trump\u2019s target audience was watching him on television; local people will vote for him regardless. </p> <p>\u201cThis is his stomping grounds,\u201d said Greg Patterson, who was cleaning muck from his store called the Pit Stop. The idea that a billionaire from Manhattan could describe the working-class corner of Louisiana as \u201chis stomping grounds\u201d did not strike Patterson as contradictory.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got 2,000 houses damaged just in this area alone,\u201d he said, stretching his arm out to the south. \u201cThese people are already back in their homes, working to repair them. It\u2019s not like down in the Ninth Ward.\u201d</p> <p>That was a reference to one of the quarters of New Orleans that was worst hit by Katrina a decade ago. That neighborhood is mostly poor, and mostly black. </p> <p>\u201cI mean that\u2019s a bunch of government-owned housing,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cNobody here is looking for handouts or waiting on the government. These are Trump\u2019s people.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/new-orleans-bush-clinton-obama-visit-hurricane-katrina-lower-ninth\">Uneven Katrina recovery leaves Lower Ninth Ward with little love for presidents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a bombastic statement, and maybe emotionally satisfying, but it was also untrue: more than 60,000 local people have applied for relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). </p> <p>As Trump left the area, police closed down Interstate 10, which connects Baton Rouge and New Orleans. As his motorcade passed by, drivers in the oncoming lane slammed on their brakes, unsure whether to pull to the side of the road. Some veered off into the grass and mud.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit was a savvy one that helped distract attention from the disarray of his campaign just 80 days from the general election. His campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">Paul Manafort, resigned on Friday</a> after a series of revelations about his connections to a pro-Russian Ukrainian regime.</p> <p>It also leveraged regional frustration with Obama. The Baton Rouge Advocate published an editorial comparing Obama\u2019s vacation on Martha\u2019s Vineyard to George W Bush\u2019s response to Katrina. \u201cSometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good,\u201d it said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It\u2019s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.\u201d</p> <p>A mile or so from where Trump had stopped to distribute supplies from his 18-wheeler, Joyce Humphries sat in a pickup truck Friday with her chihuahua, Elvis Presley, and looked out over a lake that used to be her home. </p> <p>\u201cEverything is gone,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Humphries said that Trump\u2019s visit was good enough to win her vote. \u201cWe will take any help we can get,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>What has been seen, the saying goes, cannot be unseen, and for <a href=\"http://thisisindecline.com/flicks/the-emperor-has-no-balls\">Indecline</a>, a self-professed \u201canarchist art collective\u201d, that was surely the point: on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/nude-donald-trump-statues-new-york-indecline\">the group installed five life-size effigies of Donald Trump</a>, the Republican presidential candidate, in five cities across the US that left nothing to the imagination. </p> <p>If you have none yourself, the title helped you out.

There\u2019s an easy defence here, of course, if you care to seat No Balls (I\u2019ll use the abbreviated version, if I may) in the time-honoured tradition of ghastly political satire. </p> <p>Depending on how far back you want to go, using images where words would be seen as too crass or literal (or actionable) is a time-honoured tradition that stretches back to the Renaissance. <a href=\"http://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-of-five-grotesque-heads\">Da Vinci\u2019s array of grotesque little heads</a>, the hellish fantasy landscapes of Dutch masters Hieronymus Bosch or Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which they peopled with every manner of grotesquely distorted, hybrid creature, are proto-examples of conscious social critique through art, while Michelangelo\u2019s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel are <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/michelangelos-secret-message-in-the-sistine-chapel-a-juxtaposition-of-god-and-the-human-brain/\">embedded with cheeky in-jokes </a>aimed at the ruling papal class. In Spain, Diego Velazquez, revered as he was as the official court painter of King Philip IV, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/diego-velazquez-philip-iv-of-spain\">was a sly subversive</a>, mocking his masters as they imagined him capturing their glory.</p> <p>No Balls, of course, engages in no such subtleties, so let\u2019s push aside the notion of it as art straight off. It\u2019s more in the company of the evolving gutter press of 18th-century England, unique in Europe for having no censorship laws, where the penny press made its fortune on the ribald caricatures of the powerful. (One famous image, from 1740, of an outsize Prime Minister Robert Walpole bent over, trousers down, his giant buttocks gleaming, seems an historical confrere to Indecline\u2019s action this week.) </p> <p>Indeed, No Balls has little affinity with great political art, past or present. One of the most powerful critiques of American policy I\u2019ve seen in recent years came from the American duo <a href=\"http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/allora-and-calzadilla\">Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla</a>, who represented the US at the 2011 Venice Biennale. The duo \u2013 known, though not well \u2013 looked to represent the ardor of their times: using gymnastic routines performed atop an actual 52-ton tank, it conflated militarism and athletics, perhaps America\u2019s best-known exports, within the bounds of sharp political satire (that its nonstop clanking echoed throughout the grounds of the gentle Giardini captured another American hallmark: loudness).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Dmptetj1s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-0Dmptetj1s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla\u2019s tank treadmill</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So where, in the great pantheon of such things, does No Balls sit? Not very high, and for a variety of reasons. Even to take the measure of great caricature, which relies on grotesque hyperbole to prove a point, it falls, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun, a little short.</p> <p>While it receives full marks for its nominal conceit \u2013 hubris, which Trump quite clearly has in no slight supply, has prompted many a leader to lionize themselves in sculptural form \u2013 the stunted member of Trump\u2019s anatomy to which the sculpture means to draw our attention is its undoing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f7ef8908fdac54ec3179d41e40ec0e9b6e1826e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f7ef8908fdac54ec3179d41e40ec0e9b6e1826e/0_0_750_1075/698.jpg\" alt=\"Idol-Worship or the way to preferment, a satire on Walpole.\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idol-Worship or the way to preferment, a satire on Walpole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emasculation, one can fairly say, is the least notable of Trump\u2019s many shortcomings. No balls? For what presidential candidate in recent memory could that be further from the truth? This is the man who pondered openly how shooting someone on Fifth Avenue might help him poll better. Whatever Trump\u2019s anatomical shortfalls, this is clearly not one of them, and the piece weakens itself with a contradiction to pitch a sophomoric joke. (For what it\u2019s worth, a recent mural of Trump\u2019s nemesis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/02/hillary-clinton-mural-covered-with-niqab-after-public-decency-complaints\">Hillary Clinton, appeared on a wall in Australia in much the same fashion</a>; the candidate was portrayed as busty, bikini-clad and dripping $100 bills. The cash we can understand, but the body? Like Trump, the tasteless non-sequitur is undone not by its lack of taste, but its lack of point.)</p> <p>Speaking of anatomy \u2013 mercifully, in a general sense this time \u2013 there\u2019s an argument to be made that, for Trump, given his own lack of boundaries, none should apply. But No Balls crosses, perhaps unintentionally, into territory that serves to undermine whatever message it may mean to carry. The piece, with its slumpy, distended belly, withered buttocks and sagging pectorals, crosses callously into generalized ageism and body-shaming; unlike the attempted caricaturization of Trump\u2019s particular bits, this is no joke, but rather an expression of unmitigated contempt, and whatever else it does, it dissolves satirical intent in an instant. </p> <p>There are some that may say, in an age of Kardashians, Jenners and Cyruses, that no such rules apply, but I don\u2019t think so. Whomever one is talking about, shaming his or her physical self is worse than cruelty for its own sake (though it is that): it\u2019s irrelevant. </p> <p>The group has made clever interventions in the past \u2013 replacing the names of stars on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame with the names of black men killed by police was a tightly bundled critique of the media and society\u2019s rabidly misplaced attentions \u2013 but here, intended satire gives way to blind hatred that obscures their intent. And there\u2019s nothing funny about that. </p>",

Here\u2019s part of his report:</p> <p><strong>To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup,</strong> I read Breitbart exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)</p> <p>It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart \u2013 the site boasted <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/\">31 million unique visitors</a> in July \u2013 but also how it appeals to its readers. And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency.</p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience.</p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster is impending \u2013 unless their guys can fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are actually some jobs that foreigners will do that Americans won&#39;t. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamgabbatt\">@adamgabbatt</a> demonstrates for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianUS\">@GuardianUS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN\">https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN</a></p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johntabin/status/766700215445454848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs\">@Bencjacobs</a> is &quot;soccer&quot; Guardian house style now?

Amid the party atmosphere created by the local families and international flag-wavers packing the course, it was perhaps the first time it felt like the Olympics had come to the city, rather than taking place in two hermetically sealed parks, 20km away.</p> <p>On the same stretch of coast, the finals of the beach volleyball were a riot as full stands partied on Copacabana to a spectacle that was half elite sport, half spring break. When Usain Bolt appeared at the Olympic stadium, the world stopped as the greatest sprinter of all time took their acclaim with a Brazilian flag draped around his shoulders.</p> <p>Yet beneath it all, the doubts that hung over the Games like dark clouds before the opening ceremony, never cleared completely. Even the wonder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\">Wayde van Niekerk\u2019s breathtaking 400m world record</a> couldn\u2019t help but be followed by questions about doping.</p> <p>It is the likeable young South African\u2019s misfortune to be competing at a time when suspicion comes with the territory, and at a Games tainted perhaps more than any other by the revelations of Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping.

On the eve of the Games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/rio-2016-olympics-boxing-corruption-allegations\">the Guardian had warned of well-sourced fears of judging corruption</a>.</p> <p>Then, amid uproar about some highly questionable judging, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/international-boxing-association-six-judges-sent-home-rio-2016\">the AIBA executive director was sent home to Lausanne and half a dozen of its most senior referees and judges stood down</a>. And yet the IOC continued to insist this was a \u201cmatter for the federation\u201d and its president Dr CK Wu, an IOC member and former IOC presidential candidate.</p> <p>Michael Conlan, the Irish boxer who believes he was cheated out of an Olympic medal, could have been talking much more widely than for just his sport when he railed against the mandarins who crush the dreams of athletes. Never has the gap between the \u201cordinary people doing extraordinary things\u201d, to use the words of former UK Sport chair Sue Campbell this week, and those overseeing the five-ringed circus felt wider than it did at these Games.</p> <p>For the British, surrendering to the endorphin rush and pleasing statistical permutations of the medal chase was inevitable. Yet while the individual stories of sporting endeavour were as compelling as ever and while athletes deserved their moment, it was hard to shake off the cynicism engendered by those in charge.</p> <p>The IOC, like Fifa, has always relied on sporting spectacle to blind the rest of us to their failings. It is a trick that is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off. A sort of freewheeling chaos tugged at the threads of this Olympics, threatening to unravel the whole patchwork.

His departure meant Conway would be in charge of the messaging, whereas Bannon, a former banker, was there to run the business side of the campaign.</p> <p>It was also pointed out that Trump had long been uncomfortable with the campaign spending heavily to buy television commercials, a step that was taken earlier this week with Trump shelling out $4m to go on the air in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. \u201cHe thinks he is being robbed,\u201d said the source familiar with the shakeup. \u201cBoots on the ground are worth it\u201d but \u201cmedia buys, mail and other stuff\u201d were looked on by Trump skeptically.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/766658503666786305\">an interview with Fox News</a>, Trump\u2019s son Eric suggested that the controversy over Manafort\u2019s ties to Russia and <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c01989a47ee5421593ba1b301ec07813/ap-sources-manafort-tied-undisclosed-foreign-lobbying\">a report this week</a> that he had potentially committed a felony by evading the reporting requirements of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) led to the top operative being pushed out. \u201cMy father just didn\u2019t want to have the distraction looming over the campaign, and, quite frankly, looming over all the issues Hillary is facing right now,\u201d said the younger Trump.</p> <p>Manafort, a veteran political strategist, has been under mounting scrutiny as more details emerged of his role in advising foreign politicians, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych</a>. </p> <p>His close connections to Russia through Yanukovych, at a time when Trump is trying to criticise Clinton for taking money from foreign donors for her family foundation, were proving a growing problem.</p> <p>Manafort first joined the campaign as an unpaid adviser in March after Trump had been repeatedly outmaneuvered in the delegation selection process by rival Ted Cruz. The veteran operative, who helped Gerald Ford win the last contested convention in American history in 1976, soon used that foothold to expand his mandate. Within weeks, he had in effect replaced former campaign manager Lewandowski, who was disdained by many within the party establishment as well as the Trump family.</p> <p>In a statement issued on Friday, Trump suggested Manafort\u2019s role had peaked as an adviser during the Republican national convention in Cleveland, where rival Ted Cruz had threatened to lead a revolt, but this time expressed no regret over the departure.</p> <p>\u201cThis morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,\u201d said a statement from the Trump campaign issued on Friday morning. \u201cI am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.\u201d</p> <p>The resignation, which contradicts claims Manafort would stay on earlier in the week, is the second moment Trump has exercised his famed slogan \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d \u2013 following the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-out\">ousting of Lewandowski</a>, in June.</p> <p>Lewandowski is now thought likely to make a comeback within the constantly shifting Trump inner circle, as he favours the same approach of \u201cletting Trump be Trump\u201d as Bannon is believed to.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-us-apologises-to-people-hurt-by-his-comments-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5ved7\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2667769\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump apologises to people hurt by his comments \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b6bfb1e4b0178756b5e195\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/19/160819trumpapologies2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/19/160819trumpapologies2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/19/160819trumpapologies2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-us-apologises-to-people-hurt-by-his-comments-video\">Donald Trump apologises to people hurt by his comments</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump also appeared rattled by recent opinion polling which suggests he is far adrift of where he needs to be to challenge Clinton in crucial swing states. The urgent need to confront his collapse in the polls suggests expediency, rather than a personality, may have been the largest factor leading to Manafort\u2019s departure.</p> <p>At a rally on Friday night in Dimondale, Michigan, he again read off a prepared speech, with no mention of polls or crowds \u2013 two of his favorite topics for months of rallies.

  "<p>When Donald Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">hired</a> Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon to lead his presidential campaign, many immediately wondered: what can we expect from the new Bannon-led campaign? And what is Breitbart News? </p> <p>Bannon has been described variously as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/\">\u201cthe most dangerous political operative in America\u201d</a> and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-campaign-chief-breitbart\">\u201cLeni Riefenstahl [a Nazi propagandist] of the Tea Party movement\u201d</a>.</p> <p>To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup, I read Breitbart exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)</p> <p>It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart \u2013 the site boasted <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/\">31 million unique visitors</a> in July \u2013 but also how it appeals to its readers. And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency. </p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience. </p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster is impending \u2013 unless their guys can fix it.</p> <p>But compared to the caps-lock screaming, the actual articles are quite benign. They could have been published on a liberal news site. Look at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/08/17/mook-only-fitting-for-a-bully-like-trump-to-hire-a-bully-to-run-his-campaign/\">this one from Wednesday</a>, reporting on the response of Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, to Bannon being hired by the Trump campaign.</p> <p>\u201cMook: \u2018Only Fitting For a Bully Like Trump To Hire a Bully To Run His Campaign\u2019,\u201d it reads.</p> <p>Mook did say that. It\u2019s true. The article itself is opinion-free. It could appear on the Guardian. It merely quotes Mook directly. <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/17/clinton-campaign-denounces-breitbart-news-divisive-racist-anti-muslim-anti-semitic-donald-trump-hires-steve-bannon/\">A later article on the same subject</a> quoted Mook more extensively, then included a response from Breitbart at the bottom. That\u2019s essentially what any news site would have done.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say Breitbart is objective. It just pushes its rightwing message with a surprising subtlety. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/\">An extensive profile of Bannon</a> by Bloomberg Politics reveals some of that thinking. \u201cFacts get shares, opinions get shrugs,\u201d Bannon says. And that\u2019s mostly how it works.</p> <p>On the front page, at least, Breitbart presents readers with articles it knows will make them angry. The Mook article is a prime example \u2013 it gives readers an outlet to rip into liberal politicians and liberal media. </p> <p>If Breitbart\u2019s success is from publishing articles that it knows will upset its readers, the key is to publish the stories that present the perfect combination of facts to fuel rightwing anger. For example, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/19/busy-schedule-dhs-secretary-defends-obamas-absence-louisiana/\">story about homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson</a>, who visited Louisiana following the recent floods, saying Obama could not also attend because he has a \u201cvery busy schedule\u201d. It is true \u2013 he did say that. But the article is illustrated with a picture of a smiling Obama on a golf course, and the text notes the president is \u201con vacation\u201d. </p> <p>For all the veneer of objectivity, readers are only presented with stories that further rightwing narratives. Reading it for two days, I learned a number of things I never knew. Many of them about Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>I discovered that \u201ca number of recent stories have focused on questions about Clinton\u2019s health\u201d.</p> <p>According to articles presented by Breitbart, Clinton is tired and ailing. In <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/18/trump-visits-louisiana-flood-victims-as-hillary-rests-and-obama-vacations/\">a piece about flooding</a> in Louisiana, I learned that Clinton needs \u201cextensive rest over the weekends\u201d. </p> <p>From <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/17/dr-drew-gravely-concerned-hillary-clintons-health-care/\">one headline</a>, I learned that Dr Drew \u2013 VH1\u2019s resident celebrity doctor \u2013 is \u201cgravely concerned about her health care\u201d. </p> <p>The message is clear: Clinton is the elderly grandmother who comes round for tea and biscuits and then has to be driven home when she falls asleep in front of Jeopardy. </p> <p>Apart from Clinton\u2019s troubling health, I learned that there was a \u201cnew gun control idea\u201d. The idea, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/08/18/researcher-use-gun-violence-restraining-orders-confiscate-guns-older-citizens/\">according to the Breitbart headline</a>, is to \u201ctake away guns from senior citizens\u201d.</p> <p> The story is actually presented straight. After an examination of the quotes, however, which came from an academic at Johns Hopkins University, the article didn\u2019t match the bluster of the headline.</p> <p>We don\u2019t exactly know what to expect yet from the Bannon-led Trump campaign. But it\u2019s a fair bet that it will be cleverly packaged, well liked by Trump supporters and not very nice.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">resignation of Paul Manafort</a> as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman was inevitable after details of his highly paid ties to the pro-Russian former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html\">became public</a> at the start of this week. On Friday, Mr Manafort\u2019s departure was confirmed. Even in a presidential campaign in which Mr Trump had appeared aggressively unconcerned about his reputation as the Kremlin\u2019s preferred candidate \u2013 and in which he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">called on Russia</a> to hack and publish Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2013 this was an embarrassment too far.</p> <p>Yet the resignation cannot simply be put down even to the red faces caused by charges of Moscow gold at the heart of the Republican campaign. Mr Trump has got where he is by scorning, not following, the usual rules. The difference now is that he is getting towards the business end of the presidential campaign, and it\u2019s going badly. Attacks that seemed to leave no dent in Mr Trump\u2019s armour a few weeks ago, have now begun to leave plenty. The polls have been tipping Mrs Clinton\u2019s way. If Mr Trump seriously wanted to salvage his campaign, he had to act.</p> <p>Yet it is far too early to say that the way he has so far shaken up his campaign \u2013 which partly preceded the departure of Mr Manafort anyway \u2013 marks a change of direction. There has been lots of media talk about a \u201cpivot\u201d towards a more presidential tone and a more consistent appeal to centre-ground voters. Yet little that Mr Trump has said or done since winning the Republican nomination in Cleveland in July points in that direction. On the contrary, his campaign appearances have continued to rely on the brutally populist campaign of the past. This is precisely why so many Republicans, including sitting senators, members of Congress and dozens of officials in former Republican administrations, have turned against him.</p> <p>Mr Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">apologised for some of his language and attacks</a> in a speech on Thursday night in North Carolina. But he was totally unspecific about what he was apologising for. Among many other things, he has taunted other Republicans, called Barack Obama the founder of Islamic State, hinted that gun-owners could shoot Mrs Clinton, boasted about his anatomy, insulted Latinos, immigrants, women and, most recently, abused the Muslim-American family of a dead US soldier. In the past, Mr Trump has confessed to using such language to create campaign momentum. If he genuinely proposes to alter course, it will take more than one very general speech in order to prove it.</p> <p>When Mr Trump started shaking up his campaign a few days ago, there was little sign that he was taking a new tack either. If anything, the signs were the opposite. His new chief executive is a man of the hard right, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-campaign-chief-breitbart\">Stephen Bannon</a>. He is being prepped for the TV debates with Mrs Clinton by Roger Ailes, who quit as chair of Fox News amid allegations of sexual harassment. If anything, it was Mr Manafort who was one of the strongest advocates of a pivot to the centre, not them. The changes may actually increase not reduce the chances that Mr Trump will continue to shoot from the hip. Mr Trump will do anything it takes to win, another <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/766652473121603584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">former Trump strategist said yesterday</a>. That\u2019s exactly the worry.</p>",
  "<p>If anyone needed a drink this week, it was Trump supporters.

On Wednesday, after news of yet another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">campaign shakeup</a>, I wondered if his supporters had started to see the beginning of the end. So I headed to Trump Bar, a rare refuge of Trumpism in liberal Manhattan, to find out if they were drowning their sorrows.<br></p> <p>Though the midtown sky was robin\u2019s egg blue, inside the dark bar on the ground floor of Trump Tower, near Central Park, a pair of polo-shirted tourists on barstools were watching dark clouds gather on the television screen tuned to the weather station. \u201cA storm\u2019s coming,\u201d one said to the other, sipping a whisky soda. The other man grunted. Happy hour at the Trump Bar, I discovered, was neither happy nor an hour. The daily promotion stretched from 4-7pm; the clientele was anxious.</p> <p>Andy, a young man who wore his black baseball cap backwards, polo shirt white and cargo shorts baggy, was staring into his phone. Andy was from Minnesota. This was his first time in New York. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the 9/11 [memorial] and then I came here.\u201d Beside him sat a half-empty bottle of Brooklyn Sorachi Ace, two camouflage Make America Great Again hats he had purchased from the Trump store, and a pile of Trump-Pence bumper stickers. \u201cYeah, I support Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e52fed0c8bbc8f7756619286ae14b60f2abef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e52fed0c8bbc8f7756619286ae14b60f2abef3/0_47_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey Heil and Marie Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honey Heil and Marie Smith.

We\u2019re not here to talk. Tell him \u2018no comment\u2019.\u201d \u201cNo comment,\u201d said Andy. Trump supporters appeared to follow the same media strategy as their candidate: don\u2019t answer questions you don\u2019t like \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-calls-reporter-ewan-macaskill-a-nasty-nasty-guy-video\">shut them out</a> instead.</p> <p>During happy hour, wine is $6 a glass, draught beer is $5 and cocktails are $7. But none of the signature or classic cocktails (The Billionaire Martini, $20; the Boardroom, $17; and the \u201cYou\u2019re Fired\u201d, $15) are included.</p> <p>June Smith, 70, was content with her wine. Smith was visiting New York from State College, Pennsylvania \u2013 part of what she calls the \u201cRed T\u201d of the Keystone State. She was optimistic that Trump would defeat Clinton in the election, despite his week of bad press. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she told me. \u201cUsually Pennsylvania is blue but this election it\u2019s purple!\u201d (I refrained from informing her most polls find Clinton with a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">4- to 11-point lead over </a>Trump there.) I asked what she liked about Trump. \u201cHe gets it,\u201d she explained. But her gruff son-in-law, who told me his name was \u201cForget About Me\u201d, quickly interrupted. \u201cNo more talking,\u201d he said. Smith smiled apologetically and reached for the sandwich. I grabbed my beer and wandered off.</p> <p>I soon came across a a quartet of ladies from Savannah, Georgia, who had settled into four chairs opposite Andy and his friend. One, Honey Heil, 74, was a vivacious and vociferous Trump supporter. Andy gave her a campaign bumper sticker, which she proudly attached to her shirt. \u201cLook, Donald! We\u2019re here!\u201d she crowed enthusiastically.<br></p> <p>Heil, a retired school nurse, was undeterred by Trump\u2019s so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">meltdown</a>\u201d.

As for who he reminded me, he\u2019s a bit like Jimmy Carter. He looks good, and it\u2019s easy to meet with him.\u201d</p> <p>During the encounter King <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM-uPpkbCB8\">asked Azarov a series of softball questions, </a>including: \u201cWhat do you like most about your job?\u201d, \u201cWhy are you interested in politics?\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019s your health?\u201d He mentioned Tymoshenko just once, asking Azarov: \u201cDo you have any sympathy for her?\u201d The latter replied: \u201cOf course.\u201d </p> <p>On Friday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos\">Serhiy Leshchenko</a>, a Ukrainian MP and investigative journalist, presented fresh details from a \u201cblack ledger\u201d belonging to Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions. It includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">records of $12.7m in payments allegedly designated for Paul Manafort</a>, then Yanukovych\u2019s chief consultant and election strategist and who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">on Friday resigned as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager</a>.<br></p> <p>Leshchenko said the records documented a $225,000 payment earmarked for King in return for the Azarov interview, which was broadcast by Ukraine\u2019s pro-government national TV station. \u201cMoney from the Party of Regions\u2019 shadow assets was paid to Larry King. He received $225,000 from the party\u2019s shadow coffer,\u201d the MP said, adding that the party had not paid taxes on its undercover slush fund. </p> <p>King, who left CNN in 2010 and has gone on to work for Russia Today, was not immediately available for comment. Manafort has dismissed claims he received \u201cblack ledger\u201d cash payments as \u201cunfounded, silly and nonsensical\u201d.</p> <p>Sources close to Manafort said he was not involved in flying King to Kiev. Rather, it was Azarov\u2019s own press team that came up with the \u201cstupid idea\u201d and arranged the trip, they suggested.</p> <p>But the alleged Larry King payment appears part of a wider strategy by the then ruling Party of Regions to influence US opinion and to deflect criticism of Yanukovych\u2019s increasingly authoritarian behaviour.</p> <p>The Associated Press <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c01989a47ee5421593ba1b301ec07813/ap-sources-manafort-tied-undisclosed-foreign-lobbying\">reported on Thursday</a> that Manafort\u2019s firm had run a covert Washington lobbying operation. Its goal was to win positive press coverage in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and to undercut public sympathy for the jailed Tymoshenko. At the time the EU and Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/11/yulia-tymoshenko-jailed-ukraine-pariah\">were calling for her to be freed.</a></p> <p>Between 2012 and 2014 Manafort\u2019s colleague Rick Gates directed two Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group, to set up meetings between senators and Ukrainian government officials, the AP said. The firms were paid $2.2m via a Brussels-based \u201cthinktank\u201d, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine.</p> <p>The \u201cblack ledger\u201d was found in the Party of Regions office in 2014, shortly after Yanukovych and Azarov escaped to Russia following mass anti-government protests. Ukrainian prosecutors accuse Yanukovych of being behind the shooting of 100 demonstrators and stealing $100bn. An international arrest warrant is outstanding against Azarov. </p> <p>On Friday, Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s parliamentary faction, said interrogating Manafort may shed light on the alleged secret payments. </p> <p>\u201cManafort didn\u2019t work for free in Ukraine. He served the Party of Regions for over 10 years. It\u2019s clear that his work was paid,\u201d Leshchenko said. \u201cThe money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>This week <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nabu.gov.ua/posts/1792546890990989\">Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption bureau published 19 pages from the ledger.</a> They showed 22 items designated for Manafort, with payments ranging from $3,468,693 for \u201cPaul Manafort contract\u201d to $6,000 for \u201cManafort expenses\u201d. Other entries were for exit polls, research, and computers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-ukraine-political-impact-donald-trump-campaign\">In an article for the Guardian</a> Leshchenko writes: \u201cSo-called \u2018shadow accounting\u2019 documents I have seen <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-prosecutor-confirms-paul-manaforts-name-appears-in-secret-cash-ledger/\">show</a> $400,000 in cash payments were made to him, which were intended to be spent on conducting exit polls. The documents show a further $812,000 to be paid to him for engaging international observers.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cUkrainians are concerned about the theft of public money. We want the chain of corruption to end. That is why many are troubled that Manafort\u2019s name has emerged in this probe.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cManafort worked with Yanukovych \u2013 one of the most notorious European politicians \u2013 for nearly 10 years. This is not a casual relationship between the client and the performer. Such long-term cooperation incorporates a general worldview and values. Now voters in America will have to ask themselves: are these values they want in their country?\u201d</p> <p>The ledgers also suggest that Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions was giving clandestine funding to the far-right ultra-nationalist Ukrainian party Svoboda, Leshchenko said on Friday. The payments were allegedly routed via one of Yanukovych\u2019s MPs, Vitaly Kalyuzhny.</p>",

After visits, independents were 5% more likely to vote for Romney, Wood found, and they were the only group affected for longer than two days, leading him to conclude that they might only affect an extremely close election. </p> <p>In the study, published this week in the Annals of the American Academic of Political and Social Science, Wood asked: \u201cIf visits have only a moderate impact on voters, but consume vast amounts of the candidates\u2019 and their staff\u2019s time, attention and resources, why not neglect visits and instead redouble candidates\u2019 attention to fundraising?\u201d</p> <p>Wood said that mundane duties, such as hiring staff, renting office space and paying for yard signs, bumper stickers and office supplies have an outsize effect on voter behavior.</p> <p>\u201cHaving somebody come to your door and give you a Trump yard sign or bumper sticker, it\u2019s expensive. You need to have guys organize who goes where, who\u2019s going to rent the office space, run the headquarters,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things turn out to have small but meaningful effects.\u201d</p> <p>The failed campaigns of Republicans John Kasich and Chris Christie seemed to bear out Wood\u2019s research. Kasich held more than <a href=\"https://www.johnkasich.com/blog-posts/kasich-holds-100th-new-hampshire-town-hall-in-bedford-today/\">100 town hall events</a> in New Hampshire but could not win the state, winning 15.8% of the vote, a distant second to Trump. Christie spent more than 70 days in the state and left in sixth place, with 7.4% of the vote. </p> <p>Lynn Vavreck, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that Wood\u2019s research fits with similar studies. Vavreck noted Obama\u2019s successful data campaign relied heavily on voter data to target treated field operations \u201clike a field goal unit: if the race is close, you want to have a good one.\u201d</p> <p>She similarly downplayed the importance of local stops, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has ever said, and certainly the Obama people never said, that the reason a presidential campaign won an election was because of their field operation.\u201d</p> <p>Wood suggested that Clinton would be better off visiting donors who can give her the cash for her regional offices, though he noted that her campaign is so well financed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000019\">with almost $45m to begin July</a> \u2013 that she may feel secure at the moment.</p> <p>He also said campaign consultants may be more interested in their national image than local votes: a bus tour traps journalists together from one cheesy event to another, and gives campaigns time to grind their message home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8bd80c4a408d67e3b0c6a7bc853b551fb7103b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8bd80c4a408d67e3b0c6a7bc853b551fb7103b5/0_178_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary at dunklings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton greets a worker during a visit to a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast to Clinton\u2019s many detours and pauses, Trump rarely stops to meet and greet with voters. \u201cFor whatever reason Trump does not like buses,\u201d Wood said, \u201cand he\u2019s had about half as many rallies as his Democratic opponent.\u201d </p> <p>Trump has instead hewed for months to the strategy that won him the Republican primary: rallies and a promiscuous approach to television interviews and Twitter. With only 82 days before election day [as of Thursday], Trump spent $4m on his first purchase of advertising in swing states on Thursday. Since June, Clinton\u2019s campaign has spent more than $75m on ads, according to Kantar Media\u2019s political ad tracker.</p> <p>His style of campaigning, with a skeletal staff mostly using the internet and national media, is largely unprecedented \u2013 and <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ba318206614b4a3c82430bf30ccc8b05/cutting-edge-voter-data-trump-critically-behind-clinton\">reportedly relying on the Republican party</a> for what voter data it does use.</p> <p>Both of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns relied heavily on voter data to target specific voter groups, and some veterans of his team <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-transition-idUSKCN10R11X\">have joined Clinton\u2019s campaign</a>.

  "<p>Barack Obama revealed his annual holiday reading list this week, at last solving the mystery of who is the one remaining person on earth who still hasn\u2019t read <em>The Girl on the Train</em>. Along with Paula Hawkins\u2019 novel, he is taking Helen Macdonald\u2019s memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\"><em>H Is for Hawk</em></a>; the Pulitzer prize-winning book about surfing, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/barbarian-days-452681.html\"><em>Barbarian Days</em></a>; <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/underground-railroad.html\"><em>The Underground Railroad</em></a><em>, </em>a fictionalised history by Colson Whitehead; and the sci-fi novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/292889/s/seveneves/\"><em>Seveneves</em></a>, to Martha\u2019s Vineyard.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s holiday picks are always guaranteed a sales boost, but he is not the first president to enjoy a good book. According to the policy adviser Karl Rove, he and George W Bush had an annual reading competition, averaging about two books a week, with Bush\u2019s taste extending from political biographies (he read 14 of Lincoln alone while he was in the White House) to fiction (including Camus\u2019 <em>The Stranger</em>) to YA (<em>Ana\u2019s Story</em>, co-written by his daughter Jenna). The bigger reader, though, was Laura Bush, a former school librarian, whose life is itself fictionalised in Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/16/american-stories-curtis-sittenfeld\"><em>American Wife</em></a>.</p> <p>Both Clintons\u2019 reading lists show that they are fans of Maya Angelou, but while Bill counts Hillary\u2019s <em>Living History</em> among his favourite political books, Hillary names George W Bush\u2019s <em>Decision Points</em> as hers. When he was elected president, Bill Clinton overruled a travel ban on Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, whose novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-5.html\"><em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em></a> he had loved since law school, and the two became friends. But, Clinton confessed, really he was addicted to mysteries.</p> <p>According to Tevi Troy, the author of <em>What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Popular Culture in the White House</em>, Richard Nixon and George HW Bush were big fans of Tolstoy; JFK was mad about Bond; and Ronald Reagan loved westerns. But his recommendation (\u201ca perfect yarn\u201d) was partly responsible for making Tom Clancy\u2019s <em>The Hunt for Red October</em> a bestseller.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the bookselling industry, Donald Trump has no time to read. \u201cI never have,\u201d he has said.

  "<p>Most of this week\u2019s column, I promise, won\u2019t be about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>. But the man\u2019s such a walking psychology textbook I can\u2019t resist using him as an example. In this case: his tendency to criticise in others precisely the faults he suffers from himself. \u201cSomething I saw early on with Trump,\u201d his remorseful former <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">ghostwriter Tony Schwartz</a> tweeted, is that \u201cmost negative things he says about others are actually describing him.\u201d It\u2019s not merely that he\u2019s an insecure man who lashes out when attacked; it\u2019s that his specific ways of lashing out are advertisements for his greatest insecurities. He claims Hillary Clinton shouldn\u2019t get classified security briefings, since she\u2019s \u201ca lose [sic] cannon with extraordinarily bad judgment\u201d. He mocks her power naps and uses \u201clow energy\u201d as an insult, despite being obsessed with sleeping in his own bed, and often looking exhausted. And he slams Nato members for not paying their bills \u2013 when that\u2019s precisely what he\u2019s famous for in business.</p> <p>This, of course, is \u201cprojection\u201d, one of those Freudian terms we\u2019re supposed to reject for lack of scientific evidence, but that keeps reasserting itself as an invaluable way of interpreting the world. When we\u2019re troubled by a shameful emotion or half-acknowledged thought, this theory goes, we identify and condemn the failing in others, to avoid confronting it in ourselves. (It\u2019s not just that we <em>pretend</em> to see it in others, which is how people sometimes interpret Trump\u2019s sputterings; it\u2019s that we really believe it.) A cheating husband accuses his wife of infidelity; a bigot sees prejudice everywhere she looks. It works with positive emotions, too: in the first flush of romance, Carl Jung argued, projection runs the show; we see in the other person some good part of ourselves we\u2019ve yet to understand. That\u2019s why so many relationships flounder after a few months, once you start to notice the discrepancies between the real person and the projection. \u201cProjection,\u201d Jung wrote, \u201cchanges the world into the replica of one\u2019s unknown face.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/you-dont-have-choice-oliver-burkeman\">Maybe you don\u2019t have as much choice as you think</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tricky part is that projection usually attaches itself to something real in the other person\u2019s personality, making it hard to see what\u2019s going on. For example, I get enraged by drivers in my neighbourhood honking their horns for no good reason. In a sense, I\u2019m right: they\u2019re breaking the law. But that can\u2019t be the whole explanation, since I get nowhere near so emotional about other annoyances \u2013 frankly, I don\u2019t get so emotional about most terrorist attacks. Could it be that I\u2019m specially bothered by the drivers\u2019 selfishness because I\u2019m worried I live too selfishly myself? On that logic, it\u2019s no surprise I\u2019m less viscerally angered by terrorist atrocities, since I don\u2019t secretly fear I might commit one.</p> <p>It\u2019s illuminating to examine your hostile feelings toward others, and theirs about you, through this lens. Plus, it lets you read Trump like a book \u2013 not one penned by a ghostwriter, but written, however inadvertently, from the heart.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The Department of Justice announced Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/us-government-private-prisons-use-justice-department\">it would begin \u201cphasing out\u201d the use of private prisons for federal prisoners</a> citing superior safety and rehabilitation outcomes at state-run facilities. Deputy attorney general Sally Yates wrote that private prisons \u201csimply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources\u201d, \u201cdo not save substantially on costs\u201d, and \u201cdo not maintain the same level of safety and security\u201d as the department\u2019s own sites.</p> <p> The move has been widely hailed by advocates as one that could signal positive change for about 22,000 federal inmates across 13 facilities, but many have also paused to note that the Justice Department decision only affects about a quarter of inmates and detainees held in US private facilities.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the Justice Department\u2019s announcement is a step in the right direction, much more action is needed to scrub private prisons from our criminal justice system,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, <a href=\"http://www.colorofchange.org/about\">executive director of Color of Change</a>, an online racial justice organization.</p> <p>The decision, for example, does not apply to people held in Department of Homeland Security detention centers for immigration violations, which tally at about 34,000 on any given day, and about 400,000 over the course of a year. About 60% of those detainees are held in private facilities. By comparison, private prisons currently hold about 15% of federal prisoners and 6% of those in state corrections. </p> <p>\u201cRefugees, children, parents and everyday people seeking a better life are routinely locked up, abused and even killed by corporate-run immigrant detention facilities and despite the evidence, the Department of Homeland Security refuses to shut them down,\u201d said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream Action, an immigrant rights activist organization. She added that today\u2019s decision is \u201cyet more evidence of why Hillary Clinton must commit to use executive authority to provide relief to immigrants in her first 100 days, should she become president\u201d.</p> <p>Similar to other direct efforts the Obama administration has taken on prison and criminal justice reform issues recently, there is a limited impact because of how few of the nation\u2019s incarcerated people are under federal control at any given time. Federal prisoners make up just 14% of nearly 1.5 million prison inmates nationwide, while the vast majority are instead held in state correctional facilities. An additional 740,000 inmates are also detained in local jails at any given time.</p> <p>A similar dynamic was at work earlier this summer when the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/26/obama-bans-solitary-confinement-of-juveniles-in-federal-prisons\">banned the use of solitary confinement</a> in federal juvenile facilities. It was quickly noted that only 13 juvenile inmates had endured the practice the previous year. In that same action, the president also expanded treatment for the mentally ill and increased the amount of time adult inmates in solitary must be allowed to spend outside of their cells in federal facilities. Obama said at the time he hoped the changes would \u201cserve as a model for state and local corrections systems\u201d.</p> <p>In Texas, where more people are incarcerated than any other state, the state\u2019s ACLU called on local leaders to \u201cfollow the lead of the Justice Department and end their relationships with the for-profit prison industry\u201d in the wake of the announcement.</p> <p>Texas officials \u201ccould start by phasing out one or more private state jail contracts when they expire next year\u201d, said Rebecca L Robertson, legal and policy director for the ACLU of Texas. \u201cThe for-profit prison model creates perverse incentives to cut corners and lock up as many people as possible, all on the taxpayers\u2019 dime. The results have been predictable: over-criminalization, overcrowding, inhumane treatment, inadequate services and healthcare and routine abuse of detainees.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement follows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">scathing report released last week that found privately operated federal prisons drastically more unsafe and punitive</a> than other prisons in the system. The report found that inmate-on-inmate assaults were 28% higher in private federal prisons as compared to state ones, and that cost-saving intended cutbacks to medical care in these facilities was likely at fault for the deaths of inmates experiencing medical emergencies.<br></p> <p>Jonathan Burns, the director of public affairs for Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison company in the country downplayed any concern with the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s announcement relates only to [federal] BOP [Bureau of Prisons] correctional facilities, which make up 7% of our business,\u201d Burns said. </p> <p>The company\u2019s stock dipped to it\u2019s lowest point since 2010 after the news was announced, plunging by nearly 50% in about an hour, before rebounding slightly. </p> <p>Burns said the company continued to \u201cvalue our partners, and we will continue to work with them\u201d.</p>",
  "<p><em>Update, 10:20am EDT: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">Paul Manafort has resigned</a> as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman</em></p> <p>Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, has only recently become familiar to Americans. But in Ukraine, Manafort has played a decisive role in politics for nearly a decade \u2013 one that is being closely scrutinized after his name has appeared in documents that are being examined in a corruption investigation. That is why on Friday, I helped to make public more documents related to Manafort\u2019s dealings with the Party of Regions, which he used to consult for.</p> <p>I remember Manafort clearly during the inauguration of Victor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine. On a cold February morning, men and women wearing tailcoats and evening gowns hurried towards the Lenin monument. There was a little bit of commotion at the entrance \u2013 Rinat Akhmetov, the richest Ukrainian man and the right arm of Yanukovych, was trying to make way for an inconspicuous American. It was only me and a few of my colleagues who recognized the mysterious stranger\u2019s face: it was Paul Manafort.</p> <p>Manafort had served as a consultant to the Party of Regions for many years. He had just as much cause for celebration as the newly inaugurated president, since he was the mastermind behind the president\u2019s victory. The two had worked together since 2004. After Yanukovych\u2019s election defeat that year, Manafort was hired by him and they worked on four election campaigns (including one presidential and three parliamentary ones) together.</p> <p>The American consultant was recommended to Yanukovych by his business and political partner Rinat Akhmetov, who in turn was recommended by Oleg Deripaska, his Russian colleague from the circle of fellow oligarchs. That way Manafort passed from one person to another as a relay baton to later become one of the most influential players in the Ukrainian politics. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">How Trump's campaign chief got a strongman elected president of Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question is now if he ever abused his position. So-called \u201cshadow accounting\u201d documents I have seen <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-prosecutor-confirms-paul-manaforts-name-appears-in-secret-cash-ledger/\">show</a> $400,000 in cash payments were made to him, which were intended to be spent on conducting exit polls. The documents show a further $812,000 to be paid to him for engaging international observers. And, these documents, which I <a href=\"http://www.pravda.com.ua/cdn/graphics/2016/05/black-pr/\">reported</a> on and which were the focus of a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">article</a> this week, list a total of $12.7m of payments made to Manafort.</p> <p>Ukrainians are concerned about the theft of public money. We want the chain of corruption to end. That is why many are troubled that Manafort\u2019s name has emerged in this investigation.<br></p> <p>It is not just these latest revelations that cast a shadow over Manafort\u2019s name in Ukraine. Manafort was an advisor to President Yanukovych when he pursued a divisive electoral campaign, such as focusing on the alleged infringement of rights of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. This wasn\u2019t an issue before, but after years of driving this idea into the heads of voters, the question of the Russian language has really become an important factor in Ukrainian politics. </p> <p>Subsequently, after the escape of Yanukovych in 2014, it was under the guise of protecting the Russian population that Putin invaded Crimea, violating the post-war balance of power in Europe. </p> <p>Manafort worked with Victor Yanukovych \u2013 one of the most notorious European politicians \u2013 for nearly 10 years. This is not a casual relationship between the client and the performer. Such long-term cooperation incorporates a general worldview and values. Now voters in America will have to ask themselves: are these values they want in their country?</p>",

Ultimately the businessman expresses impatience with George W Bush.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack.\u201d</p> <p>Bush was \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d nonetheless, he added. Almost two months later and a day into the war, Trump declared on Fox News: \u201cIt looks like a tremendous success, from a military standpoint.\u201d The day after that, in a San Antonio Express interview found by <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/02/donald-trump-and-the-iraq-war/\">FactCheck.org</a>, Trump said \u201c<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/02/donald-trump-and-the-iraq-war/\">war is depressing</a>\u201d and encouraged people to watch a beauty pageant. A year later he <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">told Esquire</a> the war was a \u201cmess\u201d. </p> <p>Before the war Howard Stern asked whether Trump supported invasion, to which Trump answered: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u201cI have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.\u201d </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpLR4GgAL2g\">\u2013 15 August, Youngstown, Ohio</a></p> <p>Trump called for a complete withdrawal from Iraq nine years ago, before George W Bush was out of office.

They\u2019re in a civil war over there.\u201d</p> <p>The businessman then argued that post-withdrawal chaos was in fact another reason to abandon Iraq. The power that would take over, Trump said, would be \u201cthe meanest, the worst guy and he\u2019ll have one thing, one thing, he will hate America, and he\u2019ll use that to flame. So, I mean, this is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.\u201d</p> <p>Although Trump called for Americans to wash their hands of Iraq and any anti-US forces that might rise there, he now argues that the withdrawal of US forces in December 2011, according to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/world/middleeast/28iraq.html\">a timeline set by Bush and Iraq\u2019s government</a> that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/world/middleeast/last-convoy-of-american-troops-leaves-iraq.html\">Barack Obama oversaw</a> , created the conditions for the terror group Isis to thrive. </p> <h2>The Middle East</h2> <p><strong>\u201cPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton should never have attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria, or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.\u201d </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpLR4GgAL2g\">\u2013 15 August, Youngstown, Ohio</a></p> <p>Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump all supported intervention in Libya in 2011.

But for years Obama resisted calls to actively intervene in Syria, angering many Republicans and some Democrats, until his administration<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons.html\"> began to arm anti-Assad rebels</a>. </p> <p>Obama <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/world/middleeast/04diplomacy.html?pagewanted=all\">did press Mubarak to step down</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/25/egypt-protests-mubarak\">demonstrations swelled</a> against the Egyptian president.

(The US paid $20m for control of the Philippines, which was granted full independence in 1934.)</p> <p>Trump\u2019s philosophy of war not only looks back to the colonial era, it also contradicts his own insistence that the US must stop investing in other nations. In the same 15 August speech, Trump declared, \u201cif I become president, the era of nation-building will be ended,\u201d even though he admitted that his plan, \u201cby its very nature, would have left soldiers in place to guard our assets\u201d \u2013 a costly, indefinite investment in the security of a foreign territory.</p> <h2><strong>San Bernardino</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201c</strong><strong>She wanted to support very openly jihad online \u2026 A neighbor saw suspicious behavior, bombs on the floor and other things, but didn\u2019t warn authorities because they said they didn\u2019t want to be accused of racial profiling</strong><strong>.\u201d </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpLR4GgAL2g\">\u2013 15 August, Youngstown, Ohio</a></p> <p>Tashfeen Malik, one of the shooters in last year\u2019s San Bernardino attack, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/san-bernardino-killers-did-not-post-public-terror-messages-n481066\">did not openly discuss her and her husband Syed Farook\u2019s plans</a> online: the FBI said they used private messages.</p> <p>For weeks Trump has baselessly said someone saw \u201cbombs on the floor\u201d and \u201csuspicious behavior\u201d \u2013 he has repeated this for weeks without any evidence.
