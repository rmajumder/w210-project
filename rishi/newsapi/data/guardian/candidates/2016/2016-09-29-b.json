  "<p>After months of bashing the German chancellor on the campaign trail, Donald Trump declared that Angela Merkel was his favorite world leader.</p> <p>In an interview with a local reporter in New Hampshire, the Republican presidential nominee proclaimed: \u201cI think Merkel is a really great world leader.\u201d Though, he added, \u201cI was very disappointed that, when she, this move with the whole thing on immigration, I think it\u2019s a big problem and really, you know, to look at what she\u2019s done in the last year and a half. I was always a Merkel person. I thought really fantastic. But I think she made a very tragic mistake a year and a half ago.\u201d </p> <p>Trump was criticizing the German chancellor\u2019s openness to taking refugees from Syria. Despite the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in that country, Trump has long warned of the danger of taking in refugees, whom he has compared to the Trojan Horse.</p> <p>The statement marks a change in tone from Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Merkel on the campaign trail. </p> <p>In December, after Merkel bested him to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/angela-merkel-time-magazine-person-of-the-year-2015\">Time\u2019s Person of the Year</a>, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/674587800835092480\">tweeted</a> she was \u201cruining Germany\u201d. He had previously said Merkel should be \u201cashamed of herself\u201d over refugee policy. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary Clinton is running to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel. We\u2019ve seen how much crime and how many problems that\u2019s caused</p> <footer> <cite>Donald Trump in August</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump has since gone on to compare Merkel to his election rival Hillary Clinton. In August, he said, \u201cHillary Clinton is running to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel, and we\u2019ve seen how much crime and how many problems that\u2019s caused the German people.\u201d </p> <p>He has also seen parallels in nativist opposition to Merkel in Germany in local elections and his own cause, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">telling a crowd in North Carolina</a> in September, \u201cSee what happened to Angela Merkel? They had a massive defeat recently in the elections.\u201d</p> <p>However, Trump has praised Merkel in the past. In August 2015 he <a href=\"http://time.com/4453084/donald-trump-angela-merkel-germany-immigration/\">called her</a> \u201cprobably the greatest leader in the world today\u201d and, in 2013, he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/385826942303211521\">tweeted</a> \u201cAngela Merkel is doing a fantastic job as the Chancellor of Germany. Youth unemployment is at a record low &amp; she has a budget surplus.\u201d</p> <p>Curiously, Trump\u2019s statement came only hours after Clinton praised Merkel as one of her favorite world leaders in a gaggle with reporters on her campaign plane. </p> <p>When asked to name a favorite, the Democratic nominee said \u201cOne of my favorites has been Angela Merkel \u2026 her leadership and steadiness on the euro crisis and her bravery in the face of the refugee crisis is something that I am impressed by.\u201d</p> <p>The questions came after the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/gary-johnson-cant-name-foreign-leader-aleppo-moment\">unable to name a single foreign leader he admired</a> in a town hall with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews on Wednesday. </p>",

  "<p>What does Gary Johnson know?

Just two minutes of Johnson rattling off things he does know. How many eggs in a dozen? That\u2019s a snap, Anderson. It\u2019s 12. Where are babies made, Mr Johnson? Well ... something about mommies and daddies loving each other, right? Who let the dogs out? Wow, that\u2019s a tough one, Anderson. Can I get back to you after I consult with my advisors? I happen to be heavily courting the dogcatchers\u2019 union.</p> <p>Better yet, this could make a remarkable game show for those lonely summer months when the American broadcast networks air <a href=\"http://tv.esquire.com/shows/american-ninja-warrior\">human dart tossing </a>and Family Feud. I\u2019m certain that Are You Smarter Than Gary Johnson would be a smash hit on Fox or The CW. Corral some 12-year-olds and see if they can spot China on a map before Gary.

And there\u2019s also Jill Stein, whose campaign currently consists of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1663557460563151/\">reminders</a> that she\u2019s sort of like Bernie Sanders, complete with her own stash of \u201cdank memes\u201d. <br></p> <p>A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a man who has proven on more than one occasion that he knows very little about the rest of the world, who gets <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/27/cranky-gary-johnson-should-we-just-drop-out-then.html\">indignant</a> when he is challenged on that fact and who has seemingly made no effort to close this knowledge gap. A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a less hateful Donald Trump \u2013 a man who looks more like a game show contestant than a game show host.

  "<p>Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures were partially responsible for reversing a massive growth in the use of a controversial provision of the Patriot Act for acquiring email and other so-called \u201cbusiness records\u201d, the US justice department\u2019s internal watchdog has found.<br></p> <p>The Patriot Act provision, known as Section 215, permits intelligence and law enforcement agencies to acquire from a service provider records of someone\u2019s communications \u2013 such as phone calls or email records \u2013 that are relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation.</p> <p>In June 2013, the Guardian, based on Snowden\u2019s leaks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">revealed</a> that the Bush and Obama administrations had secretly been using Section 215 to acquire Americans\u2019 phone data in bulk. The revelation led Congress to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/02/congress-surveillance-reform-edward-snowden\">significantly curtail</a> domestic bulk phone records collection in 2015. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/o1604.pdf\">new report</a> from the justice department inspector general reveals that around 2009, the FBI began encountering resistance from email providers and others to a highly controversial nonjudicial subpoena for records, known as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/17/fbi-national-security-letters-nick-merrill-surveillance\">National Security Letter</a>. In the wake of this, the FBI began acquiring the information it sought through warrant requests to the Fisa court, a secret surveillance panel, using Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the inspector general notes is a slower process.</p> <p>\u201cTransactional records for email,\u201d says the heavily redacted report, were \u201cthe most common type of records requested\u201d outside of bulk data collection, which the inspector general set aside. </p> <p>The shift resulted in an \u201cexponentially\u201d increasing FBI appetite for email and other records under the Patriot Act provision. In 2009, the Fisa court approved 21 such requests. By 2012, it had approved 212. A single order can encompass many people\u2019s records.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/washington-post-wrong-edward-snowden-pardon\">The Washington Post is wrong: Edward Snowden should be pardoned | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between 2012 and 2014, the Fisa court issued 564 such orders, which the inspector general called \u201ca dramatic increase\u201d. Between 2007 and 2009, the court issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/21/fbi-patriot-act-doj-report\">only 51 orders for domestic email and internet metadata</a>, according to the previous inspector general\u2019s report on Section 215 issued last year.</p> <p>The Fisa court, the inspector general has now found, \u201cdid not deny any business records applications\u201d made between 2012 and 2014. </p> <p>But Snowden\u2019s revelations, beginning in mid-2013, helped shift the FBI away from using Section 215 to acquire email and other metadata. The Fisa court approved warrants to collect non-bulk business records 179 times in 2013, a number falling to 142 times in 2015 \u2013 though this was still a vast increase on the 21 approved in 2009. </p> <p>A senior national security official with the justice department told the inspector general that a \u201cstigma\u201d had been created around the Patriot Act provision, even outside of the bulk collection that privacy advocates rallied to stop.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible that folks \u2026 have decided it\u2019s not worth pursuing [business records orders], you know, obviously things haven\u2019t been great since Snowden either,\u201d the report quoted the unnamed official as saying. </p> <p>The justice department disputed Snowden\u2019s impact on the shift as \u201cspeculative\u201d and indicated that the data collection did not stop, so much as shifted legal justifications.</p> <p>Just as the 2009-era resistance to National Security Letters spurred the bureau to rely on Section 215 and the Fisa court for email and other records acquisition, the justice department\u2019s national security division told the inspector general that the FBI now uses a different authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, for its email collection.</p> <p>Section 702, passed in 2008, permits the US government to collect large amounts of Americans\u2019 international communications, provided that no \u201cUS person\u201d within the country is an explicit target of the surveillance dragnet.

But what\u2019s happening now is serious,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of members are worried, confused and very sad.\u201d</p> <p>In a dig at S\u00e1nchez\u2019s recent comments that the party was splitting into different camps, she added: \u201cThere aren\u2019t camps within the PSOE and nor is it a camp. The PSOE is a great party and I\u2019m convinced that all us socialists know why we\u2019re here and what we want to defend \u2013 and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201d</p> <p>Going further still, D\u00edaz said that a proper debate on the PSOE\u2019s future was too important to be rushed for \u201cpersonal interests\u201d.<br></p> <p>The party\u2019s civil war exploded into the open on Wednesday after its former leader, Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, accused S\u00e1nchez of misleading him.

He would prefer to try to build a deal with the anti-austerity Podemos party and smaller, regional parties.<br></p> <p> Gonz\u00e1lez said S\u00e1nchez\u2019s stance, which has alienated many in the party, had left him feeling \u201cdeceived and disappointed\u201d. His very public intervention and insistence that the PSOE should step aside to let the PP govern, was followed a few hours later by the resignation of 17 members of the executive committee.</p> <p>The bloodletting in the socialist camp is likely to benefit Rajoy, whose party was the only one to pick up more seats in the June election than in December\u2019s. </p> <p>It will also help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/podemos-under-pressure-spain-political-deadlock-continues\">Podemos stake its claim as the dominant leftist force in Spanish politics</a>.

To that extent he has at least lasted the course and will doubtless soon be able to find himself a comfortable home in the security industry, away from the daily crises that come with his current post.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/met-police-chief-contenders-favourites-long-shots\" title=\"\">So who should replace him?</a></p> <p>The betting at the moment seems to be on there being, for the first time, a woman as commissioner. Various names have been mentioned, from the much admired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sara-thornton\" title=\"\">Sara Thornton</a> to \u2013 despite denials \u2013 Lynne Owens and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cressida-dick\" title=\"\">Cressida Dick</a>, although the latter is no longer a police officer. A female prime minister and a female home secretary may well feel that it is about time that the capital city followed the examples set successfully over the last decade by provincial forces and appointed a woman to the helm.</p> <p>Whoever it may be should start by repairing relations with the media, whose cooperation is vital to the Met\u2019s work. In 2012, Hogan-Howe famously embraced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/04/filkin-report-met-police-journalists?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">controversial report</a> into relations between the police and the media commissioned by the then home secretary, Theresa May, and headed by Dame Elizabeth Filkin. \u201cThere should be no more secret conversations,\u201d said Sir Bernard at the time of the Filkin report\u2019s publication, agreeing that too many detectives were too chummy with the press. \u201cThere should be no more improper contact and by that what I mean is between the police and the media \u2013 that which is of a selfish, rather than a public interest. Meetings will no longer be enhanced by hospitality and alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, those secret conversations \u2013 by which he meant that detectives should not be having chats with crime correspondents without having a press officer present and certainly should not be popping down to the pub with a reporter after a day at the Yard. While previous commissioners had briefed crime correspondents on a more or less regular monthly basis, Sir Bernard ended the practice and made clear his distaste for much of what the media got up to. As a result, relations with the media in this post-Leveson world have rarely been chillier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/police-with-body-cameras-receive-93-fewer-complaints-study\">Police with body cameras receive 93% fewer complaints \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new commissioner will have to make it clear that she \u2013 or he \u2013 is prepared to open the doors again in the way that Sir Robert Mark did so successfully back in the 1970s. They could do worse than to repeat Sir Robert\u2019s credo: \u201cOfficers who speak in good faith may be assured of my support even if they make errors of judgment when deciding what information to disclose.\u201d</p> <p>To his credit, however, last year Sir Bernard did allow the BBC\u2019s cameras to follow his officers in the series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/09/the-met-policing-london-review\" title=\"\">The Met: Policing London</a>. In doing so, he said that he was weary of the standard type of programme \u2013 \u201ccops banging in doors, charging around with their blue lights on, a macho commentary \u2026 they are short on the informative side\u201d. As a way of showing the difficulties of the job and the dangers faced by officers, the series was widely regarded as a success, so his risk was justified and should be repeated by the next office-holder.</p> <p>The new person will also need to be someone who can win the confidence both of the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and, more importantly, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is fresh from <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-isis-terrorism-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-us-election-ctm/\" title=\"\">his triumphs on the other side of the Atlantic</a>. Did he pick up any policing ideas there? He would not be the first mayor to imagine that a savvy American police chief might be the best way to shake up the Yard, although such a scenario \u2013 flirted with in the past \u2013 seems unlikely today.</p> <p>Khan has already made it clear that he is his own man when it comes to decisions and he will doubtless want someone who reflects his view that the diversity of London requires a very special kind of sensitivity. No one who has watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">catastrophic breakdown in relations between the police and the public</a> in too many big American cities will want to see the same kind of conflict repeated in London where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">our own riots</a> are still fresh in the memory.</p> <p>The old-school crimes which a commissioner had to prioritise in the past \u2013 the bank robberies that occurred on an almost daily basis \u2013 are much less of an issue these days when so much more theft is carried out by cybercriminals. So the new chief will also have to be someone who is not overwhelmed by the rather prosaic and unspectacular nature of investigating such offences.</p> <p>And, of course, the top priority will be how the new person reacts when \u2013 not if \u2013 faced with their first major terror incident in the capital. Which is why the Met\u2019s top <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism\" title=\"\">counter-terrorism</a> officer, Mark Rowley, is also now seen as a candidate.</p> <p>Anyway, the faint-hearted need not apply.</p>",

He confessed it, crying, on his first weekend home, and I cried and hated myself for not having been \u201cenough\u201d, and tried to muster that haughty tone of voice I used to conjure so easily when playing Barbies to tell him to get lost. Instead, as he begged me not to dump him, I agreed to stay.</p> <p>Of course, we broke up eventually: that\u2019s what you do at 17. I told myself my reaction to his unfaithfulness was a momentary weakness, a product of first love and immaturity, and practiced being more ruthless in enforcing my boundaries. It didn\u2019t always stick, and it wasn\u2019t the only <a href=\"http://www.thefrisky.com/2011-11-28/girl-talk-i-snooped-his-online-dating-profile/\">time</a> that I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/megancarpentier/status/778622442365485056\">caught</a> a man at least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/megancarpentier/status/770243792033185793\">attempting</a> to be unfaithful. My initial reactions differed depending on the relationship, but I didn\u2019t tell anyone in my social circle about any of it, because I didn\u2019t want the decisions I had to make influenced by what I knew was the socially acceptable reaction. </p> <p>The thing is, I stayed, however briefly, for me \u2013 not for the men in question. I wanted to <em>know</em> that it was over; I needed to feel that there was nothing salvageable about a relationship in which I\u2019d invested time and emotion. That they got to \u201ckeep\u201d me longer wasn\u2019t my consideration; what I could have and what I could still give was what I tried to figure out in between bouts of crying and glasses of wine.</p> <p>It took a long time, but I\u2019m no longer embarrassed to admit that I didn\u2019t summarily throw people I loved out of my life because they were flawed and had hurt me: I\u2019m OK with my life and my relationships being more complicated than a three-minute pop song and listening to the back-third of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.forharriet.com/2016/04/jay-z-did-exactly-what-you-should-do.html\">forgiveness and reconciliation arc</a> \u2013 on repeat as much as the front third.</p> <p>But I do wince every time a Republican smirks and suggests that the next gotcha-game they\u2019re going to play with Hillary Clinton is going to be her husband\u2019s admitted infidelities. She\u2019s hardly the only woman in American who\u2019s ever decided that an imperfect relationship with a flawed man was in her best interest; she\u2019s hardly the only woman in America to admit that she loves someone who hurt her and had to put work into her relationship for it to function.</p> <p>And none of the judgment about why she stayed has anything to do with the issues facing America, except to wildly suggest that a woman\u2019s acceptance of a flawed man into her personal life should have professional repercussions.</p> <p>That\u2019s a slippery slope to climb \u2013 especially for the women who are willingly associating with Donald Trump.</p>",

How movies see real-life heroes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This anecdote, while reinforcing Wahlberg\u2019s image of the kid from the streets done good, also acts as a reminder of just how long he has been in the public eye, being shuttled around the world first by record companies, then film-makers while pining for the basketball courts back home. It hs been 25 years since he crunched his abs as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO9909uexu8\">Marky Mark with the unforgettably named Funky Bunch</a>. Since then, he has made the tricky crossover from teenage heartthrob to respected actor and producer, and at first glance, Wahlberg now looks like a typical Hollywood A-lister. His gently feathered hair, which brushes his shoulders, looks like it was cut by a stylist who charges three figures, and his deep tan and muscles suggest a man whose time is his own. But Wahlberg has always been a more surprising prospect than appearances suggest. For a start, the reason he seems so bored is because, he says, right off the bat, \u201cI never really like talking about myself,\u201d which is not something you hear often from a celebrity. He perks up any time he can deflect the conversation to an anecdote about someone else in his life. One of those people, it turns out, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3dbf050b8f80a7c58bf001beb2e6058d8a56298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3dbf050b8f80a7c58bf001beb2e6058d8a56298/0_0_946_1422/665.jpg\" alt=\"Wahlberg Trump golf\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wahlberg plays golf as Donald Trump watches on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Golf Channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was very Trump-like, talking business, properties and stuff.

I\u2019ve never met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that Wahlberg and Trump met almost a decade ago at one of those weird celebrity golf events that always seem to be happening in California or Florida. What did they talk about? \u201cHe was very Donald Trump-like, talking about the things that he does, things that he has, business interests, properties, stuff like that. But he wasn\u2019t ever mean or rude. I don\u2019t think he asked me too many personal questions, or about what I do.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Ivanka explained to her dad who Wahlberg is, because Trump has since invited him back to play golf at his own events. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a little crazy where we are now,\u201d is all Wahlberg says about the election in which his golf buddy is barely a breath away from the White House.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yASbM8M2vg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8yASbM8M2vg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click here to watch the trailer for Deepwater Horizon.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wahlberg is in London, suffering the weather and talking Trump, because he is promoting his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/deepwater-horizon\">Deepwater Horizon</a>, the true story of the 2010 oil-rig explosion and spill crisis, the worst ever in the US. Wahlberg plays Mike Williams, the heroic lead character based on a real person, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kurt-russell\">Kurt Russell</a> as the gruff ol\u2019 boss and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-malkovich\">John Malkovich</a>, who hams it up enjoyably as the BP rep, evil to an almost southern gothic extent. It is a strikingly harrowing disaster film and Wahlberg is in classic Wahlberg mode: the blue-collar hero, standing his ground against, on the one side, Malkovich\u2019s scenery chewing and, on the other, the pyrotechnic special effects.</p> <p>Wahlberg\u2019s career is remarkable in two respects: first, the sheer range of films he has made. There are the intense dramas (The Basketball Diaries, Boogie Nights, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-fighter\">The Fighter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/03/broken-city-review\">Broken City</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/thriller.mattdamon\">The Departed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/14/thriller\">We Own the Night</a>), the comedies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/nov/04/londonfilmfestival2004.londonfilmfestival\">I Heart Huckabees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/the-other-guys-review\">The Other Guys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ted\">Ted</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/22/date-night-review\">Date Night</a>), the action movies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay\">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/30/lone-survivor-review\"> Lone Survivor</a>, Deepwater Horizon).</p> <p>Wahlberg sinks himself so deeply into a role that you can easily forget who you are actually watching, which is not something you can say of most big-name actors (on some level I\u2019d forgotten that the same guy who played Dirk Diggler was also the one who larked around with a talking teddy bear). This relates to the second point about Wahlberg: it is rarely noted how excellent he is at being the calm centre of a movie, often surrounded by flashier performers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/christianbale\">Christian Bale</a> smoking crack in The Fighter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jacknicholson\">Jack Nicholson</a> being Jack Nicholson in The Departed to that talking bear in Ted \u2013 and neither competing with them nor being overshadowed.</p> <p>\u201cI just do my thing,\u201d he says, most comfortable with self-deprecation when talking about his acting. But then he loosens up as he switches to producer mode (he produced, among others, The Fighter and Deepwater Horizon): \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the big picture, not my individual experience as an actor. I\u2019ve seen actors who are like: \u2018Oh God, this is my moment,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think it services the movie. You have to put the movie first.\u201d</p> <p>Largely, I suspect, for this reason, Wahlberg has a tendency to be overlooked by critics and accolades, which shine instead upon his co-stars. He was nominated for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i7tUNXSj7M\">supporting actor Oscar for The Departed</a>, but he was almost completely ignored for The Fighter, even though he\u2019d spent four years training as a boxer for the role; the awards instead went to his co-stars, Bale and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-leo\">Melissa Leo</a>. Does that not bug him?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I come from the real world and you\u2019re only as good as the people around you,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my philosophy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my background in sports, but I want the whole team to be good.\u201d</p> <p>It is partly this lack of look-at-me starriness that has helped him retain a relative kind of normality in the eyes of the public, and there is a loose, \u201chey-I\u2019m-just-a-guy\u201d attitude to him in person. Whereas fellow Massachusetts boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mattdamon\">Matt Damon</a> is covered in Hollywood glitter, Wahlberg \u2013 despite being a celebrity for far longer \u2013 still has a coating of grit.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I live in a big house, I drive a fancy car,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I still feel like I\u2019m gonna end up where I came from and as long as I can go there with my head held high and I\u2019m welcomed back with open arms, then I\u2019m OK.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9QoTyPDLuo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y9QoTyPDLuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click here to watch a trailer for Wahlburgers.</figcaption> </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything good happened when I started focusing on my faith. I sound like I\u2019m in the recruiting office, don\u2019t I?</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Wahlberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wahlberg, who grew up in the working-class area of Dorchester in Boston, is the youngest of nine siblings. If you want to see how close this family is then allow me to direct you to their rather extroardinary reality TV show called - what else? - Wahlburgers, which you almost certainly have never watched. Ostensibly made to promote the family\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wahlburgersrestaurant.com/\">restaurant franchise</a>, Wahlburgers, now in its sixth series, is a rather pleasing antidote to Keeping Up with the Kardashians because, with the exception of the shots of Wahlberg\u2019s LA house \u2013 which is, indeed, big and fancy \u2013 there is little here that\u2019s aspirational. Whereas the Kardashians go shopping on Rodeo Drive, the Wahlberg matriarch, Alma, hunts for bargain shoes at a store called <a href=\"http://www.frugalfannies.com/\">Frugal Fannies</a>. It is more than a little odd to see Wahlberg, an A-lister, on this shonky reality show, but, he says simply: \u201cIt was an opportunity for the family to spend time together.\u201d</p> <p>He talks about his childhood fondly, with his dad, a truck driver, taking him to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> movies on weekends. The full picture, however, was more complicated, to put it mildly. Wahlberg was suffering from drug addiction by the age of 13 and, while still a teenager, racially abused a group of black schoolchildren and beat a Vietnamese man with a stick. He also assaulted another Vietnamese man, punching him in the face. He pleaded guilty to assault and battery and served 45 days in prison. He sums up that period of his life as one in which \u201ca lot of things happened and I made a lot of mistakes. But you try to live in the moment and look to the future.\u201d</p> <p>The good thing that came out of it, he says, is that he connected with his Catholicism. \u201cEverybody goes to jail and gets on their hands and knees and says: \u2018Please God, if you get me out I promise I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 And of course, by the time you\u2019re out, you fall back into the same habits. But something just kept me wanting to go a little bit more into it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Catholicism is still a major part of his life. He has a daily prayer routine \u201cwhich I absolutely cannot miss\u201d and any movie shooting schedules must accommodate his weekly trip to mass. \u201cEverything good that has happened to me in my life, whether it\u2019s meeting my wife or the births of my children, happened when I started focusing on my faith,\u201d he says. He grins: \u201cI sound like I\u2019m in the recruiting office, don\u2019t I? Here, I\u2019ve got some brochures for you.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019d have to work hard to recruit a New York Jew, I say.</p> <p>\u201cJesus was a Jew,\u201d he replies with mock solemnity, enjoying switching from talking about himself to teasing banter. \u201cI got a lotta New York Jews with me on this trip.

Back in 1992 he posed, in full muscular glory, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlyUuCEEQUc\">Kate Moss for Calvin Klein</a> in one of the most celebrated campaigns of all time. Moss has since said she deeply regretted the shoot. \u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 17 or 18, when I had to go and work with Marky Mark,\u201d she <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/10/kate-moss-years-of-crying-johnny-depp\">told Vanity Fair in 2012</a>. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like me at all. I felt really bad about straddling this buff guy. I didn\u2019t like it. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for two weeks. I thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>Wahlberg was only 21 with no experience of the fashion world at the time. Did he feel similarly exploited?</p> <p>\u201cWell, for me it was different,\u201d he says. \u201cThe frustration that I felt was that when we talked about doing that, I was doing my music and they were like: \u2018OK, it will be about what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 but then it became just about [the image].</p> <p>\u201cBut you know, I still signed up for it, it was what it was and I think there were pros and cons. And Kate\u2019s had a good career,\u201d he concludes, which seems a tad dismissive of an 18-year-old\u2019s nervous breakdown, but, as Wahlberg says, he is not really one for introspection or reflection.</p> <p>There is a distinct smack of the guy\u2019s guy about Wahlberg, the one who still raves about his mother\u2019s bolognese and keeps his friends from home close. So close that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/17/mark-wahlberg-hustling-entire-life\">two of them are on this trip to London with him</a>. Does he always travel with his buddies? \u201cYeah! They may get fired for a short amount of time but they always come back. We\u2019re not the most professional group,\u201d Wahlberg says proudly. This part of his life was, of course, memorialised in the TV show and film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/21/entourage-film-review-hatefully-unfunny-jeremy-piven-hollywood-satire\">Entourage</a>, which he co-produced (\u201cYou take a swing and hope to hit a home run and sometimes you miss,\u201d is how he sums up the widely panned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/21/entourage-film-review-hatefully-unfunny-jeremy-piven-hollywood-satire\">film</a> version.) But is it difficult when your life is so different from those of your friends that you can fire them?</p> <p>\u201cDifficult?\u201d he repeats, baffled.</p> <p>Yes, isn\u2019t it awkward?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d he shoots back, a little grumpily.</p> <p>He pauses for a few seconds: \u201cNo. Look, I think, my real friends are certainly happy for the success I\u2019ve had. But I try to spread and share as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>On cue, one of his buddies comes back into the room with a salad and a drink for Wahlberg. Any remnants of Wahlberg\u2019s boredom and glumness are gone. Instead, he becomes downright larky.</p> <p>\u201cI have a major issue with adolescent behaviour with my friends,\u201d says the Hollywood mogul, punching his patiently smiling friend in the shoulder, and I realise I am basically in Entourage. And suddenly, Wahlberg surprises me by being so unsurprising.</p> <p><em>Deepwater Horizon is released in the UK on 30 September</em></p>",
  "<p>I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.

Labour is in the midst of the same crisis as its sister social-democratic parties across Europe, with one twist: as evidenced by all those new members, it is also home to the kind of new, insurgent politics we\u2019ve seen with Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, the Bernie Sanders campaign in the US etc. Time spent this week at Momentum\u2019s A World Transformed event in Liverpool reminded me that a great deal of Labour and the left\u2019s future lies with some of the people involved (I\u2019ve written a column about this, out later today), but a watershed moment is probably going to be a long time coming. </p> <p>As things stand, most of what we know takes the form of negatives: that the politics of New Labour are dead, that Labour is dangerously estranged from its old working class base, that the party is pretty much finished in Scotland. What happens next is unclear: my own belief is that it will have involve Labour embracing changing the voting system, creating a politics beyond work and the worker, and understanding that amassing a critical mass of support will involve other forces and parties. All this will take time.</p> <p>For now, maybe think about it like this. Jeremy Corbyn is not going to be the next prime minister. In an alternate reality, the same would apply to Owen Smith, Angela Eagle, David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, or any one else who might be mentioned as some kind of fantasy contender.

Encouragingly, these issues do seem to be being discussed. The Momentum conference fringe event was buzzing with energy and many speakers were tackling difficult topics such as automation and the possibility of a citizens income. Many politicians are also keen to explore similar themes, Jonathan Reynolds MP immediately springs to mind.</p> <p>The question is: how can this sort of radical thinking be combined with in-depth understanding of voter preferences and electoral strategy to come up with a plausible program for government?</p> <p>I think there is hope. Corbyn\u2019s conference speech was an attempt to reach out to his critics within Labour and many some to have responded in kind.

And who is now out of his depth.</p> <p>The Corbyn camp continues to do its best to paint the situation as a battle for the soul of the Labour Party, but the truth is much more prosaic. How many widespread MP rebellions have there been on policy issues? Have there been any? Instead the disquiet comes from Corbyn's perceived lack of leadership skills \u2013 that he has no coherent media policy, that shadow cabinet meetings are a shambles, that communication within the party is poor, that he lacks drive, that no one is really clear what they're supposed to be doing, and, worst of all, that there is a lack of solid, well-thought-through policy. </p> <p>Corbyn is great at preaching to the converted, but the converted aren't enough to win a general election.

They deserve what so many of them demand: hope, but not zeal.</p> <p>Yet Corbynism makes too much of its principles, too little of the practical politics they so despised in Blair and Brown.

  "<p>When Americans head to the polling stations and cast their votes on 8 November, they will be asked to decide which candidates for an array of posts \u2013 congressman, senator, judge, city counselor, mayor \u2013 we believe will serve us and represent our best interests. This year\u2019s presidential race presents an interesting question, however. Are we ready to vote for someone who is a professional businessman?</p> <p> On first hearing, that may sound appealing.

Someone used to doing deals \u2013 someone who insists that the organization they oversee functions smoothly and efficiently, not chaotically and wastefully.</p> <p> But as Monday night\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\">first presidential debate</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump reminded us, in electing the latter, we\u2019d be getting a businessman, but one who appears to possess a very distinct set of ideas about what being a businessman means and whose interests take priority. Perhaps what motivates Trump the businessman may not make him a wonderful president after all.</p> <p> The first hint came relatively early on in Monday\u2019s debate, when Clinton reminded the audience that Trump had been hoping for the housing market to collapse and that he had said in 2006 that he wished it would break down so that he could go and buy some properties and make some money.</p> <p> \u201cThat\u2019s called business, by the way,\u201d Trump interjected, defending himself.</p> <p> \u201cNine million people lost their jobs,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cFive million people lost their homes. And $13tn in family wealth was wiped out.\u201d </p> <p> What she left unsaid, and didn\u2019t need to say, was that that was the price of Trump\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d opportunity. Nor did Trump feel the need to defend himself from the implicit suggestion that he was indifferent to the connection between pain for the ordinary American citizen \u2013 pain that has amounted to a kind of national trauma that has contributed to his support \u2013 anywhere else in the evening. He left many viewers with a clear sense that \u201cbusiness is business\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54q33\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754975\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea1adfe4b0a785ec48bdc4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926wrap_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926wrap.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926wrap_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Indeed, late in the evening, he came right out and said as much. \u201cMy obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p> <p> Trump\u2019s order of priorities is clear.

An architect who designed a clubhouse at one of Trump\u2019s golf courses that Clinton said was immediately put into use? \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhich our country should do, too,\u201d he added, referring to the refusal to pay the amount owed for the work. </p> <p> Do we want a president who picks and chooses which bills to pay?</p> <p> Of course, for many of those watching the debate, the moment that the businessman-like approach by Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-lean-toward-clinton-among-one-group-of-undecided-north-carolina-voters/2016/09/27/ff271b2e-8469-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html?tid=hybrid_collaborative_3_na\">caused their jaws to drop</a> was during the discussion of his personal taxes. </p> <p> Trump has said repeatedly that he plans to break with a 40-year tradition of presidential candidates and won\u2019t release his tax returns while he\u2019s being audited.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54py9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754738\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9f924e4b0a785ec48bd68\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926taxes2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926taxes2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11903794&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\">Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Translation: unless he changes his mind, we won\u2019t be seeing those documents, with all the information they would provide about his actual income and its sources, his cash donations to charity (as opposed to simply donations of rounds of golf at his courses) and, of course, what percentage of his income actually is paid in taxes.</p> <p> Leaving those questions unanswered left Clinton free to speculate on Monday evening. Maybe, she wondered, Trump isn\u2019t as rich as he\u2019d like us to believe; maybe he isn\u2019t as charitable as he\u2019d like us to think he is. In both cases, there has been plenty of media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/trump-foundation-charity-settle-legal-disputes-reporting\">most recently about the Trump Foundation</a>. Or perhaps, Clinton suggested, he is trying to cover up the fact that he has paid almost nothing in federal income tax. </p> <p> \u201cIf he\u2019s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for health,\u201d she added.</p> <p> \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d said Trump, responding as businessman, and a goaded businessman. He went on to claim that \u201cI have a tremendous income.\u201d</p> <p> Later, Trump argued that a businessman like himself was needed to take the lead to solve the country\u2019s infrastructure problems, and he lamented the fact that the United States doesn\u2019t have the money it needs to tackle the challenge because past administrations have squandered the resources. Clinton responded immediately. Maybe, she suggested, the money wasn\u2019t there \u201cbecause you haven\u2019t paid any federal tax for a lot of years\u201d.</p> <p> While that was met with applause from the Hofstra University audience, Trump\u2019s answer was greeted only with an isolated gasp or two. Had he done so, he suggested, \u201cIt would [have been] squandered too, believe me.\u201d</p> <p> Trump didn\u2019t make a compelling case for electing a businessman as president come November \u2013 or at least not for electing this particular businessman, someone who seems to put a priority on serving himself rather than serving others, and enriching himself rather than sharing his riches. </p> <p> As CEO of the Trump Organization, The Donald could fire his employees and had no bosses. As CEO of the United States of America, he can\u2019t fire us; we\u2019re simultaneously his shareholders and his bosses. We\u2019d be hiring him, not vice versa. And it\u2019s about how he can serve us, not how well he can look out for his own interests. </p> <p> Does anything from Monday night\u2019s debate show that he has grasped that yet?</p>",

His contributions should give us serious pause. Is this how we want our republic to function? Do we want to live in a country where candidates can rise or fall based on their pocketbooks or the financial backing of their rich friends?</p> <p>Wealthy donors like Trump have donated the vast majority of campaign funds for both political parties in 2016. That should scare a lot of Americans. But there\u2019s one bright spot in the 2016 cycle that offers a path forward.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders\u2019 revolutionary campaign shocked the political establishment and demonstrated the immense power of movement politics, raising $232m from more than 8 million individual contributions. Nearly 3 million Americans coming together to support a progressive vision, donating $27 at a time, showed that a serious campaign could run on grassroots dollars alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado, Miss Universe weight-shamed by Trump, speaks out for Hillary Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those concerned about the undue influence of the ultra-wealthy in US. politics, Bernie\u2019s success offers a glimmer of hope that we might be able to halt the country\u2019s march toward plutocracy.</p> <p>Our campaign finance system encourages rich donors to pour billions of dollars into American elections. This cash flow threatens to disempower the electorate and corrupt our republic.</p> <p>When politicians like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney run traditional campaigns, they replace public-facing campaign stops with private affairs for large-scale donors. There\u2019s a loss here for both the candidates and voters. Candidates lose valuable perspective gained only from listening to the diversity of voices that represent the vast majority of Americans who are not in the upper echelons of the economy. Voters lose the opportunity to hear from politicians about their campaign platform and vision.</p> <p>Politicians are influenced by the company they keep. When constantly attending intimate gatherings with the United States\u2019 richest, they often adopt their perspectives and agendas. Candidates don\u2019t get to hear from those who can\u2019t afford to be in the room. They develop policies to protect the interests of their friends. </p> <p>After the election, the richest donors are the ones who receive the meetings and telephone calls. It\u2019s a form of simple payback. It means that our politicians are too often insulated from the opinions of the bottom 99% who can\u2019t afford to buy that time.</p> <p>What about running for office in the first place? Increasingly, that\u2019s a privilege only afforded to the wealthy as well. House of Representatives candidates must raise an average of more than $2,000 each and every day to run a winning campaign. The vast majority of Americans don\u2019t have access to that kind of capital which means they\u2019re often de facto excluded from our ruling bodies.</p> <p>Our rigged system leads us to plutocracy: a system of government controlled directly by the wealthy few that serves the interests of the wealthy few. In 2014, Princeton researchers concluded that the US has already lost its democratic roots and transitioned slowly into a form of oligarchy that caters to the preferences of elites.</p> <p>We need a political revolution in this country to fix what is broken, and I\u2019m grateful to Bernie for showing us the way forward. He raised a quarter of a billion dollars in a primary campaign with 94% of it coming in online. Now we should follow his example.</p>",
  "<p>A sweeping expansion of law enforcement\u2019s obligations to people who report their rape, which victims\u2019 advocates have hailed as groundbreaking,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>cleared a final hurdle in Congress late Wednesday evening and landed on the desk of Barack Obama, who is expected to sign.</p> <p>The bill, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/sexual-assault-survivors-rape-kits-us-senate-bill-white-house\">a 24-year-old survivor of sexual assault</a> and introduced in February, extends numerous rights to people whose rape kits are being stored and processed by federal law enforcement agencies. It includes a right to have a rape kit stored, without charge, until the statute of limitations expires, and a right to be notified in writing 60 days before a rape kit is destroyed.</p> <p>Rape victims also can request to have their kit preserved under the legislation. The bill prohibits law enforcement from charging victims for a forensic exam, and victims have the right to know any important details forensic testing reveals \u2013 such as whether they ingested a date rape drug.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn federal law, there has never been a basic set of rights for survivors of sexual assault,\u201d said Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is the bill\u2019s primary sponsor. \u201cI introduced the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Rights Act in the United States Senate [to] codify basic rights for survivors of sexual assault, and provide a model for similar reforms at the state level across our country.\u201d</p> <p>The bill is a rare bipartisan achievement in a Congress that has struggled to attain many others. A bitter partisan battle delayed the approval of $1.3bn to fight the Zika virus for several months, with members of Congress divided by a proposal to direct some of the money toward contraception through a sister organization of Planned Parenthood. And earlier in the month, Senate leaders signaled a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/senate-dysfunction-blocks-bipartisan-criminal-justice-overhaul.html?_r=0\">popular bill</a> to slash prison spending and reduce sentences for nonviolent offenders was likely dead. </p> <p>In stark contrast, the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Rights Act passed the Senate and House with uncharacteristic speed and without a single vote of dissent.<strong> </strong>Shaheen introduced the bill in February. In May, the Senate moved unanimously to attach the bill as a rider to a sex-offender registry reauthorization act. (Wednesday night\u2019s Senate vote resolved minor differences between the two bills.) The House voted unanimously on a nearly identical proposal on 6 September, with Republican speaker Paul Ryan making a personal appeal to his party. </p> <p>But the bill would not exist without Amanda Nguyen, a 24-year-old state department liaison to the White House and aspiring astronaut. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the most comprehensive rape survivors\u2019 bill ever in US history,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cThe fact that we got this done in seven months \u2026 It\u2019s amazing. All of our hard work really shows.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/sexual-assault-survivors-rape-kits-us-senate-bill-white-house\">Meet the 24-year-old who could change how the US handles sexual assaults</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nguyen has been agitating for the legislation ever since her own rape several years ago exposed her to a broken system. After submitting evidence to Massachusetts through a rape kit, Nguyen was told she had 15 years to decide whether to cooperate with criminal charges \u2013 but only six months before the state was allowed to destroy her kit. As a consequence, Nguyen spends several weeks each year scrambling to locate her rape kit so she can file an extension.</p> <p>Her ordeal \u2013 once, a police officer told her the kit was likely in police custody, only for a lab technician to confirm the kit was actually at a lab \u2013 caused her to wonder about the law in other states. Nguyen compiled a list of more than 20 rights that different states guarantee to someone who reports a sexual assault.</p> <p>Eventually, the list became the basis for the bill Obama is expected sign this week.</p> <p>Shaheen met Nguyen in July 2015. By that time, Nguyen had organized a loose network of volunteers \u2013 friends, acquaintances and advocates \u2013 who gathered online to workshop legal solutions and eventually drummed up support for a bill. The group, called Rise, has since persuaded lawmakers in Massachusetts, Oregon, California and Maryland to introduce similar legislation. </p> <p>In Massachusetts, the bill has drawn a broad coalition of support, including that of the former executive director of the state\u2019s innocence project. Virginia passed a similar law this year.</p> <p>Nguyen said she was nervous going into the House vote, the last substantive obstacle facing the bill. She stood in the US Capitol for the vote, her eyes fixed on the green ticker that logs members\u2019 votes. \u201cTo see the number just go up and up and up, and finally hit the two-thirds majority to pass, we were elated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then the number just kept going up. Nobody said no.\u201d<br></p> <p>Shaheen and Nguyen hope the bill will serve as a model for lawmakers at the state level, where the vast majority of rape kits are collected, tested, and stored. The bill that has just passed Congress, which Obama is expected to sign, only applies to sexual assault cases tried in federal courts, or crimes committed on tribal lands and federal lands, such as in national parks.</p> <p>Right now, the rights extended to victims vary wildly from state to state.</p> <p>Even states that offer extensive rights to people reporting rape, such as California, are missing key protections, such as the right to a copy of their police report. Other states lack almost any protections at all. When Nguyen compiled her state-by-state list, she found the only guarantee Kansas extended was a promise not to subject reported rape victims to a polygraph test. Utah\u2019s only promise was that the state would cover the cost of testing a rape kit.</p> <p>Not a single state requires law enforcement to retain rape kits until the statute of limitations expires.</p> <p>\u201cThe real fight is in the states,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re gearing up for. We\u2019re working with a slew of state lawmakers who have already reached out and are eager to introduce this bill. And every state can do better.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Heather, 48 \u2013 Austin, TX: \u2018Clinton will say anything to get power, Trump will just say anything\u2019</h2> <p>The reason I am undecided is because no candidate deserves my vote. </p> <p>I\u2019m a single mother of two, full-time employed, yet living paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m insulted that women think I\u2019m obligated to vote for Clinton because she\u2019s a woman, just as I bristled at Sarah Palin as a viable choice. </p> <p>I am frustrated by the lack of candid discussion about the real issues my family and I face. Instead we waste time on gender-neutral bathrooms and whether Trump is a rude man. I lived in New York for years. He\u2019s obnoxious like a lot of New Yorkers. She\u2019s smug and patronizing, implying that I, a female voter, should just trust that she knows what is best for me. </p> <p>Neither deserves my trust (Clinton because she\u2019ll say anything to get power, Trump because he\u2019ll just say anything) and I\u2019m thinking of abstaining. It\u2019s so depressing. There should be more quality options. </p> <p>Skipping election day is an awful example to my children (both teens), but I can\u2019t stomach either candidate.

According to the same quiz I agree over 90% with Clinton, but I can\u2019t bring myself to vote for her. I simply don\u2019t believe her. </p> <p>I believe her instincts are slanted towards conservatism. I believe she\u2019ll say anything to get elected. Deep down, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s liberal enough and in the end, she won\u2019t come through on what she promised. </p> <p>My indecision stems from living in Florida and knowing my vote is important. </p> <p>I hate Trump and his band of racist drones. He personifies everything that\u2019s wrong with America. If I vote for Stein that could ultimately mean victory for Trump. But then, is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?</p> <p>Is my vote a wasted one if I vote for Stein \u2013 or are progressive votes for Hillary the truly wasted ones?</p> <h2>Brexton, 19 \u2013 San Diego, CA: \u2018Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m undecided because I want to vote for a viable candidate but right now, I can\u2019t do that in good conscience. </p> <p>Climate change is far and away the number one issue and Jill Stein is obviously the best candidate to address that.

Every time I come to terms with voting for her despite her long and discouraging past, she does one more thing that\u2019s exactly opposite of what liberals and progressives want, like her choice for vice-president or her continual ignoring of the #1 issue, climate change.</p> <p>Everyone always says a vote for Stein is a vote for Trump and that if he gets elected it would be third-party voters\u2019 faults. I ask why is it not Hillary\u2019s fault for not taking the few steps necessary to earn our vote. Bernie did it, now Stein\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s not hard.</p> <p>Hillary needs to make climate change and the environment a focal point of her campaign. She needs to prove that she isn\u2019t still in the hands of big money. She has only been proving the opposite again and again. I want to vote for Hillary. I just need a reason to do so.</p> <h2>Kate, 51 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above\u2019</h2> <p>There is no one for whom I can vote with a clear conscience. <br></p> <p>To me, Hillary Clinton represents the establishment, and her election will, at best, bring four more years of government of Goldman, by Goldman, and for Goldman. Clinton is a vote for more of the same, a vote for the post-2008 status quo. Clinton is a vote for more wasted years. </p> <p>Trump, of course, isn\u2019t even remotely qualified to be president. Trump would be, I believe, a disaster, and we\u2019d finish up even worse off than we are today. Not to mention the racism, sexism and viciousness he\u2019s actively encouraged in his supporters, traits that would be amplified with his ascension to the White House. Trump is a vote for chaos. I won\u2019t vote for Trump.</p> <p>So, who\u2019s left? Jill Stein? No, too frivolous.</p> <p>Gary Johnson? No. </p> <p>I don\u2019t have a candidate in this race, but I feel like I have to vote because 2016 demands it. And it\u2019s so late in the cycle, now, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above. Most likely I\u2019ll vote for Bernie, writing his name next to \u201cOther\u201d with a bold, black sharpie. </p> <h2>Chris, 50 \u2013 New York, NY: \u2018Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve always leaned \u201cprogressive\u201d even when it wasn\u2019t in vogue. I identify loosely as a democratic socialist. So when Elizabeth Warren failed to run and Bernie Sanders picked up the mantle I was ecstatic. My enthusiasm grew the better Bernie did. I\u2019m very proud of him fighting for the $15 minimum wage, fighting for universal healthcare, making public universities free for students, putting a stop to fossil fuels, and taking climate change seriously. Perhaps most important of all, taking to task the one percenters and making them pay their fair share of taxes. Even though Bernie Sanders had difficulty connecting with the African American voter, his overall message resonated with me. It seemed quite clear that helping the economic working class would by default be helping African Americans and all minorities in this country.</p> <p>Unfortunately Bernie came up short. However, he did much better than <em>anyone</em> expected him to. One point of contention with Hillary Clinton is that she seems to take progressives and millennials for granted. Yes, she\u2019s absorbed some of Sanders\u2019 rhetoric and for that I\u2019m grateful, but there seems no conscious effort to capture the progressive zeitgeist that has captured the energy and passion of at least half the party. Also as an African American I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s policies to task. \u201cSuper-predator\u201d comments aside, they\u2019ve been incredibly damaging to African American families, from welfare to prison reform. I don\u2019t care about emails. </p> <p>Trump is a racist fascist so I can\u2019t vote for him. But Hillary comes across as untrustworthy, elitist where the rules don\u2019t apply and a insincere panderer.</p> <p>Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Clinton needs to come up with clear solutions to stop rampant police assassinations of black lives in this country. </p> <p>Maybe then she\u2019ll get my vote. Because I\u2019m liable to Just. Stay. Home.</p> <h2>Buck, 62 \u2013 Houston, TX: \u2018I want a government that does what a government should do, and nothing else\u2019</h2> <p>We live so far below our potential because most American voters are ignorant and apathetic about their government. And they vote for a person instead of an idea. I want a government that does what a government should do for its citizens, and does that fully and well, but nothing else.</p> <p>To me that is somewhere between Libertarian and the Green party. Libertarian in general but with futuristic education, healthcare, and welfare systems covering all citizens while proactively protecting our environment. We could afford that, and a fantastic national infrastructure too, if we got out of the war business, brought all our troops home, and stopped subsidizing everyone else\u2019s foreign wars that cost us trillions.</p> <p>Most of these conflicts revolve around whose imaginary friend is the best (religion), so there\u2019s nothing really being resolved by them anyway. The money we have wasted, and continue to waste on them could be put to much better use here, and we could really lead by example, but neither the Dems or GOP are \u2013 they\u2019re still just talking.</p> <h2>Bo, 22 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019</h2> <p>I am afraid of voting for someone I genuinely support \u2013 Jill Stein. She is woefully underrepresented in the media, and there is endless fear-mongering to dissuade anyone from expressing interest in third-party candidates. Our votes get dubbed \u201cwasted\u201d or \u201cspoiler\u201d votes. </p> <p>I am at a loss. People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do. No other candidate addresses the enslavement of millennials (via student debt) and the debilitating social conditions of everyday life (racism, corporate domination, low-income wage slavery, police brutality, a world of total-work, inadequate healthcare, etc) as comprehensively as Stein. Her emergency Green New Deal is just about the only thing that gives me hope for any kind of future.</p> <h2>Julian, 40 \u2013 China, TX: \u2018I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein\u2019</h2> <p>Here\u2019s the dilemma \u2013 I don\u2019t live in a swing state and due to the electoral college, my presidential vote is basically meaningless when it comes to casting for a Democrat or Republican. It might be hard to understand, especially to outsiders, but I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. It\u2019s not because I prefer Johnson, but because the vote would have greater visibility than Stein.</p> <p>Being the two major party candidates are so incredibly disliked, I felt that for the first time, alternate parties could finally break through to the mainstream and end the two-party system that has been so disastrous for the nation; both major parties put the interests of the power elites and Wall Street above the rest of the country.</p> <p>I was very enthusiastic about Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. Despite his history of calling third-party candidates spoilers for the presidential races, I really hoped he would join the Green ticket if he lost the Democratic nomination as Stein offered, or at least endorse her. I think his campaign did massive damage to a huge number of his younger followers in regards to future voter participation by endorsing Clinton. He had the perfect opportunity to break up the Democratic party if he\u2019d only fought on after he lost the nomination.</p> <p>If Bernie advocated for the Green party, far more aligned with his policies and mine than the Democrats, then I would vote for the Green party candidate this year.</p> <h2>Olivia, 27 \u2013 San Antonio, TX: \u2018Hillary, show me that you are not a \u2018My way or the highway\u2019 candidate</h2> <p>I\u2019m a millennial allied to no specific party. Both candidates seem determined to alienate \u2013 even demonize \u2013 moderate and independent voters like myself.</p> <p>Future Madame or Mr President, here are my terms:</p> <p>Donald, prove to me that you are not eager to incite a war with our neighbors, or relive the mistakes of Hoover\u2019s isolationist policies which led up to World War II.</p> <p>Hillary, show me that you are not a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d candidate, as some of your virulent advocates make you appear. Demonstrate that those who do not share all your views on a specific topic such as gun control will nevertheless be respected as equals.</p> <p>Donald, prove that you and your physically violent advocates will not spawn violent, racially charged chaos across the country and world.</p> <p>Donald and Hillary, both of you repeatedly demonstrated a shocking disdain for the integrity and even sacred role of the freedom of the press. Prove to me that you will entrust journalists with truth, and not \u201cspin\u201d. The day independent journalists are encouraged, even empowered, to question your authority is the day I may trust you. </p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s energy agenda \u2013 which includes pledges of \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d, making coal great again and ditching the Paris climate deal \u2013 is drawing bipartisan fire from industry analysts, former members of Congress, and even one coal mogul.<br></p> <p>All of them, to varying degrees, fault the billionaire\u2019s basic premises and call his promises farfetched and at times contradictory. <br></p> <p>They say the Republican presidential candidate uses faulty math to tout his vision of America\u2019s energy independence, fails to understand energy economics in his pledge to revive the coal industry, and is peddling a big myth by claiming that global warming is a hoax.</p> <p>Some energy analysts also observe that Trump\u2019s energy prescriptions, including big regulatory cutbacks that have long been industry wishes, are politically expedient and unrealistic. In making his promise to \u201csave the coal industry\u201d, for instance, Trump has backed slashing environmental rules, taking that message to West Virginia earlier this year, when he pledged that the state\u2019s miners, as well as those in Ohio and Pennsylvania, \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2c55cd2496a14bdd98bcf84ccdb34810/ap-fact-check-bringing-coal-jobs-back-appalachia\">are going to start to work again, believe me</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at Brookings for energy security and climate issues, told the Guardian that \u201ccoal jobs aren\u2019t coming back and for Mr Trump to say they\u2019re coming back is erroneous and fanciful\u201d. Noting that cheap natural gas has been the primary driver behind years of decline for the coal industry, Ebinger added that Trump seems to be \u201cpandering to coal miners\u201d.</p> <p>Other analysts concur. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s promise to revive the US coal sector can only be realized by reining in hydraulic fracking,\u201d said Jerry Taylor, the president of libertarian thinktank the Niskanen Center. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because low-cost natural gas (courtesy of fracking) has done far more to shut down coal-fired power plants and, correspondingly, reduce demand for US coal than has EPA regulations. Given that he promises exactly the opposite \u2013 moving heaven and earth to increase US natural gas production \u2013 Trump\u2019s promises are empty.\u201d</p> <p>Even Trump backer and coal mogul Bob Murray, who runs Murray Energy, which has given $100,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac, says that the coal industry won\u2019t ever be great again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a thriving industry ever again,\u201d Murray told an energy publication this year. \u201cThe coal mines cannot come back to where they were or anywhere near it.\u201d </p> <p>Likewise, Trump used dubious data when he spoke at an energy event in May in North Dakota arranged by fracking billionaire Harold Hamm, a key Trump policy adviser who has been mentioned as a possible energy secretary and recently hosted a big campaign fundraiser.</p> <p>Echoing some of Hamm\u2019s priorities, Trump pledged to lift moratoriums on energy production in federal areas, to revoke policies that limit new drilling technologies and to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement.</p> <p>Trump also promised \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d, a bullish commitment since about a quarter of US energy needs are met by imports, and one that relied on flawed projections of proven oil reserves. Trump stated that the US had 1.5 times the oil of all Opec countries combined. But at the end of 2014, the US had proven reserves of just under 40bn barrels, while Saudi Arabia alone had proven reserves of 268bn barrels.</p> <p>Similarly, Trump claimed that constructing the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 which, unlike Hillary Clinton, he backs \u2013 would create and support 42,000 jobs. But industry projections suggest that building the pipeline would yield about 6,000 jobs directly, and another 7,000 jobs indirectly.</p> <p>Ex-Conoco Phillips lobbyist Don Duncan compared Trump\u2019s energy proposals to those of an \u201cold snake oil salesman\u201d, saying: \u201cTrump\u2019s energy cures are based on a lot of numbers that clash with energy industry data and scientific studies.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s penchant for ignoring facts and hard evidence is also underscored by his attacks on global warming and the Paris accords.</p> <p>Trump famously <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">tweeted</a> in 2012 that the \u201cconcept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing less competitive\u201d. Taylor called this \u201crisible\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cNot one scintilla of evidence exists to back the charge up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of his willingness to say anything at all \u2013 no matter how ridiculous or dishonest \u2013 to justify the know-nothingism of his base.\u201d</p> <p>Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">denied</a> during Monday\u2019s presidential debate having said such a thing, but in a speech last December he referred to global warming as a \u201choax\u201d three times in one sentence. </p> <p>Former US congressman Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who runs a group promoting free enterprise climate change ideas, said Trump\u2019s global warming views were dangerous. \u201cPeople who presume to be leaders by offering false hope and inflaming passions are disqualifying themselves for leadership.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Police equipped with body-worn cameras receive 93% fewer complaints from the public, according to a new study that suggests the technology helps to cool down potentially volatile encounters. </p> <p>Academics at Cambridge University, whose research looked at nearly 1.5m beat hours across more than 4,000 shifts by officers in the UK and California, claim their findings suggest the cameras herald a \u201cprofound sea change in modern policing\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/sir-bernard-hogan-howe-to-retire-as-met-police-commissioner\">Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to retire as Met police commissioner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lead author Dr Barak Ariel, from Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Criminology, said: \u201cThe cameras create an equilibrium between the account of the officer and the account of the suspect about the same event \u2013 increasing accountability on both sides.\u201d</p> <p>Body-worn cameras have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/03/met-police-to-issue-body-cameras-to-majority-of-officers-by-next-year\">increasingly used</a> in both Britain and the US in recent years in response to a perceived crisis in police legitimacy and disproportionate targeting of ethnic minorities. </p> <p>A report last year called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jul/02/stop-and-search-police-body-cameras-london-report\">London\u2019s Metropolitan police to use cameras during all stop and searches</a>, amid persistent complaints that the force disproportionately targets young black men. In the US, the epidemic of police shootings of black people has raised similar concerns. </p> <p>The Cambridge study, conducted during 2014-15 across seven trial sites that covered a population of more than 2 million people, set out to investigate the difference made by the cameras, which are usually attached to the top half of police uniforms. </p> <p>Throughout the year-long experiment, researchers were said to have randomly assigned about half of the officers starting their shifts with cameras. All officers in the forces taking part worked with cameras at some point, the researchers said. </p> <p>During the 12 months before the study, a total of 1,539 complaints were lodged against police in the areas examined, amounting to 1.2 complaints per officer. By the end, the number of complaints had fallen to 133 for the year across all sites \u2013 0.08 per officer.</p> <p>The researchers were surprised to find that there was no statistically significant difference between the number of complaints received by officers wearing cameras and those without, a result they said may be a result of \u201ccontagious accountability\u201d.</p> <p>Co-author Dr Alex Sutherland, of Rand Europe, said: \u201cIt may be that, by repeated exposure to the surveillance of the cameras, officers changed their reactive behaviour on the streets \u2013 changes that proved more effective and so stuck.</p> <p>\u201cWith a complaints reduction of nearly 100% across the board, we find it difficult to consider alternatives, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>The findings come with an important caveat, which is that the behaviour changes appeared to rely on cameras recording throughout encounters with the public, and officers explicitly warning that they were on, the researchers said. </p> <p>Early findings from the study, published earlier this year, suggested that violence actually increased if a camera was switched on in the middle of an interaction, a move that could be interpreted by both sides as an escalation. </p> <p>Ariel said that verbal reminders that encounters were being filmed encouraged participants \u201cto think about their actions more consciously. This might mean that officers begin encounters with more awareness of rules of conduct, and members of the public are less inclined to respond aggressively.\u201d </p> <p>The study\u2019s findings are <a href=\"http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/09/21/0093854816668218.full\">published in the journal Criminal Justice and Behaviour</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Until about nine months ago, leaving the European Union was not something that sensible British politicians talked about. They hadn\u2019t, really, since the country entered the bloc in 1973, the year that Theresa May sat her O-levels. In the intervening 43 years, as the EEC became the EU; and Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair came and went; and the Channel Tunnel was dug; and the borders spread to the east; and the euro was launched, and then foundered; our relationship with Brussels seemed, more or less, to embody a settled ambivalence towards the European continent that most British people instinctively recognised as their own. Close, but separate. In, but not integrated. Related, but not the same. We did not learn French.</p> <p>And then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">17 million people voted to leave</a>. Everyone has their own explanation for why. Not all of them make sense. I found out the other day that my wife\u2019s uncle voted for Brexit because his son is training to be a doctor, and doesn\u2019t like Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for remain. Victory, as they say, has many fathers. Since 23 June, a great many things have been blamed \u2013 or thanked, depending on your view \u2013 for convincing the population that staying within the European Union was hurting us. Their names are more than familiar now. Nigel Farage. Globalisation. The rightwing press. The left behind. Professional politicians. Absent politicians. The financial crisis. Boris. Migrants. Project Fear. Sunderland. In their own way, and over time, these things helped create the feeling that we were trapped in something so defective, so inimical to our interests, that our best hope was to climb through a high window, and out.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t get to Brexit without someone dreaming up the window \u2013 the remedy of leaving \u2013 in the first place. And during those long years inside the European project, that was the work of the right wing of the Conservative party. To be specific, a small, somewhat esoteric part of that wing: a flash of feathers, almost,<strong> </strong>a sect of true Eurosceptic believers who dreamed and schemed for this moment for the last 25 years. Most worked for little else, with no reward, and with no sign that they would ever prevail. \u201cLike the monks on Iona,\u201d as one of their former parliamentary researchers told me, \u201cilluminating their manuscripts and waiting for the Dark Ages to come to an end.\u201d</p> <p>And no one in that group worked with more devotion than Daniel Hannan, a Conservative member of the European parliament for south-east England. Hannan, who is 45, is by no ordinary measure a front-rank British politician. He has never been an MP, or a minister, or a mayor. Instead, since the age of 19, he has fought for what he calls British independence \u2013 fomenting, protesting, strategising, undermining, writing books, writing speeches and then delivering them without notes. For the last 17 years, Hannan, a spry, fastidious figure, who likes to read Shakespeare once a week, has done this mainly from the other side of the English Channel. He knows what it is to toil for a lost cause. \u201cHere I am, Ishmael,\u201d he told me recently, in his office at the European parliament in Strasbourg, invoking the Old Testament as he gestured around him. \u201cEvery man\u2019s hand is against me.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan may have contributed more to the ideas, arguments and tactics of Euroscepticism than any other individual. It was Hannan, in 2012, who asked Matthew Elliott, the founder of the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, to set up the embryonic campaign group that later became Vote Leave. Elliott, who is 38, describes Hannan as the pamphleteer who made Brexit seem like a reasonable proposition for millions of people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who has done more on this,\u201d he told me. Others laboured too, of course, and Elliott cited veteran Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, who spent decades attacking the constitutional and economic aspects of the EU \u2013 \u201cbut Dan is the only person who has successfully created a whole worldview,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also then done better than anyone else to be the propagandist for it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hannan\u2019s signature case against EU membership is an upbeat argument of direct democracy and free-market capitalism. He sidesteps questions about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving by insisting there will be none. Elliott was an intern when he first heard Hannan speak in Westminster almost 20 years ago. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, was convinced by Hannan that Britain should pull out, in the autumn of 1993. \u201cWhen I heard Boris Johnson and all those others making those brilliant points they made,\u201d Carswell told me recently, \u201cI thought, \u2018Compare it to making a film: these guys on the silver screen are brilliant. But the script is written by Hannan, and this is largely a Hannan production.\u2019\u201d Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who helped persuade David Cameron to allow his cabinet to campaign freely during the vote, was \u201cradicalised\u201d, in her phrase, by Hannan during her time as an MEP. \u201cOn the morning of 24 June, I texted Dan congratulating him on changing the course of European history.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, Hannan is not a household name. He didn\u2019t break out during the campaign. Fellow Brexiteers told me there were prosaic reasons for this. \u201cThe broadcasters had their own hierarchy for their own reasons,\u201d said Michael Gove. \u201cThey took the view that some people were box-office and some people weren\u2019t.\u201d Besides, to allies and enemies alike, Hannan\u2019s role has never been on centre stage. Trying to characterise his contribution to Brexit, many people I spoke to likened him to dogmatic intellectuals from the past who came first and prepared the way. Admirers mentioned Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose writings catalysed the American Revolution. Opponents compared Hannan to Trotsky. \u201cYou have got to have hard arses,\u201d the Marquess of Salisbury, a long-term Eurosceptic and Hannan supporter, told me, \u201cwho are morally courageous, who consistently make the arguments, who don\u2019t mind being unfashionable.\u201d<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his own way, he is an idiot savant.

The final weeks of the Vote Leave campaign, with its focus on immigration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">posters about Turkey joining the EU,</a> were like nothing out of a sonorous Hannan speech. (His own 217-page book, Why Vote Leave, contains a single sentence on immigration, and Hannan supports Turkish membership of the bloc, in principle.) In the eyes of Ukip, the narrow, Hannanite case for Brexit \u2013 mostly about deregulation and sovereignty \u2013 was a sideshow next to the real event: a chorus of economic and cultural discontent. \u201cIn his own way, he is an idiot savant,\u201d said Gawain Towler, Nigel Farage\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSo locked up in his world that he can\u2019t see what is on the end of his well-formed aquiline nose.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan himself is almost impossible to pin down on these questions. He is agile and skilful when he talks \u2013 like a star witness with absolutely nothing to hide \u2013 and during several conversations this summer, he showed no anxiety at all about the manner of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, or the scale of the diplomatic and economic challenges facing the country. Whenever he could, Hannan would muse on the fair-mindedness and natural intelligence of the British people, and spar with the ideas of his many opponents. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/775996023873429504\">If you\u2019re told that \u2018Brexit was all about immigration,\u2019 you can be almost certain that you\u2019re talking to a Remain voter,</a>\u201d ran a sample, recent tweet.</p> <p>For the rest of us, the patience and ruthlessness of the long-term leavers \u2013 a tiny band, fiddling at the political margins for a quarter of a century \u2013 will always be a breathtaking thing. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge of the nerd,\u201d one current cabinet minister, who voted remain, told me. \u201cI was in awe of it.\u201d But he observed that in all the years of plotting, there had been scant planning for the part that comes next, and no guarantee the agitation will now stop. \u201cNone of these people are builders, they are destroyers,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThey are frightening people. They are like arsonists.\u201d If Hannan has ever felt a moment of fear, or doubt, about his life\u2019s work, you suspect that he will never admit it, even to himself. His term as an MEP runs out in 2019, and he plans to leave politics after that \u2013 the work of a singular, premeditated career complete. \u201cMission accomplie,\u201d Hannan quipped to me, on two separate occasions. \u201cAs we like to say in Brussels.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40e3623ac582e6143c798af55787e54198e6e3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40e3623ac582e6143c798af55787e54198e6e3c5/0_94_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerard Cerles/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Once Britain became part of the European<strong> </strong>Economic Community, the idea of leaving it went away. A few old-stagers from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/05/referendum-eec-europe-1975\">1975 referendum on membership</a> fought on \u2013 isolated high Tories and leftwingers, like soldiers left behind in the woods \u2013 but the cause was dead. The European project meant cheaper prices in the shops, and its force was unarguable. That began to change in the twilight of the cold war. In 1988, from the great medieval Belfry of Bruges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Margaret Thatcher decried a European superstate</a> on the horizon, with a character and goals that were different from her own. \u201cWe have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level,\u201d she said. The \u201cBruges speech\u201d established a new form of Euroscepticism. It saw a parallel between the disintegrating, clapped-out USSR and the folly of a new federal entity, designed in Brussels. It loved America, and Nato. It wanted a world of liberal nation states. Thatcher was in office to see the Berlin Wall come down. But then, like a confusing, bad dream for her most loyal supporters, she fell, and the Maastricht treaty materialised, with its portents of the euro, political integration and everything that she had warned against.</p> <p>Hannan was part of a particular generation of young Conservatives deeply marked by these events. He was in his first term at Oxford, studying history at Oriel, when Thatcher resigned on 23 November 1990. Twenty-three days later, John Major approved an early draft of Maastricht. The sense of a mighty mistake being made has never left Hannan. By the end of term, he had founded a university society, the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain, at the Queen\u2019s Lane cafe on Oxford High Street.</p> <p>\u201cI remember swearing what the old adventure stories would call a terrible oath to do something,\u201d he told me. Hannan had spent the summer travelling through the fragmenting societies of communist eastern Europe. He had seen crowds demanding the return of national borders, languages and flags. His CIB co-founders were another history student, called James Ross, who is now a composer, and Mark Reckless, the former Conservative and then Ukip MP. Hannan and Reckless had been to Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, together. They bumped into each other that summer in Budapest.</p> <p>The CIB came to dominate conservative student politics at Oxford at a time of acute ideological anxiety. Nicky Griffiths, later Morgan, the former education secretary, was a member. \u201cThere were all these countries and societies and economies up for grabs,\u201d she said. Most students were all over the place, figuring out what they believed in, but not Hannan. \u201cHe was clearly the leader,\u201d said Mark Littlewood, the current director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market thinktank. Littlewood was pro-Maastricht and frequently found himself up against the dapper star of the CIB in debates at the Oxford Union. \u201cNightmare,\u201d he told me. Handkerchief in his top pocket, Hannan wiped the floor with all comers, despite having a slightly odd, otherworldly quality. \u201cI mean this in the fondest possible way,\u201d said Littlewood, \u201cyou could almost think, this is someone from a slightly previous age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d/0_353_2731_3413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher deliver her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 19xx.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher delivers her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 1988 in which she warned against a European superstate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was, in a way. The only child of ageing parents, Hannan was born in Lima, Peru in 1971. He was raised on a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo, not far from the capital. The Hannans, who had come from Lancashire to Latin America after the first world war, were part of a once-prosperous British expat community in the country. But the nation of Hannan\u2019s childhood was destabilised by coups and anticolonial feeling. One of his early memories is of his father, Hugh, frail with illness, facing down a mob who had come to seize the estate.</p> <p>Hannan boarded in the Cotswolds from the age of eight.<strong> </strong>Britain in 1979 was a revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand these adults saying England is finished, going to the dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in Peru spoke like that.\u201d Ever since, friends and foes have remarked on the power of Hannan\u2019s learnt patriotism. Roger Scruton, the conservative writer and philosopher,<strong> </strong>first met Hannan when he gave a seminar to sixth-formers at Marlborough. \u201cThe expat mentality is belonging to the old country,\u201d Scruton told me, \u201cand the inability to accept that it is changed beyond repair.\u201d</p> <p>At Oxford, Hannan\u2019s screeds on Maastricht quoted Aristotle, Shakespeare and William Pitt the Younger. But he also had an eye for a stunt. Conservative ministers visiting the CIB were ambushed and photographed with anti-EU T-shirts, while Hannan\u2019s speeches \u2013 as his writings are now \u2013 were littered with arch, aphoristic observations. Lord Salisbury was able to run the British empire with 52 civil servants. King\u2019s College, Cambridge, has produced more Nobel prize winners than France. The world\u2019s oldest parliaments all hail from small islands. Goldman Sachs wants you to vote remain. \u201cA Hannan soundbite does stick with you,\u201d said Littlewood. \u201cHe does make you think.\u201d</p> <p>The Eurosceptic heroes of the time were the 22 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the Maastricht bill in May 1992, almost bringing down the government. The following spring, as he was about to graduate, Hannan wrote to them and offered himself as their researcher. Around a dozen agreed to form the European Research Group (ERG), with Hannan as its secretary.</p> <p>In Westminster, the ERG was part of a lattice of energetic, new anti-EU organisations, such as Patrick Robertson\u2019s Bruges Group, and Bill Cash\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.europeanfoundation.org/\">European Foundation</a>. Hannan joined the young activists who staffed the offices and wrote the pamphlets. He and Reckless, who was then working as an economist at SG Warburg investment bank, shared a flat above the John Snow pub in Soho. They hung a huge Union Jack over the fire escape, threw parties and believed they were on to something much bigger and more alive than keeping a fading government in power. \u201cDon\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking Dan was a young fogey,\u201d said Douglas Carswell, who met Hannan while he was on work experience in the Commons that year. \u201cThis was a radicalised streak of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>The job of the ERG was to keep the European debate alive, and to make contact with like-minded campaigners across the continent. But Hannan and his group also consciously sought to bend the Conservative party to their thinking. \u201cFor us the EU was the litmus test for the generation above us,\u201d Reckless told me. After the defeat to Labour in 1997, they attached themselves to Michael Howard as the most Eurosceptic candidate to lead the Conservatives. Gove, who was writing for the Times, remembers meeting Hannan, who was supplying lines and jokes for Howard to use in the House of Commons, that summer. \u201cHe was very, very clear-minded and clear-sighted,\u201d Gove told me. \u201cSome people find certainty attractive. Other people find it unsettling.\u201d Hannan was 24 years old.</p> <p>For all its fervour, though, Euroscepticism in the late 1990s could not have been more unfashionable. New Labour was ascendant, and openly intent on deeper integration with the EU. In the summer of 1998, Tony Blair praised the incoming single currency and the prospect of Britain adopting the euro became the next line of battle in the European debate. The ERG published a paper, The Euro: bad for business, written by Reckless, and Hannan organised two conferences on the subject before helping to establish Business for Sterling, a single-issue pressure group to fight what was, at the time, a widely expected referendum.</p> <p>Largely forgotten now, Business for Sterling set the template, and included some of the key personnel, for the 2016 leave campaign. (Vote Leave\u2019s initial vehicle, Business for Britain, was named in homage.) Although the group was chaired by Tory rebels and right-leaning grandees \u2013 led by Rodney Leach, a merchant banker, who later became a lord; Rupert Hambro, of Hambros Bank, and the Marquess of Salisbury \u2013 it was outwardly cross-party and apolitical. \u201cBusiness for Sterling were the first campaign to sort of bring those concerns out of the political margins and into the real mainstream,\u201d Theresa Villiers told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/72_0_3474_4342/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Herbert, who had run the Countryside Alliance, was in charge. (This year, Herbert, who is now an MP, led the Conservative campaign for remain.) He hired a brilliant young campaign director, a former investment analyst, whose last job had been in Russia, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\">Dominic Cummings</a>. Hannan was by now flitting back and forth between the ERG and his job writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph. He thought about how to frame the European question for a national audience. \u201cThis was when I started realising how much the mechanics of a campaign matter,\u201d he told me. \u201cSimply by talking about keeping the pound rather than opposing the euro, we added 15 points.\u201d</p> <p>Business for Sterling recruited Bob Geldof, Vic Reeves and thousands of students to its cause. It helped keep opinion polls set against joining the Euro and deterred the new Labour government, and its pro-European allies in the City, at their moment of peak of popular influence. Hannan and Cummings and the rest of the new crowd \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 came away with their first victory scars against the establishment. \u201cWe did feel that bonding that comes from a ridiculed minority,\u201d said Hannan.</p> <p>Eighteen years later, many of Business for Sterling\u2019s funders and supporters gathered to the flag again. Villiers was one of many long-term Eurosceptic campaigners who realised that, although they were underdogs, they had fought a version of this battle before. \u201cIt is funny,\u201d she told me. \u201cAlmost at every point I assumed remain would win. But it certainly did occur to me the disadvantage they had was they had been thinking about this referendum for possibly a year. Whereas people like Dan, it has been their life\u2019s work. The whole of their adult working life had been building to this moment.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Business for Sterling succeeded because it found language and symbols \u2013 the Queen\u2019s head on a fiver \u2013 that touched the nerves of millions of people.<strong> </strong>Pulling out of the EU was a different ball game. There was no word for Brexit in the 1990s. Even Eurosceptic MPs didn\u2019t mention it as an option. The language of choice for Tory rebels was of \u201creform\u201d; \u201cfundamental reform\u201d if they were feeling brave. \u201cWhatever weasel words,\u201d Reckless told me. \u201cDan and I were always clear that our objective was leaving the EU, and that was what we were working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan was one of the first elected British politicians to suggest the idea publicly. In the spring of 1998, believing a referendum on the euro was imminent, he began to look for a seat in the European parliament. Tory MEPs were among the most ardent pro-Europeans in the party, and it seemed like a logical, if audacious, place to take the fight. Hannan\u2019s age \u2013 he was now 26 \u2013 and his polished,<strong> </strong>bracing stump speech marked him out from the other candidates. \u201cI was saying we should take powers back and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to come out if we can\u2019t,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Conservative party activists loved it, but Hannan\u2019s bold language alarmed party headquarters. <strong>\u201c</strong>I was told that he was a fanatic,\u201d said Edward McMillan-Scott, the leader of the Tory bloc of MEPs at the time. McMillan-Scott tried to sabotage Hannan\u2019s campaign, and the young candidate was questioned furiously at an open primary at the London Arena in May. But the ploy backfired. Hannan delighted the crowd again, and the following summer, he was elected to the European parliament as a Conservative candidate for the south-east.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams. We are realistic. There is something in his life that affected him</p> <footer> <cite>Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once inside the heart of the EU, Hannan set about discrediting it. A former researcher in his office told me that duties were divided between responding to constituents and \u201cthe more naughty stuff\u201d of seeking out waste and hypocrisy in Brussels for Hannan\u2019s column in the Sunday Telegraph. Hannan fell out with most of his Conservative party colleagues when he wrote about the expenses they were able to claim,<strong> </strong>but he did not relent. \u201cI was building a campaign to delegitimise the institution,\u201d he said. In the plenary chamber, Hannan used his allotted speaking time to rail against the statist, Bonapartist European project. Fellow MEPs, particularly from abroad, listened to Hannan\u2019s ornate rhetoric in bewilderment and dismay. \u201cThe Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams to go back to. We are realistic,\u201d Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White, an MEP from Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular, told me. \u201cThere is something in his life that probably affected him.\u201d</p> <p>From day one in Brussels, Hannan also sought to bring the Tories out of their moderate grouping, the European People\u2019s party, or EPP, and to ally them with more critical, anti-EU voices in the European parliament. Since 1979, the party had sat alongside fellow centre-right parties from countries such as Germany and Spain. But hardline Eurosceptics believed that this meant that Tory MEPs absorbed the meeker, pro-European tendencies of their continental colleagues. At first Hannan simply sat alone. But after six years of hectoring and arguing, and as new, Eurosceptic Conservative candidates were elected, he moved the entire bloc to his position. In 2005, Hannan extracted a promise from David Cameron \u2013 then a leadership contender \u2013 that the Tories would leave the EPP. In 2009, they did. (McMillan-Scott was driven out of the party.)</p> <p>Concentrating on arcane goals such as breaking up the EPP was a telltale move of the hardcore Eurosceptics. Another inch gained. Another bolt loosened. \u201cOur goal in politics should not be to get the right people in,\u201d Hannan told me once, paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the American free-market economist. \u201cIt should be to set the incentives so that even the wrong people will do the right things.\u201d But behaving like this, and working to another order of events, separated Hannan and the other Maastricht diehards \u2013 even from fellow Tories who might otherwise agree with them. \u201cThe view at the centre was these were the people who had kept the Conservative party out of power for years,\u201d said Gove. \u201cWhatever they are most passionately in favour of must perforce be at best eccentric, at worst electoral disaster.\u201d</p> <p>One new MP in 2005 remembered being lobbied to support the move out of the EPP and asking an older colleague for advice. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just cannot. It looks good. But you cannot give an inch to these guys because they will never, ever accept it. They will take and take and take until they have won.\u2019\u201d Several Conservative MPs I spoke to for this article compared Hannan and his set to \u201centryists\u201d and \u201cTrots\u201d for their ideological purity, their quest to reassert what they regard as Britain\u2019s lost place in the world. \u201cThey are grammar-school imperialists,\u201d one MP told me. \u201cA hundred years ago Hannan and his ilk would have been able to vent their rather bizarre beliefs bullying people in a nether-province of India.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan says such insults have never bothered him. \u201cIt passes by as the idle wind that I respect not,\u201d he said. He simply regards himself as a different kind of a politician. \u201cI think public life for me has a slightly didactic role, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be trying to shift the centre ground of public opinion.\u201d Since becoming an MEP, Hannan has written six books, from polemics, such as The New Road to Serfdom, a critique of America\u2019s \u201cEuropean\u201d drift under President Obama; to historical homilies such as How We Invented Freedom &amp; Why It Matters, a 400-page exploration of the genius of English liberty, tracing its origins back to Anglo-Saxon witans and the Magna Carta.</p> <p>Operating apart, however, means that Hannan can sound alarmingly unlike most other British politicians. How We Invented Freedom includes a long extract from a speech made by Enoch Powell on St George\u2019s Day, 1961. Another devout Eurosceptic, Powell eulogised the English language that day as \u201ctuned already to songs that haunt the hearer like the sadness of spring\u201d. The one-time health minister is now remembered for his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech of 1968, but Hannan frequently cites Powell as the model of the opinion-forming politician he would like to be, describing him, when we spoke, as the \u201csupreme exemplar of that in his generation\u201d.</p> <p>For years, within the Tory party, Hannan was also notorious for helping to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/04/conservatives.speeches\">William Hague\u2019s so-called \u201cforeign land\u201d speech </a>in 2001. The speech\u2019s attacks on Europe and tough line on asylum seekers were perceived as racist, and it is still regarded as a nadir in the party\u2019s recent political messaging. But when we talked about the speech this summer, Hannan said: \u201cThere is sort of a hobbit-like element to a lot of British people. They don\u2019t want to be told something until they have worked it out for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Still, there were times when the road seemed so long, and so hard, that Hannan despaired. In 2005, the EU seemed to defy referendums in both France and the Netherlands, where voters rejected a new constitution for the bloc, by repackaging the proposed reforms and forcing them through under a new name: the Lisbon treaty. Hannan wondered whether the whole project was in fact unstoppable. \u201cThey\u2019ll do it all by stealth,\u201d he thought, \u201cand they will get to where they want to go.\u201d<strong> </strong>Cameron\u2019s new-look party was determined \u201cto stop banging on about Europe\u201d and Hannan came close to joining Ukip. In 2007 and 2008, he met Farage several times to discuss his defection, but in the end, the Tories broke with the EPP, and he stayed with the Tories.</p> <p>In November 2009, though, the Conservatives abandoned their own manifesto promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Hannan called Cameron\u2019s office to resign from his duties in Brussels \u2013 he was the party\u2019s legal affairs spokesman in Europe. A senior aide picked up the phone. \u201cI said \u2026 I just think you\u2019ve made the most terrible mistake,\u201d Hannan recalled. But he promised to step down without publicity. The adviser thanked him, and asked Hannan what he planned to do next. \u201cI\u2019m going to devote myself full time to securing and then winning a referendum on leaving the EU,\u201d Hannan replied. The aide laughed down the line. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d/0_0_3228_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.

He was in his office in Brussels. The Macauley poem, Horatius at the Bridge, entered his mind: \u201cWho will stand on either hand / And keep the bridge with me?\u201d He thought of Carswell and Reckless, his closest friends in politics, whom he spoke to almost every day. (Reckless became a Conservative MP a few months later.) Then Hannan ran through his old, Eurosceptic allies. He ended up in touch with the Democracy Movement, a descendant of James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party, which had entered candidates in the 1997 election. At the time, the Democracy Movement had its own plan to bring about an in-out referendum in the UK, which was called the People\u2019s Pledge.</p> <p>Like other successful Eurosceptic campaigns, the People\u2019s Pledge was scrupulously cross-party \u2013 it had mainly Labour staffers \u2013 and didn\u2019t make the mistake of asking for too much. The premise was simple: it identified Labour and Conservative MPs under pressure from Ukip in their constituencies, and asked them to publicly support a referendum on the EU. The People\u2019s Pledge launched in March 2011. By October, there was a petition signed by 100,000 people, a debate in parliament and 81 MPs signed up, more and less against their will. Hannan spoke at rallies and impressed donors.</p> <p>Europe was the last thing that the Conservative-led coalition government wanted to address. There was so much else to attend to. The economy. Public service reform. The big society. \u201cOh God, so annoying,\u201d is how a former Cameron adviser described the pressure from the Eurosceptics. \u201cConstantly demanding to see the prime minister.\u201d Gove, then education secretary, felt particularly torn whenever the subject came up. The tactics of the People\u2019s Pledge, and Hannan\u2019s role in it, made many of his colleagues uneasy. On the substance of the argument, however, Gove sided with the young speechwriter he had met in the 1990s. \u201cMore and more of what Dan said, I would find myself agreeing with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I tried not to think about it whenever possible.\u201d</p> <p>With the eurozone in crisis, and signs of support for a referendum from Labour, the pressure grew. In March 2012, Boris Johnson signed the People\u2019s Pledge. Six months later, a rebellion masterminded by Reckless defeated the government over its contribution to the EU budget. Cameron was cornered, and announced the planned referendum at Bloomberg\u2019s London headquarters the following January. Like George Osborne, Gove argued against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think offering the referendum was a good idea,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought, This is being offered as a stopgap, not as a carefully considered recalibration of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It is more about dealing with an immediate political dilemma.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/brexit-how-a-fringe-idea-took-hold-tory-party\">Brexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By then, the skeleton of the leave campaign was already in place. In August 2012, Elliott and Hannan had been invited to spend the weekend at the country house of Lord Leach \u2013 the former chair of Business for Sterling, who died 11 days before the referendum \u2013 on the Norfolk coast. Over the years, Leach had become more or less neutral on the EU question, and he had arranged a house party to discuss possible options for a referendum. Of the group, Hannan and Elliott were the most doubtful of Cameron\u2019s ability to reform the EU.</p> <p>\u201cDan was basically, \u2018He is not going to do it. Don\u2019t believe him,\u201d Elliott recalled. In the garden, Hannan urged Elliott to start thinking about what a Brexit campaign might look like. A year earlier, Elliott had run the winning \u201cno\u201d side of the referendum on the alternative vote with a message that had impressed Hannan with its bloodymindedness. Rather than engaging with the principles at stake, Elliott had focused on the cost of changing the voting system \u2013 an impressive-sounding \u00a3250m \u2013 and sent dustbin trucks apparently heaped with money through the streets of Westminster.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was the most rubbish argument ever,\u201d Hannan said.<strong> </strong>But it worked. Behind in the polls at the start, \u201cNo to A/V\u201d won with 67% of the vote. Elliott had also proved adept at bringing rightwing donors and thinkers to what was a dry, democratic exercise. Leach had chaired the campaign. While Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who later contributed more than \u00a3650,000 to pro-leave groups, chipped in \u00a320,000. (In the run up to the vote, Odey bought gold and bet against house-building companies. On 24 June, as the pound collapsed, he made around \u00a3220m. \u201cCrispin,\u201d as a friend told me, \u201chas the common touch of a Medici.\u201d)</p> <p>The new campaign took its playbook from Business for Sterling. Elliott used the initial vehicle, Business for Britain, to set about winning friends and funding from the City. At the same time, he pondered the looming, awkward alliance with Ukip and more protectionist, anti-immigrant strains of anti-EU thinking. \u201cWe needed each other,\u201d he told me. Based on the 2014 European election results, Elliott reckoned that the Ukip vote would be worth around 30% in the referendum. The job of Vote Leave would be to win the centre ground with a reassuring, forward-looking tone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30/0_133_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless \u2013 Hannan\u2019s closest friends in politics \u2013 celebrate Reckless\u2019s byelection win for Ukip in 2014.

Dan in a sense provided us with that message.\u201d Elliott hired Cummings, as campaign director, who coined the all-important slogan, \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, while the deliberately crude figure of \u00a3350m per week, to describe Britain\u2019s EU budget contribution, echoed Elliott\u2019s successful A/V strategy.</p> <p>Hannan worked the political side. In the autumn of 2014, his allies Carswell and Reckless left the Tory backbenches for Ukip \u2013 one month apart \u2013 in synchronised defections designed to keep up the pressure on Cameron for a referendum, and, in theory anyway, dilute Nigel Farage\u2019s dominance of the party.<strong> </strong>A year later, as the vote approached, and Cameron began his doomed renegotiation, Hannan reached out to Gove, Johnson, Villiers and others. \u201cI spoke to Boris and made my pitch,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cThe only thing I will say is that he was obviously agonising about the issues.\u201d (Johnson did not respond to a request to comment for this article.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At least three of Gove\u2019s memorable soundbites \u2013 including people being \u2018fed up with experts\u2019 \u2013 were thought up by Hannan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time the actual campaign was under way, Hannan\u2019s work was more or less done. \u201cTwenty years of inch-by-inch, person-by-person, converting those in the Conservative party to his vision,\u201d said Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hannan went to Vote Leave\u2019s weekly strategy meeting, chaired by Gove, but his biggest impact on the national debate was probably subliminal. \u201cDan would often express views that I had myself,\u201d said Gove, \u201cwhich he would present in a crisper, more elegant and more coherent way.\u201d At least three of Gove\u2019s more memorable soundbites \u2013 about people being fed up with experts, joking about British MEPs losing their jobs, and comparing pro-remain economists to Nazi scientists \u2013 were Hannan lines.<strong> </strong>Villiers borrowed freely from her friend\u2019s speeches. From needling and courting one or two \u201couters\u201d in the late 1990s, Hannan watched 137 Conservative MPs announce their support for Brexit.</p> <p>He took part in 104 events and debates during the campaign, giving his final speech at Runnymede, where Magna Carta was agreed in 1215. He spent the night of the vote in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters, next door to Lambeth Palace, with Cummings and the rest of the team. (Elliott was in Birmingham.) There was no party planned. \u201cDominic is very puritan about these things,\u201d said Hannan. When victory was certain, Hannan stood on a desk in the office and delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V \u2013 \u201cWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d \u2013 substituting the names of people who had worked on the campaign. He didn\u2019t go to bed until midnight the following day.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On the Monday after the vote, at around six o\u2019clock in the evening, Matthew Parris, the conservative columnist, found himself standing a few feet away from Hannan on College Green, outside the Houses of Parliament. Hannan was having an argument, on air, with Christiane Amanpour of CNN. When the fall of Cameron consumed other senior figures from Vote Leave, Hannan became uneasy about the way that Brexit was being reported, particularly abroad. \u201cThe story taking shape was that Britain had just voted, as it were, for Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. Hannan took on as many interviews as he could, to put across a more positive interpretation of events, but he often found himself under hostile questioning. With Amanpour, he lost his temper. \u201cYou guys have been shouting \u2018racist\u2019 for so long,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cthat you weren\u2019t listening to what we were actually saying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivOOM0PbNps\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ivOOM0PbNps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Christiane Amanpour interviews Daniel Hannan</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even by the standards of those numbing, chaotic days, Parris was taken aback by the ferocity of the encounter. \u201cHe was very uncomfortable and very angry,\u201d Parris told me. He has known Hannan since the mid-1990s, and later accused him in the Spectator of being willing to exploit xenophobia in order to pursue his own, more abstract goals. <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/for-the-first-time-in-my-life-i-feel-ashamed-to-be-british/\">\u201cHe has ridden a tiger, and knows the tiger he rides,\u201d Parris wrote.</a> \u201cI find him a bit scary,\u201d he said, when we spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t think he sees himself in politics to give effect to what the public thinks, but to what the public ought to think, which is quite different.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan, naturally, cannot bear this kind of talk. When we first met, in Strasbourg, in early July, I asked him whether he really believed that the nation had voted for his free-market, internationalist version of Brexit. \u201cCan you see how patronising that is?\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, remainers are saying basically, \u2018These thicko, working-class bigots weren\u2019t listening to you. And let me now tell you \u2013 having ignored them \u2013 let me tell you what they really think.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Hannan spoke of polls that showed that sovereignty was the primary concern of leave voters, rather than immigration, and of the economic shock that had not come. He admitted that because of the closeness of the vote, we were unlikely to become the \u201coffshore, low-tax, global free-trading entrep\u00f4t\u201d that he longs us to be. Hannan\u2019s chosen Brexit would be rather soft, by current standards: something along Swiss lines, with opt-ins for various sectors to the regulations of the single market.<strong> </strong>He believes that compromise on free movement is possible, and that the Swiss government was making progress on the subject until talks were shut down before the British referendum. There is precedent, he pointed out, in his Hannanite way: EU immigration to Liechtenstein is capped at 71 people per year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It all sounded so reasonable when he talked which, of course, is Hannan\u2019s gift. \u201cEven if you fundamentally disagree with him, you find yourself nodding along,\u201d said Nicky Morgan. Like other senior politicians who campaigned for remain, she disagrees with Hannan\u2019s analysis of what drove the result, and is anxious about the future. \u201cI think we are in the calm before the storm,\u201d she said. Morgan has been called a traitor twice in her constituency of Loughborough, and has heard calls for the removal of a Polish community that has been there since the second world war. She didn\u2019t hear much about free trade and parliamentary supremacy in May and June. \u201cTalking to people who voted leave \u2026 \u2018back\u2019 was a very important word. One of the most depressing things was this, \u2018I want to take our country back.\u2019 Back to what?\u201d</p> <p>Nigel Farage has his own reasons for disagreeing with Hannan. The two have not spoken since 2014. (Farage says the two fell out over his approach to immigration; Hannan says that Farage underwent \u201ca personality change\u201d.) We met recently, in Westminster. The celebratory moustache was gone. He was just back from the US, where he had addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi, and was smoking on the patio. He had been thinking about the similarities between the core Brexit vote, and Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the have-nothings \u2026 They have got something, but they are concerned about the change in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic feeling is that something has gone wrong; that we are not in control; that our political class aren\u2019t the same as us, are detached from us.\u201d</p> <p>Like Hannan, Farage started out making a case for why Britain should leave the European Union \u2013 around trade and sovereignty and democracy \u2013 in the early 1990s. But he realised that the argument only went so far. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what most people are bothered about,\u201d he said. The mystery, for Farage, is that Hannan and his group have never figured this out. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seemed to approach the referendum as if it was an Oxford Union debate. I don\u2019t think they have met any real people in their entire lives.\u201d Farage said he didn\u2019t hear much about Hannan\u2019s free-market, open ideals on the doorstep either. \u201cIt is another disconnect isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible for someone to crave something for so long, and then be deluded about why it happened? To strive and strive, only for the country to fall into a different, meaner, poorer future? I once asked Hannan why he had dedicated his life to getting us out of the European Union. \u201cIt was the independence issue,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the idea of self-government.\u201d I told him that \u2013 as a citizen of the same country \u2013 I still didn\u2019t really get it. I couldn\u2019t see the freer land that he was seeking, even now that we had cut ourselves adrift. \u201cIt\u2019s a big philosophical difference,\u201d said Hannan. \u201cBetween the mentality of the powerful bloc run by competent, educated people and the mentality of \u2018trust the people\u2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be rude. \u201cWe are all conditioned by outlook, experience, genes, whatever. Two people will very often look at the same thing and have very different takes on it.\u201d</p> <p>We were on a train back to London, in late August. Hannan had just spoken at a Conservative club lunch in Worthing, on the south coast, where he was the guest of honour. The lunch had been held in a small hotel. More than a hundred had turned out, a swirl of floral prints and club ties. I sat on Hannan\u2019s table, where he remarked, thought-provokingly, on the scale of British immigration to Spain. \u201cIt is the great migration of our time,\u201d said Hannan, pointing out that there were more British people in Spain than people of Pakistani origin in the UK. \u201cHow many of them are on benefits?\u201d, one woman, in curls, asked promptly. Hannan ate his roast beef, smiled, and did not reply.</p> <p>After lunch, he rose to speak. The Olympics had just finished, and someone gave Hannan a homemade medal for his work on Brexit. The MEP thanked the room for putting him out of a job. The microphone wasn\u2019t working, but he did not need it. With his voice high and precisely cadenced, Hannan spoke of his hopes for the years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that hard.\u201d And he exhorted the audience to remember great British achievements: the medals table, and two wars against German tyranny, the abolition of slavery. \u201cThe idea that we can\u2019t now make a success of living under our own laws, trading with our friends and allies on every continent, while governing ourselves, is not worthy of a country like this one.\u201d Hannan paused. \u201cCheer up my friends.\u201d The lunchers laughed. Sunshine poured in. The cataclysm could not be felt. \u201cListen to the drone of the bees in lavender, and ask yourself where in the world would you rather be?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2016.

Trump had long falsely claimed that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, an accusation widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle. Although Trump only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton\">recently acknowledged</a> that Obama was born in the United States in an event at a Washington hotel, he falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for the conspiracy theory\u2019s origin. He since said that he only acknowledged Obama\u2019s actual birthplace in order to \u201cget on with the campaign\u201d.</p> <p>Trump also introduced a new conspiracy theory to the campaign on Wednesday night when he accused Google of somehow colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cGoogle search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,\u201d the Republican told a cheering crowd of supporters in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Neither Google nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment on this accusation, which seems to stem from a report in Sputnik News, a Russian state propaganda outlet. The reference to Google did not appear to be ad libbed as it was in Trump\u2019s prepared remarks.</p> <p>Also, at the rally, Trump unveiled a new accusation towards Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked as \u201ca globalist\u201d, by saying she was a \u201cvessel for special interests ... who want to strip [the United States] of its status as a sovereign nation\u201d. Although the former secretary of state has long favored immigration reform as well as number of free trade agreements, there is no evidence that she has ever supported stripping the United States of its sovereignty.</p> <p>However, Clinton is facing scrutiny over her complicated marital history. After Trump publicly congratulated himself for not bringing up former president Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities in Monday\u2019s debate, his campaign has cited them in talking points in an attempt to rebut past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">crude statements about a beauty queen</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado, Miss Universe weight-shamed by Trump, speaks out for Hillary Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, which included calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d for her weight and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d in reference to her Hispanic heritage, were brought up by Hillary Clinton in Monday\u2019s debate.

According to<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/781176300820201472\"> a recent poll</a> conducted by ABC/Washington Post only 49% of voters under the age of 40 said they were likely to vote in November. A similar poll in 2012 put that number at 71%. The Democratic nominee also held two fundraisers on Wednesday, one of which featured an appearance from Massachusetts senator and progressive Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>The leading third party alternative to Clinton and Trump suffered his own embarrassment on Wednesday. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for the White House, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/gary-johnson-cant-name-foreign-leader-aleppo-moment\">unable to name a single foreign leader</a> he admired in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews. He referred to his inability to come up with a single name as \u201canother Aleppo moment\u201d. This was a reference to a televised interview several weeks ago when the former two-term governor of New Mexico, having been asked \u201cWhat would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?\u201d on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\">responded with the question \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d</a>. Johnson seemed unaware of the Syrian city which has been long under siege in the midst of that country\u2019s civil war and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/aleppo-two-hospitals-bombed-out-of-service-syria-airstrikes\">the site of numerous atrocities</a> by the Assad regime and its allies.</p> <p>The candidates will return to the campaign trail on Thursday by meeting voters in states that they are long familiar with from the primaries.
