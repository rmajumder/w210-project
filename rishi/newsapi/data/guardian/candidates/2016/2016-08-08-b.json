  "<p>Donald Trump outlined an economic vision for the US on Monday, including dramatically slashing taxes, and took sharp aim at Hillary Clinton in an attempt to reset a campaign recently flogged by a series of controversies.</p> <p>In a nearly hour-long speech, unusually reading from a teleprompter, the Republican presidential nominee suggested Detroit itself was an example of \u201cthe living, breathing example of my opponent\u2019s failed economic agenda\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe unemployment rate [in Detroit] is more than twice the national average,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHalf of all Detroit residents do not work. Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime. These are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said his economic plan would reverse a lagging recovery in jobs from the 2008 recession, in part by reducing income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and entirely eliminating income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. That\u2019s a change from September 2015, when he initially proposed four brackets that would pay zero, 10%, 20% and 25%. He said it would mark the \u201cbiggest tax revolution since the Reagan tax reform\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will make America grow again,\u201d Trump said to applause. </p> <p>In addition, Trump said he would lower corporate tax rates from 40% to 15% \u2013 a rate he said punished \u201ccompanies for making products in America\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis, ladies and gentleman, is backwards \u2013 it\u2019s backwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.</p> <p>\u201cNo American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,\u201d he continued. Clinton\u2019s economic vision entailed \u201conerous regulations\u201d, which would put small companies \u201ctotally out of business, and you won\u2019t be able to start \u2013 you could never, ever start \u2013 a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have today in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also said he would eliminate the estate tax, which currently applies to estates larger than $5.45m for individuals, or $10.9m for married couples.</p> <p>\u201cNo family will have to pay the death tax,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech began with a few hiccups. Throughout his remarks, several protesters interrupted the candidate before being whisked away by security. The economic club\u2019s attendees booed, jeered and cheered, and at one point delivered a standing ovation for Trump following the interruptions. \u201cGo home!\u201d one attendee shouted; \u201cWe love you, Donald,\u201d said another.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/trump-economic-speech-protesters-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3kg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640265\"            data-video-name=\"Protesters repeatedly disrupt Donald Trump during economy speech \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8c8b9e4b0f5d0648418e3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808trumpprot_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400061&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400061&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400061&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400061&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/trump-economic-speech-protesters-video\">Protesters repeatedly disrupt Donald Trump during economy speech</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The remarks were delivered inside a ballroom of Cobo Hall in downtown Detroit, before 1,500 members and guests of the prestigious Detroit Economic Club, a business and professional organization that routinely serves as a stop for presidential candidates. About 100 anti-Trump protesters marched around Washington Boulevard outside the hall while chanting \u201cDump Trump\u201d.</p> <p>The specifications of the economic plan appeared to mimic proposals offered last fall by his campaign and later highlighted on his campaign\u2019s website. In March, the group Citizens for Tax Justice said <a href=\"http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2016/03/donald_trumps_tax_plan_would_cost_12_trillion.php#.V6jAZk0rKVN\">his plan would cost more than $12tn</a>. Trump also reiterated his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his plan to ask TransCanada to renew the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.</p> <p>The newest proposals included a temporary moratorium on regulations from federal agencies. He pitched a plan to allow families to \u201cfully deduct\u201d all childcare expenses from their taxes, which he said would \u201creduce cost in childcare, offering much needed relief to American families\u201d.</p> <p>The speech was viewed as a chance to reboot Trump\u2019s flailing campaign, following a week that saw the candidate vehemently push back against criticism from the family of a Muslim soldier who died in Iraq, and as the leader of the American Nazi party proclaimed him presidency as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/american-nazi-party-leader-trump-opportunity\">a \u201creal opportunity\u201d</a>. His standing in polls across the US fell in tandem, including in Michigan, where Clinton opened up <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/08/trump-economic-agenda-child-care-tax-break/88388718/\">a near double-digit lead</a> this week. And on Monday, a little-known CIA operative and Republican, Evan McMullin, announced his third-party run for president, presenting himself as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">a conservative choice for \u201cmillions of disaffected Americans\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, made a surprise appearance to introduce Trump on Monday, saying the candidate was in Detroit to deliver what \u201cso many American leaders have done at this very podium\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou will hear your keynote speaker outline a vision, a new economic vision to make America great again,\u201d Pence said to applause.<br></p> <p>Both Clinton and Trump view Michigan as vital to their campaign, and the Democratic nominee is set to follow her opponent with an economic speech, also in Detroit, on Thursday.</p> <p>Clinton, on a two-day campaign swing through the battleground state of Florida, spurned Trump\u2019s economic agenda as a repackaging of Republicans\u2019 old policies. <br>\u201cTrickle-down economics does not help our economy grow,\u201d Clinton said during a rally in St Petersburg on Monday. \u201cIt does not help the vast majority of Americans, but it does really well for people already at the top.\u201d</p> <p>She said his tax plans will \u201cgive super big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy\u201d, while casting herself as a champion for small businesses. <br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make the wealthy pay their fair share,\u201d she said, drawing cheers from the crowd. \u201cI am not going to raise taxes on the middle class, but with your help we are going to raise it on the wealthy.\u201d<br><br>She also took a swing at Trump\u2019s new team of economic advisers, dismissing them as \u201chedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently\u201d.</p> <p>Before Trump\u2019s speech, the congresswoman Debbie Dingell said she was looking forward to the speech, \u201cbecause it\u2019s really important to hear all the candidates. I\u2019ve always done that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what democracy is \u2013 it\u2019s hearing from those candidates,\u201d said Dingell, a board member of the economic club and Democrat who represents Michigan in the US House. \u201cIt\u2019s understanding those candidates. So I want to see what he has to say.\u201d </p> <p>Others weren\u2019t as interested.<br></p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d said Valerie Kindle, a retired worker for the state of Michigan who lives in the city of Eastpointe, about 20 minutes north-east of Detroit. \u201cThis person has been unstable since the very beginning. I\u2019ve never seen \u2026 a campaign ran as he ran his. We\u2019re Americans \u2013 we don\u2019t tear each other down like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow why, why should we support [him]?\u201d Kindle continued. \u201cHas the United States come to that level? Where we really want the scum of the earth to represent us?\u201d</p> <p><em>Lauren Gambino contributed reporting from New York.</em></p>",
  "<p>As the first woman to clinch a major party nomination, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy is already historic \u2013 and increasingly it looks like Donald Trump\u2019s is too. But not in a flattering way.</p> <p>If last week came the point at which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-week-campaign-turning-point-2016-election\">self-immolated the campaign</a> and beloved Trump brand, this week may be remembered as the time he finally drove his party\u2019s national security leadership to support the Democratic candidate for president en masse, either by voting for her expressly or by abstaining.</p> <p>National security is an issue that Republican presidential candidates have historically been able to dominate, but Trump may be the first guy in recent history to blow that for the party. Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republicans-donald-trump-warning-letter-bush-reagan\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would put the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">filed papers to run for president</a> as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins. But that\u2019s just fine with McMullin, who says: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>In fact if there\u2019s a common theme to this most recent wave of GOP dissenters, it\u2019s just how eerily close they sound to Hillary Clinton\u2019s talking points.</p> <p>\u201cHe is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,\u201d<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> the GOP national security leaders said in the letter</a>. \u201cHe does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\">in recent interviews</a> have specifically cited Trump\u2019s recent comment inviting Russia to hack into Clinton\u2019s email servers, a remark Trump has since claimed he was making in jest, as the moment that changed their mind about him. They also touched on his embrace of Putin specifically, calling his admiration for him and other foreign dictators \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>That sounds a whole lot like what Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/hillary-clinton-on-egyptair-shines-a-very-bright-light-on-threat-of-terror/\">been saying all along</a>, if not what Barack Obama said at the Democratic convention last month when he called Trump\u2019s rival the most qualified presidential candidate in history.</p> <p>In our era of political polarization and congressional stagnation, it\u2019s been ages since top Republicans and Democrats in Washington could agree on anything more definitively than the need to keep Trump out of the White House. And without getting ahead of ourselves too much (for Trump\u2019s done nothing this election so well as outperform low expectations), let\u2019s hope the unlikely unity extends beyond the neocons and with any luck, lasts longer than the election. </p>",
  "<p>Many longtime Republican foreign policy and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/hillary-clinton-military-endorsements-trump\">national security</a> officials have issued their most vociferous repudiation of Donald Trump to date, saying the GOP presidential nominee, if elected, \u201cwould be the most reckless president in American history\u201d.</p> <p>An open letter released on Monday and signed by 50 fixtures from decades of Republican Pentagons, state departments, White Houses and treasuries rejected Trump\u2019s \u201calarming ignorance\u201d of basic international affairs, his competence at understanding US national interests and his temperament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Republican Evan McMullin to launch presidential run against Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president and commander-in-chief,\u201d states the letter, which was first reported by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html\">New York Times</a> and includes several top aides from the George W Bush administration. </p> <p>\u201cIndeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country\u2019s national security and well-being.\u201d</p> <p>The former officials, many of whom are likely candidates to staff any Republican president\u2019s administration, added that Trump \u201clacks the character, values, and experience\u201d to hold the highest office in the land. It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national security salon <a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\">War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who also signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon under secretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hacking-dangerous\">Trump\u2019s posture toward Russia</a> \u2013 the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump. </p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, whose antipathy to Trump has become highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Bill Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence. So has George W Bush\u2019s White House Iraq and Afghanistan adviser, Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, who is held in high esteem amongst congressional Republican internationalists.</p> <p>The new letter also contains harsher language than the old. While the March letter compared Trump to a \u201cracketeer\u201d, the new one flatly says Trump \u201clacks the temperament to be president\u201d. It also calls into question his fitness to wield \u201ccommand of the US nuclear arsenal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike previous presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr Trump has shown no interest in educating himself,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHe continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/hillary-clinton-military-endorsements-trump\">Clinton set to seize national security issue from GOP as endorsements roll in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Clinton campaign has also sought to cast a spotlight on Trump\u2019s competence to be commander-in-chief as voters grow increasingly alarmed over national security.

Trump\u2019s original plan placed four brackets at 0%, 10%, 20% and 25%.</p> <p><strong>\u201c1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the great depression.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Since the US recovery began in mid-2009, the economy has grown at an annual rate of 2.1%, according to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economy-grew-at-a-disappointing-1-2-in-2nd-quarter-1469795649\">data from the commerce department</a>. That is the slowest recovery since 1949, by which point the US had emerged from the great depression; the financial crisis of 2008 was the worst since the stock market crash that began the great depression.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThere are now 93.4 million Americans outside of the labor force. I</strong><strong>t was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump cited accurate <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS15000000\">BLS figures</a>, and he was almost correct on the difference between 93.4 and 80.5. But he neglected to mention that more than five million people have also joined the labor force since Obama took office in 2009. He also neglected to mention demographics; the baby boomer generation is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/45011-LaborMarket-OneCol.pdf\">retiring</a> out of the workforce. </p> <p><strong>\u201cHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump has this figure correct: as of the second quarter this year, 62.9% of households owned a home, down from 63.4%, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-homeownership-rate-629-percent-matches-51-year-40959325\">according to the Census Bureau.</a></p> <p><strong>\u201cMore than 12 million people have been added to the food stamp.\u201d</strong></p> <p>As of April 2016, <a href=\"http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/snapdata2016-apr.pdf\">43,571,080 people </a>were enrolled in the Snap assistance program, according to the Food Research and Action Center, meaning an increase of about 12 million from December 2008, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-foodstamps-usa-idUSTRE4B28CB20081203\">when 31.5 million Americans were enrolled</a>. But 14.7 million people enrolled for food assistance under George W Bush, with a 17% increase from 2007 to 2008 alone.</p> <p><strong>\u201cFifty-eight per cent of the African American youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Unemployment rates for young African Americans with a high school degree \u2013 17 to 20 years old \u2013 are high, according to <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/young-black-high-school-grads-face-astonishing-underemployment/\">the Economic Policy Institute</a>. But EPI\u2019s figures are slightly different from Trump\u2019s: the institute places this very specific demographic at 19.5% unemployed and 37% \u201cunderemployed\u201d; for young college-aged graduates (21-24), unemployment is 7.2% and underemployment 14.9%. These are still startlingly higher than the population for other Americans, but not the same figure cited by Trump.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThe 5% [unemployment] figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern American politics.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump provided no evidence for this claim, and has for months asserted that real unemployment could be as high as 42%.  </p> <p>He is correct to point out that people who aren\u2019t looking for work are a longstanding concern \u2013 but the BLS has a statistic for that too, called \u201clabor underutilization\u201d. In July, <a href=\"http://unemploymentdata.com/current-u6-unemployment-rate/\">this broader rate was 10.1%</a>, twice the unemployment number but still far below its rate five years ago \u2013 it was as high as 15.2% in December 2011.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35% ... \u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump adjusted his previous false claim that the US is one of the highest taxed countries in the world to a more specific and more correct one, about corporate tax rates \u2013 which he elides slightly by calling a \u201cbusiness tax rate\u201d. The US corporate income tax rate does rank among the highest among industrialized nations, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\">according to the OECD</a>. But Trump\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t take into account deductions and other exemptions \u2013 the kind that helped <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/07/27-giant-profitable-companies-paid-no-taxes/81399094/\">General Motors and dozens of other corporations escape paying any taxes</a> in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cT<strong>he Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump appears to have drawn this figure from <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515001123\">a study in the journal Energy Policy</a>, which found the coal industry lost about 49,000 jobs from 2008 to 2012. He failed to mention that a major factor in this decline was the rise of natural gas, solar and wind industries, which had an employment increase of 175,000 jobs. Natural gas, especially, cut into the coal industry.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150bn to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400m in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\u201d</strong></p> <p>The US has not given $150bn to Iran; it released billions of Iran\u2019s money frozen by sanctions related to the country\u2019s nuclear program. Estimates vary regarding how much of that money Iran will actually see: the treasury secretary, Jack Lew, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, Iranian officials between <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, the $400m in question stems from a dispute over a failed arms deal in the late 1970s, which has been under arbitration at the Hague for decades. The money was delivered in foreign currency because it is illegal under US law to have transactions with Iran in US dollars, and because remaining sanctions are major obstacles to global banks. A small group of US sailors was captured the same month of the scheduled delivery, and released less than a day later.</p>",

They returned when the office closed and made two arrests after Brooks and Green refused to leave. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling very strongly about today\u2019s action,\u201d Green said in an email after the arrest. \u201cThe energy from the youth during today\u2019s action empowered me to remain resilient through this civil disobedience.\u201d<br></p> <p>Nearly 30 protesters occupied the Republican\u2019s office on Monday morning, demanding that Goodlatte, as chairman of the House judiciary committee, convene a hearing on the Voting Rights Act. The number of protesters filtered throughout the day and by mid-afternoon, there were about 15 people remaining. <br></p> <p>Earlier, Brooks spoke to the Guardian in a phone call from Goodlatte\u2019s office. \u201cPeople bled, sweated and died for the right to vote,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Congress conduct a hearing on the right to vote?

In 2013, the US supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-obama\">struck at the heart</a> of the 1965 law in a 5-4 decision that allowed nine states, mostly in the south, to make changes to electoral rules without approval from federal authorities in Washington. </p> <p>The prevailing justices argued that while racial discrimination persisted, it was no longer sufficient to justify what they called \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d against the southern states. The states included Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.</p> <p>Civil rights activists were deeply disappointed by the ruling, and have been at the forefront of fighting a surge of voter identification laws which have passed in some of the nine states, which they say amounts to voter suppression and targets racial minorities.</p> <p>\u201cYou can vote with an ID that allows you to carry a concealed weapon, but a card that allows you to carry a book of Shakespeare or a textbook does not allow you to vote,\u201d Brooks said, expressing frustration that in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2016/aug/03/citing-court-victories-elsewhere-tennessee-de/379235/\">some states</a> a handgun permit, but not a library card, can be presented as identification at polling booths. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/north-carolina-voting-rights-law-republicans-november-elections\">string of legal victories last month</a>, courts in five states ruled against voter ID and proof-of-citizenship laws. The rulings were seen<strong> </strong> as a sweeping victory for voting rights activists and the US Department of Justice, which had challenged the restrictive voting laws.</p> <p>An appeals court invalidated key parts of a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a> voting law, stating in a searing ruling that the law had been enacted with \u201cdiscriminatory intent\u201d and targeted African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d. This followed a similar decision by the notoriously conservative fifth circuit court of appeals that found Texas\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/texas-voter-id-law-voting-rights-act-federal-court-decision\">stringent voter identification</a> law had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/05/texas-court-strikes-down-voter-id-law\">a discriminatory impact</a> that breaches US voting rights law.The states could appeal the rulings to the supreme court.</p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cWe\u2019re here to raise the moral </span> consciousness and push for the strengthening of the Vot<span tabindex=\"-1\">ing Rights Act,\u201d Green said earlier.

  "<p>The chimney stack stands idle, grass sprouts through cracks in the empty car park, and an aging sign \u2013 \u201cJanesville people working together; quality; pride; worldwide\u201d \u2013 mocks what used to be. The sprawling General Motors plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, closed down eight years ago with thousands of job losses, but a pub that once did a roaring trade serving workers on the assembly line is clinging on.</p> <p>On Sunday evening a dozen or so locals at the Zoxx 411 Club drank, played darts or leaned on the bar, which incorporates old GM and Fisher Body metal badges. \u201cWe lost our house and car,\u201d said Diane Nordeng, 67, whose husband Robert was laid off by GM after 19 years. \u201cHe got very depressed. He stayed in all day and didn\u2019t socialise or go out anywhere. It\u2019s been very difficult for the families. A lot of people thought Janesville would completely go under but they\u2019re trying hard to stay alive.\u201d</p> <p>Scenarios like this \u2013 industrial decline, job losses, hollowed-out communities \u2013 across the country are widely thought to be fodder for the populism of Donald Trump. The Republican nominee, who laid out his economic strategy on Monday, has been dubbed a \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d. But Janesville, and Wisconsin more broadly, suggest Trump is struggling to overcome pockets of resistance even, or especially, within his own party.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, who as speaker of the House is the most senior elected Republican in the land, is up for re-election in his own backyard on Tuesday. The Janesville resident is being challenged by Paul Nehlen, a maverick businessman from out of state seeking to ride the Trump wave (\u201cblue-collar makes it to VP of Fortune 500\u201d, says his Twitter account), in a primary election to decide which Republican will contest the House seat for Wisconsin\u2019s first congressional district in November.<br></p> <p>Ryan was bitterly criticised at the time of the GM plant shutdown, and again in 2012 when, running for vice-president, he tried to pin the blame on Barack Obama. Nehlen, like Trump, has railed against factory closures, promised to \u201crepatriate\u201d jobs to the US and branded Ryan a \u201csoulless globalist\u201d. In a year of voter rebellion against the Washington establishment, the stage might have appeared set for a stunning upset. But it is not going to turn out that way.</p> <p>A poll last week by the Remington Research Group put Ryan on 80% and Nehlen on just 14%. Charlie Sykes, a conservative talkshow host, said: \u201cRyan is going to win overwhelmingly. Paul Nehlen is absurdly over-hyped by certain elements of the conservative media. They created a virtual candidate, but it looks completely different from here.\u201d</p> <p>Such is the power of Twitter and Trump that it took just a 10-word tweet from the candidate \u2013 \u201cThanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated\u201d \u2013 last Monday to catapult Nehlen from obscurity to the news networks. A day later, Trump told the Washington Post that he was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to endorsing Ryan and praised Nehlen for running \u201ca very good campaign\u201d. But on Friday, the brash billionaire finally gave his backing to Ryan at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin,<strong> </strong>from which Nehlen, who had driven three hours to attend, was humiliatingly ejected.</p> <p>When Nehlen arrived at the Trump rally he was informed that he could not attend because he did not have a ticket. \u201cThey said you can\u2019t come in here, they brought a detective \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Nehlen told the Washington Post the following day.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s belated and somewhat grudging endorsement of Ryan was important for keeping up appearances of party unity. But it seems unlikely to make much difference in a congressional district where Trump lost to rival Ted Cruz by 19 percentage points in the Republican primaries. Indeed, Wisconsin as a whole inflicted Trump\u2019s worst setback of that campaign and has never embraced him. Before his plane touched down last Friday, state assembly speaker Robin Vos wrote in an open letter: \u201cWe are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans.\u201d It is now set to play a central role in what many regard as civil war within the party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">Donald Trump endorses Paul Ryan after previously refusing to back him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with Ryan, Scott Walker, the governor of the state who launched an abortive bid for the presidency this year, and Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, grew up in southern Wisconsin. All are close in age and share a political worldview. Now the triumvirate is wrestling with the Trump problem: what to do with a wildly unpredictable candidate who recently insulted the family of a dead soldier and who regularly stretches conservative orthodoxy to breaking point.</p> <p>David Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/trumps-enablers-will-finally-have-to-take-a-stand.html\">wrote</a> last week of the Republican leadership: \u201cThere comes a time when neutrality and laying low become dishonorable. If you\u2019re not in revolt, you\u2019re in cahoots. When this period and your name are mentioned, decades hence, your grandkids will look away in shame.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan has condemned some of Trump\u2019s statements while still backing his candidacy. Sykes, who has known Ryan since he was first elected to the House in 1998, said: \u201cI think he has struggled with it from the beginning. He knows who Donald Trump is and what he\u2019s about. It\u2019s an exquisitely complicated dilemma for him. I think he sees it as at a responsibility to the party because he\u2019s speaker of the House. If he wasn\u2019t speaker of the House, there would be no way he\u2019d be supporting him. This is a deeply painful dilemma for him.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan is keenly aware that the Trump effect could cost Republicans the Senate and inflict losses in the House. Sykes added: \u201cHe\u2019s worried about what could have been. Ryan\u2019s a policy wonk. He always said if this election is about ideas, we will win; if it\u2019s about personalities, we will lose. It\u2019s an election entirely about personalities.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Dump Paul Ryan\u2019</h2> <p>In this spirit, Nehlen, 47, the vice-president of a water filtration company, has attempted to channel Trump during his primary campaign, laying bare the party\u2019s inner turmoil. Just as the Republican convention heard from family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, a move that many observers found tasteless and exploitative, so Nehlen arranged for a group of women whose children had been killed in similar circumstances to wield photos outside Ryan\u2019s home. In another stunt, Nehlen stood before a yellow construction dump truck that bore the words \u201cDump Paul Ryan\u201d and \u201cGet the dirt on Ryan\u201d.</p> <p>Nehlen has accused Ryan of acting against Wisconsin\u2019s workers by shipping jobs to China, bringing in cheap labour and keeping the borders open. He has echoed Trump\u2019s call to build a wall along the Mexican border and gone even further in suggesting the deportation of \u201csharia-compliant\u201d Muslims. All this earned him the backing of Tom Tancredo, a former congressman from Colorado and hardliner on immigration.</p> <p>Tancredo, 70, head of the Team America political action committee, argues that Trump should not have caved into party pressure to back Ryan. \u201cTrump is dangerous to Paul Ryan\u2019s position on issues and the Chamber of Commerce that he represents,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is scary for him. I think Trump made a mistake in supporting Paul Ryan and John McCain. If he\u2019s elected, his ability to achieve his agenda is compromised by their presence there.\u201d</p> <p>There is little hope of healing divisions in the party any time soon, Tancredo added. \u201cTrump should have picked someone for vice-president that the establishment hates even more than him because that\u2019s the only way he\u2019ll avoid getting impeached by a Republican Congress. If he goes ahead with an executive action on controlling the border, I think he will be impeached. He comes from the most vulnerable group in America: wealthy old white males.\u201d</p> <p>Nehlen also earned the backing of arch-conservative heroines Sarah Palin, Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, as well as Tea Party activists hoping for a repeat of the primary surprise that ousted then House majority leader Eric Cantor. But it is to little effect against Ryan, \u201ca fifth-generation Wisconsinite\u201d who makes much of his local roots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/donald-trump-committed-fans-poll-drop-us-election\">\u2018I\u2019m still for him\u2019: Trump fans undaunted by string of campaign blunders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Attending a Serbian cultural festival over the weekend, he told the Washington Post: \u201cWisconsin Republicans are good at sniffing out interlopers. These tactics that they\u2019re employing, which are basically scam Pacs and hoax campaigns, inventing myths like I\u2019m for open borders and the rest, just don\u2019t really fly. It\u2019s unnerving to people because it\u2019s not how we treat each other in Wisconsin.\u201d</p> <p>In Janesville, a bridge connects pleasant suburban housing, parks, playgrounds, a golf course and the Rotary Botanic Garden to the old neighbourhood of the GM plant, where paint peels off abandoned buildings. GM once employed 7,000 people and was the biggest job provider in the area for decades. A study found that its employees and those whose wages were tied to that production contributed $220m to the local economy. Brad Dutcher, 49, who was president of the local United Automobile Workers branch at the time, said: \u201cThat tremendous amount of influx that went away in a very short period of time had dire effects on the community, small businesses began to close, property values fell, school districts suffered and families began to relocate to other GM facilities across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Many workers at the factory are Democratic voters with fond memories of the Bill Clinton years. Dutcher added: \u201cOurs was not the first automotive factory to close under Paul Ryan\u2019s watch within his district; the Chrysler plant in the Milwaukee area ceased production also. Representative Ryan\u2019s failure to take on the big oil industry had a huge effect, in my opinion, on the decision to close our plant. We produced large SUVs and fuel prices were upwards of $3 a gallon.</p> <p>\u201cHis position on tax loopholes for corporations that move work out of the United States could also be tied to the closure. GM had, and still does [have], a truck factory in Mexico that produced the same SUVs that were made in Janesville, obviously at a substantially lower labour rate.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Trump, and his acolyte Nehlen, are still struggling to gain a foothold in the district. Dutcher said: \u201cThe Republican party has made the bed that they must now lie in. They chose to let the extreme right dictate their agenda and now they are saddled with a nominee that, quite frankly, is an embarrassment to most Americans.\u201d</p> <p>Nordeng, a great-grandmother who commutes two hours a day to work as a security officer, has plenty of reasons for discontent but will not turn to the bombastic tycoon. \u201cTrump can talk till the cows come home but look at his history and the way he treated people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t leave a good impression.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are following the crowd when it comes to Trump. A lot of people don\u2019t like him. Paul Ryan would be a better choice. If Ryan were running, he would win.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Former CIA agent Evan McMullin \u2013 who launched an improbable independent bid for president on Monday in the hope of providing a conservative alternative to Donald Trump \u2013 faces significant hurdles in becoming a credible threat to the Republican nominee.</p> <p>A relative unknown even in Washington, McMullin filed the paperwork on Monday for a third-party run against Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

And even in states where time for ballot access remains, McMullin would have to secure the requisite number of signatures, which varies by state and as a matter of process requires both money and organization on the ground.</p> <p>Those helping McMullin with his long-shot candidacy insist they have donors on their side, citing the trend of high-dollar fundraisers sitting on the sidelines rather than backing Trump. </p> <p>But many influential Republicans also believe the Never Trump movement missed its opportunity to put forward a meaningful challenge to the former reality TV star ahead of the Republican national convention in Cleveland last month, where Trump formally accepted the party\u2019s nomination for president.<br><br>That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a strategy behind the last-ditch effort to introduce McMullin to a dissatisfied electorate. The former House Republican staffer is a Mormon and native of Utah, a state that has remained reliably in the GOP\u2019s column but could prove a toss-up this November.</p> <p>Mormons dominate Utah \u2013 where candidates can still put their names forward until 31 August \u2013 and handed Trump one of his worst losses in the Republican presidential primary in June. As a voting bloc, they have <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/opinion/campaign-stops/donald-trumps-mormon-problem.html?_r=0\">fiercely opposed</a> Trump as someone counter to their faith-based values and further been turned off by his disparaging comments toward 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, himself a Mormon and member of the Never Trump movement.</p> <p>Romney has yet to endorse a candidate in the race but said he would vote for neither Trump nor Clinton. Mike Lee, the senator from Utah and a prominent figure in the conservative movement, has also declined thus far to endorse Trump.</p> <p>Trump currently holds just a four-point lead over Clinton in Utah, based on an average of <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-utah-president-trump-vs-clinton\">publicly available polling</a>. The emergence of McMullin could certainly inflict more damage to Trump\u2019s prospects in the state, where there is time yet to get on the ballot and six electoral votes will be at stake.</p> <p>McMullin will, however, have to compete for the anti-Trump conservative vote with Libertarian Gary Johnson, who also ran in 2012 and this time will appear on the ballot in all 50 states. Polling shows at least a faction of voters taking a longer look at the former governor of New Mexico, who has also attracted support from at least one sitting Republican congressman, Scott Rigell of Virginia and Marvin Bush, the brother of former president George W Bush.</p> <p>It is unclear where exactly McMullin stands on policy issues, with little yet known about his background and platform.</p> <p>But if McMullin can secure a place on the ballot in even a handful of red states where Trump is struggling to keep his footing, he could have the kind of spoiler effect that helps to deny the Republican nominee the presidency.</p>",
  "<p>The first time I interview <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mark-singer\">Mark Singer</a> it\u2019s the Tuesday after the Republican national convention, which culminated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\">a Donald Trump speech Singer accurately describes as \u201cscripted insanity\u201d</a>. Things feel pretty bleak. Trump\u2019s candidacy, says Singer, is \u201cthe most cynical and truly sad thing that\u2019s ever happened in my life in this country, and I\u2019ve lived through assassinations and terrible wars, but that it has led to this \u2013 it\u2019s a mixture of every awful emotion. If we elect this man it\u2019s the end of a lot of things, I just don\u2019t know how that happens. With a whimper perhaps \u2013 I hope not a bang.\u201d</p> <p>Born in 1950, Singer has been a writer for the New Yorker since 1974 (\u201cThere was no reason to leave,\u201d he tells me as we sit outside a caf\u00e9 near his home on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side). In 1996, his then editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/apr/07/tina-brown-our-speakers-have-taken-on-bigger-misogynists-than-trump\">Tina Brown</a> commissioned him to write a profile of Trump with the words \u201cHe\u2019s totally full of shit, you\u2019ll love him!\u201d After months getting a full immersion into Trump\u2019s world, one highlight being a ludicrous meeting between Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/29/guardianobituaries.russia\">Aleksandr Lebed</a>, in which Trump proudly showed the Russian general and Kremlin fixer a shoe he\u2019d been given by Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/video-mark-singer-on-the-perils-of-profiling-donald-trump\">Singer wrote a 10,000-word profile</a> that nailed the narcissism, superficiality and cynicism with which the world is now so alarmingly familiar. It concluded that Trump had \u201caspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/trump-and-me-mark-singer-donald-review-hari-kunzru\">Trump and Me by Mark Singer review \u2013 a lot of laughs but then horror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naturally, Trump didn\u2019t appreciate Singer\u2019s efforts, attacking him in his book Trump: the Art of the Comeback, in a letter to the New York Times (\u201che was not born with great writing ability\u201d), and finally in an irate missive that read: \u201cMark, you are a total loser! And your book (and writings) sucks!\u201d </p> <p>These last two sentences are proudly printed on the back of Singer\u2019s new book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/trump-and-me-mark-singer-donald-review-hari-kunzru\">Trump and Me</a>, which revisits his profile in the light of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Given Singer\u2019s probing wit and Trump\u2019s essential ridiculousness, it is very funny, though the implications of a Trump presidency seem increasingly less amusing in the light of the hatred he has unleashed. \u201cI am afraid. Everybody I know is afraid,\u201d Singer says. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton wins, listening to the sigh of relief just on this island, we might have a carbon dioxide overload crisis. You\u2019ll see these trees shooting up.\u201d </p> <p>Singer says that Trump is \u201cthe most unapologetic \u2026 there has to be a word stronger than hypocrite, there really does.\u201d He is despairing that some voters \u2013 stoked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">email scandal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/clinton-campaign-blames-russia-wikileaks-sanders-dnc-emails\">the WikiLeaks revelations about her attempts to undermine Bernie Sanders</a> \u2013 think Hillary Clinton is more dishonest than Trump. This, he says, \u201cis what really makes you want to blow your brains out. It makes you want to go back and find patient zero and think, when was the moment where we stopped being willing to fund public education in this country, that it became so egregious that we no longer could have people who understood the constitution, the checks and balances? Trump says: \u2018I love the ill-educated.\u2019 You bet he does.\u201d </p> <p>Singer blames Fox News and the web for what seems to be a growing disregard for the truth, but also acknowledges that widening inequality, leaving a large swathe of Americans essentially abandoned by the two main parties, has helped account for Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 along with \u201cthe haters\u201d, racists and xenophobes excited by this promises to keep Mexicans and Muslims out of America. </p> <p>Nevertheless, he can\u2019t bring himself to picture Trump actually being elected. \u201cImagine November 9, 2016. You wake up and there it is in the newspaper, Donald Trump has been elected president. He\u2019s not going to institute martial law yet, he\u2019s not going to abridge the first amendment just yet, he\u2019s not going to seal the borders \u2013 he can\u2019t do anything until January 20. This will be the beginning of a series of <em>anni horobili</em> that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d </p> <p>Singer cites a recent obituary of a friend\u2019s aunt, which concluded: \u201cDied of complications of congestive heart failure and the 2016 presidential election.\u201d Like her, he says, \u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see a lot of people who\u2019ve been hanging on, letting go. I believe that. And a lot of them are going to be envied.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Trump in his quintessence\u2019</h2> <p>Just a week later, however, things look very different. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-campaign-terrible-week-paul-ryan-khan\">Trump is plunging in the polls</a>, largely thanks to his typically impetuous and politically suicidal decision to attack Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of US army captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in the Iraq war. \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing,\u201d Khan said of Trump in his speech at the DNC, a line devastating because it is so self-evidently true, and one to which Trump was stupid enough to respond, telling ABC: \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat almost made me embarrassed for humanity,\u201d says Singer when I call him a few days after Trump\u2019s car-crash performance. \u201cI don\u2019t really lump myself in the same humanity that possibly he belongs to.\u201d</p> <p>Singer says the Khan episode \u201cshowed Donald Trump in his quintessence\u201d. Even the rightwing political commentator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-oreilly-slaves-eat-well\">Bill O\u2019Reilly</a>, he says, \u201cwho\u2019s a bomb thrower\u201d, told Trump on his Fox show that you don\u2019t attack a gold-star mother. \u201cTrump is saying: \u2018Well yeah, but\u2019 \u2013 and then he says, as plain as day, \u2018I didn\u2019t attack her.\u2019 And right after he says that he says: \u2018I was viciously attacked.\u2019 This demonstrates as plainly as anything that he\u2019s a person who lies reflexively.\u201d</p> <p>Now Trump seems to be flailing. \u201cHe\u2019s shocked,\u201d Singer says. \u201cHe\u2019s in a tailspin because his ego is constructed in a way that does not brook any kind of disagreement. He has his own party telling him, \u2018Dude, shut the fuck up. Do not go there.\u2019 These are people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Guiliani </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/newt-gingrich\">Newt Gingrich</a>, this is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, OK? He hears them, he goes out and the next day does it again.\u201d</p> <p>This reckless behaviour has had many commentators wondering whether Trump is suffering from a mental illness. Last week, Singer participated in <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/trump-the-candidate-unfit-to-serve-737086019759\">an extraordinary discussion on MSNBC\u2019s The Last Word With Lawrence O\u2019Donnell</a> with Dr George Simon, a psychologist <a href=\"http://www.manipulative-people.com/\">described on his website</a> as \u201cthe leading expert on manipulators and other disturbed characters\u201d. To be diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, you need to exhibit five of around <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/\">a dozen symptoms on a checklist</a>, such as \u201cHas a grandiose sense of self-importance\u201d and \u201clacks empathy\u201d. However, the entire list seemed to apply to Trump. </p> <p>\u201cHis mental illness is now the conversation,\u201d Singer says. There are tricky ethical issues around such a long-distance diagnosis \u2013 not least, he says, the fact that comparing them to Trump may further stigmatize sufferers. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfair to people who have various mental illnesses.\u201d </p> <p>Singer says that even mental illness can\u2019t entirely account for Trump\u2019s behaviour. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that this is somebody capable of this degree of obtuseness, obliviousness, total absence of self-awareness and cruelty. This combination. Since you and I spoke the other day, that has blown open and he\u2019s really done. So now the headlines are, what\u2019s the party going to do? They\u2019ve got to do something. They\u2019re almost conceding the election now, two weeks after their convention!\u201d Singer even made a bet last Monday with <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jane-mayer\">Jane Mayer</a>, a New Yorker colleague, that Trump would be gone in two weeks. \u201cThe wheels are starting to come off so dramatically and you can feel it.\u201d </p> <p>Given his plunging popularity, Singer says it\u2019s no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">Trump is now claiming that the election will be rigged</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s in the book,\u201d<strong> </strong>he points out. \u201cThe thing that he\u2019s dreaded most in his life is being labeled a loser. So he has to have an explanation for that.\u201d </p> <p>In the shorter term, Singer says, Trump\u2019s next big challenge will be the debates \u2013 or more specially, how he can avoid them. As Trump has demonstrated many times, for instance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-fact-check-nfl-debates-iran-hillary-clinton\">recently claiming that Russia would not invade Ukraine</a>, when Russian soldiers occupied Crimea over two years ago, when it comes to events beyond America\u2019s borders he is profoundly ignorant. \u201cExactly right,\u201d Singer says. \u201cBy choice and temperament both. And this is a person who brags: \u2018I know more about Isis than the generals.\u2019 This party has this quote on record when they nominated him. Guess who I don\u2019t have a whole lot of sympathy for? It\u2019s game over.\u201d Given the warp speed at which the news has moved this year however, Singer rows back: \u201cThat is the kind of stuff that is so dangerous to say I should bite my tongue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, says Singer, is the most transparent politician there has ever been: \u201cHe\u2019s only out for himself, in every way, in every gesture.\u201d One of the reasons for publishing his book, he says, was in disgust at the way journalists indulged Trump\u2019s race for the presidency because it was good for ratings and traffic. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/how-false-equivalence-is-distorting-the-2016-election-coverage/\">This notion of false equivalency</a> is not something that journalists have figured out, but it wasn\u2019t even that with Trump, it was just the celebrity and [him] using up all the oxygen. But I knew that Trump had no intention of winning, it was obvious \u2013 and here we are.\u201d</p> <p>As for many Americans, the Trump candidacy has been a draining experience for Singer. No one can turn away, Singer least of all. \u201cI just sat here and I was watching MSNBC last night until 11 o\u2019clock and I realized, I am now an addict. I\u2019m totally a junkie and I really need to have an intervention of my own, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>That sets him off on another Trumpian train of thought \u2013 those in the Republican party who think they can perform some kind of intervention. \u201cThis idea of doing an intervention with Trump is hilarious to me. These might be the last optimists in America.\u201d You can\u2019t treat people like Trump, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re incurable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president could affect the strength of the Anzus treaty and Australia\u2019s relationships in the Asia-Pacific region, former federal foreign minister and NSW premier Bob Carr has warned.</p> <p>ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night was entirely dedicated to US politics, and parallels were also drawn between the US and Australia, with rising public dissatisfaction having led to the emergence of more fringe candidates.</p> <p>Besides Carr, the panel included US anti-poverty campaigner Linda Tirado, US author and satirist PJ O\u2019Rourke, international security analyst Lydia Khalil, and US defence and politics analyst Crispin Rovere. </p> <p>Guests initially discussed the prospect of Trump having access to nuclear weapons. O\u2019Rourke described him as a \u201ctoddler\u201d but Rovere, who is writing a book on Trump, said his approach to nuclear weapons was \u201centirely mainstream and entirely consistent\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/pj-orourke-says-blame-the-elites-for-trump-and-brexit-and-vote-for-clinton\">PJ O'Rourke says blame the elites for Trump and Brexit \u2013 and vote for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe says he hates nuclear weapons. He never wants to be in a position where they might have to be used but so long as they exist he will not rule it out entirely. That\u2019s exactly the same as Barack Obama. That\u2019s exactly the same as most presidents.\u201d</p> <p>Carr said Trump\u2019s suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/06/should-more-countries-have-nuclear-weapons-donald-trump-thinks-so/\">it would not be a bad thing if Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia had nuclear weapons</a> was \u201cvery worrying\u201d.</p> <p>This was \u201cunravelling\u201d the security arrangements in the Asia Pacific which Australia was part of through the Australia, New Zealand, and US (Anzus) treaty, a collective security agreement in place since 1951.</p> <p>\u201cWe would be in the peculiar position of watching a President Trump unravel arrangements that have been considered vital to avoiding nuclear exchanges in the region in which we live and \u2026 it would really challenge us,\u201d said Carr.</p> <p>Carr noted the potential fallout should the US go through with ideas raised by Trump, suggesting it would threaten the strength of the treaty, but did not say Australia should walk back from it if Trump wins.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m suggesting first of all, the alliance works both ways, it is a running argument,\u201d said Carr.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we would be obliged to seek every opportunity to tell the Americans that inaugurating a trade war with China by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/17/china-finance-minister-trump-trade-proposal-irrational\">putting a 45% tax on American imports</a> from China would be disastrous, and telling them, as I believe, as a respected ally of the United States, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/donald-trump-north-korea-war-nuclear-weapons\">withdrawing nuclear protection from Japan and South Korea</a> would compel those countries to acquire their own nuclear weapons. Australia has something to say, and we can say it,\u201d he said, adding that he would be uncomfortable with Australian warships alongside a Trump-led US fleet in Japanese waters.</p> <p>He said the treaty was more important than any single presidency.</p> <p>Khalil, who is also a Lowy Institute fellow, said she believed the treaty was strong, but she was not \u201cblase\u201d about it.</p> <p>\u201cI spent a lot of time in my career in the Middle East and for the first time in my life I have seen those authoritarian tendencies come through Trump,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThis idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-republican-convention-speech-law-order\">\u2018I alone can fix it\u2019, that line he said during his convention</a> \u2013 that\u2019s very worrying to me. Maybe because I spent so much of my time looking at other regions of the world where this is very easy to open up, and democracy is a fragile thing, open society is a fragile thing \u2026 no international security person in the United States has come out in favour of him. They\u2019re saying he is a threat.\u201d</p> <p>It followed her earlier comments that Trump lacked an articulated position on anything, which she said made him a dangerous presidential candidate.</p> <p>\u201cWin or lose he\u2019s already set us back on the international and security front,\u201d said Khalil.</p> <p>O\u2019Rourke warned that perhaps Trump was not the real threat, but that his candidacy seemed to spark \u201can impulse to like a demagogue.\u201d</p> <p>Carr agreed Trump could be \u201cthe harbinger of something to come. It may not be this Trump, but it could be the Trump in four years time, as America becomes a society shaped by global forces that Washington can\u2019t control.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to a question about rising popular discontent with the Australian, US and UK establishments and support for Brexit, Trump, and newly reelected senator Pauline Hanson, Carr said there was a \u201cself-correcting process\u201d and Trump as president would result in \u201can enormous rethinking\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe sense of betrayal will be very rapid. How does somebody implement the promises that he has made? I think we\u2019ve seen a self-correcting process in the rise of the Green party in Australia. Its support hasn\u2019t continued to rise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look at Clive Palmer, who was seen as a bit of a demagogue, I guess. The public looked at him, the public was entertained for a period and then the public dropped him. There is no alternative here but to trust in the good sense of the voters.\u201d</p> <p>Tirado said Australians were looking at their version of the rise of the Tea party, and it would be problematic when Turnbull has to negotiate with the One Nation senators over important issues like the economy and royal commissions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we don\u2019t have the choices of pushing it one way or the other, that leads to a lot more people feeling disenfranchised\u201d.</p> <p>Khalil said the political elite had \u201cignored the losers of globalisation\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe see it here in Australia with Pauline Hanson. But you have a prime minister here who talks about innovation and how wonderful it is to be an Australian. But for many Australians, innovation is scary and no one is addressing these concerns of voters. There is a crisis with the middle class in the States \u2013 there\u2019s opiate addictions, high mortality rates and no-one outside of it are addressing those concerns. They have a voice in Trump \u2013 a narcissistic, crazy one, but they have a voice in Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Evan McMullin, a little-known former CIA operative, is launching a third-party bid for president as a conservative alternative to Donald Trump.<br></p> <p>The independent run, first reported by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/anti-trump-republican-launching-independent-presidential-bid?utm_term=.ptQANWqd5#.jgbkXQ4e1\">BuzzFeed</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/762624156211023872?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe</a>, comes as a faction of Republicans remain reticent to embrace Trump as the party\u2019s presidential nominee.</p> <p>McMullin, who until recently was employed as the chief policy director of the House Republican Conference, told ABC News there was still time to mount a campaign that could prove to be a spoiler in certain GOP-leaning states where <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/donald-trump-committed-fans-poll-drop-us-election\">Trump has lost ground in recent polls</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn a year where Americans have lost faith in the candidates of both major parties, it\u2019s time for a generation of new leadership to step up,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us.</p> <p>\u201cI humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for president.\u201d</p> <p>A \u201cMcMullin for President\u201d campaign fundraising website has been set up at <a href=\"http://www.evanmcmullin.com/\">EvanMcMullin.com</a>, which features a picture of McMullin with the text: \u201cStanding up to run for president because it\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d </p> <p>McMullin\u2019s candidacy is being pushed by backers of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, which formed before the former reality TV star wrapped up the Republican nomination but has struggled until now to field an alternative candidate. </p> <p>Better for America, a group formed by Never Trump proponents, indicated that some influential Republicans would come out in support of McMullin following his announcement. He is expected to file paperwork on Monday afternoon, but would nonetheless face hurdles getting on the ballot in states where the deadline has already passed.</p> <p>Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist who counts himself among the Never Trump ranks, said it was important to have a candidate \u201cdraw a distinction between Trump and conservatism\u201d regardless of the odds. </p> <p>\u201cThere are clear and obvious hurdles to an independent run at this point, especially not being a household name, but I assume they are well aware of them and I\u2019ll withhold judgment and keep an open mind,\u201d said Cooper, who served as an aide to former House majority leader Eric Cantor. </p> <p>\u201cThe next generation of leaders need to step up and start making a difference or conservatism will be electorally challenged for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Cooper indicates, McMullin holds little name recognition even among Republicans in Washington.

  "<p><strong>Now that we are in August, has there been a big trend for summer 2016?<br></strong><em>Mia, N1</em></p> <p>Indeed there is, Mia, and it\u2019s one that I only cottoned on to after the US political conventions \u2013 not, it has to be said, usually a hotbed of fashion trends. I don\u2019t want to be mean about American politicians (well, not all of them), but let\u2019s put it this way: they don\u2019t tend to give Milan fashion week too many paroxysms of insecurity when it comes to carving out the look of the season.</p> <p>And yet, a trend most definitely came from, of all places, Pittsburgh and Cleveland \u2013 and that trend is white. I first noticed this during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\">Melania Trump\u2019s karaoke version of Michelle Obama\u2019s speech</a> during the Republican National Convention, when she wore a white Roksanda dress that was a lot more impressive than anything that came out of her mouth. It was also, I thought, not very Melania. I have made it my mission over the past decade to acquaint myself with the ways of Melania, just as I did with Donald Trump\u2019s previous two wives, all of them fascinating in their own ways. Each of his wives was perfect for the decade in which they married him: Ivana, with her shoulder pads and open love of wealth, was like a human embodiment of the 80s; Marla Maples looked like a cast member of Baywatch or Melrose Place, making her perfect for the 90s. Then there\u2019s Melania, with her frankly terrifying smoky-eye makeup and permanently blown-out hair: so very 21st century. She looks, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll take this as an insult, like an assassin in a Bourne movie, or maybe an Austin Powers film, or possibly even Zoolander. Anyway, the soft femininity of the Roksanda dress was so strikingly different from Melania\u2019s usual fembot style (which can be summed up as tight and pointy with brass detailings) that I knew something was up. As, indeed, it was: white was up.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/emotion-watching-hillary-clinton-woman-candidate-for-president\">Hillary Clinton then wore a white pantsuit at the DNC</a>, a nod, apparently, to white being the colour of the suffragettes. Rather amusingly, Congresswoman <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-daily-briefing/2016/07/290716-why-everyone-is-talking-about-joyce-beatty-dress.html\">Joyce Beatty wore the same white dress as Melania to the DNC</a>, and not only did she look better in it, she also reminded everyone about what is now referred to as the Melania Incident. So 2-0 to Congresswoman Beatty.</p> <p>Finally, this week, Michelle Obama wore a sleeveless <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/08/02/michelle-obama-singapore-state-dinner-brandon-maxwell/87979666/\">full-length white dress to a state dinner for the prime minister of Singapore</a>. I like to think Queen Obama chose this as an homage to the <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1872988,00.html\">full-length white dress by Jason Wu</a> that she wore to the Inaugural Ball in a kinda \u201cRemember that night? Well, now we are outta here! You\u2019re gonna miss us, guys!\u201d way.</p> <p>White really is the ultimate power colour. We can talk about its references to purity, saintliness and all other words that are just synonyms for virginity until the white cows come home. But the truth is, what it is about now is a woman who wants to be noticed, doesn\u2019t care if her thighs look fat and doesn\u2019t give a damn about her dry-cleaning bill. Now, if that isn\u2019t a power statement, I don\u2019t know what is. And that\u2019s what summer 2016 is all about, fashion-wise: ladies not giving a good goddamn, whether it\u2019s about breaking glass ceilings or blatantly ripping off someone else\u2019s speech on the international stage.</p> <p>Ah well, win some, lose some, eh, ladies?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad0350165c9f4371489344c504545d910ac033b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad0350165c9f4371489344c504545d910ac033b2/0_0_3808_4760/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jessica Parker ... not a feminist.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Jessica Parker ... not a feminist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lovekin/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker has disowned feminism.

I mean, I know this column is called Ask Hadley, but it\u2019s hard to know how to answer this question, at least without being blatantly rude. To recap, <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a21886/sarah-jessica-parker-september-2016-cover/\">Parker was interviewed in Marie Claire</a> and was asked if she considers herself a feminist. \u201cI am not a feminist,\u201d she replied, to the sound of a million heads falling on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of separation. I just want people to be treated equally.\u201d</p> <p>You know, when Andrea Leadsom said something similar last month, I honestly didn\u2019t mind. \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist because I\u2019m not anti-men ... <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/andrea-leadson-feminist-feminism-times_uk_5780f9eee4b074297db31b28\">Feminism is a term that has been used to abuse men, so I don\u2019t identify with it</a>,\u201d quoth Andrea, in the now infamous interview that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-pulls-out-of-race\">ended up torpedoing her leadership bid</a>. And the reason I didn\u2019t mind is because I didn\u2019t expect her to know better: she\u2019s a Tory MP who looks like she hangs out at private golf clubs in Surrey. I never thought she would be up on her Dworkin. But SJP, for God\u2019s sake. You live in Manhattan, you starred in a show that was in some ways a feminist landmark, you have \u2013 I assume \u2013 New York friends. How could you have got to the age of 51 and still be saying things like this without hitting yourself in the face? There\u2019s nothing surprising about a celebrity saying something stupid \u2013 the truth is that most celebrities are stupid. But for a woman who grew up in the 70s, lives in a modern metropolitan city and hangs out with writers and artists to not understand that feminism is about equality, well, that takes some serious effort. Well done, SJP. You win the coveted crown of Ask Hadley\u2019s Numpty of the Month.</p>",
  "<p>With <em>The Fate of Gender</em>, US science reporter and author Frank Browning (<em>The Culture of Desire</em>, <em>A Queer Geography</em>) has written a very complicated book because\u2026 it\u2019s a very complicated subject. There\u2019s a lot more to gender than just endless snits about \u201cblue toys for boys and pink toys for girls\u201d, and Browning not only acknowledges the myriad different strands (and micro-strands), he does a near-heroic job of weaving them together to produce a compelling&#xa0;narrative.</p> <p>Split into sections and then chapters, <em>The Fate of Gender</em> examines subjects as diverse as gender as a construct and a performance, as opposed to a biological reality, the neuroscience of \u201cmale\u201d/\u201cfemale\u201d brains, the notion of masculinity and femininity being fluid rather than set, and distinctions between genders not so much vanishing as splintering and restructuring into new forms. As Browning says, Lady Gaga\u2019s supportive message in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw\" title=\"\">Born This Way</a> may actually be far too rigid for the lifelong fluctuations some people experience with their gender identity. According to some of his interviewees, some people are born one way, then end up being quite another way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Browning does an admirable job of distilling highly complex, dense information into an intriguing, accessible form</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, taking in everything from gender-free nurseries in Scandinavia and pregnancy surrogates&#xa0;for gay parents in Los Angeles, to female masturbation clinics in China (not quite as saucy as it sounds) and frazzled female trailblazers in Silicon Valley, Browning investigates the effects on families and children as gay parenting becomes part of the norm, how unbridled female sexuality has historically threatened male-dominated culture, and how women are redefining established power structures in the workplace and everywhere else (and, says Browning,&#xa0;starting to get the \u201cmale\u201d ulcers to go with it).</p> <p>Browning also looks into how some sectors of previously dominant male culture are prone to reacting to all these huge changes. Clue: often rather badly. Browning quotes <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/essays/21649050-badly-educated-men-rich-countries-have-not-adapted-well-trade-technology-or-feminism\" title=\"\">from the <em>Economist</em></a>: \u201cBadly educated men in rich countries have not adapted well to trade, technology or feminism.\u201d As evidenced, perhaps, by the polarised US election race (touched upon by Browning in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/11/donald-trump-fate-of-gender-frank-browning-book-us-election\" title=\"\">a separate media interview</a>), where all too often the appeal of \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d Donald Trump is played off against the \u201cshrill\u201d, \u201cshrewish\u201d \u201cball-breaker\u201d Hillary Clinton, seemingly with no more nuance required. While this is a simplistic assessment (lots of women like Trump and lots of men dislike him), there seems little doubt that, here, the gender factor is being played out on a global political stage.</p> <p>All this before even getting on to the topic of transgender/transsexual people and their increasing visibility, politicisation, acceptance, and power, across the spectrum, which, as Browning points out, would have been unthinkable even just a decade ago. Again it isn\u2019t as simple as Caitlyn (previously Bruce) Jenner making it on to the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em>. It\u2019s a highly complex subject: transvestite is not the same as transgender, is not the same as transsexual, is not the same as hermaphrodite, and so on\u2026 Browning attempts to simplify and demystify the subject, talking in depth to transgender and transsexual individuals, bringing in trans children and their issues, and also intersex children (where surgical interventions, which used to happen as babies, are now postponed).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/jul/29/token-podcast-coming-soon\">Token podcast: coming soon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are points in <em>The Fate of Gender</em> where Browning seems to expound too heavily on some aspects (for instance, the practical details of surrogacy), while failing to give similar length and depth to others (such as feminist objections to surrogacy \u2013 viewed by some as a rent-a-womb abuse of women). Moreover, some feminists reject the idea of trans women (as women). I would have liked to hear more about this from Browning, not only concerning the intricate arguments, but also on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/27/germaine-greer-transphobia-cardiff-feminism-inclusive\" title=\"\">toxic, counterproductive stifling of debate</a>, which in this country, led to the likes of Germaine Greer and Julie Bindel being banned from certain public speaking forums because of their dissenting views.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Browning does an admirable job of distilling highly complex, dense information into an intriguing, accessible form that avoids straying into pop science. <em>The Fate of Gender</em> doesn\u2019t pronounce gender dead or make any other pronouncements (\u201cDoes that suggest that what we are now witnessing in the gender arena is the first wave of massive transexualisation of humanity?\u201d asks Browning. \u201cHardly.\u201d)</p> <p>Instead, the book signposts a new reality \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t discount maleness (Browning highlights the comparative fragility of men, from cradle to grave, and observes that emerging studies on maleness are as exciting as the ones on femaleness), but eschews blind attachment to any inflexible notions of gender models, echoing the Denis Diderot mindset, that little in nature is fixed. <em>The Fate of Gender</em> emerges as a fascinating (and yes, complicated) book, in which the vast majority of readers could be assured of learning something.</p> <p><em>The Fate of Gender is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/fate-of-gender.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a><em> </em></p>",
