  "<p>A mysterious online group called the Shadow Brokers claims to have infiltrated an elite hacking unit linked to the National Security Agency and stolen state \u201ccyber weapons\u201d, and is now auctioning them off to the highest bidder.</p> <p>The stolen malware is said to belong to Equation Group, a sophisticated hacking team <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/\">believed to be operated by the NSA</a>. So far, the Shadow Brokers have only released a <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/hackers-hack-nsa-linked-equation-group\">few taster files</a> and images of the cache, but <a href=\"https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/the-shadow-brokers-lifting-the-shadows-of-the-nsas-equation-group/\">security researchers</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@msuiche/shadow-brokers-nsa-exploits-of-the-week-3f7e17bdc216#.i9wx333t6\">said they appear to be legitimate</a>.</p> <p>The leak, announced in broken English by the group in a series of posts on Twitter, Tumblr, Pastebin and Github, was accompanied by claims that the group was in possession of state-sponsored \u201ccyber weapons\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than Stuxnet,\u201d said the group, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/\">sophisticated digital weapon</a>, believed to be funded by the US and Israel, that sabotaged Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. The hackers are asking for a whopping 1m bitcoins, which is around $580m, to release the best files.</p> <p>The files and pictures of the cache that were offered for free as \u201cproof\u201d include filenames correspond to those mentioned in documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, including \u201cBANANAGLEE\u201d, \u201cJETPLOW\u201d and \u201cEPICBANANA\u201d. There are also a number of hacking tools used for penetrating network gear including routers and firewalls created by major companies like Cisco and Juniper \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html\">spy tools which it is already known the NSA uses</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68f21bb8b4ad4703370c284d7853cae17320e4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68f21bb8b4ad4703370c284d7853cae17320e4bf/0_0_856_394/500.jpg\" alt=\"Evidence of the NSA \u2018hack\u2019, as released by mysterious group the Shadow Brokers.\" width=\"500\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evidence of the NSA \u2018hack\u2019, as released by mysterious group the Shadow Brokers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Shadow Brokers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese files are not fully fake for sure,\u201d said security researcher Bencs\u00e1th Boldizs\u00e1r, who is credited with discovering the state-sponsored Flame malware, in an <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/group-claims-to-hack-nsa-tied-hackers-posts-exploits-as-proof/\">interview with Ars Technica</a>. </p> <p>\u201cMost likely they are part of the NSA toolset, judging just by the volume and peeps into the samples. At first glance it is sound that these are important attack-related files, and yes, the first guess would be Equation Group.\u201d</p> <p>Kaspersky Lab, the security company that first <a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2015/equation-group-the-crown-creator-of-cyber-espionage\">exposed Equation Group\u2019s cyber-espionage in 2015</a>, has published a <a href=\"https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/75812/the-equation-giveaway/\">detailed blogpost</a> showing a \u201cstrong connection\u201d between the files found in the leak and their earlier findings about Equation Group. Kaspersky has found encryption algorithms among more than 300 files in the Shadow Brokers\u2019 cache used in a way that has only been seen before in Equation Group malware. </p> <p>\u201cThe chances of all these being faked or engineered is highly unlikely,\u201d says the security company.</p> <p>Although this sounds like a nightmare for the NSA on the face of it, a number of researchers have pointed out that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the NSA has been hacked directly. The leaked information is more likely to come from a compromised system outside the NSA\u2019s networks that was hosting NSA malware. If the Shadow Brokers really did have access to the NSA\u2019s network, they wouldn\u2019t blow their cover with a leak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/creative83/status/765418187974475776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Access to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSA?src=hash\">#NSA</a> would be too valuable to spoil in a leak.

He suggests that it is a Russian-originated attack designed to expose evidence of NSA cyber warfare activities. </p> <p>\u201cWhy did they do it? No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514740747669505\">he posted</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThis leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

  "<p> US trucks will produce 10% less carbon dioxide and consume 10% less fuel within a decade under the last major plank of Barack Obama\u2019s climate policy.</p> <p>The second phase of a new benchmark for medium- and large-sized trucks will cut more than 1bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and 2bn barrels of oil use, the Environment Protection Agency announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>In fact, US heavy duty vehicles should emit at least 16% less CO2 than their European counterparts under the new rule, according to an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) last month, which the Guardian has seen.</p> <p> Gina McCarthy, the EPA\u2019s administrator, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is very clear that we are going to be moving out well ahead of any other country in the development of these standards. We will be driving these technologies and as result we will benefit from them more than any other country.\u201d</p> <p>Although medium and heavy duty lorries only make up 4% of road traffic, they also suck up 22% of US oil transport demand, and that figure is rising fast.</p> <p>The emissions cut from honing their fuel economy would be \u201croughly equal to the greenhouse gases associated with the electricity and power use from all US residences for one year\u201d, McCarthy said. </p> <p>Under the new rule, heavy duty trucks made in 2027 will be 25% more carbon efficient than models built in 2018, saving drivers $170bn in fuel costs and creating a $230bn net benefit to society, the EPA said.</p> <p>The standard is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-transportation/2016/08/waiting-on-truck-emissions-mandates-215873\">thought unlikely</a> to deliver the fuel savings of 54.5 miles a gallon promised by Obama in his first term. A boom in sales of trucks and sports-utility vehicles triggered by cheap gasoline prices may have pushed that out of reach.</p> <p>But it was still hailed as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d for future generations by Anthony Foxx, the US transport secretary. </p> <p>The commercial vehicles rule will apply to semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses and work trucks, and cut fuel costs by about $170bn, according to the EPA. It will be phased in over three stages, in 2021, 2024 and 2027. </p> <p>Brussels will pay close attention to the new law, after <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/strategies/news/doc/2016-07-20-decarbonisation/com(2016)501_en.pdf\">an EU proposal for similar post-2020 targets</a> last month pledged to regulate trucks for the first time.</p> <p>One European car industry source told the Guardian: \u201cThis announcement is obviously good news for the climate and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\">the INDC commitments</a> made by the world\u2019s states in Paris. But it is important for car manufacturers that \u2013 as well as a framework and visibility \u2013 we are given the time to implement [the rule].\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy said that aspects of the proposal might be seen as \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d in some industry quarters, but that the EPA believed they \u201chit the absolute sweet spot,\u201d balancing cost-effective emissions and fuel-saving reductions. </p> <p> Heavy goods vehicles <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/index_en.htm\">make up 6% of Europe\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions</a> \u2013 more than aviation or international shipping.</p> <p> Between 1990 and 2010 their emissions soared by 36%, and EU officials see little chance of a decline without policy action, which they have pledged to bring forward before the end of 2017.</p> <p>A limit of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre has already been set for cars by 2021 and campaigners warn that if European trucks do not follow the American example, they will soon be overtaken in the clean vehicles race.<br></p> <p> \u201cThis is as much about environmental leadership as about innovation,\u201d said Stef Cornelis, the cleaner and safer trucks officer at the Transport and Environment campaign group.</p> <p> \u201cIf the EU wants to remain the world\u2019s leader in truck manufacturing, it should table a fuel efficiency standard for trucks in 2017 with a more ambitious 2025 target than the US one. Anything less will mean further stagnation for trucks made in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Europe is currently the largest heavy duty vehicle market without efficiency standards. </p> <p>The ICCT forecasts that the EU bloc will fall behind the US in tractor-trailer efficiency in 2020. By 2030, HDVs will account for 45% of Europe\u2019s on-road emissions by 2030, on present trends.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has denied multiple reports that disgraced Fox News creator Roger Ailes has been brought in to help the candidate prepare to face Hillary Clinton on the debate stage next month.</p> <p>\u201cHe is not advising Mr Trump or helping with debate prep,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to the Guardian on Tuesday, referring to Ailes. \u201cThey are longtime friends, but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Ailes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">resigned last month from</a> the network he co-founded and ran for 20 years, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-fox-news-ideology-conservative-baby-boomers\">allegations that he sexually harassed numerous subordinates</a>, including former host Gretchen Carlson and star anchor Megyn Kelly.

The 2014 fringe was full of plays about what it would mean if Scotland voted to leave the UK, while the 2015 listings were filled with reflections on the consequences of the remain vote.</p> <p>But, when the scripts for this year were being written, the laptop screen in front of a playwright was a cloudy crystal ball. As the official fringe programme went to press in the spring, the EU referendum was still weeks away, it was not yet certain that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would be the US presidential nominees, and it was commonly held that Jeremy Corbyn was unlikely to still be leading the Labour party by the summer.</p> <p>So a political writer needed to be either extremely brave or prophetic. The stand-up comics, well used to the necessity of topicality, have been able to adjust. The journalist-performer Viv Groskop\u2019s show, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/viv-groskop-be-more-margo\">Be More Margo</a> (Stand 3 &amp; 4), now has \u201cPost-Brexit Edition\u201d stamped across the posters , its theme of social climbing having been tweaked for Theresa May\u2019s Britain.</p> <p>Occupying even more scorched earth, Bridget Christie \u2013 whose 11am gigs at the Stand comedy club have become an Edinburgh must-see; this week\u2019s returns queue was almost as long the one for the ticketed \u2013 has kept the title, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bridget-christie-mortal\">Mortal</a>, of her planned show about facing up to death.

Anecdotes about her potted fuchsias become metaphors for xenophobia, culminating in two of Christie\u2019s signature turbo-riffs, when the pace and weight of words seems to threaten her with asphyxia, about Nigel Farage and Michael Gove.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e86be809bcb7057a37f5bb9963de7d6c01a346a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e86be809bcb7057a37f5bb9963de7d6c01a346a/126_525_4754_5942/800.jpg\" alt=\"Viv Groskop.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viv Groskop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plays, however, are harder to change. There seem to be more cancelled productions than usual this year, including Party Time, an advertised drama about a politician suffering meltdown in a TV interview. And, although no-shows can be due to logistical or economic reasons, it was tempting to wonder, walking round the city this week, if the lengths of gaffer tape obscuring now empty time-slots outside venues covered up time-expired dramas such as Cameron Remains, Angela Eagle Takes Off!, Governor Scott Walker for President and A Night With John Whittingdale.</p> <p>One gamble with history that has paid off is the return of one of last year\u2019s hits, David Benson\u2019s portrayal of the cabinet\u2019s only surviving Old Etonian in Tom Crawshaw\u2019s play <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/boris-world-king\">Boris: World King</a> (Pleasance Dome). There must have been a moment on 30 June, after BoJo\u2019s withdrawal from the leadership race, when Benson and Crawshaw feared they were sending a white (haired) elephant to Edinburgh. But the politician\u2019s unexpected resurrection at the Foreign Office means Boris has instead more or less achieved the show\u2019s subtitle.</p> <p> Benson, under a blond dish-mop wig, has verbally and physically perfected his portrayal of the politician\u2019s ruthlessly calculated spontaneity, and a daring tonal shift in the script \u2013 a furious moral interlude in which the audience is warned that Johnson may not be as harmless as his rumpled buffoonery suggests \u2013 has even more force when aimed at the holder of one of the great offices of state.</p> <p>Another presentation that has benefited from a change in context is <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mrs-roosevelt-flies-to-london\">Mrs Roosevelt Flies to London</a> (Assembly Hall). Written and performed by Alison Skilbeck, this monologue about the former first lady\u2019s morale-raising trip to the UK in 1942 has had a previous life, and was always a moving and bravura performance. But with the advance on the White House of Hillary Clinton, who has admitted to having imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt about women in politics, the show has gained an extra resonance.

In December 2015, rival candidate Ted Cruz was stealing Trump\u2019s thunder by saying the US was now \u201cat war\u201d because of the San Bernardino attacks. Trump had to one-up his competition, so he proposed a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering this country\u201d, and everyone forgot about Cruz for the moment.</p> <p>Then, after the public debated the constitutionality of a religion-based ban, Trump later announced that he would instead \u201csuspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies\u201d. Are we to assume that Trump isn\u2019t opposed to terrorism per se but only terrorism against the US and its friends?</p> <p>And by July, he stated that he would bar entry to those coming from \u201cterritories and terror states and terror nations\u201d, whatever that means. In the intervening months, as the website <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/\">thinkprogress.org</a> has <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/gops-attempt-to-soften-trump-s-language-on-a-muslim-ban-derailed-by-trump-himself-74beba29977b#.8wnlw5wxp\">pointed</a> out, he has exempted from the ban his own friends who are Muslim, Muslim Americans in the military, Muslim world leaders and Muslim athletes. Trump\u2019s Muslim ban has been remixed almost as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01sn5gv\">often</a> as Change the Beat by Fab 5 Freddy.</p> <p>The latest version of this failed immigration policy has Trump tilting back to the days of the cold war. Proposing an \u201cideological screening test\u201d, Trump now says that his program of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d will screen out those who \u201cdo not share our values and respect our people\u201d. Going further than his past proposals, Trump now demands we bar those \u201cwho have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles \u2013 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to take any of this seriously. Trump is proposing that the freedoms of immigrants, and especially Muslims, entering this country be curtailed to the point that they cannot hold \u201chostile attitudes\u201d. But who is to decide when an attitude is hostile enough to warrant exclusion? Do we really expect the authorities to patrol not only our borders but also our thoughts? Does Donald Trump, of all people, not realize that you might say contradictory things about any given topic just to get ahead?</p> <p>Trump\u2019s precedent for this absurdity is the old McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, which sought to ban communist thought from the country, but which ended up keeping such notable people as Nobel-prize winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, French actor Yves Montand and Canadian politician Pierre Elliot Trudeau from crossing our borders.</p> <p>\u201cIt made us look to the rest of the world like a people other than the people we are\u201d is how the late US senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan characterized the policy. \u201cIt misrepresented America. It said we\u2019re afraid of ideas, can\u2019t handle them, don\u2019t like people speaking their minds. That\u2019s not who we are at all.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s unworkable policy proposal will further alienate Muslims around the world because it tells them they are guilty until they can prove to him they are innocent. It also insults all immigrants by policing their thoughts and beliefs and every citizen by suggesting we can\u2019t think for ourselves. For a man who says he bravely stands up to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, Donald Trump seems awfully ready to enshrine it into law. </p>",
  "<p>As Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers have dropped in recent weeks, bashing the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/08/14/trump_blames_disgusting_and_corrupt_media_for_weak_poll_numbers.html\">\u201cdisgusting and corrupt\u201d</a> media has become the centerpiece of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not running against Crooked Hillary, I\u2019m running against the crooked media,\u201d he<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/291377-trump-im-running-against-media-not-clinton\"> said at a rally</a> in Fairfield, Connecticut, over the weekend.</p> <p>His campaign is indeed a place where journalistic objectivity meets its limits, but it\u2019s not because we\u2019re deliberately gunning for him. There simply is no fairness in presenting both sides of a story when one side is consistently rubbish, to put it kindly, or a dumpster fire, in this cycle\u2019s parlance. Trump changes his mind like it\u2019s the weather and tells a lie every five minutes, going by Politico\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-fact-check-errors-exaggerations-falsehoods-213730#ixzz42sQo6zu6\">best count</a>.<br></p> <p>Different outlets have handled Trump\u2019s unique challenge in different ways, but generally it means working harder.</p> <p>CNN and MSNBC have taken to <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/msnbc-uses-chyron-to-fact-check-donald-trumps-erroneous-claims-in-real-time/\">putting parentheticals</a> in their chyrons to correct erroneous claims in real time. The New York Times has started including the sweep of history in even the most straightforward news stories to demonstrate breaks from longstanding political norms.</p> <p>The fact-checkers, in particular, are working overtime.</p> <p>The Associated Press and most major television networks have started fact-checking virtually every speech he gives, something they didn\u2019t do in previous cycles. No fewer than<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/06/22/true-fact-checking-a-single-donald-trump-speech-required-10-ap-writers/?utm_term=.b031f87a914e\"> 12 AP reporters</a> were required to fact-check a single speech he gave earlier this summer, which they found to be \u201crife with distortion\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s also been keeping Politifact busy. As of late June,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/29/fact-checking-2016-clinton-trump/\"> 95 of the site\u2019s 158 fact-checks of Trump</a> were rated \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cpants on fire\u201d, while the same could be said for just 16% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 120 rated statements.</p> <p>Even the typically staid Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, is at his wit\u2019s end. He called <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/09/trumps-remarkable-suggestion-that-clintons-emails-led-to-an-iranian-defectors-death/\">one recent Trump comment</a> \u201camong the stupidest claims made so far in this campaign\u201d.</p> <p>A comment like Kessler\u2019s isn\u2019t evidence of bias; it\u2019s an example of telling it like it is. What\u2019s actually biased is mindless he-said, she-said reporting \u2013 and to allow such reporting is to allow a bias in Trump\u2019s favor, because so much of what he says isn\u2019t true.<br></p> <p>Of course, that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from \u2013 wait for it \u2013 lying about reporters. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it \u2013 the liberal media can\u2019t stop telling outrageous lies about me,\u201d he wrote in a recent fundraising email.</p> <p>The flip side of Trump continually lambasting media outlets is that he also reads coverage obsessively, calling his campaign manager \u201cseveral times a day\u201d to discuss specific stories, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-gop.html?_r=0\">according to</a> the New York Times. The adulation of anything he deems to be flattering coverage is also quite possibly as unprecedented as all else in his campaign. </p> <p>As he put it at a rally in Radford earlier this year,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/trump-rally-photographer-secret-service-protests\"> \u201cabout 80%\u201d</a> of reporters are worse than the \u201csleazebags\u201d he works with in politics. The political press, he added, is \u201cthe worst of all\u201d.</p> <p>By saying there are still a few non-sleazebag journalists, he\u2019s left room for those who would tell the stories he wants told. Don\u2019t trust the media, just the members of the media writing nice things about me, he seem to be saying.</p> <p>What\u2019s less straightforward is what Trump perceives to be flattering. Take, for instance, the story of Tony Schwartz.</p> <p>In 1985, the then New York magazine writer Schwartz wrote a piece describing Trump as \u2013<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\"> by Schwartz\u2019s own recollection</a> \u2013 \u201ca ham-fisted thug who had unsuccessfully tried to evict rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants from a building that he had bought\u201d. To his surprise, Trump, who was then trying to burnish his tough-guy image, was so taken with the piece he hung it on his wall. Trump especially loved that \u201ceverybody seemed to have read it\u201d, as he later gushed to Schwartz in a note on gold-embossed stationery. Soon after, he\u2019d entice Schwartz to leave journalism and ghostwrite the myth-making book Art of the Deal.</p> <p>Schwartz recounted all this in a New Yorker piece about how he regrets his role in creating the legend of Trump as a charmer and savvy businessman. He stated openly that he\u2019d never forgive himself if Trump were elected president. \u201cI genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes, there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\"> he wrote</a>.</p> <p>For journalists, that story is more than good reading \u2013 it\u2019s a cautionary tale: the moment we buy into Trump\u2019s notions about what constitutes biased versus unbiased coverage, we buy into the logic of a master propagandist.</p> <p>Voters should understand that, too.</p> <p>To have a low opinion of Trump\u2019s suitability for higher office, to write critically about him regardless of how many journalistic outlets he blacklists in retaliation, is not a mark of bias \u2013 it\u2019s a badge of honor. And journalists tellingly boast about it as such.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s right that the media does not have a high opinion of his political fitness, but he\u2019s wrong that that makes us corrupt. Our low opinion is well-founded, undergirded by ample facts, historical evidence and morality. It means we\u2019re doing our job, not his ghostwriter\u2019s.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 August 2016. An earlier version said 95% of the Politifact\u2019s 158 fact-checks of Trump were rated \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cpants on fire\u201d. That has been corrected to 95 of 158.</p>",

  "<p>Black and Latino women will lose more than $877,000 and $1m respectively over a 40-year career compared to their white male counterparts, according to <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resources/the-lifetime-wage-gap-by-state-for-african-american-women/\">a report</a> by the National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC). </p> <p>The report, which breaks down the gender wage gap by race and state, found that in 2014, <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/resources/the-lifetime-wage-gap-by-state-for-latinas/\">Latina women</a> earned between 54 and 55 cents for every dollar that white men made. This amounts to a 40-year career wage gap of $1,007,080 on average. Latina women lose more than a million dollars over their careers in 23 states, including the District of Columbia where the gap is highest at $1,781,720. </p> <p>\u201cA big driver of the wage gap is the gap in opportunities that push Latinas and African American women into different occupations than white men. Latina women and African American women are over-represented in low-wage jobs, for example, and under-represented in high-paying occupations like law and engineering,\u201d said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at NWLC.</p> <p>The report comes a week before African American Equal Pay Day, which takes place on the day black women catch up to white men\u2019s pay from 2015. Latina Equal Pay Day takes place in November.</p> <p>In 2014, black women earned 60 cents for every dollar earned by white men. That means that the average black woman would have to work 20 months to earn what a white man earns in 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cAfrican American women shouldn\u2019t need to work more than 66 years to earn what a white man earns in 40 years,\u201d said Martin. \u201c If we don\u2019t act now to ensure equal pay, for many women of color, the cost of the lifetime wage gap will surpass a million dollars. We literally can\u2019t afford to ignore this.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are six states, including the District of Columbia, where the gap has already surpassed $1m:</p> <ul> <li><strong>District of Columbia: </strong>$1,595,200<br></li> <li><strong>New Jersey:</strong> $1,231,600<br></li> <li><strong>Connecticut:</strong> $1,140,400<br></li> <li><strong>Louisiana:</strong> $1,134,880<br></li> <li><strong>California:</strong> $1,046,960<br></li> <li><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> $1,022,440</li> </ul> <p>According to NWLC, even black women with a high level of education still experience a wage gap. \u201cAfrican American women with a bachelor\u2019s degree typically make $46,825 per year \u2013 only $1,849 more than white men with only a high school degree,\u201d NWLC pointed out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-day-minimum-wage-gender-gap\">Calling for equal pay, Hillary Clinton shares little about her own experience</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year when celebrating equal pay day for all women, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called for more transparency around pay in the private sector and expressed her support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. The legislation, which says that workers who talk about their pay with coworkers cannot be fired or retaliated against, has been introduced in every Congress since 1997. While serving in the US Senate, Clinton co-sponsored the bill during the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 sessions.</p> <p>\u201cIf talking about equal pay and paid leave and more opportunities for women and girls is playing the gender card, then deal me in,\u201d she said earlier this year on Equal Pay Day, which took place on the one-year anniversary of her presidential campaign. </p> <p>While speaking at the Republican national convention, Ivanka Trump surprised many when she said that her father, too, will fight for equal pay for women. </p> <p>\u201cHe will fight for equal pay for equal work,\u201d said Trump, daughter of the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. </p> <p>Trump has previously spoken in support of equal pay without committing to any policies or expressing support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. </p> <p>\u201cIf they do the same job they should get the same pay,\u201d Trump <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump-on-equal-pay-509295171617\">said</a> last year while appearing on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to say what\u2019s the same job.

On Monday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign leapt on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">a report in the New York Times</a> that handwritten ledgers found in the Ukraine show $12.7m in undisclosed payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a serious matter and there are real concerns about the pro-Kremlin interests engaged with the Trump team,\u201d said Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook.</p> <p>Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. A source who worked with him in Ukraine said on Tuesday: \u201cIf there was cash I would have known about it and seen it. I was going in and out of the Party of Regions HQ every day.\u201d </p> <p>Even before the latest allegations, Trump\u2019s links to Russia have raised eyebrows: Manafort\u2019s candidate has expressed admiration for Putin, encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and appeared unaware that Russian troops had seized the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If he can make Yanukovych president, I\u2019m sure he can do it with Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Oleg Voloshin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the Trump campaign was reportedly instrumental in rewriting the new Republican platform to remove calls for the donation of weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces.</p> <p>It remains unclear how much of this was down to Manafort. What is indisputable is that at the same time as he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort was also building personal business links with some of the most powerful figures in the post-Soviet world.<br></p> <p>Before his arrival in Kiev, Manafort had long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">specialised in taking on unsavoury clients</a>, such as Ferdinand Marcos, the Filipino dictator, and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and subtly retooling their public reputations. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df/0_84_4199_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has expressed admiration for Putin and encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was recruited to work in Ukraine in the summer of 2005 by the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov \u2013 the main financial backer of Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions. </p> <p>That autumn, Manafort and his team \u2013 including longtime aide Rick Gates, another future Trump hire \u2013 began work for the Party of Regions. They rented an anonymous office at number 4 Sophia Street in Kiev, opposite the stop for the 16 and 18 trolley buses. Typically, its white blinds were drawn.</p> <p>The Americans kept a low profile, but Manafort\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t go entirely unnoticed. In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington, US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation. \u201cLong a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019,\u201d they observed.</p> <p>The party had enlisted \u201chelp and advice from veteran K street political tacticians\u201d, the diplomats said, referring to Washington DC\u2019s lobbying district. Manafort\u2019s firm \u2013 Davis, Manafort &amp; Freedman \u2013 was busy \u201cnipping and tucking\u201d. Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a \u201clegitimate political force\u201d.</p> <p>I met Manafort in September 2007, on the eve of the Ostroh rally. This was just before the parliamentary elections, and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopter. </p> <p>Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist. He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client \u2013 even their hairstyles were similar. (Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovych to blow-dry his hair. Manafort\u2019s camp denies this.)</p> <p>The American had an interesting story to tell \u2013 one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.<br></p> <p>The new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English \u2013 and was even playing tennis with the US ambassador.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004,\u201d Manafort told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all the situation here.\u201d <br></p> <p>Yanukovych was no puppet of Putin, Manafort said; he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy \u2013 good relations with Russia and the EU. </p> <p>\u201cAs a person, he [Yanukovych] is growing,\u201d Manafort assured me. \u201cI think the time out of power helped him.\u201d</p> <p>Manafort introduced professional techniques. He gathered polling data, worked on messaging and distributed talking points. His efforts were at least partially successful: Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections, and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff. Within a few months, it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange Revolution. </p> <p>Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power: the courts, parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/sergii-leshchenko/two-worlds-of-viktor-yanukovych%E2%80%99s-ukraine\">the media and TV</a>. Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed; Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her release. </p> <p>In late 2013, Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union, but at the last minute he dumped the plan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/ukraine-russia-leaders-talks-kremlin-loan-deal\">instead accepted a $15bn Kremlin bailout</a>. </p> <p>Pro-EU demonstrators flooded the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s main square, and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forces.</p> <p>In February 2014, riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev.

Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea</a>, further fueling tensions in the region.<br></p> <p>Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovych\u2019s 2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.</p> <p>Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort\u2019s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)</p> <p>He suggests that Yanukovych \u201clistened to what Paul said\u201d between 2007-2010, but then, once he became president, stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s advice was always non-ideological, Voloshin recalls. He would calmly explain: \u201cThese people won\u2019t vote for you, don\u2019t bother with them,\u201d and then suggest he \u201cpromote this message, promote that message\u201d. \u201cIt was a very American approach. Do this, do that.\u201d And, crucially: \u201cHe was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Voloshin, Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA. \u201cYou can blame him for whatever. The only thing you can\u2019t blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphere.\u201d</p> <p>Voloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda, arguing that it would counter Yanukovych\u2019s sagging ratings. Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment, telling Yanukovych bluntly: \u201cYou are going to have very bad times with the west.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that Yanukovych didn\u2019t listen to him. If it weren\u2019t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,\u201d Voloshin claims. </p> <p>During the period that he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics.<br></p> <p>In 2007, he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP.<br></p> <p>Based offshore in the Caymans, the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort, Rick Gates and Rick Davis. Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort, Manfort\u2019s lobbying company in Delaware. The new firm\u2019s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev, Odessa and Mariupol. It would acquire small companies, consolidate them into larger national enterprises, then sell them on.</p> <p>One of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin, who stumped up almost $19m. Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, sealed the agreement in trips to Moscow.</p> <p>What happened next was strange indeed. Only one investment by Pericles was ever made, in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable. According to court documents, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies</a>, including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp, registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. The trail wound through other opaque shell firms, including Cascado AG, set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</p> <p>A search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details. Cascado has two Latvian directors, <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/offshore/faux-corporate-directors-stand-fraudsters-despots-and-spies\">Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin</a>. In reality, they are mere nominees. The pair have been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets</a>.<br></p> <p>When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back. In 2011, the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska\u2019s stake because of \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. Further emails went unanswered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459/0_98_3469_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yulia Tymoshenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Manafort \u2018played a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-business-as-in-politics-trump-adviser-no-stranger-to-controversial-figures/2016/04/26/970db232-08c7-11e6-b283-e79d81c63c1b_story.html\">simply disappeared</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2814130/Pericles-Winding-Up-Petition.pdf\">Deripaska\u2019s frustrated lawyers wrote</a>, in a 2014 petition to have Manafort\u2019s firm wound up.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money. Either way, the episode illustrates Manafort\u2019s personal links to figures close to Putin. </p> <p>Later, Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain, when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US. (In 2006, the US had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/oleg-deripaska-us-visa-rusal\">citing alleged \u201ccriminal associations\u201d</a>. Deripaska denies the allegation, and his visa was subsequently reinstated.)</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort\u2019s capitalist adventures. In November 2011, Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Her lengthy writ</a> alleged that Manafort \u201cplayed a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych\u2019s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate.</p> <p>In particular, she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych. Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo, an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom, which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine. Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it. </p> <p>The RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption, she alleged in legal filings. Its real owner, she claimed, was Semyon Mogilevich, a Ukrainian-Russian mobster, and one of the FBI\u2019s top fugitives. Firtash denies this.</p> <p>According to her writ, Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions. The cash was laundered \u201cthrough a labyrinth of shell companies\u201d. It was then returned to Ukraine, with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Manafort sells the unsellable product.

Manafort\u2019s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $900m. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Firtash transferred at least $25m to the project</a>.

He expanded the World Cup finals from a 16-nation to 24-nation and then 32-nation competition, invited almost all the countries in the world to join Fifa, and offered them increased involvement in it. By the time he left office in 1998, the organisation had more members than the UN.</p> <p>He was the first sports administrator to pursue global sponsors, such as Adidas and Coca-Cola, and gain total control of television rights and advertising, through his links with the now discredited and defunct sports marketing company ISL. The revolutionary lobbying and business techniques he used to win votes and contracts are now employed routinely.</p> <p>And yet, to his many critics, Havelange\u2019s zeal for commercialising football resulted in it losing its soul. There was rarely any evidence of his love for the game \u2013 the players, countries and hundreds of millions of fans to whom the game brings such joy seemed but parts of his money-spinning masterplan. Worse still, his administrative era was severely tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption, which intensified under the man he pushed forward to be his anointed successor, Sepp Blatter.</p> <p>Havelange was born in Rio de Janeiro to Belgian parents. His father was an arms trader who sent his son to school in France, and the family spoke French at home. Havelange played football as a youth but it was swimming at which he excelled, and he represented Brazil at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 (the year in which he also earned a law degree). He won a bronze medal for water polo at the Pan American Games in 1951, and represented Brazil in the sport at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.</p> <p>He made his fortune building up Cometa, a transport businesses, but it was as a sports administrator that Havelange made his name. He led the Brazilian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1963. In 1958 he was appointed head of the CBD, the Brazilian Sports Confederation, which oversaw all the nation\u2019s sports.</p> <p>The appointment was made six months before Brazil won their first World Cup, in Sweden, and coincided with a golden era of Brazilian football as they went on to win the tournament again in Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970. The 1958 and 1970 teams included a galaxy of stars, among them Pel\u00e9, who would become an important figure in Havelange\u2019s quest for power.</p> <p>His role in funding and organising Brazil\u2019s World Cup victories was important, if typically autocratic. In 1958 he included a psychologist in the party (fearing some players were still affected by the trauma of 1950, when Brazil lost in the final at home in Rio, in front of 200,000 people), and wanted to impose <em>concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total </em>on the squad, effectively round-the-clock supervision, believing that football was too important to be left to the footballers.</p> <p>By the late 1960s Brazil was entering the most brutal phase of a 20-year military dictatorship and Havelange appeased the generals by sacking the coach, Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, a member of the Brazilian Communist party, in 1969. He also instigated a three-month pre-tournament training camp for the squad. They won the 1970 World Cup playing some of the best football ever seen, but they arrived in Mexico wearing dark green, military-style suits.</p> <p>In 1969, with an eye on the Fifa votes of African football federations, he organised a tour of the continent for Pel\u00e9\u2019s club, Santos. It was Havelange who circulated the story that the opposing sides in the Biafran civil war in Nigeria declared a two-day truce so they could watch Pel\u00e9 play. Years later, Pel\u00e9 claimed the story was exaggerated. There was the chance for more lobbying in 1972 when Havelange invited 20 countries to Brazil, all expenses paid, to play in an unrecognised football tournament, the Brazil Independence Cup.</p> <p>By the time of the 1974 election for Fifa president, Havelange had spent millions touring the world lobbying for votes, often accompanied by Pel\u00e9. He reckoned he had visited 86 countries in 10 weeks in the runup to the election.</p> <p>His strategy was to attack the European dominance of Fifa while promising developing countries a greater role, money for their football infrastructure and an expanded World Cup. He paid for many poorer African delegates, who otherwise rarely bothered to turn up at such meetings, to attend for the vote. Despite the enormous global success of the 1970 World Cup, broadcast for the first time in colour, the incumbent Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, was hanging on to amateur traditions and supported apartheid in South African sport. He was an easy opponent for Havelange to outmanoeuvre.</p> <p>According to Patrick Nally, a pioneer of modern sports marketing who played a key role in the victory, interviewed by the journalist Andrew Jennings for Dishonored Games (1992): \u201cHavelange had seen the future \u2026 He knew that if he became the president of the only federation already running its own high-profile world championship, then he would enjoy huge economic power.\u201d</p> <p>Havelange had relatively little influence on his first World Cup as Fifa president, held in Argentina, then ruled by a military junta. He let the generals and the head of the Argentinian organising committee, Vice-Admiral Carlos Lacoste, run it their way. In the semi-final stage, Argentina beat Peru 6-0, one of the most controversial results in the history of the tournament.</p> <p>While that match was in progress, a bomb exploded at the home of the Argentinian finance secretary, Juan Alemann, who had criticised the organising committee for wasting millions of dollars on the World Cup. Alemann believed Lacoste had masterminded the operation. Two years later, Havelange appointed Lacoste a Fifa vice-president. When democratic rule was restored to Argentina in 1983, Lacoste was investigated for corruption.</p> <p>Havelange\u2019s expansion of the World Cup began at the 1982 tournament in Spain, when the number of teams increased from 16 to 24. The following World Cup was scheduled to be held in Colombia, but when the country pulled out in financial difficulties, the US, Canada and Mexico put themselves forward to host it. In a show of strength that typified Havelange\u2019s rule, every member of the Fifa executive committee voted with him in support of Mexico.</p> <p>Mexico 1986 set a template for future World Cups \u2013 and was soon copied by other global sports federations. Havelange backed Mexico\u2019s bid because of his close relationship with <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=1/news=fifa-senior-vice-president-guillermo-canedo-has-died-70175.html\">Guillermo Ca\u00f1edo</a>, a Fifa vice-president and Mexican media baron who brokered a lucrative global TV deal with ISL.</p> <p>The founder of ISL was the German businessman Horst Dassler, former boss of Adidas, who, together with Havelange and the IOC chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/21/juan-antonio-samaranch-obituary\">Juan Antonio Samaranch</a>, were the most senior members of \u201cthe club\u201d, an exclusive group of sports administrators and marketing men who controlled a large proportion of international sport. It was a cosy relationship, with the world\u2019s two most powerful sporting bodies and the company that provided the lion\u2019s share of their income all based in Switzerland.</p> <p>ISL bought the rights to the World Cup for enormous sums, peaking in 1996 at the \u00a31.45bn combined bid for rights to the 2002 and 2006 finals. The company folded in 2001, leaving debts of \u00a3153m and a trail of corruption that led to Fifa\u2019s door. A Swiss court investigating the collapse, and the whereabouts of millions of missing dollars, heard evidence from a legal representative of Christoph Malms, a former ISL chief executive, that \u201cthe company became a private source of money for Fifa, virtually their private bank\u201d.</p> <p>After two decades, Havelange\u2019s Napoleonic rule began to stretch the patience of even loyal Fifa executives. He developed the habit of closing executive meetings by simply leaving the room and, in one famous case, postponing a discussion on Fifa appointments by handing out his own list of new committee members, then declaring the list passed without a vote.</p> <p>He banned Pel\u00e9 from attending the draw for the 1994 World Cup in Las Vegas after a feud involving Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange\u2019s then son-in-law and president of the Brazilian Football Confederation. This behaviour towards Pel\u00e9 would have raised eyebrows anywhere in the world. In the US, where he was the only soccer player known to many Americans, it was reckless.</p> <p>Havelange survived one more term as president, secured after further intensive lobbying and a promise to expand the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 tournament. Before resigning in 1998, he helped his righthand man, Blatter, to win the vote to succeed him, over the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson.</p> <p>In 2011, Jennings told a Brazilian senate investigation that Havelange had received bribes totalling around $50m from ISL. Later that year the IOC ethics committee announced that it would investigate claims that he had received bribes of $1m. Soon afterwards, he resigned from the IOC for health reasons.</p> <p>In April 2013 he resigned as honorary president of Fifa, again citing health reasons. Jennings led a BBC team for a Panorama programme in December 2015 that revealed the existence of a letter written by Havelange in 2010 claiming that disputed payments to him were above board and known to Blatter. An investigation by the FBI led to Blatter\u2019s ejection from Fifa later that month.</p> <p>Havelange and his wife, Anna Maria (nee Hermanny), had a daughter, L\u00facia, who was divorced from Teixeira in 1997, a granddaughter, Joana, director of the organising committee of the Brazil 2014 World Cup, and two grandsons, Ricardo and Roberto.</p> <p>\u2022 Jean-Marie Faustin Godefroid de Havelange, lawyer, sports administrator and businessman, born 8 May 1916; died 16 August 2016</p>",

The musicians of the <a href=\"http://www.west-eastern-divan.org/\">West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</a> are gathered onstage at the Teatro Colon opera house. In jeans and sweatshirts, the eldest among them were still only half the age of Barenboim, who perched on his conductor\u2019s podium in a crisp black shirt and navy trousers. He\u2019s been performing here since 1960.</p> <p>They began with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXonlYzpT-0\">Siegfried\u2019s Funeral March</a> from Wagner\u2019s G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. And for the rest of the morning, they just kept beginning. Over and over. The first few low bars of menace would fill the hall, then the conductor would shout: \u201cSTOP STOP STOP. It must be absolutely claustrophobic. EEE-vil!\u201d</p> <p>Again.</p> <p>\u201cSTOP. What is with you today?\u201d</p> <p>Again.<br></p> <p>\u201cSTOP.\u201d It had not been apparent before how suitably built Barenboim is to convey anger. But his hooded eyes were flashing, the barrel chest and jutting arms thrust out.<br></p> <p>The cellists were beaten up for a full 20 minutes. Accusations of laziness were flung around, of musicians having skipped \u201chotel-room practice\u201d.<br></p> <p>Over half an hour Barenboim did not allow the orchestra more than 30 seconds into the March. In two days\u2019 time, this piece would be performed here as part of a sequence of Wagner excerpts stitched into a kind of symphony. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even begun to hear how it\u2019s going to sound!\u201d he bellowed, as if this was news.<br></p> <p>Again.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2db85d6179785b47c540fdb5e4f2e09c512053ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db85d6179785b47c540fdb5e4f2e09c512053ee/0_53_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim during a reherseal with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon, in Buenos Aires.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim rehearsing with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSTOP.\u201d<br></p> <p>The longer this went on, the more the ensemble wilted. After two weeks of concerts and rehearsals, they were already \u201creally exhausted,\u201d one said to me. \u201cA lot of music in the head and a lot of problems.\u201d Finally, on being allowed to progress on to the next few bars, the players burst into an ovation of pent-up frustration.</p> <p>\u201cThe greatness of a musician is measured by the degree of fanaticism he brings to his playing,\u201d writes Barenboim in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/nonfiction.music.books\">his memoirs A Life in Music</a>. If, as a violinist, you fail to produce just the right accent on a note: \u201cIt should cause you almost physical pain.\u201d</p> <p>Now, at one such pang of pain, Barenboim wheeled around to his assistant, who had led earlier rehearsals. Two days ago, the shaven-headed and sharp-suited Julien had sat on the stage as a page-turner in Barenboim\u2019s duet with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/26/staatskapelle-berlin-daniel-barenboim-martha-argerich-lisa-batiashvili-royal-festival-hall-review\">Martha Argerich</a>. As the two legendary pianists sprang through Brahms\u2019 Haydn Variations, Julien had leaned forward to flip the score \u2013 only for Barenboim to slap him away, in front of 3,000 people. This time, the assistant sat a few rows back in the dark of the stalls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/17/daniel-barenboim\">Daniel Barenboim: unstuff your shirts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evidently, not far enough back. \u201cJULIEN,\u201d Barenboim yelled. \u201cWhat have you been doing? They have no clue.\u201d Throughout the rehearsal, the polymath had hopped between English, Spanish, Italian and French \u2013 but for 24-carat bollockings he preferred German. His shout \u201ckeine Ahnung\u201d carried through all seven storeys of the gilt and red plush of the Colon.</p> <p>Visiting that week was a conductor at the national conservatory, Rodrigo Gonzalez Jacob. From his box seat, the 35-year-old marvelled at the last of a previous epoch of conductors. Like the late Georg Solti and Herbert von Karajan, Barenboim had made his name during the long boom of the record industry, when classical music could command private budgets on top of public handouts and the term \u201cmaestro\u201d was used without irony.</p> <p>\u201cSome in my generation see him as despotic, monarchical,\u201d Gonzalez Jacob said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any musicians would stand me screaming at them the whole rehearsal, the whole day.\u201d But then, he wasn\u2019t Barenboim. \u201cI\u2019ve learned more in a week of watching than I have in my last five masterclasses.\u201d</p> <p>That Tuesday, the session concluded three-and-a-half hours later with the warning: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be ready in time.\u201d Musicians headed back to their hotel for a short rest, before another long rehearsal in the afternoon. Barenboim now had to endure a Guardian interview. On learning I was of Bengali origin, the lifelong friend of Mumbai\u2019s Zubin Mehta regaled me with his headwaggling Indian accent. \u201cKul-kutta. Vot are you saying?\u201d He has somehow a reputation as a skilled mimic, but this was Peter Sellers. Then came another voice: \u201cWaare\u2019s me boonch of flaars?\u201d This, he assured me, was \u201cthe North Coon-try\u201d accent of opera singer Dame Janet Baker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7037d90d39b74f456eb729ac887cb8bdeb8547d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7037d90d39b74f456eb729ac887cb8bdeb8547d7/1661_1137_2539_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barenboim speaks with Aditya Chakrabortty backstage at the Teatro Colon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim speaks with Aditya Chakrabortty backstage at the Teatro Colon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the five-minute walk between theatre and restaurant, the classical musician was stopped four times by strangers who wanted to shake his hand, touch his arm, thank him. One woman strode up, clapping loudly. \u201cMuy bueno! Muy BUE-no! Felicitaciones.\u201d</p> <p>It was near here that Barenboim\u2019s own performing career began. On Fridays, he would play chamber concerts at a businessman\u2019s house. \u201cI loved to go mostly because his wife made the best apple strudel.\u201d There, aged seven, he met an eight-year-old Argerich. \u201cWe used to play under the piano.\u201d</p> <p>Both parents were piano teachers, and would take him to see the great musicians touring Buenos Aires. The young Barenboim saw Furtw\u00e4ngler, violinist Adolf Busch and virtuoso pianist Arthur Rubinstein. \u201cYou used to queue for three days and two nights for tickets for Rubinstein. People stayed in the queue for the whole day.\u201d The child prodigy enjoyed a \u201cdouble life. I would go to school, come home and play football, then give a concert.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some see no point in the orchestra\u2019s philosophical dialogues: 'There\u2019s a lot of heat, but they never resolve anything'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Julien and the cellists would be glad to hear, he also committed plenty of his own gaffes. Take his first-ever recital in Britain, in Bournemouth. The name was rolled around his mouth, like a glug of Malbec: Bawn-mouf. He was into the final strait of a Mozart concerto in E-flat and the \u201clast movements of Mozart concertos are sometimes quite similar in rhythm and speed. Even the melodies.\u201d All of a sudden, \u201cI mistakenly landed in another concerto, this time in B-flat.\u201d Luckily, his conductor had all Barenboim\u2019s humour and none of his temper. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s OK \u2013 as long as you don\u2019t charge double for playing two different pieces.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Having picked the restaurant \u2013 a barbecue with a giant firepit in the front window and a corrugated-iron ceiling \u2013 Barenboim was now ordering platters of meat, pumpkin and chips. Even as he did so, waiters kept bringing complimentary dishes: metal trays of grilled pork and empanadas. While forking food towards me and his chief executive, Tabar\u00e9 Perlas, the conductor discussed the members of the Divan Orchestra. He and Perlas could name all 100 of them, from more than 10 countries. They told me where X lived, whether Y was clever. Barenboim works with four orchestras regularly, but it is the Divan musicians that he calls \u201cmy people\u201d. While touring, they live in \u201cThe Sovereign Independent Republic of the West-Eastern Divan\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq3aRicsvH0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kq3aRicsvH0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>When it began in 1999, \u201cthe Palestinians from Nazareth had never met the Palestinians from the territories, let alone an Egyptian or a Syrian.\u201d As Barenboim has written, the hope is that by \u201chearing the painfulness of the other side for the first time\u201d they \u201cthink about the past and the suffering that has lasted so long.\u201d Through sharing a music stand, occupier and occupied could share their histories and their politics. It is an idea that has captivated journalists, film-makers and audiences. Yet over 16 years, the Divan has changed from a youth orchestra to one with its fair share of thirtysomethings with less time and patience for seminar-room discussions. \u201cThey need to check on their own children,\u201d one member told me. \u201cOr get a bit more sleep\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I find these theological states very, very dangerous \u2013 in this respect Israel and Iran are twin brothers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even more striking is the cooled enthusiasm among the musicians themselves. Some, especially those from Israel, would still vouch for how having colleagues from neighbouring territories has made them more loving of their neighbours. But others saw no point in the orchestra\u2019s hallmark philosophical dialogues: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heat, but they never resolve anything.\u201d<br></p> <p>While admiring of Barenboim, Palestinian violinist <a href=\"http://www.west-eastern-divan.org/news/musician-spotlight-tyme-khleifi/\">Tyme Khleifi</a> acknowledged that whenever tensions rose in the Middle East, they were magnified in the orchestra. She recalled the Lebanon war of 2006. \u201cThe Lebanese musicians couldn\u2019t come and the Syrian musicians weren\u2019t allowed to come by their government \u2013 out of solidarity with Lebanon. So who did you have? A few Palestinians, a few Egyptians [compared to many Israelis] \u2026 even the numbers were imbalanced. There were people whose families were getting bombed on the Lebanese side; there were people whose families were getting bombed on the Israeli side. While all of this was going on, we were rehearsing. The atmosphere was very charged. In Arab culture, music is for celebration. You don\u2019t play music at funerals. And so there were questions about what we were doing here, whether we should be playing at all.\u201d Eventually, Barenboim persuaded the ensemble to play as a \u201csimple statement\u201d.</p> <p>Reading that story, a cynic could say it shows up Barenboim as a latter-day Quixote. Why does he keep trying to reconcile the irreconcilable? Others might find evidence of moral courage, cleaving to an ideal even as others ditch it.</p> <p>Holding both Israeli and Palestinian nationalities, and owning a house in Jerusalem, Barenboim has got in ever-deeper trouble in Israel. Its president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/ewenmacaskill\">accused him of \u201ccultural rape\u201d</a> for performing music by Wagner, an antisemite, during a concert there. A government minister called him \u201ca real Jew hater\u201d. For his part, the musician has called the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank \u201cimmoral\u201d and backed a boycott of the Israeli government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5defb7a938789758464baee1999995a02f43ad70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5defb7a938789758464baee1999995a02f43ad70/0_75_1972_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim conducts the West Eastern Divan Orchestra, rehearsing ahead of their Proms debut in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, rehearsing ahead of their Proms debut in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheila Rock/EMI Classics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He admits to \u201cone cousin\u201d in Buenos Aires who is \u201cvery upset with me\u201d.

That provoked fury in Israel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/01/iran-bars-daniel-barenboim-israeli-citizenship\">before being blocked by Iran on the grounds that it would not grant entry to an artist of \u201cthe Zionist regime\u201d</a>. To me, Barenboim claimed: \u201cWe\u2019re still planning to go. The concert was not cancelled, only postponed\u201d. But how did he feel under political artillery from both sides?</p> <p>\u201cThe Iranian government still denies the Holocaust \u2013 so you can\u2019t take them seriously. And the Israeli government spreads rumours and disinformation about Iran \u2013 because it needs to for the creation of panic. I find these theological states \u2013 and in this respect Israel and Iran are twin brothers \u2013 very, very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>To contrast with that polarisation, Barenboim told a story that began in 1966, with him playing the Prague Spring festival. When he got to the stage door, two young men were waiting. They were from Syria and they wanted to see his rehearsals. \u201cI\u2019d never met a Syrian in my life.\u201d </p> <p>They had coffee and hung out, \u201ca wonderful time\u201d. Then they asked for tickets to the next day\u2019s performance, featuring Arthur Rubinstein with the Czech Philharmonic. Barenboim, who was leaving before the concert, could do nothing. But he did take them in to the rehearsal, then went backstage to mention them to Rubinstein. At first, the legendary pianist thought this was another of Barenboim\u2019s \u201csilly jokes\u201d, before getting excited: \u201cI\u2019ve never met an Arab musician!\u201d All four went for lunch, before Barenboim had to go.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Music can teach you about life, about how to make passion and discipline co-exist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the West-Eastern Divan orchestra formed in 1999, seven Syrians joined. \u201cI was so curious. How did they manage to come? For Syrians it was against the law to have any contact with Israelis.\u201d He got talking to two \u201cpretty girls\u201d and \u201cafter a little flirt\u201d, one of them said, \u201cSooll-key\u201d. What was Sooll-key?</p> <p>She tried again: \u201cSoulkhy. He met you in Prague.\u201d</p> <p>One of those young men waiting at the stage door had gone on to become director of one of the most prestigious conservatories in the Middle East. Thirty-three years later, he wrote to the Syrian minister for culture about a workshop for young musicians in Germany. No word of Israeli involvement, just an assurance of Mr Barenboim\u2019s reputation and a request for a few students to go. \u201cCan you believe that? After 33 years.\u201d</p> <p>More than a happy ending, it is a tale of the triumph of Barenboimian virtues: improvised cultural exchange, institution-building and a bit of cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a political person \u2013 I don\u2019t try to make contacts or get the cellular number of a minister,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But he can do politics \u2013 and he can win. Later that week, a violinist from Damascus, Nouras Hanana, told of how he had heard from Barenboim that he had been lobbying the government of Argentina to take in Syrian refugees. \u201cI wanted to hug him,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04f5b42a929031808f421520ed0cce2c3511fcfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04f5b42a929031808f421520ed0cce2c3511fcfe/0_164_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barenboim confirmed that he had rung the new president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, straight after his election victory in late November. The call was also on behalf of Martha Argerich, he said, since both their grandparents had benefited from the generosity of Argentina in accepting refugees and immigrants. </p> <p>Macri came to Berlin in July, when Barenboim pressed him again. In the conductor\u2019s telling, the president said it was \u201ca little problematic\u201d but that \u201cI think we can do 3,000\u201d. (Argentina\u2019s Foreign Office confirmed that Macri and Barenboim met in Berlin, but would not provide details of the conversation.) That same week, Buenos Aires announced it would accept 3,000 Syrians. Amid rehearsals at the Colon, Barenboim had also visited foreign minister Susana Malcorra. It is hard to think of another classical musician anywhere in the world who would have put in such an effort \u2013 or been taken seriously by a country\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>Barenboim still boils over with plans. He wants to tackle the gulf between a class of musicians who are technically skilled but ignorant of their society, and a wider society that can\u2019t understand classical music. This autumn his Barenboim-Said Academy in Berlin begins teaching a degree course in music, coupled with twice-weekly philosophy lessons. He is also looking for a primary school in Germany to follow a programme of music education set by him and the Berlin Staatskapelle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There comes a point when your brain wants to think of tomorrows and your body reminds you of yesterday</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He has already opened a music kindergarten in Berlin and Ramallah. \u201cBut when the children go to primary school, most of them forget.\u201d After that will come a secondary school \u201cso if you are an intelligent parent\u201d your child can be taught music \u201cfrom day one of kindergarten until the Baccalaureate at 18\u201d.

There comes a point when you have a separation between brain and body \u2013 a brain who wants to think of tomorrows and the body who reminds you of yesterday.\u201d He talks repeatedly of how he can no longer put on his socks standing up. More than once I found myself inspecting him as if he were an elderly relative, for early warnings of issues to be dealt with. This cut on his cheek, that gash running behind his ear.</p> <p>But on my last night, he and the orchestra are performing to a packed house. I watch backstage. Before going on to perform Liszt, Martha Argerich stomps on the red carpet and growls. In between turns, Barenboim perches on a stool, observing in semi-seriousness to me \u201cthe finest girls\u201d in the orchestra. Then the Wagner and the concert are all over and he comes off stage to a standing ovation. On the other side of the curtain are nearly 3,000 people \u2013 from the fur-wearer in the stalls to the T-shirt-clad up in the cheap seats \u2013 all on their feet applauding this man of a more expansive, optimistic time. He slides off the stool and goes back on stage for another encore. </p> <p>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/proms-2016/prom-43-martha-argerich-daniel-barenboim-and-the-west-eastern-divan-orchestra/\">Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Proms on 17 August</a>.

  "<p>Jo\u00e3o Havelange, the Brazilian who reshaped the football world before his reputation was tainted by corruption scandals, has died aged 100 during a Rio Olympics that he helped secure and is taking place in a stadium once named after him.</p> <p>It was Havelange who paved the way for the huge commercial exploitation of major sporting events, including the Olympics and the World Cup, but also for the lurid allegations of bribery and corruption that have dogged them ever since.</p> <p>A former Olympic athlete, Havelange was an International Olympic Committee member from 1963 to 2011 and used his position at the head of the Brazilian FA (the CBF) during the golden period when his country won three World Cups, between 1958 and 1970, to launch a bid for control of Fifa.</p> <p>His campaign to oust Sir Stanley Rous as president marked a decisive moment in world sport. The Englishman was seen as fusty and out of touch, representative of a colonial old guard trying to maintain their grip on a global game, while Havelange ushered in a new way of doing business that mixed personal, political and corporate interests until they became indistinguishable.</p> <p>With the help of Horst Dassler, the Adidas scion who founded the sports marketing agency ISL, and Fifa\u2019s young secretary general, Sepp Blatter, Havelange oversaw an explosion in the governing body\u2019s revenues as broadcasting and sponsorship deals rolled in.</p> <p>Along the way, it has been alleged, he was one of a great many sports executives who shared in the proceeds. In 2010, the BBC produced a list of individuals, which included Havelange, who received bribes totalling $100m from ISL through front companies.</p> <p>In death as in life, Havelange took centre stage. The news of his passing quickly dominated headlines overshadowing the Olympic triumph of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/brazilthiago-braz-da-silva-elevated-to-national-hero-status-after-pole-vault-gold\">Brazil\u2019s first gold in the pole vault for Thiago Braz da Silva</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/joao-havelange-obituary\">Jo\u00e3o Havelange obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tone was respectful but far from universally laudatory. While newspapers noted Havelange had massively expanded Fifa and its finances, they also focused on his corrupt practices, obsession with power and occasional quarrels with Pel\u00e9.</p> <p>In a piece titled \u201cThe worst kind of politics\u201d, the influential columnist Juca Kfouri noted the behind-the-scenes deal-making of a figure who claimed to be free of ideological bias yet worked with Brazil\u2019s military dictators and then built a global empire that was bigger than that of many nations or multinationals. \u201cHavelange did the worst kind of politics when he claimed to be apolitical and he used this to justify his close relationship with dictatorships around the world, whether it was in Africa and South America,\u201d Kfouri wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that he transformed Fifa into a great money-making machine and made football popular in the five continents. Unfortunately he did this with a family that even the Cosa Nostra [Italian mafia] has nothing on.\u201d</p> <p>TV stations showed images of his life \u2013 black-and-white photographs of him as a lawyer and member of the Brazilian Olympic team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, as head of the Brazilian Football Confederation during a period when his country won the World Cup three times, and then as president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, when the world football body expanded its reach with a system of patronage that strengthened his grip and left a legacy of corruption that continues to this day.</p> <p>Allegations of bribe-taking dogged his career and his family. In 1993, his former ally Pel\u00e9 accused Havelange\u2019s son-in-law Ricardo Teixeira, the then president of the CBF, of corruption, a charge which was denied. Six years later a German newspaper reported Havelange had accepted diamonds and other gifts in connection with Amsterdam\u2019s bid for the 1992 Olympics.</p> <p>In 2006, the British investigative journalist Andrew Jennings told the Brazilian senate that Havelange may have built a fortune of tens of millions of dollars from bribes paid through a front company. He also revealed that a $1m bribe apparently meant for Havelange had crossed the desk of Blatter, who was later found by the Fifa ethics committee to have been \u201cclumsy rather than criminal\u201d in his handling of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6794cf5d59de1e6a8506e1b2fe5101ca5ab095c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6794cf5d59de1e6a8506e1b2fe5101ca5ab095c/0_15_2625_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange\u2019s presidency of the country\u2019s confederation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange\u2019s presidency of the country\u2019s confederation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/04/joao-havelange-resigns-international-olympic-committee\">Havelange resigned from the IOC</a> citing health concerns, the day before he was to appear before an ethics committee investigating claims that he received a bribe of $1m from ISL.</p> <p>But his influence continues to be felt. <a href=\"http://esportes.estadao.com.br\">Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo noted</a> that Havelange\u2019s connection and ability to secure votes played a decisive role in securing the Olympics for Rio de Janeiro during the bidding competition. \u201cI invite you all to come to my city, to honour the Games, on my 100th birthday. I ask you to join me to realise this dream,\u201d he told delegates at the 2009 IOC meeting at which Rio was named the first South American city to host the Games.</p> <p>On reaching his century on 8 May, he achieved that goal, though was too ill to take part in the Olympic torch relay that reached its conclusion in his home city of Rio.

  "<p>\u201cA colourful and talented man\u201d was how Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-very-bright-talented-man-russia-us-presidential-race\">described</a> Donald Trump back in December. In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/18/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-striking-america-superpower\">he went further</a>: \u201cMr Trump has declared that he\u2019s ready for the full restoration of Russian-American relations. Is there anything bad there? We all welcome this, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>These are the only comments Putin has made on Trump, but nevertheless, Trump\u2019s potential Russia links have become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">one of the biggest stories of the election campaign</a>, as the media investigates everything from his dubious business links in Russia, to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">campaign manager\u2019s links</a> to Russian and Ukrainian cashflows, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/carter-page-donald-trump-foreign-policy-advisor-russia\">Gazprom links and Kremlin-friendly ideology</a> of one of his campaign advisers. </p> <p>Some have even gone as far as to insinuate that Trump could be a Russian agent, sent to implement the Kremlin\u2019s nefarious plans.</p> <p>So, is Putin hatching a cunning plan to put Trump in the White House? The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/clinton-blaming-russia-emails-dnc-hack\">apparent hacking</a> of Democratic party emails by Russian hackers might suggest so. There certainly has been what appears to be coordinated chatter among pro-Kremlin Twitter accounts, ranging from low-level spammers to Alexey Pushkov, one of Russia\u2019s top foreign policy officials, who has been surprisingly forthright about his admiration for Trump.</p> <p>But Kremlin watchers say the picture may be more nuanced. In Moscow, there is sniggering at the idea of Trump as a Manchurian candidate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see that hysteria and paranoia about external interference is not just a Russian thing,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst who advised the Kremlin until 2011. <br></p> <p>A source close to the Kremlin said: \u201cI think Putin has conflicted feelings about Trump ... Of course, he says nice things about Russia. But Hillary is more predictable. With Trump, who knows what would happen?\u201d <br></p> <p>The potential appeal of Trump is his willingness to dismiss \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, and work outside the rules. While Trump\u2019s fiery rhetoric has alarmed many world leaders, Pushkov has hailed it as \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Putin believes all world leaders are cynical, merely cloaking their cynicism with high-minded rhetoric about democracy and human rights \u2013 and at least Trump does not attempt to hide his contempt for convention and willingness to flout established norms.</p> <p>\u201cI think Putin probably likes Trump from an aesthetic point of view,\u201d said Valery Garbuzov, director of the Institute for US and Canadian Studies, a government-linked thinktank set up in 1967 to give the Soviet leadership analysis and advice on how to deal with the US. \u201cBut he should be aware that the reality could be very different.\u201d<br></p> <p>Putin\u2019s attitude toward Trump is bound up in his thoughts about US power in general, as well as a personal dislike for Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Putin came to power in 2000 determined to restore Russia\u2019s position as a \u201cfirst-tier nation\u201d and have its voice respected in the international arena. During the 1990s, a weak, ailing Russia had been unable to influence events internationally. </p> <p>In 1998, when Bill Clinton called Boris Yeltsin to tell him the US was considering airstrikes on Serbia, Yeltsin was furious, recounted Clinton\u2019s Russia advisor Strobe Talbott in his memoirs. He screamed \u201c<em>Nelzya</em>!\u201d \u2013 a strong Russian imperative which means something like \u201cit is impermissible!\u201d \u2013 several times down the phone at the US president and then hung up. The airstrikes went ahead, of course.<br></p> <p>Putin was determined that under his presidency, Russia\u2019s objections were going to be taken into account. </p> <p>Years later, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia\">his officials said</a> Ukraine turning towards the west and signing a trade agreement with the EU was also <em>Nelzya</em>, Putin was willing to do what Yeltsin could not: back his words up with brute force. After pro-European protests led former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych to flee, Putin moved to annex Crimea. </p> <p>During the early part of his rule, though, he thought he could attain this seat at the table by becoming friends with the Americans.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe started off thinking we could work with them \u2013 we just needed them to understand Russia better. He genuinely believed that one day Russia might even join Nato; it didn\u2019t seem ridiculous then,\u201d said the source close to the Kremlin.</p> <p>There were a number of episodes that changed Putin\u2019s mind about American intentions. First came his belief that the US was funding Chechen fighters through American embassies in the South Caucasus. Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/10/ukraine.jamesmeek\">the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine</a>, which Putin believed was directed by US operatives. As the years went by, Putin became more convinced that the US was an enemy, and that it had designs of regime change in the Kremlin.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe has certain assumptions about American power that are locked in, and we struggled mightily trying to convince him that that\u2019s not what we do,\u201d said Michael McFaul, formerly US ambassador to Russia. Putin assigned the Americans all kinds of agency in Russia and genuinely believed the ultimate policy to be regime change, McFaul recalled. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d accuse us of things, and Obama would say to him: \u2018We\u2019re not doing that,\u2019 and he\u2019d look Obama in the eye and say \u2018Yes, you are. We know.\u2019 I was never sure if he really believed this stuff or not, but I came to the conclusion he did.\u201d</p> <p>Pavlosky said Putin has become bored with the day-to-day decision-making involved in running the country, and is much more interested in foreign policy. \u201cForeign policy has also become very personal now. He sees himself as the personification of the country. He genuinely thinks the US is trying to overthrow him,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Putin has made this claim explicitly on occasion. When mass protests broke out in Russia over falsified elections in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/vladimir-putin-hillary-clinton-russia\">he claimed the Russian protesters were acting according to a signal</a> from the US state department, then run by Hillary Clinton.<br></p> <p>\u201c[Opposition leaders] heard the signal and, with the support of the US state department, began active work,\u201d Putin said at the time. \u201cWe are all grownups here. We all understand the organisers are acting according to a well-known scenario and in their own mercenary political interests.\u201d</p> <p>It was not the first time Putin had tough words for Clinton. During her 2008 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton said Putin \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a soul\u201d, referencing George W Bush\u2019s claim that he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes and \u201cgot a sense of his soul\u201d. </p> <p>Putin shot back: \u201cAs a minimum, a head of state should have a head.\u201d</p> <p>Those who know Putin say he is unlikely to forget the spat.</p> <p>\u201cIn the US, politics is like a sport: you say all kinds of horrible things and then you\u2019re friends again, like Obama and Clinton in 2008,\u201d said the source close to the Kremlin. \u201cIn Russia it\u2019s not like that; there\u2019s no culture of throwing insults around and then making up. Putin is a pragmatist. He will work with whomever he needs to. But of course, he will remember forever the things Hillary said.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not Putin is rooting for a Trump presidency, some doubt that having the controversial tycoon in the White House would really be good for Russia.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an incredibly simplistic view; it\u2019s the view of propagandists, not analysts,\u201d said Garbuzov. Analysts from his institute sit on various advisory boards to the foreign and defence ministries, but Garbuzov admits he does not know how much weight their more nuanced views on the US hold. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t exclude that if Hillary wins, Russia and the US could end up having productive dialogue in a number of areas, and likewise if Trump wins, there could be total chaos. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s anti-Russian, but she is an experienced politician who understands the world. He has no experience at all of politics; he\u2019s a demagogue and a populist.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and government programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the bigger questions \u2013 questions about the character of the state, the future of freedom and the meaning of virtue. These beliefs provide the foundation for a conservative intellectual establishment \u2013 thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, magazines such as National Review, pundits such as George Will and Bill Kristol \u2013 dedicated to advancing the right\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Over the last year, that establishment has been united by one thing: opposition to Donald Trump. Republican voters may have succumbed to a temporary bout of collective insanity \u2013 or so Trump\u2019s critics on the right believe \u2013 but the party\u2019s intelligentsia remain certain that entrusting the Republican nomination to a reality television star turned populist demagogue has been a disaster for their cause and their country. Whatever Trump might be, he is not a conservative.</p> <p>That belief is comforting, but it is wrong. Trump is a unique character, but the principles he defends and the passions he inflames have been part of the modern American right since its formation in the aftermath of the second world war. Most conservative thinkers have forgotten or repressed this part of their history, which is why they are undergoing a collective nervous breakdown today. Like addicts the morning after a bender, they are baffled at the face they see in the mirror.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/the-past-present-and-future-of-trumpism\">The past, present and future of Trumpism | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not all of the right\u2019s intellectuals have been so blind.

Posts analysing the campaign with titles such as The Twilight of Jeb! alternated with more ambitious forays in philosophy such as Paleo-Straussianism, Part I: Metaphysics and Epistemology. More intellectually demanding than the typical National Review article, the style of their prose also suggested writers who were having fun. Disquisitions on Aristotle could be followed by an emoji mocking the latest outraged responses to Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/02/the-dark-history-of-donald-trumps-rightwing-revolt-podcast\">The dark history of Donald Trump's rightwing revolt \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors at JAG were not all backing Trump himself \u2013 officially, they were \u201celectorally agnostic\u201d \u2013 but they were united by their enthusiasm for Trumpism (as they put it, \u201cfor what Trumpism could become if thought through with wisdom and moderation\u201d). They dismissed commentators who attributed Trump\u2019s victory to his celebrity, arguing that a campaign could not resonate with so many voters unless it spoke to genuine public concerns.</p> <p>JAG condensed Trumpism into three key elements: economic nationalism, controlled borders and a foreign policy that put American interests first.</p> <p>These policies, they asserted, were a direct challenge to the views of America\u2019s new ruling class \u2013 a cosmopolitan elite of wealthy professionals who controlled the commanding heights of public discourse. This new ruling class of \u201ctransnational post-Americans\u201d was united by its belief that the welfare of the world just happened to coincide with programmes that catered to its own self-interest: free trade, open borders, globalisation and a suite of other policies designed to ease the transition to a post-national future overseen by enlightened experts. In the language of JAG, they are the \u201cDavoisie\u201d, a global elite that is most at ease among its international peers at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/21/-sp-davos-guide-world-economic-forum\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos and totally out of touch with ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Mainstream conservatives and their liberal counterparts were equally complicit in sustaining this regime, but JAG focused its attention on the right. Leading Republican politicians and the journalists who fawned over them in the rightwing press were pedlars of an \u201cintellectually bankrupt\u201d doctrine whose obsessions \u2013 cutting taxes, policing sexual norms, slashing government regulation \u2013 distracted from \u201cthe fundamental question\u201d Trump had put on the agenda: \u201cdestruction of the soulless managerial class\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>JAG unleashed salvo after salvo against \u201cConservatism Inc\u201d, the network of journals and thinktanks that, along with talk radio and Fox News, has made defending the party of ideas into a lucrative career path. \u201cIf Trump ends up destroying the Republican party,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is because the Republican party, as it exists today, is little more than a jobs programme for failed academics and journalists.\u201d</p> <p>News of JAG began circulating on the right shortly after its debut early in the primary season. \u201cThe first time I heard someone refer to it, I thought it was a joke,\u201d says former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum.

In June, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan alerted her readers to the \u201csophisticated, rather brilliant and anonymous website\u201d. A link from the popular rightwing website Breitbart News drove traffic even higher, and JAG seemed poised to shape the discussion over the future of conservatism.</p> <p>Then it disappeared. Months of posts, totalling more than 175,000 words, were scrubbed from the internet, replaced by <a href=\"http://journalofamericangreatness.blogspot.co.uk/\">a note labelling the site an \u201cinside joke\u201d </a>that had spiralled out of control. Within the right, rumours swirled about the real motives behind the vanishing act; fans of JAG took its self-immolation as further evidence that the conservative establishment would not tolerate any dissent. But the brief life of the Journal of American Greatness did more than provide grist for feverish speculation on Twitter. Patrolling the boundaries of acceptable thought on the right has always been one of the central duties of the conservative intellectual, and JAG\u2019s voluntary purging was the latest chapter in a long battle to define the meaning of conservatism.</p> <p>Conservatives tend to portray their cause as the child of a revolt against the liberal status quo that began in the aftermath of the second world war, gained momentum in the 1950s when a cohort of intellectuals supplied the right with its philosophical underpinning, attained political consciousness in Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 presidential campaign, and won vindication with Ronald Reagan\u2019s election to the White House. Ideas have consequences, they proclaimed. Just look at us.</p> <p>But there is another way of interpreting the history of the American right, one that puts less emphasis on the power of ideas and more on power itself \u2013 a history of white voters fighting to defend their place in the social hierarchy, politicians appealing to the prejudices of their constituents so they can satisfy the wishes of their donors, and the industry that has turned conservatism into a billion-dollar business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a/0_168_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White segregationist demonstrators protesting at the admission of the Little Rock Nine, to Central High School, 1959\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White segregationist demonstrators protesting in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the explanation preferred by leftwing critics, who typically regard the Republican party as a coalition fuelled by white nationalism and funded by billionaires. But this line of attack also has a long history on the right, where a dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades. Now the unlikely figure of Donald Trump has brought in a wave of reinforcements \u2013 over 13 million in the primaries alone. Their target is the managerial elite, and their history begins in the run-up to the second world war, when a forgotten founder of modern American conservatism became a public sensation with a book that announced the dawning of a civilisation ruled by experts.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World was the most unlikely bestseller of 1941. The author, James Burnham, was a philosophy professor at New York University who until the previous year had been one of Leon Trotsky\u2019s most trusted counsellors in the US. Time called Burnham\u2019s work a grim outline of \u201cthe totalitarian world soon to come\u201d that was \u201cas morbidly fascinating as a textbook vivisection\u201d.</p> <p>The son of a wealthy railway executive, Burnham graduated near the top of his class in Princeton in 1927 before studying at Oxford and then securing his post at NYU. But the Great Depression radicalised him, and he began a double life, lecturing on Aquinas by day and polemicising against capital by night. By 1940, Burnham had lost his faith in the revolution of the proletariat. While Trotsky denounced his erstwhile disciple as an \u201ceducated witch doctor\u201d, Burnham started work on the book that would justify his apostasy.</p> <p>According to Burnham, Marxists were right to anticipate capitalism\u2019s imminent demise but wrong about what would come next. Around the turn of the 20th century, he claimed, the scale of life had changed. Population growth surged, immense corporations gobbled up smaller rivals, and government officials struggled to expand their powers to match the growing size of the challenges they faced.</p> <p>These structural changes fundamentally altered the distribution of power in society. In the 18th century, authority had rested with aristocrats; in the 19th century with capitalists; in the 20th century it had passed on to the managers, whose authority derived from their unique ability to operate the complex institutions that now dominated mass society.</p> <p>Technocrats had become the new ruling class. According to Burnham, fascism, Stalinism and Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal were all products of this transformation, and there was no use struggling against the world that was coming into being \u2013 a world where state ownership of the means of production had become the norm, where sovereignty had shifted to a bureaucratic elite, and where the globe was divided into rival superstates.</p> <p>Burnham was not the first to foresee a society run by managers, but the arguments he borrowed from others took on a different meaning when brought together in this form. His sweep was global, his narrative reached back centuries, and he almost seemed to welcome a totalitarian future. For Burnham, the only sensible response to the managerial revolution was to recognise that it had occurred and accept there was no point in trying to bring back a world that was already lost. This bleak forecast captured the public imagination. Fortune called it \u201cthe most debated book published so far this year\u201d and it went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59/0_115_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard C Levin with William F Buckley Jr, Yale University, 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William F Buckley Jr collects an honorary doctorate from Yale University, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Child/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Burnham quickly moved on to new territory. His true subject, he concluded, was power, and to understand power he needed a theory of politics. Marx had been his guiding influence in The Managerial Revolution; now he turned to Machiavelli, constructing the genealogy of a political theory that began with the author of The Prince and continued into the present.</p> <p>For a Machiavellian, Burnham wrote, politics was an unending war for dominance: democracy was a myth, and all ideologies were thinly veiled rationalisations for self-interest. The great mass of humanity, in Burnham\u2019s dark vision, would never have any control over their own lives. They could only hope that clashes between rival elites might weaken the power of the ruling class and open up small spaces of freedom.</p> <p>Burnham\u2019s newfound zeal for defending freedom led him, in 1955, to a conservative magazine called National Review, and to the magazine\u2019s charismatic young founder, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?_r=0\">William F Buckley Jr</a>. Buckley\u2019s goal was to turn a scattered collection of reactionaries into the seeds of a movement. His journal set out to make the right intellectually respectable, stripping it of the associations with kooks and cranks that allowed liberals to depict it as a politics for cave-dwellers who had not reconciled themselves to modernity. Burnham was there at the start, one of five senior editors on the masthead of the first issue.</p> <p>Soon Burnham was Buckley\u2019s ranking deputy. But in an editorial staff riven by abstract debates between ardent libertarians and devout Christians, Burnham was the pragmatist who urged his colleagues not to ask politicians for more than the electorate would accept. For the right to win over working-class voters, Burnham argued, the movement had to embrace a more populist economic policy \u2013 contrary to the wishes of his anti-statist colleagues and their corporate backers, who wanted to lower taxes on the rich and roll back the welfare state. \u201cMuch of conservative doctrine,\u201d Burnham wrote in 1972, \u201cis, if not quite bankrupt, more and more obviously obsolescent.\u201d Less than a decade later, Ronald Reagan was president, and it was Burnham who seemed like a relic of the past.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>For a long time, the only major study of Burnham\u2019s work was a slim volume published in 1984 by a minor academic press under the title Power and History. The book\u2019s author, Samuel Francis, seemed a typical product of the insurgent conservative movement Burnham had helped to create \u2013 though by the late 1990s, when Francis published an updated version of Power and History, it made more sense to speak of a new conservative establishment. Outsiders who arrived at the White House with Reagan had become senior executives in Conservatism Inc. With the end of the cold war, the right had lost the glue that had bound its coalition, but there were still battles to be waged, and the money was better than ever.</p> <p>Francis was never going to become a star in the emerging rightwing infotainment complex. Shy and overweight, with teeth stained from smoking, he had difficulty making it through cocktail parties. After completing a PhD in British history at the University of North Carolina, Francis left academia for Washington \u2013 first working at a rightwing thinktank, then serving as an aide to a Republican senator, and finally joining the editorial staff of the capital\u2019s influential conservative daily newspaper, the Washington Times.</p> <p>Francis retained his academic interests while he ascended into the ranks of the conservative establishment. He published six books in his lifetime, but he worked in private on one massive volume that he hoped would bring together all the disparate strands of his thought. Finished in 1995 but not discovered until after his death a decade later, the result was published earlier this year under the title Leviathan and Its Enemies. It is a sprawling text, more than 700 pages long, digressive, repetitive and in desperate need of an editor.</p> <p>It is also one of the most impressive books to come out of the American right in a generation \u2013 and the most frightening. It is a searching diagnosis of managerial society, written by an author looking for a strategy that could break it apart.</p> <p>Like much of Francis\u2019s writing, Leviathan and Its Enemies began with Burnham \u2013 in this case, quite literally. \u201cThis book,\u201d Francis announced in the first sentence, \u201cis an effort to revise and reformulate the theory of the managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paleoconservatives depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of flyover country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Francis agreed that society had been taken over by managers, but he believed the new ruling class was far more vulnerable than Burnham had realised. Not everyone had benefited from the rise of the experts \u2013 and Francis saw this unequal distribution of rewards as the managerial regime\u2019s greatest weakness.</p> <p>For reasons he never quite explained, he insisted that the cosmopolitan elite threatened the traditional values cherished by most Americans: \u201cmorality and religion, family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity\u201d. These were sacred principles for members of a new \u201cpost-bourgeois proletariat\u201d drawn from the working class and the lower ranks of the middle class. Lacking the skills prized by technocrats, but not far enough down the social ladder to win the attention of reformers, these white voters considered themselves victims of a coalition between the top and bottom against the middle.</p> <p>According to Francis, this cohort had supplied the animating spirit of rightwing politics since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. They had supported Goldwater \u2013 but Francis regarded Goldwater\u2019s programme, like the \u201cmovement conservatism\u201d of the National Review, as a \u201cquaintly bourgeois\u201d throwback to the oligarchic politics of the 19th century, with nothing to offer the modern working man. Their tribune was not Goldwater but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/14/us/george-wallace-segregation-symbol-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all\">George Wallace</a>, the notorious segregationist and Democratic governor of Alabama \u2013 who won five southern states as an anti-civil rights third-party candidate in the 1968 presidential election. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had appealed to this group, too, but neglected their interests after taking office. Despite having elected multiple presidents, the post-bourgeois proletariat had yet to find a voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370/76_16_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Francis had difficulty explaining why managerial society would generate so much opposition in the first place. In Leviathan and Its Enemies, he argued that resistance to the cosmopolitan elite would be driven by \u201cimmutable elements of human nature\u201d that \u201cnecessitate attachment to the concrete and historical roots of moral values and meaning\u201d.</p> <p>He was more candid in a speech he gave while working on the book. \u201cWhat we as whites must do,\u201d he declared, \u201cis reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites.\u201d Where mainstream conservatives depicted the US as a nation whose diverse population was linked by devotion to its founding principles, Francis viewed it as a racial project inextricably bound up with white rule. The managerial revolution jeopardised this racial hierarchy, and so it must be overthrown.</p> <p>Francis delivered his remarks on racial consciousness at a conference organised by <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, an obscure journal devoted to promoting white nationalism. Years earlier, Francis had struck up a friendship with Jared Taylor, who went on to found the magazine with Francis\u2019s encouragement. From their first encounter, Taylor recalled, he and Francis \u201cunderstood each other immediately\u201d.</p> <p>Francis\u2019s employers at the Washington Times were not as sympathetic. The paper fired him after his comments were released, a move that was part of his larger expulsion from the respectable right. Buckley himself dismissed Francis as \u201cspokesman\u201d for a group that had \u201cearned their exclusion from thoughtful conservative ranks\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Francis would not be so easily purged. For years he had cultivated a relationship with Pat Buchanan, a one-time Nixon protege who had become one of the country\u2019s most recognisable conservatives thanks to his role as co-host of CNN\u2019s popular debating programme Crossfire. In 1992, Buchanan launched a long-shot campaign against incumbent president George HW Bush that, against all expectations, garnered almost 3m votes in the primaries. While all this was going on, Buchanan was growing closer to Francis, whom he later called \u201cperhaps the brightest and best thinker on the right\u201d.</p> <p>Francis and Buchanan were linked by their association with a breakaway faction on the right known as paleoconservatism. While mainstream conservatives had taken advantage of cushy gigs in New York and Washington, paleocons depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160314-flyover-country-origin-language-midwest/\">flyover country</a>. Francis urged Buchanan to make another run for the White House in 1996, this time as the candidate of the post-bourgeois resistance. That campaign would be based on three issues: protectionism, opposition to immigration and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that repudiated global commitments and foreign interventions in order to focus on defending the national interest.</p> <p>Buchanan listened, and he went on to a surprise win in New Hampshire\u2019s pivotal early primary, convincing Francis that the managerial elite was more vulnerable than at any point in his lifetime. While mainstream Republicans and Democrats celebrated forecasts that the US population was on track to become less than 50% white as a sign of America\u2019s capacity to adapt and grow, Francis believed that the members of his post-bourgeois proletariat regarded these shifting demographics as another reminder of their dwindling power.</p> <p>Buchanan\u2019s campaign fizzled after New Hampshire, but Francis had a ready explanation for the collapse: Buchanan was too loyal to the Republican party to seize the opportunity he had been granted. \u201cDon\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative,\u2019\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything any more.\u201d The managerial class had absorbed Buckley and his followers. They, too, were the enemy.</p> <p>After Buchanan\u2019s defeat and his own exile from mainstream conservatism, Francis devoted himself to what he called \u201cracialpolitik\u201d. He was a regular contributor to outlets promoting white racial consciousness \u2013 becoming, in Jared Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cthe intellectual leader of a small but growing movement\u201d. Francis denied that he was a white supremacist, but he condemned interracial sex, warned of \u201cincipient race war\u201d and drafted a manifesto for a white nationalist group arguing: \u201cThe American people and government should remain European in their composition and character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac/0_74_2039_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan at the Cross Roads of the West gun show in Phoenix, Arizona, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he looked ahead, Francis was especially concerned with the threat that one rising political star posed to his vision of the future. Barack Obama, he remarked in 2004, was \u201cthe model of what the New American is supposed to be\u201d. Ivy League-educated, effortlessly cosmopolitan, promising to transcend barriers of race \u2013 Obama was the embodiment of the managerial elite. He represented everything Francis loathed about the contemporary United States.</p> <p>The fact that Obama, Francis\u2019s symbol for American decadence, became one of the most popular figures in the country brought the great contradiction of his thought into relief. The 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie and the 20th century to the managers, he argued, because these rising classes had performed necessary social functions. His post-bourgeois proletariat, by contrast, were on the decline.</p> <p>So was Francis. The supposed realist who cast hunger for power as the driving force of world history spent most of his time writing for journals with subscribers in the low five figures. In his last years, he was a lonely man. Before his sudden death from a cardiac aneurism in 2005, he had begun a study of conservatism and race. His masterpiece, Leviathan and Its Enemies, was still tucked away in a box of floppy disks; when it was published 11 years later, it would be under the auspices of a white-nationalist press. The right-leaning Washington Examiner ran one of his few obituaries. \u201cSam Francis,\u201d it said, \u201cwas merely a racist and doesn\u2019t deserve to be remembered as anything less.\u201d It seemed just as likely that Francis would not be remembered at all.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI want you to really listen<strong> </strong>to this,\u201d Rush Limbaugh told his listeners in January this year. The king of rightwing talk radio was lecturing his audience, which averages around 13 million people a week, on Samuel Francis. Prompted by a magazine article casting Francis as the prophet of Trumpism, Limbaugh read aloud from one of Francis\u2019s post-mortems on the Buchanan campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Limbaugh said, \u201cis how right on it is in foretelling Trump.\u201d Before abandoning the subject, he added one point. Francis, Limbaugh noted, \u201clater in life suffered the \u2013 acquired the \u2013 reputation of being a white supremacist\u201d, a reputation Limbaugh insisted was undeserved.</p> <p>The white nationalists who rallied to Francis in the last decade of his life disagree on that point, but they also see Trump as a vindication of their longtime inspiration. \u201cSam would have said that Trump is doing exactly what he advised Patrick Buchanan to do,\u201d maintains Jared Taylor, who made news in the primary season when it was revealed that he had recorded automated phone messages endorsing Trump. (\u201cWhite Supremacist Robocall Heartily Urges Iowa Voters to Support Trump,\u201d reported a headline in the conservative Daily Caller.) According to Taylor\u2019s American Renaissance, \u201cFrancis would be very pleased to see the GOP and conservative establishments mocked and destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Even liberal commentators are looking back at Francis \u2013 whose prediction of a white working-class backlash against a globalist ruling elite seems to be coming true not just in the US but across Europe. \u201cIf you just drop the white nationalism a lot of Francis makes sense,\u201d says Michael Lind, who once worked as an assistant to Buckley but now describes himself as a \u201cradical centrist\u201d. According to Lind, conservatives have been \u201cspurning their natural constituency \u2013 the mostly white working class\u201d, creating space for the rise of Trump.</p> <p>Francis was also an inspiration for the team at the Journal of American Greatness, who called him \u201cthe closest thing to what could be described as the source of Trumpian thought\u201d in their very first post. They admitted that Francis\u2019s writing \u201covertly indulges various Southern nostalgias\u201d, but insisted that his \u201cdeservedly criticised statements on race\u201d could be separated from the core of his analysis. The managerial class was still the enemy, and only Trump seemed even dimly aware of what it would take to mount an effective challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors of JAG looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the authors at JAG wanted to do more than add chapters to the history Francis had already sketched. While they remain anonymous, sources have identified them as part of a conservative establishment located outside the Washington-New York axis that dominates the intellectual life of the American right \u2013 probably associated with the California-based <a href=\"http://www.claremont.org/\">Claremont Institute</a> and the midwestern <a href=\"https://www.hillsdale.edu/\">Hillsdale College</a>.</p> <p>Trump the candidate, they admitted, was at best an imperfect messenger. But it was the message that counted: \u201cThe American regime \u2013 like nearly all its cousins in the west \u2013 has devolved into an oligarchy.\u201d JAG was not just arguing that Trump\u2019s campaign had a coherent agenda \u2013 a controversial assertion, given that many on both the left and right have dismissed Trump as an unhinged demagogue jabbing randomly at pressure points in the electorate. It was arguing that Trump succeeded <em>because</em> of his platform. Without those ideas, he would have been just another novelty candidate. Armed with them, any of Trump\u2019s more disciplined rivals might have stolen the nomination from him \u2013 but instead they opted for recycled bromides from the Reagan era.</p> <p>The site could be fiery in its defence of Trump, but the best moments came when its targets were the grandees of the right. There are plenty of scathing articles about rightwing thinktanks written from the left, but none of their authors could write a sentence such as \u201cSeeing conservatives court billionaires \u2013 which I have had occasion to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times \u2013 is like watching dorks tell cheerleaders how pretty they are.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, the authors of JAG were still thinkers who looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer. They denounced conservatives for accepting \u201cthe leftist lie\u201d that having a \u201cnatural affinity for people who look, think and speak\u201d alike \u201cis shameful and illegitimate\u201d. \u201cThe ceaseless importation of people unaccustomed to liberty,\u201d they wrote \u2013 referring to \u201cmass third world immigration\u201d \u2013 \u201cmakes the American people less fit for liberty every day\u201d. Islam was a subject of particular concern. \u201cWhat good,\u201d they asked, \u201chas Muslim immigration done for the United States and the American people?\u201d Francis would have approved.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>With its archive deleted, JAG\u2019s internet presence is now confined to the occasional mournful tweet from one of its former readers, but the problems it identified on the right are more glaring than ever. \u201cThe conservative movement\u2019s mission has become providing comfortable professional livelihoods to literally hundreds of people,\u201d David Frum told me recently. Although this behemoth has proved effective at turning a profit, the intellectual returns on the investment have been paltry. \u201cConservatism was a lot more creative and effective when it had less money,\u201d Frum said.</p> <p>This narrowing of intellectual ambitions has coincided with a crisis of authority. When asked to name the dominant theme of the right\u2019s intellectual history since George W Bush left office, conservative journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty responded with one word: \u201cdisintegration\u201d. Buckley has been dead for the better part of a decade, and no successor has emerged with the clout to take up his role as arbiter of the true faith.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the little magazines that once set the tempo of debate have struggled to maintain their influence in the age of social media. \u201cTwenty years ago if you got the summer internship at National Review you were high-fiving everyone you knew,\u201d one conservative activist told me. \u201cThat was like getting the Goldman Sachs internship. You were set.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Kesler, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and professor at nearby Claremont McKenna College, sees a generational change underway. His best students, he says, used to seek out three paths: some went into academia, others into politics, and a third group tried to navigate a path between the two as writers for middlebrow journals such as National Review. But that middle ground has eroded in the last decade, Kesler says. Now many feel \u201crevulsion\u201d at the state of public debate and take refuge in academia \u2013 or they succumb to a \u201cpopulist tug\u201d and end up at rightwing clickbait factories such as <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/01/how-breitbart-unleashes-hate-mobs-to-threaten-dox-and-troll-trump-critics.html\">Breitbart News</a>. That pull will only grow stronger now that Trump has shown how little influence establishment conservatives have over the constituency they claim to represent.</p> <p>In Washington, a policy-minded cohort dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-conservative-reformicons-put-new-twist-on-tax-debate-1423010939\">reformicons</a> has become the great hope for conservatives planning their response to the rise of Trump. Long before this year\u2019s campaign, they had begun to devise a more populist agenda to appeal to the working-class voters who have become an increasingly significant part of the Republican electorate. With an eye to the future, they are also convinced that Republicans need to reject Trump\u2019s brand of white identity politics if it hopes to win elections in a country becoming more diverse by the day.</p> <p>From the reformicon perspective, Trump represents a pathological response to the legitimate complaints of voters whose concerns have been overlooked for too long. The challenge for savvy Republican politicians is to convert the impulses that have propelled Trump\u2019s rise into a platform that can appeal to a multiracial coalition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the well-intentioned reforming wonks have struggled to find an audience outside the capital. Part of the problem is financial. \u201cThere\u2019s no money from rich donors even for reasonable populism,\u201d says Michael Lind. To the ears of conservative billionaires, pleas for economic policies that appeal to workers sound like the prelude to tax hikes on the wealthy. For a Washington-based movement offering what the sceptics at JAG called \u201cmanagerialism with a human face\u201d, a lack of wealthy donors is a potentially fatal obstacle.</p> <p>Of all the forces unleashed by the rise of Trump, the one that may pose the greatest threat to the relevance of the conservative intellectual establishment is the gleefully offensive movement known as the alt-right. Nurtured by online forums such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit\">Reddit</a> and 4chan, along with white-nationalist standbys such as American Renaissance, the alt-right has become a vehicle for the simmering anger of mostly white and mostly young men \u2013 with strong links to the earlier varieties of racialpolitik promoted by Francis, who is sometimes cited as a founder of the alt-right. Mainstream conservatives have reacted with shock and horror to this development. \u201cThe nasty mouth-breathers Buckley expelled from conservatism have returned,\u201d declared a typical response from Commentary, one of the major journals of the establishment right.</p> <p>But the new iconoclasts of the alt-right can\u2019t be purged from a conservative movement they have no desire to join, especially when they can reach an audience of millions on social media. If there is an heir today to the young William F Buckley \u2013 who launched his career with exuberant attacks on the hypocrisy of the liberal establishment and managed to make conservatism look like a stylish rebellion against the powers-that-be \u2013 it might be someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, a professional provocateur who has become a spokesman for the alt-right. At one typical event this spring, Yiannopoulos, who refers to Trump as \u201cDaddy\u201d, delivered a lecture with the title Feminism Is Cancer after being ushered into the auditorium on a throne held aloft by students wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. Yiannopoulos\u2019s critics are rightly concerned that his main agenda is promoting himself, but Brand Milo is a booming business.</p> <p>The future looks more precarious for the guardians of True Conservatism. They have strong support from leading figures in the Republican party such as Paul Ryan, and retain control over an infrastructure of donors, thinktanks and journals. A landslide defeat for Trump could still revive their cause, but they could just as easily be swept aside by a rising generation of rightwing activists with a more Trumpian set of concerns.</p> <p>Their brand of conservatism won\u2019t disappear, but it could become more a curiosity than a movement, as it was in the days before the birth of the modern right over half a century ago. \u201cThe whole Buckley experiment may have been a passing phase,\u201d says Lind \u2013 a strange interlude when a cohort of writers mistook their ideological preferences for the will of the people and, even stranger, provided the basis for an industry based on that delusion. The anxiety that its time has passed lurks underneath all the conservative establishment\u2019s impassioned denunciations of Trump: a fear that his unprecedented victory in the Republican primary has demonstrated it is already obsolete. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Trump said in April, \u201cbut at this point who cares?\u201d</p> <p>But Trump may have unintentionally pointed the way for a new kind of American conservatism, driven by resentment at the globalist diktats of the hated managerial class. Over the last year, that anger has emerged in surprising venues. In language that Francis would have recognised, the billionaire <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/peter-thiel.html\">PayPal co-founder and Silicon Valley guru Peter Thiel</a> declared that America is no longer a democracy \u2013 since it has become a country \u201cdominated by very unelected, technocratic agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Thiel has been an outspoken libertarian since his days as an undergraduate at Stanford in the 1980s, and in 2008 he supplied $500,000 for an attempt to create manmade islands that would provide an \u201cescape from politics in all its forms\u201d, but lately he has started to associate himself with a different crowd. In July, following an outpouring of criticism, <a href=\"https://news.fastcompany.com/peter-thiel-to-speak-atconference-thrown-by-group-tied-to-white-nationalists-4010060\">he cancelled a planned appearance</a> in front of a group that has provided a meeting ground for libertarians and white nationalists, including Francis\u2019s close friend Jared Taylor. But a similar public outcry did not persuade him to drop another speaking engagement earlier that month: a speech on the final night of the Republican national convention, where he had come as a delegate to cast his vote for Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
