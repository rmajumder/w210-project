  "<p>Hillary Clinton has said her husband, former president Bill Clinton, should not have to resign his role as head of their family\u2019s charitable foundation until the presidential election is decided in November. </p> <p>The Democratic nominee said she did not see any ethical problems with her husband\u2019s continued involvement with the Clinton Foundation, which raises money from wealthy donors around the world while she runs for president despite mounting criticism. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump\">Clinton Foundation: Bill to quit board if Hillary becomes president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are conflicts of interest,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hillary-clinton-husband-bill-resign-foundation-post/story?id=41878492\">told ABC\u2019s David Muir</a> in a joint interview today with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, that aired in full on Tuesday. </p> <p>Bill Clinton told supporters in August that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump\">resign from the foundation\u2019s board</a> and stop raising money if his wife were elected. The foundation last month <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chelsea-clinton-to-stay-on-clinton-foundation-board-if-hillary-becomes-president-1472058025\">confirmed</a> that Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would remain on the board even if her mother won in November. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Clinton signaled that this could change. Asked whether she thought her daughter\u2019s ongoing role with the foundation would present a conflict of interest if she were elected, Clinton said she did not. </p> <p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve said over and over again ... these issues will be decided after the election and we will decide the appropriate way forward,\u201d Clinton told reporters during a press conference aboard her plane. </p> <p>In the ABC interview, Clinton also dismissed accusations that allies and donors of the Clinton Foundation received special treatment while she served as secretary of state.</p> <p>\u201cI know that that\u2019s what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, I take it seriously,\u201d Clinton said in the interview, which was taped on Monday between Labor Day campaign stops. </p> <p>When Kaine was asked how he would convince voters who still find Clinton untrustworthy, he made it personal. </p> <p>\u201cI have a son in the military who is deployed overseas right now,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI care very, very deeply about who the next commander-in-chief is. I completely count and trust Hillary Clinton to be a great commander in chief and to make the right decisions for the country. The prospect of Donald Trump making those decisions about the life of my kid and millions of service members scares me to death.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton and her campaign pointed to a more recent<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\"> Washington Post report</a> that revealed the Republican presidential nominee paid a $2,500 penalty to the Internal Revenue Service for a 2013 donation from his charitable organization to an organization associated with the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi. At the time, Bondi was debating whether to investigate the now defunct Trump University. She decided against it. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be compromised by tens of millions of dollars in foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation is no laughing matter either \u2013 it is downright terrifying,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. \u201cWhen that 3am phone call comes, we can\u2019t have an ethically challenged president on the line who took truckloads of cash from other countries.\u201d </p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, Clinton questioned her opponent\u2019s readiness to be the commander-in-chief and his grasp of foreign policy during a campaign event in Tampa, Florida, while her running mate delivered a speech on national security in North Carolina.<br></p> <p>\u201cHis whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform,\u201d Clinton told a crowd, adding that a \u201cman who is so wrong about our veterans isn\u2019t right to serve as commander-in-chief\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton also attacked Trump over his inconsistencies on how to defeat Islamic State, quipping: \u201cHe says he has a secret plan to defeat Isis. But the secret is he has no plan.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cWhen it comes to fighting Isis, he has been all over the map. You would have to literally map it out. He has talked about letting Syria become a free zone for Isis. Look at the map, Donald. He has talked about sending in American ground troops. Not on my watch.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Nicaragua said on Tuesday it has given political asylum to former El Salvador president Mauricio Funes, who has come under scrutiny back home for a truce with gangs during his administration and is also facing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/03/salvadoran-ex-president-francisco-flores-stand-trial-corruption-charges\">multiple legal cases</a>.</p> <p>The Nicaraguan government\u2019s official Daily Gazette published a notice announcing that Funes, his partner and three children have all been granted asylum. It said their lives and physical integrity are in danger as a result of \u201cfighting in favor of democracy, peace, justice and human rights\u201d.</p> <p>Funes said via Twitter that he decided to seek asylum on 31 August \u201cafter confirming the political persecution that is being initiated against me\u201d.</p> <p>According to the Gazette, the petition was dated 1 September, the same day El Salvador\u2019s supreme court ordered the release of a list of Funes\u2019s government-funded trips abroad while in office. Asylum was granted the following day.</p> <p>Funes, a former journalist who was elected as a member of the leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) party, is facing a civil prosecution back home for alleged illicit enrichment. Investigators argue that he and his family need to justify the origin of more than $700,000 in income.</p> <p>Salvador prosecutors have also opened an investigation into possible corruption dating to his 2009-2014 government. In August, Salvadorian authorities raided several homes and businesses searching for evidence related to alleged \u201ccrimes of embezzlement, illicit negotiations, misuse of funds, illicit enrichment and influence-trafficking\u201d.</p> <p>Funes denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cAsylum only seeks to guarantee protection from persecution,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI have not given up on confronting the judicial process nor proving my innocence.\u201d</p> <p>Funes\u2019s government repeatedly denied approving negotiations with the gangs, which are blamed for violence that has pushed El Salvador\u2019s homicide rates to among the highest in the world.

  "<h2>\u2018Son of a whore\u2019 x3</h2> <p>The sitting president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, is fed up with people criticizing the way his countrymen carry out extrajudicial killings. He called President Barack Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d for America\u2019s criticism of the drug war which has claimed 2,400 victims in the last two months. This epithet was sufficiently offensive for Obama to cancel a planned meeting with Duterte. But the president shouldn\u2019t be overly shocked. Duterte <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://time.com/4328906/rodrigo-duterte-pope-francis-philippine-president-son-whore/\">called Pope Francis</a> a \u201cson of a whore\u201d for snarling up Manila traffic earlier this year when he visited the country.

I know what you\u2019re thinking; this Duterte dude sounds like a sophisticate on the world stage, but he isn\u2019t the only person to have strayed near the edges of acceptable diplomatic language.</p> <h2>\u2018A female llama surprised when bathing\u2019</h2> <p>There\u2019s a proud history of diplomatic tension between the French and the British. Whether Napoleon <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_shopkeepers\">described</a> Britain as a \u201cnation of shopkeepers\u201d or not, French statesman Georges Clemenceau spoke witheringly of David Lloyd George: \u201cOh, if I could piss the way he speaks!\u201d and in similarly punchy terms, Churchill mocked Charles de Gaulle: \u201cWhat can you do with a man who looks like a female llama surprised when bathing?\u201d How Churchill came to know what that might look like is unclear, but withering putdowns of Frenchmen were once all the fashion. Lawrence of Arabia described French marshal Ferdinand Foch colourfully as \u201ca frantic pair of moustaches\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018Young, handsome, and tanned\u2019</h2> <p>A great one for the racist insult was the Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi who in 2008 described the up and coming President-elect Barack Obama as \u201cyoung, handsome, and tanned\u201d. Making the comments after a meeting in Moscow, Berlusconi said that those who disagreed with his description were humourless \u201cimbeciles\u201d, adding: \u201cHow can you take such a great compliment negatively?\u201d A year later, Berlusconi met the Obamas at a G20 summit and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15642201\">said afterwards</a> to the press: \u201cWhat\u2019s his name? Some tanned guy. Ah, Barack Obama! You won\u2019t believe it, but the two of them sunbathe together because the wife is also tanned.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018Appalling old waxworks\u2019</h2> <p>The heir to the British throne has found himself snarled in diplomatic incidents with some of the world\u2019s major powers. Prince Charles\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/19/pressandpublishing.china\">1997 diaries</a> on the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese (title: \u201cThe Handover of Hong Kong or The Great Chinese Takeaway\u201d) revealed that Prince Charles viewed officials as \u201cappalling old waxworks\u201d and labelled one Chinese handover ceremony an \u201cawful Soviet-style\u201d performance. Awkwardly, the Queen herself was caught by the media describing Chinese officials during President Xi Jinping\u2019s first state visit to Britain last year as \u201cvery rude\u201d. Worst of all, Prince Philip famously told British students on a 1986 state visit to China that \u201cif you stay here much longer, you\u2019ll all be slitty-eyed\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018Terrific wankerer\u2019, \u2018sadistic nurse\u2019: Boris strikes again (and again)</h2> <p>All of this means that our foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, cannot even hope to win awards for undiplomatic language, however often he mentions the US president\u2019s part-Kenyan ancestry, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/boris-johnson-wins-the-spectators-president-erdogan-offensive-poetry-competition/\">calls the Turkish president</a> a \u201cterrific wankerer\u201d, quips that the only reason he \u201cwouldn\u2019t visit some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump\u201d or that Hillary Clinton looks like \u201ca sadistic nurse in a mental hospital\u201d. If Britain goes toe-to-toe with the Philippines, and Boris Johnson finds himself being described as the \u201cson of a whore\u201d then at least he knows he\u2019s in great company.</p>",

  "<p>So your politician did something with his penis. In an age of duelling sympathies \u2013 free speech v invasion of privacy, opposing revenge porn v exposing moralistic hypocrisy \u2013 it can be difficult to navigate quite how to feel. Should we care? Should we rage? Should we leave adult human beings to manage their own genitals? Should adult human beings who apparently cannot even be trusted to keep their own genital secrets a secret be trusted with very important big secrets, such as the President\u2019s Book of Secrets?</p> <p>Well, it depends.</p> <p>In Britain this week, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/05/why-the-sunday-mirror-was-justified-in-exposing-keith-vaz\">expos\u00e9 by the Sunday Mirror revealed MP Keith Vaz</a> allegedly enlisting the services of two male sex workers and offering to pay for cocaine. The tabloid justified its intrusion into Vaz\u2019s private life by arguing that his position as chair of the home affairs select committee \u2013 which, after an extensive inquiry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/01/decriminalisation-of-sex-workers-in-england-and-wales-backed-by-mps\">recently recommended the decriminalisation of sex work</a> \u2013 constituted a conflict of interest (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/keith-vaz-resigns-as-chair-of-home-affairs-select-committee\">Vaz has now resigned from the committee</a>).</p> <p>That stance has been taken up and loudly championed by opponents of full decriminalisation, eager to use Vaz\u2019s personal violation as a cudgel to discredit the committee\u2019s findings. As Joan Smith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/keith-vaz-home-affairs-committee-chair-prostitutes-sex-trade\">wrote in this paper</a>: \u201cTo put it bluntly, he appears to have chaired hearings where campaigners proposed a change in the law that could, in theory, turn his own private behaviour into a criminal offence.\u201d</p> <p>In the US last week, former congressman Anthony Weiner strode boldly into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal\">yet another sexting scandal</a> (his third), his passion for a career and a marriage apparently superseded by his passion for showing strange ladies what the outline of his penis looks like in boxer briefs. Which is fine, of course. We all have our hobbies and priorities. (Perhaps, though, Weiner\u2019s lot is more accurately characterised not as a life intermittently derailed by public tumescence but as one long, continuous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/did-anthony-weiner-want-to-get-caught-sexting\">sext</a> with the occasional breather.)</p> <p>This time around, Weiner upped the grimace factor by taking a photo of his activated crotch about six inches from the head of his sleeping toddler. He also used that one-big-eye-one-small-eye-waggy-tongue emoji a lot, which should be illegal.</p> <p>And by sending his penis pics to a \u201cbusty brunette\u201d Trump supporter who gleefully made them public, Weiner handed the GOP fodder for several weeks of significance-free yowling about Hillary Clinton, whose longtime aide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-controversy-hillary-clinton-campaign\">Huma Abedin, happens to be Weiner\u2019s now-estranged wife</a>. The implicit message in the Abedin melee is the same one that has clung to Clinton for decades: \u201cIf she can\u2019t even satisfy her husband, how can she possibly satisfy America?\u201d (Because this retrograde country\u2019s first female president can\u2019t just be a politician \u2013 she\u2019ll also have to be America\u2019s wife and mommy.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c7d0c31f309044b54fce0e39e64759f4faf9f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c7d0c31f309044b54fce0e39e64759f4faf9f4/0_247_4005_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Weiner, as then New York mayoral candidate, with his now-estranged wife and longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Weiner, as then New York mayoral candidate, with his now-estranged wife and longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The case for the newsworthiness of the Weiner scandal appears to be that his name is Weiner and he does things with his wiener. Which \u2013 I get it \u2013 is a small joy in a grim world. But, as <a href=\"http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/08/29/24525226/anthony-weiner-caught-doing-what-weiner-does-best\">sex columnist Dan Savage notes</a>, our love of a lurid tabloid story and a penis pun really doesn\u2019t justify posting someone\u2019s private sex pics without their consent:</p> <p>\u201cMaking private sext messages public? Do it to anyone else, you\u2019re the asshole. Do it to Anthony Weiner, he\u2019s the asshole. Why the double standard? Posting dirty pictures or videos that were shared with you privately \u2013 or made with you privately \u2013 without the consent of the person in those pictures or videos is called revenge porn and it\u2019s a crime in many states.\u201d</p> <p>So how do you tell if you\u2019re looking at a newsworthy sex scandal or a prurient, exploitative one? Pretty simple. Just ask yourself:</p> <p>1. Was this politician engaged in legal, consensual penis shenanigans (cheating, sexting, canoodling) or wicked, life-ruining penis crime (sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence, child pornography)?</p> <p>2. In their capacity as a lawmaker, did this politician push oppressive, socially conservative legislation that regulated or criminalised the consensual, private sex lives of others? Did they yell all the time about gay people burning in hell or encourage parents to send their kids to abusive gay conversion camps or vote against anti-discrimination laws, while soliciting same-sex blowjobs in public toilets? Did they insist that abortion is baby-murder while procuring expensive secret abortions for their mistresses and daughters?</p> <p>If the answer to 1 is \u201ccrime\u201d or the answer to 2 is \u201cYUP,\u201d or if you\u2019ve got yourself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/dennis-hastert-sentenced-prison-child-molestation\">a twofer like former US house speaker Denny Hastert</a>, then congrats! That\u2019s a scandal that actually means something. If not, and, on top of everything, you find yourself gawking at someone\u2019s private correspondence that\u2019s been dredged up by vultures or homophobes with an agenda, maybe take a pass.</p> <p>By this metric, political stings for prostitution only matter if you believe that paying for sex should be criminalised (I don\u2019t \u2013 I prefer to listen to sex workers when they tell us what keeps them safe). And Weiner\u2019s escapade is a non-event. He\u2019s not even a politician any more \u2013 just a guy who probably shouldn\u2019t be in a monogamous marriage and wants to show his penis off to brunettes in the (illusory) privacy of his own phone. I understand why Abedin would care. It is hard for me to care.</p> <p>Come on. Stop. Talk about real stuff, not this sideshow. (Also, abolish that emoji.)</p>",

Her claims unleashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/07/gretchen-carlson-roger-ailes-fox-news-lawsuit-other-women\">a wave of accusations from other women</a> who encountered Ailes during his decades-long career in television and Republican politics. In the weeks following her lawsuit, more than 20 women contacted Carlson\u2019s attorneys to say they had also been victims. A similar number spoke to investigators hired by 21st Century Fox to look into Carlson\u2019s accusations.</p> <p>Though Carlson sued Ailes personally, Fox News is liable for the settlement of the suit according to a report on the deals in Vanity Fair, which broke the news of the $20m payout. It\u2019s unclear how much of the money Ailes is personally responsible for.</p> <p>In response to the suit, Ailes initially maintained that he fired Carlson over poor ratings. He dismissed her and others\u2019 allegations as categorically false and reportedly called on other Fox News anchors to publicly lend their support. One of the loudest voices in Ailes\u2019s defense, Greta Van Susteren, abruptly left the network on Tuesday. </p> <p>Van Susteren wrote on her Facebook page: \u201cFox has not felt like home to me for a few years and I took advantage of the clause in my contract which allows me to leave now.\u201d According to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/fox-settles-with-carlson-then-van-susteren-quits.html\">a report in New York Magazine</a>, the clause stipulated that Van Susteren could leave if Ailes left. \u201cThe clause had a time limitation, meaning I could not wait,\u201d Van Susteren wrote. </p> <p>New York reported that Van Susteren was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the culture exposed by the lawsuit and the investigation by law firm Paul, Weiss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a8e10495dea88715670a96f08b7d79513d90286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a8e10495dea88715670a96f08b7d79513d90286/0_322_2634_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Ailes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Ailes left Fox in July amid a wave of sexual harassment allegations.

Ailes himself has retained Beverly Hills attorney Charles Harder, the lawyer who helped Peter Thiel sue Gawker through proxy Hulk Hogan in a suit that, though the verdict is likely to be overturned on appeal, bankrupted the company and left one of its editors penniless. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61d2be5c-7382-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a\">a report in the Financial Times</a>, Ailes wants Harder to help him pursue legal action against New York Magazine and its reporter Gabriel Sherman, who broke many of the stories around Ailes\u2019s decline and fall.</p> <p> With the accusations mounting \u2013 including, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/sources-kelly-said-ailes-sexually-harassed-her.html\">reportedly</a>, a claim of sexual harassment by the network\u2019s star anchor, Megyn Kelly \u2013 Ailes\u2019s position had become increasingly tenuous. On 21 July, Ailes was ousted from the rightwing cable giant he helped found nearly two decades ago.</p> <p>Claims of harassment and intimidation have continued to emerge in the wake of Ailes\u2019s departure. In late July, Laurie Dhue, a former on-air host, announced her plans for a tell-all book detailing claims of sexual harassment against Ailes.</p> <p>On Friday, Sherman <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/02/fox-news-phone-hack-report-media-matters\">reported</a> that a private investigator hired by Fox News had accessed the phone records of a reporter for Media Matters, a watchdog group that monitors conservative media outlets, at the behest of a Fox executive. In the US, obtaining phone records without permission is a crime.

Although Levada stopped accepting foreign grants in 2013, Anti-Maidan accused it of being paid by the Pentagon as part of a project with the University of Wisconsin. Gudkov said the centre had worked on studies with the university but denied any links to the US defence department, telling the independent TV station Rain the checks were a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d.</p> <p>Putin signed a law in 2012 requiring non-government organisations that receive funding from abroad and engage in vaguely defined \u201cpolitical activity\u201d to register as foreign agents.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s claims that if he loses in November it will be due to a \u201crigged\u201d election have sparked strong bipartisan criticism from election lawyers, donors and a former member of Congress who warn that the Republican candidate\u2019s words are dangerous, fueling doubts about the election\u2019s legitimacy and potentially leading to voter intimidation.</p> <p>As his poll numbers have weakened and his high-decibel spats with critics escalated, Trump has raised the specter of rigged elections and suggested that if he loses it might well be because of voter fraud. </p> <p>\u201cThe only way we can lose, in my opinion, I really mean this, Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on,\u201d Trump told a largely white rally last month in Altoona, Pennsylvania. \u201cGo down to certain areas and watch and study [to] make sure other people don\u2019t come in and vote five times.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have unbelievable turnout, but we don\u2019t want to see people voting five times,\u201d Trump added, saying that he had \u201cheard some stories about certain parts of the state and we have to be very careful\u201d.</p> <p>Several election lawyers and analysts are disturbed by Trump\u2019s combustible use of language.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric is troubling and casts a shadow over the legitimacy of the elections,\u201d said Ken Gross, a well-known election lawyer in Washington who represents both Republican and Democratic clients. \u201cTrump\u2019s words may motivate people to go to polling places and potentially intimidate people not to vote.\u201d </p> <p>The idea that \u201celections are rigged and there\u2019s widespread fraud is not backed up by facts\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Others echo these concerns. \u201cTo argue that the process is rigged and prepare people for a supposedly illegitimate outcome is a very dangerous thing,\u201d former Reublican representative Vin Weber told the Guardian. \u201cWhat you want is to have a civil peaceful election [and] you don\u2019t want to disrupt that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-tax-returns-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52vdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2696938\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: 'Trump clearly has something to hide' in tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cf3270e4b0bc856be626ee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906Clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906Clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906Clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-tax-returns-hillary-clinton-video\">Hillary Clinton: \u2018Trump clearly has something to hide\u2019 in tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One prominent GOP election lawyer says that Trump\u2019s fears are overblown, stressing that the \u201cfar right has been worked up about voter fraud for the last five to 10 years, but there\u2019s little evidence that this type of activity is material. I don\u2019t like it when people talk about issues that haven\u2019t happened yet, or are phantom issues\u201d.</p> <p>Recent studies indicate that voter fraud is not widespread. Only 31 cases of possible in-person voter fraud were found from 2000 to 2014, during which period over 1bn votes were cast in general and primary elections, according to a study by Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s ominous warnings seem part of a new campaign mantra. The candidate voiced similar views this summer in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">interview with The Washington Post</a> and on Fox News with Sean Hannity. </p> <p>Trump complained to the Post that recent court decisions nixing restrictive voter ID laws could well lead to voter fraud, calling this a \u201cvery unfair development. We may have people vote 10 times\u201d. Likewise on Hannity, Trump urged supporters to begin \u201cwatching closely\u201d lest the election be \u201ctaken away from us\u201d.</p> <p>On the campaign trail in Ohio Trump declared: \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, the candidate\u2019s website boasts a section that not only informs supporters how they can be a \u201cvolunteer Trump election observer\u201d, but also echoes Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric about election rigging. Those who sign up to be volunteers receive emails explaining that the campaign intends to do \u201ceverything that we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked Hillary from rigging the election\u201d. The website notes that volunteers would be useful in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with Trump talking about training poll watchers as campaigns have long done, stresses Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now holds the same title at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \u201cBut if he\u2019s suggesting, as it appears he is, that his supporters should take any actions that would result in intimidation of voters, that\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p> <p>Adds Charlie Black, a veteran GOP operative: \u201cIf it was my campaign, I\u2019d let the lawyers handle any potential voter fraud.\u201d </p> <p>Some conservative groups have echoed Trump\u2019s fears about rigged elections.</p> <p>Right-leaning groups \u2013 including Judicial Watch and True the Vote \u2013 are calling for extra vigilance, and raising money off the issue. Judicial Watch has rolled out an \u201cElection Integrity Project\u201d which warns voters that \u201cthe integrity of our elections is under systematic assault by leftists and politicians whose objective is clearly to manipulate the elections for their own gains\u201d. The project charges that certain states are refusing to clean their voter rolls of the deceased and people who have moved and has filed suits in some states to force them to do so.</p> <p>Outside experts disagree with the premise that there\u2019s a link between voter rolls and voter fraud. \u201cIn-person voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and is a myth that has been used to to justify voter restrictions like photo IDs,\u201d said Gerry Hebert, the executive director of the Campaign Legal Center. </p> <p>And Hebert adds that filing a lawsuit to clean up voter rolls \u201cis not proof of voter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>But Trump allies have continued to stoke fears of fraud. Longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone, who has offered periodic advice during the campaign and publicly raised the specter of a rigged election, told Breitbart News that the government \u201cwill be shut down if they attempt to steal this election and swear Hillary in\u201d.</p> <p>Some GOP operatives poke fun at Trump\u2019s fears of a \u201crigged\u201d election \u2013 especially in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s comments make perfect sense coming from a paranoid narcissist,\u201d quipped Rick Tyler, a former spokesman for Senator Ted Cruz, noting that the GOP \u201chasn\u2019t won Pennsylvania in a presidential election since 1988\u201d.</p> <p>But other critics see graver threats in Trump\u2019s words.</p> <p> \u201cIf people start to believe that elections aren\u2019t legitimate then it could encourage anarchy and despotism,\u201d said Michael Epstein, a GOP donor and fundraiser who initially backed Governor Scott Walker in the primaries. \u201cIf you lose respect for government, anything is possible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, has written to church leaders in Britain asking them to help prevent attacks on Poles living in the UK and combat a climate of \u201caversion and animosity\u201d.</p> <p>Duda said on Tuesday his letters to the heads of the Church of England and the Catholic church in Britain were in support of the Polish government\u2019s efforts to obtain better protection for the hundreds of thousands of Poles living in Britain.</p> <p>Last week, 40-year-old Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik died after he was beaten by teenagers in Harlow, about 30 miles north of London. Three other Poles have been attacked there, and there have been reports of further incidents across Britain.</p> <p>In his letters to the archbishop of Canterbury and to the archbishop of Westminster, Duda said such attacks could potentially create a divide between Poles and British people.</p> <p>He pleaded for a \u201cconstructive effort\u201d from church communities and local parishes to \u201calleviate the adverse consequences of intolerance and xenophobia, including what appears to be a clear instance of aversion and animosity toward Poles\u201d.</p> <p>Duda\u2019s plea came as Polish and British police met on Tuesday to discuss J\u00f3\u017awik\u2019s killing and the protection being given to the Polish community more generally in the south-east of England.</p> <p>Two senior Polish ministers said they had been given assurances by the British home secretary, Amber Rudd, and foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, at an emergency meeting in London on Monday that the protection of Polish communities in the UK would be stepped up. </p> <p>The spate of apparently targeted attacks has caused mounting alarm in the large Polish community in the UK, as well as in Poland. </p> <p>Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, the Polish home affairs minister, accompanied by the foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, expressed surprise that Essex police had released on bail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">six teenagers arrested in connection with the death of J\u00f3\u017awik</a>.</p> <p>Essex police have said J\u00f3\u017awik and a second Polish man who survived were apparently the victims of an unprovoked attack. The motive is unknown, but police are investigating whether it was a hate crime.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/poland-runs-own-investigation-of-polish-mans-death-in-essex\">The Poles are to mount their own criminal investigation into the death of J\u00f3\u017awik</a>, but are acting in cooperation with Essex police.</p> <p>In addition to assurances that the protection of Polish communities in the UK would be increased, the Polish ministers said Johnson told them he would look into incidents such as inappropriate media comments. </p> <p>The two ministers came to the UK only days after the Polish deputy prime minister visited the country, underscoring the concern over the anti-Polish atmosphere in parts of the UK. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/22/polish-uk-brexit-dont-think-many-will-stay-poland-immigration\">Poles on Brexit: 'I don't think many will stay.

A few months ago, on the sidelines of the campaign leading up to the Brexit decision and after the referendum, incidents against Poles have begun to occur,\u201d said Waszczykowski.</p> <p>He added that the Polish side appreciated that many British politicians, including Theresa May, have condemned attacks on Poles.</p> <p>Poland is the most common foreign country of birth for people living in Britain, according to figures released last month by the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>An estimated 831,000 Polish-born people lived in Britain in 2015, compared with 69,000 in 2004 when Poland joined the EU and its nationals gained the right to live and work in Britain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/poland-wants-to-play-intermediary-for-brexit-talks-says-deputy-pm\">Poland has offered to act as a mediator between the rest of the EU and the UK</a> in the coming talks about Brexit.

Were Republican leaders to start listening to climate science experts, many of their voters would likely follow suit. After all, most American conservatives already support climate policies; they just don\u2019t view the issue as a priority. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">today\u2019s Republican Party is essentially controlled by the fossil fuel industry</a>. As the study notes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>we and others have argued that the conservative movement, fearful of the regulatory implications of climate change, and seeking to defend the current economic system built on fossil fuel use, has been the driving force behind organized climate change denial.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Conservative media climate denial is a root problem</strong></h2> <p>Public perception and priorities are also heavily influenced by the media. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/08/global-warming-denial-fox-news\">A 2013 study</a> found that conservative media consumers are more likely to distrust scientific experts and reject climate science realities. </p> <p>Relatedly, <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/09/01/study-newspaper-opinion-pages-feature-science-denial-and-other-climate-change-misinformation/212700\">a new report by Media Matters</a> on climate coverage in major American newspaper opinion pages found pervasive misinformation in the Wall Street Journal.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Out of 93 climate-related opinion pieces published in the Journal during the time period examined, 31 featured climate science denial or other scientifically inaccurate claims about climate change (33 percent)</em></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc807650e130c418306ee0e5353a017c06538e1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc807650e130c418306ee0e5353a017c06538e1d/0_0_2000_1414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Climate science misinformation in major newspapers in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A study last year found that the <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/08/11/its-not-just-the-editorial-page-study-finds-wsj/204855\">WSJ\u2019s biased climate coverage extended beyond its opinion pages to its news coverage</a> as well.

The evidence so far gives little basis for optimism.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>There\u2019s plenty of blame to go around. Republican policymakers have failed to deliver much-needed leadership on climate change, American conservatives have relied too heavily on biased media sources, and conservative media outlets like Murdoch\u2019s WSJ have misinformed their readers.</p> <h2><strong>Democrats are tackling climate change on their own</strong></h2> <p>Until the fossil fuel industry\u2019s control over conservative policymakers and media loosens, American climate action will be up to the Democratic Party.

  "<p>In 2017, several months after the United States swears in a new president, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands will turn 50 years old. Some birthdays ought not to be celebrated, however. Through its occupation, Israel continues to colonize territory in the West Bank and further entrench its military rule, with no sign of it ending. American politicians may not want to face this reality, but the situation is dire, leading Jay Michaelson of The Forward to <a href=\"http://forward.com/opinion/348267/if-israels-occupation-is-permanent-why-isnt-it-the-same-as-apartheid/\">write</a>: \u201cAs a temporary policy, the occupation is unjust. As a permanent one, it is apartheid.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have good, workable solutions to this most intractable of problems. Just kidding. Although the entire world knows that a durable resolution to the conflict is imperative, not in the interests of justice but also in the pursuit of peace in the region, the American presidential candidates have about as much to offer peace in the Middle East as New Coke and Crystal Pepsi offered to the future of carbonated beverages.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to know where he stands, but he\u2019ll stand there vehemently. In January 2013, Trump recorded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> endorsing rightwing Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s run for prime minister, but by December 2015, Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0e098fa7e6ec4900b08efad80c15348a/ap-conversation-trump-calls-mideast-peace-toughest-deal\">told</a> the Associated Press that he would be \u201cneutral\u201d when negotiating a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and he questioned \u201cwhether or not Israel\u2019s willing to sacrifice certain things\u201d to come to an agreement.</p> <p>But then, by March 2016, Trump was again changing positions. He <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/03/21/donald-trump-aipac-israel-hillary-clinton-sot-tsr.cnn\">said</a> that \u201cit\u2019s probably not possible\u201d to be neutral and by May, he <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3571403/Trump-insists-Israel-building-West-Bank-settlements-says-Netanyahu-moving-forward-Palestinians-fired-thousands-missiles-Jewish-state.html\">told</a> the Daily Mail that Israel should \u201ckeep moving forward\u201d with new settlement construction in the West Bank, thereby flouting five decades of stated (though completely ineffectual) US policy.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t stop there. Come June, Trump\u2019s co-adviser on Israeli affairs, David Friedman, told the Israeli newspaper <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.726779\">Haaretz</a> that Trump would probably support annexing parts of the West Bank and that a Palestinian state is not \u201can American imperative at all\u201d, with Friedman asserting that he\u2019s also unconcerned about a binational state because \u201cnobody really knows how many Palestinians live there\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, there are 2,898,927 Palestinians living in the West Bank, 1,850,559 in the Gaza Strip, 1,471,201 in Israel, and a total of 12,365,761 worldwide (end of <a href=\"http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Downloads/book2188.pdf\">2015</a> figures), according to the reputable Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>Even the rabidly rightwing Breitbart News \u2013 now completely aligned with the Trump campaign \u2013 links to a source <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/palestinian-bureau-of-statistics/\">citing</a> the Palestinian statistics bureau. So when Trump\u2019s adviser says nobody really knows, he must mean Trump doesn\u2019t know. Trump is nobody.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Hillary Clinton, a politician who seems never to have met a war she won\u2019t vote for. Her bellicose <a href=\"http://time.com/4265947/hillary-clinton-aipac-speech-transcript/\">speech</a> in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) last March promised not a new solution to the conflict but rather a shield for Israel from global pressure and nonviolent opposition movements over Israel\u2019s actions and illegal settlement activity. The <a href=\"https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf\">final</a> Democratic party platform isn\u2019t much better on the issue. It repeats language similar to Clinton\u2019s Aipac speech, declaring that Israelis \u201cdeserve security\u201d (and Palestinians don\u2019t?), while Palestinians \u201cshould be\u201d rather than \u201cmust be\u201d free to govern themselves. As a practiced diplomat, Clinton surely knows that such word choices matter.</p> <p>When Democratic party leaders were negotiating the 2016 platform, the Bernie Sanders wing of the party proposed an amendment calling for \u201can end to occupation and illegal settlements\u201d. This internationally recognized position was considered too \u201c<a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/29/inside-the-democratic-partys-showdown-over-israel-palestine/\">one-sided</a>\u201d for the party establishment, and the amendment was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/09/politics/democratic-platform-israel-palestine-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/\">defeated</a> by a vote of 73-95, though the final draft twice mentions that Palestinians ought to be able to live in \u201cdignity\u201d. The Republican Party <a href=\"https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5b1%5d-ben_1468872234.pdf\">platform</a>, meanwhile, is zealously anti-Palestinian and basically off in its own world. It states that the party \u201crejects the false notion that Israel is an occupier\u201d, and describes the completely nonviolent Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement as one of several \u201calternative forms of warfare\u201d being waged upon Israel. So there\u2019s that.</p> <p>Party platform statements don\u2019t mean much in the end, and these reflect more how the Democrats are sticking to a tired status quo framed by the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Republicans are spinning hard to the right. Neither position offers anything that shows that they truly understand the reality of the situation.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, there are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-west-bank-settlements-israel-election.html\">now</a> more than 350,000 settlers living in the West Bank and another 300,000 living in East Jerusalem, greater than double the number since the Oslo Accords were signed and still in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its citizens into territory it controls or displacing those who live there. Around 60% of West Bank land, dubbed Area C under Oslo, is under exclusive Israeli control. And the thriving business of settlement enterprises further dispossesses Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch recently <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/19/occupation-inc-how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian\">documented</a>. Some Palestinians who have lost their own businesses or farms due to Israeli land confiscations, discriminatory regulations, or water deprivations are then left with no choice but to work for the very businesses that displaced them in the first place.</p> <p>Palestinian citizens of Israel struggle under a <a href=\"http://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/7771\">system</a> that accords them fewer rights and opportunities than their Jewish counterparts. And regardless of what one thinks of Hamas, the siege that Israel imposes (with Egyptian collusion) on Gaza affects all of its inhabitants and is unconscionable. According to the Israeli organization <a href=\"http://gisha.org/\">Gisha</a>, over 70% of Gaza\u2019s population relies on humanitarian aid, while 47% suffer from food insecurity. In the second quarter of 2016, unemployment was at 41.7%, and at a staggering 57.6% among young people.</p> <p>Nothing in the current situation excuses the abhorrent and immoral attacks on civilians, whether coming from Palestinians or Israelis, and any lasting solution must work to guarantee peace and security for everyone.</p> <p>But the precarious situation of today is a consequence and not a contradiction of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and it\u2019s high time we recognize that the Oslo Accords are as likely to bring peace to the Middle East as Donald Trump is to unite America. From its conception, Oslo never required Israel to recognize Palestinian rights to statehood and has instead enabled Israeli encroachment on the West Bank. Over 20 years ago, Edward Said predicted that the accords would establish the Palestinian Authority not as a sovereign government of the Palestinians but as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v15/n20/edward-said/the-morning-after\">Israel\u2019s enforcer</a>\u201d of the occupation. I was a student of Edward Said\u2019s then, and I clearly remember the loneliness from which he objected to the agreement along with his refusal to attend the White House signing ceremony out of principle. At the time, he was considered an obstructionist outlier. History has only proven him right.</p> <p>The next president of the United States must recognize the folly of current approaches and seek new solutions. Until now, the international consensus has been focused on a state-oriented resolution as a way to confer rights and stability to Palestinians and Israelis. But what if that equation were flipped, if the focus were instead on enshrining full equality for everyone before even considering the creation of two states? A new administration ought to concentrate on mechanisms (including withholding aid) geared to guaranteeing the human rights of all the people living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river, along with ways to preserve the communal rights of each of the communities.</p> <p>Whether the result of such an approach leads to one state or two states or 21 states on the land is immaterial. (In fact, slim majorities of both Palestinians and Israelis still <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dae99c74e08a4c4082e8c2387ad656d8/poll-shows-most-israelis-palestinians-still-seek-peace\">support</a> a two-state solution.) What matters is that we finally wake from the 23-year-old slumber induced by Oslo, the numbing half-century of occupation, and the nearly 70 years of Palestinian dispossession, to see that the only durable resolution to this conflict will be one that protects Israelis and Palestinians equally, with liberty and justice for all. </p>",
  "<p>Henry Rollins likes to talk. Actually, saying Rollins likes to talk is a bit like saying an anteater enjoys ants, or a boxer doesn\u2019t mind getting into a punch-on. On top of countless books and <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/authors/henry-rollins-2127489\">a column in the LA Weekly</a>, his spoken-word performances can run upwards of three hours.

(Perhaps it\u2019s helpful to note, at this point, that Rollins \u2013 born Henry Garfield \u2013 was diagnosed with hyperactivity in fourth grade.)</p> <p>But what does Rollins still have to be angry about? By his own admission, he\u2019s a rich, white, heterosexual, educated American dude who has been spared what he calls the American beating. \u201cI live in a really nice neighbourhood [in the Hollywood Hills] with ridiculously famous neighbours,\u201d he says. \u201cI call the cops and they show up in about 40 seconds and they call me \u2018Mr Rollins\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from the days when the LAPD routinely harassed Black Flag and their fans, often shutting down shows. More seriously, Rollins has seen the extreme violence of America close up too: in 1991 he bore witness to the still-unsolved murder of his best friend Joe Cole, who was shot dead in an attempted robbery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d1adb711650cb0c8000e154abe851e5dd2468f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d1adb711650cb0c8000e154abe851e5dd2468f/0_0_2300_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Rollins performs at Hammersmith Apollo in 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018America gets what America deserves\u2019: Henry Rollins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Success has mostly insulated him from further trauma.

  "<p>Donald Trump kicked off Labor Day by pivoting yet again on immigration.<br></p> <p>On a day when he barnstormed Ohio like a conquering hero, the Republican nominee left open the possibility of a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and indicated a desire to move on from the issue.</p> <p>In an interview with reporters on his jet, somewhere over north-eastern Ohio, Trump insisted that while anyone seeking to become a citizen was \u201cgoing to have to get out and come back in through the process\u201d, he was \u201cnot ruling out anything\u201d when it came those who remained in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to make that decision into the future. That decision will be made.</p> <p>\u201cOur first thing will be to get all the bad elements out, the gang members, secure the border, stop the drugs from coming in.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I talk about more than anything else is jobs. We\u2019ve been talking about immigration \u2026 if I didn\u2019t bring up immigration, you guys wouldn\u2019t have been talking about it. Immigration is a huge problem. I\u2019ve proved that and I\u2019ll solve that problem. But the thing I am going to be best at is jobs, at renegotiating trade deals, which are a disaster.\u201d </p> <p>As the Republican nominee later declared in his in-flight interview \u201cit\u2019s all about jobs \u2026 The immigration position is so clear and so well announced \u2013 we gotta stop the drugs, we gotta stop criminality, get rid of the bad ones, and a lot of them are bad \u2013 it\u2019s really now so much talking about jobs because our country has been destroyed by other countries taking our jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a week earlier Trump had given a hardline immigration speech, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">proclaiming firmly</a>: \u201cThere will be no amnesty\u201d and insisting \u201canyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d</p> <p>But surrogates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">appearing on Sunday shows</a> made his position sound more nuanced. The former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump confidante, told CNN he had left \u201ca very big opening for what will happen with the people that remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday Trump seemed eager to focus on jobs in blue-collar Ohio communities. Starting with a roundtable with union members outside Cleveland, then making a retail stop before being mobbed by crowds at a county fair outside Youngstown, Trump bathed in the adulation \u2013 the New York City real estate mogul transformed into a working-class hero. </p> <p>At the roundtable, introduced by Tom Coyne, the Democratic mayor of Brook Park, Ohio who cast his first Republican vote for Trump in March\u2019s presidential primaries, the nominee bemoaned the fact that Mexico and China were taking American jobs. As he told reporters later: \u201cThey are taking our jobs like Grant took Richmond.\u201d</p> <p>He criticised Barack Obama over his visit to China where the G20 hosts didn\u2019t \u201cgive him stairs, the proper stairs to get out\u201d. The \u201cmetal staircase\u201d Obama descended was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/05/trump-obama-china-trip-snub-clinton-ohio-campaign\">attached to Air Force One</a>. \u201c[If it] were me I\u2019d say you know what folks, I respect you a lot, but let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Voters in Ohio seemed to warm to his style. At a county fair in traditionally Democratic Mahoning County, Trump was mobbed as he briefly walked through the crowd. The Republican nominee smiled and waved as infatuated Ohioans shouted \u201cWe love you Donald\u201d and even shrieked in glee. </p> <p>Adulation in Ohio, maybe \u2013 but Trump faces as a tough battle as he lags in national and state polls. Looking ahead to the debates, he pledged that barring \u201churricanes [or] natural disaster, I expect to do all three. I look forward to the debates. I think it is an important element of what we\u2019re doing. I think you have an obligation to do the debates.\u201d</p> <p> He confirmed that he was not engaging in traditional preparation \u2013 no mock debates, no one playing Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people do so much prep work that when they got out there they can\u2019t speak.\u201d</p> <p>The first debate between Trump and Clinton takes place on 26 September. </p>",
