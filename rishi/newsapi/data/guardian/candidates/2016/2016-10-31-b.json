At the time, 60 Minutes\u2019 story was so scandalous that, although it was largely right, the authenticity of key documents was questioned, and producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett as a fierce woman pushed to the edge of self-doubt) and anchor Dan Rathers lost their jobs.</p> <p>With Robert Redford cast as Rathers, the shadow of journo classic All the President\u2019s Men looms tall over Truth. Though Truth doesn\u2019t reach those heights, it\u2019s a pretty good iteration of the genre, wrapping you up in the ethos of table-slamming self-righteousness, just as a good journo movie should. And from the mad vantage point of the US election campaign, it\u2019s fascinating to see the disgracing of Mapes and Rathers as part of a broader political witch-hunt in what we thought at the time were the USA\u2019s gloomiest days. </p> <p>Truth is like a devoted fan\u2019s love letter to the great newsroom dramas that preceded it, and an enjoyable and smart film for a night in. </p> <p><strong>Film: Alice (1990, US), director Woody Allen \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOsWXU06c8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFOsWXU06c8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us. That\u2019s what has happened to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Woody Allen\u2019s latest, Cafe Society, is in theatres, but his magical, odd film from 1990 makes for far less masochistic viewing: it\u2019s Woody in a good mood. </p> <p>With her wide, anxious face and hurried eyes, Mia Farrow\u2019s heroine is a Woody stand-in: a Manhattanite whose existential dissatisfactions coalesce into a longing for an affair with a divorced musician called Joe. Alice\u2019s treatments from a Chinese doctor (please turn your Hollywood-racism filters to HD) supernaturally switch off her inhibitions. </p> <p>There are two lovely observations at the heart of Alice: the first is that there is a particular type of person for whom infidelity is actually incredibly difficult, even when they desire it; and the second is that all types of people have ways of insisting on unhappiness via increasingly elaborate forms of self-sabotage. On the surface, Alice has everything she should want (wealth, a husband, lovely children); as a character, she also has the compassion of her film-maker \u2013 an unusual thing to treasure in an Woody Allen film.</p> <p><strong>Film: Volcano (Ixcanul) (2015, Guatemala/France), dir.

Our Mayan heroine Mar\u00eda is set for a local arranged marriage, but yearns to run away with another man, Pepe, for a new life in the United States. She is torn: \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d in the US, she asks Pepe. \u201cMoney. Dollars,\u201d he replies while the camera remains on Mar\u00eda\u2019s face. \u201cWhat does the air smell like there?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know. \u201cHere, the air smells of coffee. And of the volcano.\u201d </p> <p>The really special thing about Volcano is its palpable creation of this remote place, with clean cinematography that captures life in the plantation in long, wide, unmoving shots. Through that honest film-making approach, debut writer-director Jayro Bustamante lets the story unfold like a fable, and makes Volcano a lovely, living eulogy to a culture that may soon be lost. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/23/frackmans-accidental-activist-theres-blood-in-the-water-and-im-the-shark\">Frackman</a> (film, 5 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/06/nightcrawler-review-jake-gyllenhaal-toronto-film-festival\">Nightcrawler</a> (film, 18 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/what-we-do-in-shadows-review\">What We Do In the Shadows</a> (film, 25 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/19/20000-days-on-earth-review-nick-cave-artistic-legacy-documentary\">Nick Cave: 20,000 Days on Earth</a> (film, 27 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/no-activity-patrick-brammall-and-darren-gilshenan-deliver-australian-farce-at-its-finest\">No Activity</a> (TV, season one, out now)</p> <h2>Netflix Australia</h2> <p><strong>TV: Black Mirror, season three (2016, UK), created by Charlie Brooker \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvvMdJUz3rc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rvvMdJUz3rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/21/black-mirror-review-charlie-brooker-nightmare-sterile-world-is-only-five-minutes-away\">Black Mirror review \u2013 this nightmare sterile world is only five minutes away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no cure for the internet. It\u2019ll never go away.\u201d It\u2019s always been pessimistic, but episode three of Black Mirror\u2019s new season delivers the dystopian drama\u2019s thematic mandate in two brutal sentences.</p> <p>Now a Netflix Original, the latest Black Mirror instalments continue the template set early in the series: each hour-long episode is a self-contained, speculative science-fiction about one element of technology gone rogue \u2013 episode one, for instance, shows a Pinterest-y pastel world in which every person is reduced to a numerical rating via a social media app \u2013 with a twist in the final moments that usually sends the protagonist to madness, social expulsion or death. </p> <p>The difference now is that showrunner Charlie Brooker\u2019s bleak outlook is increasingly expressed in classical horror conventions, most notably in episode two\u2019s haunted house concept. Black Mirror is not always subtle and never light viewing, but it remains anchored in beautifully observed truths about how tech amplifies existing anxieties and unhappinesses.</p> <p><strong>TV: The Crown, season one (UK/US, 2016), created by Peter Morgan \u2013 4 November</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTfo44bGXdg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qTfo44bGXdg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Netflix\u2019s entry into British longform storytelling and the company\u2019s most expensive production to date, The Crown is indeed a must-watch \u2013 but not for the reasons you might think. </p> <p>Based on a viewing of the first two episodes, Netflix has applied the sensibility of prestige UK film-making to television production: Stephen Daldry (The Reader, Billy Elliot) directs a script from Peter Morgan (The Queen) presenting an origin myth of Queen Elizabeth II, beginning with the decline of King George VI\u2019s health in late 1940s and newlywed Elizabeth\u2019s premature ascent to throne. </p> <p>With its original programming, Netflix\u2019s genius may be its ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist of each country: where House of Cards is a melodramatic thriller that undermines US political institutions, The Crown is an immaculately-art-directed propaganda biopic aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/27/the-crown-writer-peter-morgan-ducked-chance-to-meet-queen\">humanising those in the monarchy</a> and positioning the Queen as a kind of proto-feminist. </p> <p>Mmmmm, politically dubious addictive longform prestige trash.

And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well.

I\u2019m not aware of any of the factors that went into Director Comey\u2019s decision to send this letter to Congress on Friday.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if the incident could affect the election outcome, Earnest replied: \u201cWe certainly have already seen some of Secretary Clinton\u2019s harshest critics capitalise on this letter, distort its contents to provoke controversy.\u201d</p> <p>Comey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">letter to Congress</a>, stating that the FBI is examining newly discovered information that might be pertinent to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state, has placed a widely respected FBI director in extraordinary political jeopardy.</p> <p>Earnest dismissed any notion that Congress could be seen as an impartial oversight body. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen just in the last 72 hours the kind of risk that\u2019s associated with communicating to them sensitive information,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s one senior Republican official, who had previously endorsed the Republican nominee for president, who\u2019s let it slip that his party was considering impeaching President Clinton even before she\u2019s been elected, if she\u2019s elected.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-anthony-weiner-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a59t\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2857941\"            data-video-name=\"Trump: who'd have thought we\u2019d be thanking Weiner? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5816fbe7e4b01c528432e846\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031TrumpAttorneyGeneral2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031TrumpAttorneyGeneral2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031TrumpAttorneyGeneral2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-anthony-weiner-video\">Trump: who\u2019d have thought we\u2019d be thanking Weiner?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThat I think is a pretty clear indication that Congress is not at all impartial and that\u2019s why many of these norms \u2026 that apply even when we\u2019re not talking about someone famous and even when we\u2019re not talking about an election a week and a half away, should apply.

A <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-emails-comey-poll-politico-morning-consult-230519\">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> carried out after the announcement put Clinton three points ahead, while a CBS/YouGov survey of likely voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 1% of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence.</p> <p>Trump claimed on Monday that the FBI had stumbled across a digital \u201cmother lode\u201d and predicted they would discover missing work-related emails that had been deleted from Clinton\u2019s computers.</p> <p>\u201c650,000 [emails]? \u2026 I think you are going to find the 33,000 that are missing,\u201d he told supporters in Michigan. \u201cI think we hit the mother lode, as they say in the mining industry.\u201d</p> <p>Trump urged Comey to resist political pressure. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing, but he did the right thing,\u201d he told the Grand Rapids rally. \u201cI was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took guts for director Comey to do what he did,\u201d he added, to chants of \u201clock her up\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p>Trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once-safe Democratic territory in the industrial mid-west. He was also due to speak in Warren in Michigan on Monday before appearing with running mate Mike Pence in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.</p> <p>Until his polling gap began to narrow again last week, Trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states, while Clinton eyed Republican territory in Utah, Arizona and Georgia. Renewed optimism among Republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground, particularly as Trump\u2019s economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing lines. </p> <p>Michigan and Wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for Clinton in the Democratic primary, when large numbers of blue-collar workers favoured Bernie Sanders. Signs of Democratic nervousness in Wisconsin became apparent last week when the Clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz. Sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for Clinton in the state on Wednesday.</p> <p>The impact of early voting may also be forcing Trump to look further afield. States such as a North Carolina have seen heavy early turnout among Democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from Clinton.</p> <p>If he cannot win North Carolina but picks up Florida and Ohio, Trump\u2019s best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like Michigan and Wisconsin or, in the north-east, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Maine.</p> <p>Clinton is redoubling her efforts. Two stops on Monday in Ohio were to be followed by three in Florida on Tuesday and another swing to North Carolina later in the week.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this,\u201d she told a rally in Ohio on Monday. \u201cNow what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander-in-chief.\u201d<br></p> <p>There was less direct criticism of the FBI than over the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and it\u2019s a good a question,\u201d she said, to boos from a young crowd at Kent State University. \u201cBy all mean they should look at [the emails] and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails: there is no case.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59nxm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851168\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5814032ae4b0219a00d39cc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\">Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) declined to confirm to the Guardian whether it is investigating Comey for violating the Hatch Act.

They are looking at an economy that increasingly seems lopsided,\u201d he added, saying many workers who paid tax felt wronged by what they saw as a business tax system where \u201con the international side you see a whole lot of international firms organising themselves to avoid paying in some cases any taxes\u201d. </p> <p>The onus was on government to reform the tax system, to increase investment in people so that they have the right education and skills for the modern workplace and to spend on infrastructure, according to Lew, who has served as Treasury secretary under the US president, Barack Obama, since 2013 after a stint as White House chief of staff.</p> <p>Without such moves, he predicted drastic long-term consequences. \u201cWe run the real risk that middle class, working class people say, \u2018I see the economy is growing but I don\u2019t see how I am going to benefit from it.\u2019 The danger, if that is where things drift to, is not just a short-term political one, I actually think it\u2019s a fundamental threat to liberal democracy and to free-market capitalism.\u201d</p> <p>Without referring specifically to Trump and his proposal to build a wall between the US and Mexico, Lew also addressed rising concerns among voters over immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a history [in the US] of \u2018everyone should have an opportunity\u2019, and you look at the way the modern economy has evolved and people are beginning to question that proposition. </p> <p>\u201cWhen people question that proposition they lash out and historically one of the places people lash out is against outsiders.

The lawsuits, filed by state Democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target. </p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters. </p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but they could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling. </p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities, and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California whose <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>. </p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey, when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore armbands that identified them as an unofficial \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d and erected posters warning against voter fraud. <strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong></p> <p>The RNC last week said claims it was now in violation of the consent decree, set to expire at the start of 2017, were \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s exit pollers, self-titled \u201cvote protectors\u201d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisation\u2019s website late last week. The organisation is still encouraging its volunteers to livestream video from polling stations. </p> <p>In an emailed statement, Stone dismissed the lawsuits as \u201cwithout merit\u201d and argued the lawyers who filed them \u201ccould face sanctions\u201d. The former Richard Nixon adviser said the polling was not being coordinated with the Trump campaign or the RNC. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Stone said. </p> <p>\u201cI assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.\u201d </p> <p>The Guardian contacted the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaign\u2019s general legal counsel for a response to the recent lawsuits and is awaiting a response.</p>",
  "<p>Linda Tirado nails it (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/heart-america-pain-fear-vote-donald-trump-ohio\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 31 October). My wife and I have just returned from travelling across America for six weeks. We looked for election signs all the way. The only Trump sign we saw was on the Trump Tower he once owned in Chicago. We saw one Clinton sign, a damp A4 print in a front yard in the lefty area of Portland the night of the second \u201cdebate\u201d. We saw one Sanders sign, same night, same area. We did see two Feel the Bern bumper stickers on a car at an Oregon surf beach. This was the only bumper sticker we saw.</p> <p>We began in Chicago, travelling across the midwest and west to San Francisco. We travelled through Illinois to St Louis, then through central Wyoming up into Montana, then to Portland, across Oregon and California to San Francisco, where I mailed my absentee ballot. Yet most significant was what we never saw: the word Republican nor the word Democratic, anywhere on any sign or poster. Everywhere we saw posters and signs for candidates for Senate, the House, for governors, state senators and representatives, mayors, councils, judges, and sheriffs. All avoided listing their party.<br><strong>Nick Jeffrey</strong> <br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Much attention has been focused on the timing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\" title=\"\">FBI chief James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress</a> saying his agency is investigating more emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton.

That timing guaranteed no new information would be revealed at least until Monday \u2013 giving speculation and hyperbole a two-day head start on the facts.

  "<p>The most striking thing about the Washington Post/ABC <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a92016ElectionTrackingNo9.pdf\">poll</a> released on Monday is not how close Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are in popularity, it\u2019s how close they are in unpopularity. Such deep dislike could affect Americans\u2019 willingness to vote \u2013 and that\u2019s all the more problematic for Clinton\u2019s campaign given that the latest development in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">email scandal</a> could dent her popularity yet further. </p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/upshot/get-ready-for-another-swing-in-the-polls-but-not-necessarily-a-shift-in-the-race.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fupshot&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">analysts</a> claim that any such dip will be temporary, but with just eight days left until most of the US votes, a short-lived decline would need to be very short. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/us-election-polls-nevada-north-carolina-ohio-trump-clinton\">Clinton and Trump virtually tied in Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monday\u2019s poll showed that the Democratic candidate is seen unfavorably by 60% of likely voters while her Republican opponent is viewed unfavorably by 58%. Voting intention was similarly close: Clinton 46%, Trump 45%, which suggests that some voters are holding their noses and picking a president they don\u2019t like. </p> <p>The numbers are also mirrored when it comes to dislike of \u201cthe other side\u201d \u2013 97% of Trump supporters view Clinton unfavorably (90% strongly so) and 95% of Clinton supporters see Trump unfavorably (again, 90% say \u201cstrongly\u201d). This poll, however, was conducted 26-29 October, before news that the FBI had acquired a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by a Hillary Clinton aide. </p> <p>Polls are often conducted over multiple days and some of them \u2013 such as the <a href=\"http://www.investors.com/politics/ibd-tipp-presidential-election-poll/\">IBD/TIPP</a> presidential tracker \u2013 collected some responses after the latest Clinton email news broke. That poll also suggested Clinton\u2019s lead had shrunk to just one percentage point. Overall, in national polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">averages</a>, Clinton is now only ahead by 2.5 percentage points, whereas just two weeks ago the former secretary of state had a seven percentage point lead.</p> <p>Nate Cohn, a journalist at the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/upshot/get-ready-for-another-swing-in-the-polls-but-not-necessarily-a-shift-in-the-race.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fupshot&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">writes</a>: \u201cMany [news events] moved the polls [in 2016], but none fundamentally reshaped the race.\u201d That analysis is deeply problematic, though. The major way that people are making sense of the race is to look at polls, so to claim that news is affecting the polls but not ultimately the race makes little sense \u2013 especially because barely a week of this election has gone by without some sort of scandal creating a polling \u201cdip\u201d or \u201cbump\u201d, so there is no simple opinion equilibrium that we can measure. </p>",

  "<p>It is the morning after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/kaine-v-pence-what-we-learned-vice-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">the first American presidential debate</a>. Hillary has, it is mostly agreed, won the round. In an office on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, it is time for the morning \u201cInstagram story meeting\u201d at <a href=\"http://www.betches.com/\" title=\"\">Betches.com</a>. The assembled staffers all agree: the evening yielded two \u201cmomentous American moments\u201d worthy of social-media comment. One was the travails of a female presidential candidate facing Donald Trump for the first time. The other was Rob Kardashian tweeting Kylie Jenner\u2019s phone number.</p> <p>\u201cTwo national-security breaches in one night,\u201d cracks Samantha Fishbein.</p> <p>\u201cI think Putin was responsible,\u201d says Jordana Abraham.</p> <p>\u201cNo, the Chinese \u2013 it could have been the Chinese,\u201d says Aleen Kuperman.</p> <p>You can hear, in these jokes, that this trio of young women translate the absurdities of the political process into their own language \u2013 one of celebrity feuds and social-media memes, screenshots and snarky remarks.</p> <p>They set about designing and writing the Instagram posts that will result. Somehow, this sort of activity fills entire days. After all, this is how Fishbein, Abraham and Kuperman \u2013 who began the company as 22-year-old Cornell students with no ambitions in the media \u2013 currently make their living: they run Betches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbdbd1b2aea500a78a4cff9335fba631406ed2a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbdbd1b2aea500a78a4cff9335fba631406ed2a4/0_28_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Betches does politics.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betches does politics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s hard to describe succinctly just what Betches is, because it\u2019s a brand that has several faces. Betches is, for example, a website. Its tagline is: \u201cBrutally honest news, gossip &amp; advice for young women.\u201d The website has fairly traditional blogposts on it, with such titles as <a href=\"http://www.betches.com/youre-more-likely-to-get-laid-in-fall\" title=\"\">Science Proves Fall Is the Best Season For Acting Like a Ho</a>; <a href=\"http://www.betches.com/sarah-jessica-parker-admits-carrie-bradshaw-was-annoying\" title=\"\">Sarah Jessica Parker Admits Carrie Bradshaw Was Annoying AF</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.betches.com/what-your-tattoo-says-about-you\" title=\"\">What Your Dumb Tattoo Says About You</a>.</p> <p>Those titles alone will probably give a sense of the brand. The Betches are into pop culture. The Betches are sarcastic to a fault. The Betches enjoy the semi-ironic use of the word \u201cho\u201d.</p> <p>But the website is only the beginning. There is also <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/betches/?hl=en\" title=\"\">a Betches Instagram account</a>, which chiefly trades in snarky remarks pasted awkwardly over paparazzi and stock photographs. \u201cWhen you try get out [sic] of doing PE but the teacher makes you wear all the lost property,\u201d reads one post accompanied by a picture of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian dressed in Adidas pants. \u201cU ever get stuck talking to someone who won\u2019t shut the fuck up &amp; start thinking about all the times u were alone &amp; how u took it for granted,\u201d reads another recent post, this one sans illustration. Or: \u201cLive every day like you just found out you\u2019re not pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>And then there are the Betches books, which keep hitting the New York Times bestseller lists. The first was called <a href=\"http://www.betches.com/betches-nice-is-just-a-place-in-france-introduction\" title=\"\">Nice Is Just a Place in France: How to Win at Basically Everything</a>. The second was called <a href=\"http://www.betches.com/i-had-a-nice-time-and-other-lies\" title=\"\">I Had a Nice Time And Other Lies \u2026: How to Find Love &amp; Sh*t Like That</a>.</p> <p>The way to best describe their output is \u201ccontent\u201d. And the content is enormously popular. Their Instagram account alone boasts 4.5 million followers. Last month, their website got nearly 10 million page views and a million unique visitors. Plenty of this audience gets its news and entertainment through social media. And the Betches, being millennials \u2013 all three of the company\u2019s leaders are now 27 \u2013 are very, very good at making content that appeals to other young women on social media. The most popular posts \u2013 the ones with the most likes and shares on Instagram, for example \u2013 tend to be the most sarcastic ones. A recent text-only post read: \u201cThe awkward moment when your sarcasm is so advanced that people actually think you are stupid.\u201d It got 119,000 likes.</p> <p>Though they decline to provide revenue figures, they say they\u2019re making money. They haven\u2019t seen any of the advertising decline that traditional media has, either. When I point out to them that this seems unusual, the Betches look at each other, and shrug. Perhaps it\u2019s simply that they have mastered a form of social sharing very attractive to advertisers right now, though their sponsored posts on Instagram are often a bit limp: \u201c(grabs popcorn) Catch a new episode of The Daily Show TONIGHT at 11/10c on Comedy Central #sponsored.\u201d</p> <p>The business has been profitable for going on four years, they say. They have four full-time employees \u2013 all white women in their 20s, like themselves.</p> <p>There is a kind of uniformity to the Betches \u2013 so much so that I happen to notice that they are all wearing the same makeup look when I meet them: bronzer, heavy eyeliner, nude lip. Some of that is undoubtedly the product of all having grown up together on Long Island. But some of it is that the Betches know they have a particular sort of appeal, and they strive, they tell me, for \u201cconsistency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur fanbase knows exactly what to expect from us,\u201d Kuperman explains.</p> <p>They picked the name Betches because they were hearing it said by young women who didn\u2019t necessarily want to call themselves \u201cbitches\u201d but who seemed to long for an alternative to bro culture.</p> <p>Are they feminists? \u201cThat\u2019s such a hard question. If you define feminism as all men and women should be equal,\u201d Abraham says, \u201cthen yes.\u201d \u201cEmpowering females?\u201d Kuperman chimes in. \u201cThen definitely.\u201d</p> <p>There is some explicitly feminist content on the Betches\u2019 site. They mock Ivanka Trump for calling her dad a feminist. They cheer when \u2026 well, I\u2019ll let the title do it: Bumble Totally Destroyed a Sexist Fuckboy, Yas Queen. (Bumble, for the uninitiated, is a popular dating app described as a \u201cfeminist Tinder\u201d.)</p> <p>But even the Betches themselves don\u2019t think they\u2019re as serious about these matters as, say, Jezebel. \u201cThey\u2019re serious but making jokes,\u201d says Fishbein, \u201cbut we\u2019re making jokes and we\u2019re serious.\u201d How do Abraham, Fishbein and Kuperman see their followers, then?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"882e422e1a199f5b5d9720553cfbe5153d8685d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/882e422e1a199f5b5d9720553cfbe5153d8685d9/6_0_797_797/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Betches worldview.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Betches worldview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSlightly narcissistic,\u201d says Kuperman.</p> <p>\u201cAlso fun,\u201d Abraham interrupts. \u201cThey\u2019re self-aware, and they don\u2019t take themselves too seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSelf-aware is debatable,\u201d counters Fishbein, adding that there is a portion of their readership that looks at the Betches\u2019s relentless snark and wishes \u201cthey could be like that\u201d.</p> <p>The common denominator of all the Betches\u2019s work could be summed up as smartass \u2013 the person at the party who always has something cutting to say. But one can\u2019t help feeling that they\u2019re not quite going for Dorothy Parker levels of wit. For all the Betches\u2019s hundreds of blogposts and Instagrams and Snapchats and other assorted ephemera, there is very little that seems particularly original in its cleverness, or radical in its politics. Most of the jokes are the jokes you\u2019d find anywhere on the internet. (In fact, in some cases, the Betches simply reproduce Twitter screenshots of other people\u2019s jokes on Instagram.) Their own contributions are generally offered up in standard internet speak: \u201cI can\u2019t with this\u201d; \u201cAccurate\u201d; \u201cWhyyyyy\u201d.</p> <p>But they do not starve for \u2013 as people in the content business call it \u2013 engagement. And the living they make on that basis seems likely to be handsome. Most of their revenue, in fact, comes from advertising, Kuperman says. Then something like 35% of their income comes from their online shop. (It sells hats with slogans such as, \u201cNot a morning person,\u201d or T-shirts that read: \u201cDrunk enough for pizza.\u201d) Finally, the revenue from the book sales is ploughed back into the business.</p> <p>They are doing so well, in fact, that they feel it\u2019s time for outside investment. Their goal is to build their brand even further. \u201cWe want to be [a] household name,\u201d Kuperman says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to anyone and hear, \u2018What is a betch?\u2019 Or for them to mispronounce it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s self-inflicted wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the public-opinion needle toward Hillary Clinton, according to recent polls. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">may have changed a little</a> in the aftermath of the FBI\u2019s renewing of its email probe last week. But even so, the fears of many voters that a Donald Trump presidency might become a reality have abated. </p> <p>Those fears are not unfounded. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-assault-allegations-women-jill-harth\">failings as a candidate and a person</a> are manifest, and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected. That\u2019s especially true at the agency level, with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power. The wildcard aspect of his personality poses risks that can\u2019t be predicted, nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging initiatives.</p> <p>What has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the Republican nominee\u2019s outrageous behavior, bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate, however, is a critical examination of what a Clinton administration will mean for the nation. The FBI probe, information on tangled interests within the Clinton Foundation, evidence of influence peddling and Wikileaks revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic process, signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal level.</p> <p>The content of what has been revealed in these leaks, as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable conclusion: Hillary Clinton represents the entrenched interests of the status quo. Her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized US policies for several decades \u2013 at tremendous, almost incalculable cost both domestically and internationally.</p> <p>During the campaign, Clinton has engaged in the type of saber-rattling one expects of presidential candidates, especially Democrats who seek to counter the party\u2019s image as weak on defense. She has agitated against Russian President Putin on Ukraine and Syria, and reiterated her belief in \u201cthe responsibility to protect,\u201d the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years \u2013 even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere. A muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered US allies, yet Clinton supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of President Obama without a hint of irony.</p> <p>The ill-advised and tragic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to extract a heavy toll, and though opposition to those wars helped propel Barack Obama into office, the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the government\u2019s ongoing crusade, the so-called War on Terror. In reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the US has waged around the world, the deadly manifestations of the War on Terror have largely been met with silence or, depressingly, approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement. Sadly, Donald Trump\u2019s self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question Clinton\u2019s unabashed cheerleading for a continuation of these modified Cold-War strategies. </p> <p>Beyond the battlefield, Clinton\u2019s historical enthusiasm for \u201cfree\u201d but not fair trade \u2013 even while waffling on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">TPP</a> \u2013 gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served. In the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the world, the Obama administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements. As Secretary of State, Clinton had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so. Why would anyone expect her to change now? </p> <p>The inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">Green party</a>, which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down US military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home. </p> <p>This election is about far more than our collective distaste for a hyper-inflated ego, and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of Trump for the clear and present danger of Clinton\u2019s corporatist logic is no trade-off at all. <br><br></p>",
  "<p>A new batch of emails leaked by WikiLeaks from the Gmail account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, were released on Monday, seeming to show Donna Brazile, the interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a CNN contributor, giving Clinton a heads up about a likely debate question the day before she was due to take on Bernie Sanders at a primary debate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gabriellahope_/status/793094919275544577\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brazile 2 weeks ago: &quot;I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did&quot;<br><br>Yeah, ok. <a href=\"https://t.co/8jBOZ4G8q6\">pic.twitter.com/8jBOZ4G8q6</a></p>&mdash; Gabby Morrongiello (@gabriellahope_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabriellahope_/status/793094919275544577\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A woman did ask about the Flint water crisis at the next debate.</p> <p>On 11 October, Brazile released a statement \u2013 after earlier Podesta emails supposedly showed Brazile leaking a CNN town hall question \u2013 declaring: \u201cAs it pertains to the CNN debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/785915299593801729\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donna Brazile statement on Wikileaks emails <a href=\"https://t.co/LqblQt6Kjo\">pic.twitter.com/LqblQt6Kjo</a></p>&mdash; Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/785915299593801729\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A CNN spokeswoman said the network was \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d with the news that Brazile allegedly leaked a debate question to Clinton\u2019s campaign.

The reason why people want Will &amp; Grace or any of these shows back is because they were era-defining comedies. A reboot of a 90s comedy is not going to define the late 2010s. Though you wouldn\u2019t think so with Netflix, Amazon, cable TV, web videos and platforms not even invented yet, there is a limited amount of television production resources. To keep spending them on rehabbing the shows that defined other eras is just keeping this era from having its own defining hits or keeping us from fully appreciating the ones that we already have. So let\u2019s allow the Friends, Seinfeld, Martin, Roseanne and all the women of Living Single continue on with their semi-retirement. Thanks to Netflix, Amazon and Hulu we can go and revisit the past anytime we want. We don\u2019t need it to keep rearing its ugly head in the present, no matter how funny it might be. </p>",
  "<p>A Scottish golf resort owned by Donald Trump is being taken to court for allegedly breaching the privacy of a rambler photographed by staff without her consent or knowledge.</p> <p>The resort in Aberdeenshire was served with a court summons on Monday after Trump\u2019s Scottish lawyers admitted that two staff members took mobile phone images of Rohan Beyts while she was on the course in April.</p> <p>Trump International Golf Club Scotland, owned by the Republican presidential candidate, has been ordered to appear at Edinburgh sheriff court on 22 December to respond to a civil action lodged in the small claims court by Beyts this month.</p> <p>Beyts is seeking damages of up to \u00a33,000 ($3,650) after TIGCS rejected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/rambler-sues-trump-golf-resort-scotland-breach-of-privacy\">her initial requests by letter</a> for an apology and damages. Her civil action claims the company is guilty of a criminal offence under the UK\u2019s data protection and privacy legislation, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-scottish-golf-resort-admits-breaching-data-protection-law?CMP=share_btn_tw\">an investigation by the Guardian</a> revealed the resort was in breach of the Data Protection Act.</p> <p>The resort admitted it was not registered under the act with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office despite operating at least nine CCTV cameras and holding confidential records on its staff, its thousands of customers and its suppliers. It subsequently registered with the ICO in August.</p> <p>In the US, meanwhile, Trump has threatened to sue any cinema that screens the documentary, You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too.

Police told Beyts a golf resort guest had also been a witness.</p> <p>She alleges the staff must have hidden before filming her, because she said both she and Edwards had looked hard to make sure there were no golfers or passersby visible when she squatted down.</p> <p>\u201cThey deliberately concealed themselves and followed us,\u201d Beyts said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anybody when I ducked down in the dunes. Sue was higher up on the dunes and she couldn\u2019t see anybody.\u201d</p> <p>The charges against Beyts were dropped by prosecutors after she refused to accept a warning letter under the 1982 act and said she had a diagnosed medical condition. </p> <p>Beyts and her lawyer, Mike Dailly, are considering a formal complaint to the ICO in tandem with the civil action. </p> <p>Dailly said: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that there is a claim here. What Ms Beyts is seeking to enforce is the right to protect personal data. That is guaranteed by the EU charter of fundamental rights, which requires member states to provide effective remedies when their rights are breached.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute highlights a long-running conflict involving Trump and his resort staff over Scotland\u2019s strong right of access legislation, which gives people the right to walk across private land, such as golf courses and Highland estates, so long as the activity is not disruptive.</p> <p>Dailly said Trump\u2019s company was guilty of \u201ca very cavalier disregard for the rule of law, and acting in a way which is highly oppressive to ordinary members of the public who are going about their lawful business\u201d.</p> <p>Trump admitted he had not heard of Scotland\u2019s right to roam legislation when he gave evidence at a public inquiry in 2008 into whether or not to approve his plans for the resort. </p> <p>After winning that inquiry, Trump has been accused by activists and his neighbours of blocking off the main public path across the course, in breach of the resort\u2019s planning consent. A large locked gate has been installed that forces walkers to squeeze through a narrow gap against a hedge. </p> <p>Beyts, a regular hill walker and outdoor sports enthusiast, said she had been out on the course with Edwards that day because her friend had been confronted by resort staff on previous walks, and needed support. \u201cI see myself as supporting Scotland\u2019s access code, the right to roam,\u201d Beyts said.</p> <p>In a statement on Monday, a TIGCS spokeswoman in Aberdeenshire said: \u201cWe have not received a letter from the court but our position remains the same that any claims brought against us by Rohan Beyts are baseless and we will continue to vigorously defend our business from troublemakers like this.\u201d </p> <p>Dailly said the summons was sent to the company\u2019s registered office in Edinburgh.</p>",

  "<h2>FBI obtains warrant to search Clinton aide\u2019s laptop</h2> <p>The FBI has obtained a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by Clinton aide Huma Abedin, as part of its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. The move came as the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, said the FBI director, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey</a>, may have broken the Hatch Act, which bars federal officials from using their official authority to influence an election, by his decision to send a letter to Republican congressional committee chairs on Friday announcing the new development. That showed \u201cclear intent to aid one political party over another\u201d, Reid said, adding a claim that Comey was not releasing information linking the Trump campaign to Russia. Reports said FBI investigators had known for weeks they might find pertinent emails on Abedin\u2019s device, which was shared with her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation over alleged illicit texts to a minor. Clinton called on Comey to \u201cput it all out on the table\u201d; Donald Trump said the email scandal was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">Clinton emails inquiry: FBI gets warrant as Comey told he may have broken law</a></p> <h2>Will Hillary Clinton lose?<br></h2> <p>The Democrat is losing support just as the Republican is experiencing a resurgence.

A Russian poll found that 22% of Russians had a positive opinion of Trump, compared with just 8% for Clinton. In Mexico, Trump\u2019s rise has stirred unease and indignation. Iranians have been amused by the bitter rivalry been Clinton and Trump.

I\u2019ll be honest, Dave: not since people used to make fun of Tom Cruise\u2019s height has someone taken such a wrong tack to mock their target. Just as there are many \u2013 oh, so many! \u2013 more interesting things to discuss in regards to Cruise than his petite stature (only last week, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/tom-cruise-scientology-is-a-beautiful-religion\">he told ITV news</a> that without Scientology \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am\u201d, which, if he means someone with the reputation for being one of the biggest weirdos in the world, I guess he\u2019s right), so there are multiple things for which to criticise fashion designers other than how they look off duty. Because the truth is, even the most virulently anti-fashion critic cannot say that designers do not practise what they preach. There\u2019s Karl Lagerfeld, who every morning for breakfast tucks into two protein shakes \u2013 \u201cno sugar, of course\u201d \u2013 and steamed apples. Mmm! When dining alone at night at home, Lagerfeld opts against a curry on the sofa in front of The X Factor, choosing instead to dine on \u201cMeissen china in front of his favourite statue, a bronze commissioned by Catherine the Great in 1774\u201d. Designers \u2013 they\u2019re just like us! I once interviewed Miuccia Prada on what I was assured was her day of relaxation. She turned up wearing jewelled earrings and a necklace so enormous I \u2013 insanely \u2013 assumed they must be fake until a PR disabused me of that delusion. What better way to relax than slinging jewellery worth hundreds of thousands of pounds around one\u2019s person?</p> <p>But no designer better exemplifies all this than Tom Ford. Tom Ford is amazing, and if I didn\u2019t think he would physically recoil in horror at my decidedly un-Tom Ford-esque physical appearance I\u2019d ask him to adopt me. Because Ford is a god and the rest of us are mere peasants who are lucky to live in his time. Victoria Beckham \u2013 not a woman known for letting her standards slip \u2013 told a story about how, when she was boarding a plane, Ford ticked her off for daring to think it was OK to swap her usual restrictive clothing for something more relaxed just because they were on an 11-hour flight. \u201cHe said: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t.\u2019 I thought he was joking and was getting ready to change when he said: \u2018No, you really shouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d And before anyone complains that this is just another example of a misogynistic male designer making women suffer, Beckham added that the only concession Ford himself made for comfort was undoing one button on the waistcoat of his three-piece suit. In US Vogue this month, a journalist describes how Ford has to pour three glasses of water before he finally achieves his desire of pouring \u201cthe platonic ideal of a glass of sparkling water\u201d, rejecting one for having a \u201ctiny black speck\u201d and another because the lime slice \u201clooks too unappealing\u201d.</p> <p>Now, in anyone else, this would sound worryingly like OCD. But Ford has said repeatedly that he simply likes to live in a \u201chyperreal\u201d world, although he has had to let that slide a little since having a son a few years ago who firmly rejected \u201ctasteful, grey wooden toys\u201d for \u201clurid plastic\u201d (how Ford made nappy-changing hyperreal we can all only imagine). So there we are, Dave: designers may present a completely unrealistic view of the world, but you can\u2019t say they don\u2019t live that view themselves. Looks like we\u2019ll all just have to go back to criticising them for the skinny models and high prices.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2016.

  "<p>A week ago, the US election looked to be over. Hillary Clinton was riding so high in the polls after a disastrous series of gaffes by Donald Trump that few could conceive of a Republican path to victory on 8 November. Friday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">shock intervention by the FBI</a> may not be enough to change that outcome on its own, but it has certainly set political imaginations running wild.<br></p> <p>The worry for Democrats is that fresh inquiries regarding Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state come at a difficult time. Not only is it hard to prove a negative and re-establish her innocence with barely a week to go until the election, but the letter to congressional officials from director James Comey capped a tricky run of news that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-lead-donald-trump-polls\">already making a sizable dent in her polling lead</a>.</p> <p>Momentum for Trump began to recover first thanks to another set of emails, the contents of which perhaps explain why the Clintons risked so much to try to retain control of her electronic communications in the first place. Released by WikiLeaks, a factor that US intelligence agencies have blamed on Russian hackers, these emails to and from campaign chairman John Podesta have been trickling out for weeks, with mostly embarrassing rather than damaging content.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\">Hillary Clinton's email controversy explained: what we know so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That changed on Wednesday with the release of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\">report</a> that appeared to confirm just how much the Clinton family has blurred the boundaries between its business, charitable and political interests. Though almost all of the new information related to Bill rather than Hillary, it gave Trump supporters fresh ammunition at a moment when they were desperate to shift attention from their candidate\u2019s own scandals over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-income-tax-returns-published\">taxes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/temple-taggart-donald-trump-gloria-allred-lawsuit\">alleged inappropriate behaviour towards women</a>.</p> <p>In an election that many pollsters describe as an unpopularity contest, it does not take much to swing the mood of independent voters.

  "<h2>\u2018We must remember the richness immigrants have brought\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Monica, 51, Vermont, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></li> </ul> <p>I live in a tiny rural town in Vermont. The daughter of Peruvian immigrants who overstayed visas back when it took just a few months to get a green card; I\u2019ve worked hard to feel like I belong anywhere. I found my way to Vermont as a young adult and no other place feels like home. I am voting for Hilary Clinton, although my preference would have been Bernie Sanders. Hillary\u2019s approach seems to be informed by her years of experience and that\u2019s what I want in a president \u2013 someone who is intelligent and informed about both policy and process. A Trump presidency would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d as he\u2019s so fond of saying. I get no sense that he has any knowledge of, or worse, the desire to learn about, the issues at all. That\u2019s truly frightening. Trump would further divide our nation \u2013 his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides. We must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country. The first priority of the next president must be to unify us, as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere. This has been the ugliest campaign I have witnessed in my 51 years. Trump\u2019s campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover. One good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and encouraged them to make their voices heard at the ballot box \u2013 for better or worse.</p> <h2>\u2018We have become a politically correct society to our detriment\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Anne-Marie, 69, New Jersey, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>Born in 1946, the first year of the \u201cbaby boom\u201d, I am a second-generation American. I earned my BA, MEd and MA in, respectively, history, teaching and journalism. Most of my working life was in publishing. I have been alone since my divorce some 40 years ago. My views do not fit any one party, and my voting history is mixed. I have voted for Democrats and Republicans, and I threw away a vote on Ralph Nader in 2000 because I could not vote for either of the main candidates. I will vote for Donald Trump. He might not change this country \u2013 Congress can obstruct a president, as it has been doing since 2008 \u2013 but if he could, it would be in directions I support: defeating Isis, strict(er) immigration, encouraging businesses to stay or return here, a much better relationship with Russia, and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we have, to our detriment, become. A president\u2019s priorities should be protecting the American land and people, and promoting the general welfare \u2013 here, stateside. I have found the campaign absolutely horrid.

I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m angrier at \u2013 Donald Trump for being a compulsive liar \u2013 or the press for letting him get away with it. Trump\u2019s supporters chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d are the worst. Hillary Clinton is not a criminal! We face serious problems with no easy solutions. Over 20% of our children live in poverty. Climate change is real. We have too many guns and not enough good jobs. Our son is unemployed \u2013 I don\u2019t want Obamacare repealed \u2013 I want it fixed. Hillary has a plan for that. Hillary cares about people, about children and families. She\u2019s a feminist who will appoint supreme court justices who will stand up for women\u2019s rights. Especially if the Democrats take back the Senate, she can get things done. Even Trump conceded that she\u2019s a fighter. This is a historic election and, yeah, I\u2019m excited about it.

Despite having backed Sanders myself, I take a less noncommittal position: Clinton, far from being the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d, is a remarkably qualified, intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my own, a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread. Her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the United States to stand upright as a respected model among nations. I anticipate with hope the improvement of the Affordable Care Act to make healthcare universally affordable, the push to end gun violence, the increase in police accountability, the reform of our prison system, and a social promotion that advances race relations, LGBT rights and gender equity. None of these changes can be expected under the influence of Donald Trump, who sees the truth as tractable, promotes his sexism and narcissism as assets, and in the end, is excessively volatile and unprincipled. It\u2019s embarrassing that Clinton, whose political competence is nigh unparalleled, holds only an uncertain majority over his farcical campaign. While the current poll aggregates are tentatively reassuring, I will remain apprehensive until she is confirmed as president-elect after election day.</p> <h2>\u2018Washington is offering no choice besides disaster\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Geno, 37, Pennsylvania, voting for <strong>Jill Stein</strong></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m in that middle class suffering from decades of neoliberalism \u2013 involuntarily in debt, in a dead-end job because of health coverage and few options. My household can eat and pay bills most of the time, so we\u2019re luckier than some, but doing much more is a rare treat. The nation needs living wages, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, renewable energy, an end to US aggression, and investment in our future instead of the already-rich. Society should support people over profit. The most wretched excuse for a campaign in our lifetimes has only promised the opposite. The major parties offer a deranged rightwing sociopath provoking global war or a reality-TV buffoon with no actual policy, both of them hopelessly corrupt and staggeringly incompetent. Reinforcing Bush-Obama corporatism isn\u2019t an option. Libertarianism is suicidally shortsighted. We need a progressive administration that\u2019ll keep the grassroots engaged in fighting for constructive, sustainable goals. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting Jill Stein. It\u2019s already too late to prevent a president Clinton; that\u2019s what the establishment wants and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll get. Of course Trump never had a chance \u2013 he\u2019s only there to scare us towards Hillary. No thanks. I won\u2019t throw my vote away on a felon and war criminal. I\u2019d rather affirm policies I actually support. The alternative is staying home, but I\u2019d rather send a message rejecting business as usual (hopefully amplified a little in a swing state). Washington is offering no choice besides disaster. Our first duty is to refuse to be complicit or legitimize it.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist Donald Trump\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Chris, 50, New York, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>My name is Christopher; I am a gay African American illustrator and comic book artist living in New York City with my husband who is an Episcopal seminarian. As a Bernie Sanders supporter, allow me to make my position crystal clear: I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist, racist and misogynist Donald Trump. I would love to have another choice, but unfortunately, with Jill Stein polling even worse than Gary Johnson I\u2019m forced to be pragmatic and vote for Hillary Clinton. Liberal supreme court nominations; banking, healthcare, student loan and immigration reform; increasing living wages, honest discussions of the true effects of mechanization of labor, infrastructure revitalization, climate change, federal enforcement of police reform \u2026 these should be presidential priorities. Will they be under a centrist Clinton administration? Doubtful. Still, it is my sincere hope that the more progressive side of the Democratic party will apply the appropriate pressure. This entire presidential campaign has been a demoralizing debacle, and I for one can\u2019t wait until election day. I\u2019m just going to need a shower or two to scrub off the stink after leaving the voting booth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, 28 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, on 28 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Had Sanders won the primaries, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Dan, 59, California, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>My name is Dan and I\u2019m an older, white, middle-class male who intends to vote for Donald Trump. But I didn\u2019t start out that way. Although I\u2019ve been a Republican since registering to vote at age 18 I switched to the Democratic party this year in order to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary election. Had Sanders won the Democratic primary I wouldn\u2019t be writing this little essay and I would most definitely <em>not</em> be voting for Donald Trump. Let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not voting for Trump because I like him. I\u2019m voting for Trump \u2019cause I like Hillary Clinton even less. I don\u2019t think policy positions matter much in a presidential election. Presidents don\u2019t actually get to direct much policy. What matters most to me is leadership. The ability to lead a large organization and inspire those being led. In this respect both candidates have serious liabilities. But Hillary\u2019s appear to be the far more serious breaches of integrity. From her early days on the Nixon impeachment issue to her operation of the state department she has left behind a taint of corruption at the highest levels of government. We are already hearing of the rumblings of disorganization and discontent in both the state and justice department as a result of her corrupting influence. The priority of a president should be to manage the immense federal bureaucracy and inspire citizens. Hillary has proven herself to be singularly inadequate to the task.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m a Mormon Republican voting for Clinton\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>David, 43, Colorado, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a westerner, having lived and voted in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. I\u2019m educated, with two postgraduate degrees. I\u2019m also religious, having been Mormon all my life. I\u2019ve been a registered Republican since my first voting experience in 1996. I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. Or, to put it more precisely, I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump. The most important factor for me in voting for any public office is character, and I think it is obvious that Trump has the worst character of any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen. There are many very reasonable objections to Clinton, and I\u2019m really not a big fan of hers, but I don\u2019t think they come anywhere close to the magnitude of Trump\u2019s deep moral flaws. I think Clinton is a very capable politician, and I like her experience in public service. I also think she\u2019s quite moderate, which is what I consider myself to be. Presidents are important, but they can\u2019t do all the things for which people often hold them responsible. I think she\u2019ll do well at foreign relations. I think she\u2019ll choose capable but moderate supreme court justices, and I hope that Congress will approve them. This has been a miserable campaign, not just because of the poor field of candidates and the disgusting rhetoric, but also because it has divided the citizenry in very ugly ways. I am voting early, by mail, and I look forward to having the whole thing finished.</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>The emails currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">roiling the US presidential campaign</a> are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">slowly released by WikiLeaks</a> from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week\u2019s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.</p> <p>The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\u2019t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent.</p> <p>They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59n4x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851228\"            data-video-name=\"'We learned to fight back': Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58140c67e4b08d944ba4bd15\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028Daca_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028Daca_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12004004&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\">\u2018We learned to fight back\u2019: Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone\u2019s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people\u2019s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don\u2019t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren\u2019t.</p> <p>With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.</p> <p>The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement.</p> <p>Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary\u2019s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton\">appear to name</a> President Obama\u2019s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).</p> <p>The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15865\">email</a> Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29255\">visit</a> Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to \u201clearn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action\u201d). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley\u2019s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19482\">complains</a> that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be:</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.\u201d</p> <p>Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, \u201cmadness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue\u201d.</p> <p>There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words \u201cDavos\u201d or \u201cTahoe\u201d. But it is when you search \u201cVineyard\u201d on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By \u201cvineyard\u201d, of course, they mean Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the 2015 <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30396\">email</a> from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that \u201cHillary\u2019s image is being torn apart in the media and there\u2019s not enough effective push back\u201d. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24270\">invites</a> Podesta to a dinner featuring \u201cfood produced exclusively by the island\u2019s farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines\u201d. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19449\">recommended</a> that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that \u201cIt wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make \u2013 but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events\u201d. We even read the <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32784\">pleadings</a> of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he \u201cjoined the DSCC Majority Trust in Martha\u2019s Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>(Hilariously, in another <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8640\">email chain</a>, the Clinton team appears to scheme to \u201chit\u201d Bernie Sanders for attending \u201cDSCC retreats on Martha\u2019s Vineyard with lobbyists\u201d.)</p> <p>Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta \u2013 the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite \u2013 for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.</p> <p>This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927\">appears to think</a> that any kind of bank reform should \u201ccome from the industry itself\u201d. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another\u2019s careers, constantly.</p> <p>Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.teneoholdings.com/\">Global CEO Advisory Firm</a>\u201d that <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-foundations-fundraisers-pressed-donors-to-steer-business-to-former-president-1477527597\">appears</a> to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation.

The friends all succeed. They break every boundary.</p> <p>But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, it\u2019s all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you aren\u2019t part of this happy, prosperous in-group \u2013 if you don\u2019t have John Podesta\u2019s email address \u2013 you\u2019re out.</p>",

If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs.</p> <p>South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula.</p> <p>Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it.

The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt.<br></p> <p>Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans.<br></p> <p>Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media. Some suggested that perhaps the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, would need to fly to Washington to broker a national unity government deal, as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, did after the divisive 2014 Afghan election.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sune-engel-rasmussen\">Sune Engel Rasmussen</a> in Kabul</em></p> <h2>Germany </h2> <p>If Hillary Clinton were to run against Donald Trump for the German presidency, she would win by a landslide.

Among these voters, stories about the candidates\u2019 foibles did nothing to dent their popularity. Both could only be brought down by their own self-destructive tendencies, Zucconi concluded.</p> <p>Gianni Riotta, the former editor of Il Sole 24 Ore, said that \u2013 despite being a \u201cdisastrous\u201d prime minister \u2013 Berlusconi was a more astute politician than Trump has proven to be, having counted both George W Bush and Vladimir Putin as friends.

The softer the Brexit, the happier the White House will be.

Britain will also be at the front of the queue if she chooses to take a more assertive line with Putin. At present, Britain has been the rhetorical outrider, but it may get some practical backing from the White House. The UK will hope stabilisation of its defence budget, the renewal of Trident nuclear submarines, and its willingness to send troops to the Baltic states will ensure that it remains at the front of the queue when it comes to security cooperation, if not a trade deal.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour\">Patrick Wintour</a> in London </em></p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>Iraq is currently consumed by the battle to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/iraqi-shia-militias-tighten-noose-on-isis-with-mosul-offensive\">retake Mosul from Isis</a>, and preparing for its own elections next year, so the US election has received relatively little attention \u2013 even though the outcome is likely to be critical to Iraq\u2019s future.</p> <p>Renewed American military and financial support has been key to the fight against Isis, particularly in the current campaign to retake Mosul, the jihadi group\u2019s last major stronghold in the country.<br></p> <p>Over $1.6bn was provided for training and equipping Iraqi forces in 2016 alone.

That is why we at the <a href=\"https://ninedotsprize.org/\" title=\"\">Nine Dots prize</a> are offering $100,000 for the best answer to the question: are digital technologies making politics impossible?

We shout at each other across ever-widening gulfs of sympathy and understanding. We fixate on people and personalities, looking for someone to blame for our mutual incomprehension - \u201cIt\u2019s her fault!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s his fault!\u201d \u2013 when this only makes the divisions worse. But what if it\u2019s not the people that are the problem? What if it\u2019s the machines through which we increasingly communicate that are causing things to fall apart?</p> <p>Living through dramatic change is hard because it\u2019s possible to miss what\u2019s really at stake. It is also possible to exaggerate. And, seen from another angle, the most striking thing about our politics is how little has changed.</p> <p>Digital technologies may have transformed the world around us over the last 25 years: how we shop, how we find love, where we look for news, whom we count as our friends, what we do with our time \u2013 all of this and more has been turned upside down. But if you took someone from the early 1990s and transported them into the political world of 2016, it would seem strangely familiar.</p> <p>It\u2019s still looking unlikely that Trump will actually become president: more probably it will be Hillary Clinton, who is married to a man who was president when the internet was only just getting going. Corbyn is equally unlikely to end up as prime minister. Instead, in Theresa May we have someone who could have come ready minted from an age of Tory politics before the internet was even invented.</p> <p>If our political leaders are relics of another time, then perhaps what is happening is that politics is not so much being disrupted as being left behind. Certainly that\u2019s the view from some parts of Silicon Valley, where democratic politics is often seen as an analogue inconvenience in a digital world. Why not use information flows to bypass the messy business of politics altogether?</p> <p>Digital technologies make it far easier than it has ever been to find out what people want \u2013 their likes and dislikes \u2013 without having to go through the cumbersome business of getting them to vote. You may find that a terrifying prospect. Or you may find it a liberating one. That\u2019s another way in which this is an open question: making politics impossible sounds like something to regret, but if politics has become a barrier in the way of getting things done, could it be something to celebrate?</p> <p>For now, though, the Silicon Valley worldview remains a minority one. The rest of the world still looks intensely political and the titans of the digital age are vulnerable to its vicissitudes. But politics has a habit of biting back. If Trump wins, even Mark Zuckerberg might find himself wondering what comes next. Politicians still have weapons at their disposal that Google and Facebook can\u2019t match: armies, currencies, taxes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Technologies that have the potential to spell the end of analogue politics do not spell the end of politics altogether</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet it\u2019s possible to imagine a near-enough future in which that is no longer the case. A genuinely digital currency \u2013 on the blockchain model of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\" title=\"\">Bitcoin</a> \u2013 could entirely alter the power of the state. Full blown cyber-warfare \u2013 with algorithms not human beings fighting it out \u2013 might do the same. Perhaps instead of being left behind by the transformative power of the digital revolution, politics is about to catch up. In that case, all bets are off. Technologies that have the potential to spell the end of analogue politics do not spell the end of politics altogether. What seems impossible for the current generation of politicians may be a sign of what the next generation will have at its disposal.</p> <p>This question is about more than just the echo chambers of the internet, though it\u2019s about that too. There\u2019s no doubt that digital technologies are changing human behaviour, and not always for the better. The hopes from the dawn of the digital age of a new era of democratic empowerment remain unfulfilled. Intolerance appears to be on the rise. Governments have proved more adept at using this technology to keep an eye on us than we have been at keeping an eye on them.</p> <p>Digital technologies are the box in which we all increasingly live. Are we trapped? Or does politics still offer a way out? It\u2019s easy enough to despair, or else to think that only time will tell.

Again, this claim does not stand up to scrutiny as NHS England spending cannot be seen in isolation from other areas of health spending.\u201d</p> <p>The letter\u2019s other signatures are Dr James Davies, a Conservative MP who is also a family doctor; Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw, a former health minister, Labour MP Emma Reynolds; and Dr Philippa Whitford of the Scottish National party, who is an NHS breast cancer specialist.</p> <p>Their letter\u2019s detailed rejection of the government\u2019s claims raises serious questions about the accuracy of May\u2019s insistence, in a newspaper interview on 17 October and again at prime minister\u2019s questions two days later, that her administration was giving NHS England boss Simon Stevens even more than he had sought in negotiations with ministers.</p> <p>May told the Manchester Evening News: \u201cSimon Stevens was asked to come forward with a five-year plan for the NHS. He said that it needed \u00a38bn extra; the government has not just given him \u00a38bn extra, we\u2019ve given him \u00a310bn extra.

But the MPs dispute that arithmetic, saying that the real amount of extra cash being given to the NHS in England between 2014-15 and 2020-21 is only \u00a36bn and even that much smaller sum has only come from cutting spending on public health programmes and medical education and training by \u00a33.5bn.</p> <p>Worries about health service funding have emerged with increasing intensity in the run-up to the autumn statement on 23 November after it emerged that May told the head of the NHS in private that it would get no additional money this parliament. </p> <p>Last year, finances were so tight that the NHS overspent its budget but public pressure to fund the health service generously remains strong. During the EU referendum campaign, the successful leave campaign promised to boost funding for the health service by diverting money that it said was being spent in Europe.</p> <p>Warning of the political risk involved in underfunding the NHS, the five MPs add that \u201cpublic expectations of the health service, and the continued rise in demand for its care produced by an increasing and ageing population, mean that measures which could be taken in some government departments are not acceptable in the NHS \u2026 including rationing of care and cuts in service provision.\u201d</p> <p>The MPs maintain that what they see as short-sighted cuts to social care threaten the viability of NHS services. They also raised the risks of the Department of Health \u201crepeatedly raiding\u201d the NHS\u2019s capital budget in recent years and the decision to give the NHS only tiny budget increases in 2017-18 and in the two years afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cOur fear is that, given the \u2018U-shaped\u2019 trajectory of increases in funding for the NHS over the spending review period, these short-term pressures will become overwhelming. Despite the real-terms increases set out in the spending review, per capita funding for the NHS is projected to be flat in 2017-18 and actually to fall in 2018-19. That calls into question the ability of the NHS to maintain services in the latter part of the spending review period,\u201d they say.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the health secretary in the coalition government, recently called for the NHS to be given \u00a35bn more than the money already planned. </p> <p>There have also been widespread calls for the government to make good on the suggestion by Brexit campaigners that leaving the EU could add \u00a3350m-a-week to the NHS budget.</p> <p>NHS England declined to comment on the letter.</p> <p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said that NHS underfunding meant that \u201cit is being asked to deliver an impossible task. Put simply, the gap between what the NHS is being asked to deliver and the funding it has available is too big and is growing rapidly\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Prof John Appleby, the chief economist at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said the MPs were right to warn that cutting the amount of per capita funding for healthcare could mean major restrictions to NHS services being needed in the later years of this parliament, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to see how this can be reconciled with providing high quality healthcare that meets the needs of a growing and ageing population,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cSomething will have to give \u2013 whether that\u2019s an explosion in waiting lists, patients not being able to access new drugs coming on-stream or another record set of hospital deficits.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/15/bma-theresa-may-nhs-crisis-autumn-statement\">BMA: Theresa May lacks understanding about seriousness of NHS crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government rejected the MPs\u2019 analysis and repeated previous statements made by May and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, including the highly contentious \u00a310bn claim. \u201cThe government has backed the NHS\u2019s own plan for the future with a \u00a310bn real terms increase in its annual funding by 2020-21, helping to ease the pressure on hospitals, GPs and mental health services. It is wrong to suggest otherwise\u201d, said a government spokesman.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs the chief executive of NHS England said last year, the case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported.

One in three NHS clinical commissioning groups are planning to shut or downgrade an A&amp;E unit over the next 18 months, while one in five maternity units where consultants are in charge are earmarked for closure, according to a Health Service Journal survey of 99 of England\u2019s 209 GP-led CCGs. More than half intend to make major changes to community hospitals, where mainly elderly patients go for rehabilitation after a spell in hospital, and almost as many plan to reduce the number of beds in their local acute hospital. </p> <p>The schemes, which are likely to prove highly unpopular, are being put together as part of NHS England\u2019s drive to rationalise services and treat many more patients outside hospitals through 44 regional Sustainability and Transformation Plans in a bid to find \u00a322bn of savings to help close a \u00a330bn hole in its budget.</p> <p>But Dr Chris Moulton, vice-president of the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/21/nhs-crisis-plan-to-cancel-operations-and-appointments-as-winter/\">Royal College of Emergency Medicine</a>, which represents A&amp;E doctors, said: \u201cThey are desperate to save money, but these are truly desperate measures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already have one of the lowest numbers of beds in the developed world \u2013 we need more beds, not fewer. We already have occupancy at record levels, and it\u2019s too risky to go further.\u201d<strong> <br></strong></p>",
  "<p>This weekend\u2019s news of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">renewed FBI interest</a> in a newly found cache of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails is just the latest twist in this long, strange trip to the White House. For months now, Hillary Clinton has seemed destined to become the next President of the United States. </p> <p>In recent weeks Trump\u2019s campaign has been in free fall and he remains well behind Clinton in the \u201cground game\u201d, the voter turnout operation so important in American electoral politics. Yet Trump has made a habit of defying predictions of his imminent political demise \u2013 and so long as the content and the implications of the Clinton emails remain unknown \u2013 we cannot rule out a Trump presidency completely. </p> <p>The issue of character has dominated the campaign. Trump\u2019s fitness for office, his persistent appeals to the worst fears and least attractive elements of American public opinion, his unwillingness to accept the results of the election. And Clinton has been plagued by decades-long enmity towards her among large segments of the electorate and persistent questions about her honesty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/07/is-the-us-australia-anchor-of-peace-immune-from-rust\">Is the US-Australia 'anchor of peace' immune from rust? | Carl Ungerer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the first time since 1980, unease about America\u2019s standing in the world \u2013 and how it should respond to numerous foreign policy challenges \u2013 has taken outsized prominence in a US presidential election. For Australia, vastly different implications for foreign and defence policy, as well as trade and investment, would flow from the election of Clinton or Trump.</p> <p>On the question of a Clinton or Trump presidency, Australian public opinion is utterly unambiguous. Earlier this year, before Trump\u2019s most shameful moments, the United States Studies Centre fielded questions about the US-Australia relationship to the more than 100,000 Australians who took the ABC\u2019s Vote Compass survey: 70% said Australia should distance itself from the United States if Trump is elected (just 24% said Australia\u2019s relationship with the United States should remain unchanged). </p> <p>Under a Clinton presidency, 87% of Australians would leave the US relationship unchanged, or seek to strengthen it. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s comfort with Clinton is understandable: she has visited here twice as first lady and secretary of state (including the 2012 launch of our sister centre in Perth). Much has been made of Clinton\u2019s hawkishness relative to President Obama\u2019s, her greater instinct to deploy military force and to take an active stance in global affairs. It seems likely that Clinton\u2019s foreign policy will be broadly consistent with Obama\u2019s, but with renewed vigour, less pensive deliberation, and a determination to stand up to global bullies. </p> <p>Three of the foreign policy challenges Clinton (or Trump) face are already apparent.</p> <p>Clinton will need to address ongoing Russian attempts to confront the United States and its interests at the same time as she manages US allies in Europe. Clinton seems determined to take a more active role in stabilising the Middle East, limiting if not eliminating the threat posed by Isis and other extremist groups, and instituting a no fly zone over Syria. Clinton will also need to police the Iran nuclear deal and limit the wider prospects of a Sunni-Shia conflagration stemming from Saudi-Iranian rivalry.</p> <p>In Asia, Clinton must balance the long term trend of increasing cooperation and dialogue between China and the United States alongside China\u2019s increasing assertiveness and militarisation in places like the South China Sea. </p> <p>For months Clinton\u2019s Asia team have been working on plans to further operationalise America\u2019s stabilising alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. North Korea will command immediate attention. Speaking last week, the US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper grimly assessed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/paranoid-north-korea-wont-stop-building-nuclear-weapons-us-spy-chief\">denuclearising the North Korean regime</a> may already be a lost cause, suggesting that the US and its Asian allies may soon face the prospect of North Korean nuclear tipped missiles pointed their way. </p> <p>If the United States is to act to avert this, the next administration will have to make some extremely tough decisions very early in its term. Australia is already committed to play a part in North Korean contingencies by virtue of our role in the UN Command charged with supervising the uneasy armistice on the Korean peninsula. </p> <p>The pressing question for Australia is how a President Clinton might apportion diplomatic and military effort between the Middle East, Russia, and Asia \u2013 and how Australia would seek to shape its contribution.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom is that a President Trump would lead an isolationist America. This is an incorrect simplification. Trump is a nationalist, not an isolationist. Trump has signalled he would increase the United States Navy by 30% and the US Marine Corps by more than 50%. He has pledged to renegotiate the Iran deal and up the fight against Isis, including through the commitment of US (and presumably allied) ground forces in Iraq and Syria. A Trump foreign policy could be very active indeed.</p> <p>Trump has declared he will sharply escalate trade tariffs with China and designate that country a currency manipulator. He has simultaneously promised to increase the presence of the US military in Asia (including in hotspots like the South China Sea) and withdraw forces contributing to the defence of South Korea and Japan. All of these moves are destabilising in a rapidly evolving Asian strategic situation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/unlike-julia-gillard-hillary-clinton-will-inherit-an-electorate-incredibly-alive-to-sexism\">Unlike Julia Gillard, Hillary Clinton will inherit an electorate incredibly alive to sexism | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most immediately, a President Trump would force Australia to a decision on Japan. Trump\u2019s dislike of Japan is visceral and long held, stemming back to 1987 when he bought full page ads in the New York Times claiming that Japan was taking advantage of the US. Would Australia, hedging against less predictable US engagement in Asia, continue its decade long trend towards a closer security relationship with Japan? Or to assure Trump, would Australia seek to distance itself from Japan, distinguishing Australia\u2019s alliance from one the new President sees as unfair and unrewarding?</p> <p>Though Clinton is the status quo candidate for Australians, her presidency may not be \u2013 she will face pressure to demonstrate that US allies are contributing to US interests. </p> <p>A Trump presidency however would put the US-Australia relationship under much greater stress. It would be unpalatable to a majority of Australians, and concerning to those with responsibilities for Australia\u2019s foreign and defence policy. </p> <p>These concerns would be compounded by uncertainty as to which of Trump\u2019s many (and often contradictory) campaign pronouncements would actually be implemented \u2013 and by whom. All of this would put immense pressure on the bipartisan consensus that has guided Australia\u2019s relationship with America.</p> <p><em>James Brown is director of research and Simon Jackman is professor of political science and chief executive officer, both of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. </em></p>",
