  "<p>Sir Alan Duncan will on Monday become the first Foreign Office minister to visit Argentina since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 in the strongest sign yet that Anglo-Argentinian relations are recovering despite the continuing dispute over the Falkland Islands.<br></p> <p>Duncan will focus on improving business links, but will also hold a bilateral meeting with Argentinian officials on the Falklands. The UK wants to extend direct flights from the Falklands to South America beyond the current weekly flight from Chile. The flights are limited by Argentinian controls over its airspace. Argentina want any new flights from the Falklands to be focused primarily on journeys to Buenos Aires. </p> <p>The two sides are also likely to discuss rights to explore for hydrocarbons in the waters off the Falklands, including ideas for joint exploration raised by Susana Malcorra, the Argentinian foreign minister. At present Argentina imposes sanctions against companies seeking to cooperate with any British exploration. <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/argentina-promises-respectful-cooperation-over-falklands\">Malcorra told the Guardian last week</a> that she wanted to end the very confrontational approach of the previous administration of Cristina Kira Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. <br></p> <p>She said the two countries agreed on 80% of issues, and co-operating on those should not be blocked by those over which they differed. </p> <p>The Argentinian claim to the islands, described as the Malvinas by Argentina in the country\u2019s constitution, will not be revoked. </p> <p>The UK Foreign Office said Duncan\u2019s visit followed \u201can improvement in relations between the UK and Argentina since the election of President Mauricio Macri last year. It marks an important step forward following more than a decade of difficulties under the isolationist approach of Argentina\u2019s previous government.</p> <p> \u201cThis is important for Britain, because having a better relationship with Argentina also means we can get a better deal for the Falkland islanders.\u201d </p> <p> During the two-day visit Duncan will attend a business and investment forum hosted by Macri in Buenos Aires and hold meetings with senior government ministers, including Malcorra and the deputy foreign minister Carlos Foradori.</p> <p>The Argentinian economy is heavily dependent on the ailing Brazilian economy.</p> <p>Duncan said: \u201cThis is a positive time for the relationship between the UK and Argentina. Our countries have many deep links, including in culture and language, and I hope my visit will help us take a step forward together.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign against Donald Trump has been going well. What isn\u2019t going so well is her attempt to convince Americans that they have reasons to want her in the White House beyond Trump\u2019s odiousness and unsuitability for office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-veterans-forum-debate-preview-moderators-elections-2016\">We just got a terrifying taste of the Clinton-Trump debates to come | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her terrible ratings on trustworthiness have persisted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson\">I have written before that she is fundamentally honest</a> and does not deserve such <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/03/us/elections/trump-and-clinton-favorability.html?_r=0\">high disapproval ratings</a>.

Still, it\u2019s clear that most voters, including some loyal Democrats, don\u2019t share my assessment. At a time when she should be pulling way ahead of Trump, she is leading, but not comfortably.</p> <p>The drag on her momentum is Clinton\u2019s insistence on holding things close in order to maintain a zone of privacy. This feeds the unfair but persistent belief among a sizable chunk of the electorate that she has something serious to hide. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">events of Sunday</a> were a case in point: the candidate appeared to stumble after leaving the 9/11 memorial in New York. The zone of privacy closed around her \u2013 press were largely kept in the dark, apart from a short statement and a shout of \u201cI\u2019m feeling great\u201d. Clinton then retreated to Chappaqua with her inner circle.</p> <p>The time has come to do something daring to try to restore trust. It goes against every fibre of her nature, but Clinton should now become radically transparent.<br></p> <p>She should release the <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/1/hillary-clintons-wall-street-speech-transcripts-an/\">transcripts of her Wall Street speeches</a>.

She should announce that no member of the Clinton family, including her daughter, Chelsea, will be involved in the foundation while she is president.

The campaign should never go dark when something happens, even if it\u2019s not serious.</p> <p>If she has personal calendars from her time as secretary of state and New York senator, she should release those.

She resents being scrutinised more heavily than men, which she is. That unfairness was on display once again last week on the presidential forum televised by NBC, when the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-email-story-is-out-of-control/2016/09/08/692947d0-75fc-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html?utm_term=.7b9bf2cd0aeb\">host, Matt Lauer, grilled Clinton</a> over and over again about her emails while letting Trump skate by with outright lies.</p> <p>In calling for Hillary Clinton to embrace radical transparency, I am holding her accountable to her own standard. In her two campaigns for president, she has claimed she is more transparent than anyone else. During a speech in Philadelphia in 2008, she said: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7ZaL-F09E\">\u201cI think I\u2019m probably the most transparent person in public life\u201d</a> \u2013 adding that \u201cI feel you know a lot more about me than you know about anyone else. Much of it untrue, but nevertheless, it\u2019s all out there.\u201d Last March she told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood: <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/04/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-democratic-presidential-candidate-hillary-clinton-speaks-with-cnbcs-john-harwood-on-closing-bell-today.html\">\u201cI\u2019ve been the most transparent public official in modern times as far as I know.\u201d</a> If she wants to be president, she should prove this to the doubters.</p> <p>Of course, she\u2019s right that the media will never be satisfied, no matter what or how much she releases. There will be more and more questions. The tortuous, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gCAJi3yLy0\">72-minute press conference</a> that she gave as first lady in 1994, intended to answer questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/21/hillaryclinton\">Whitewater</a> and her commodities trading, only cemented her conviction that journalists are out to get her. I covered this press conference, which was dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/21/molly-ringwald-pretty-in-pink-role-model\">Pretty in Pink</a>\u201d for the sweater she wore, when I worked for the Wall Street Journal, which went overboard on Whitewater. However much Clinton hated the experience, however sexist she thought it was for reporters to dwell on her clothes, she actually did herself some good by confronting her questioners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Enduring more questions about the thorny personal issues she hates talking about will help her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I also thought she did a fine job answering the barrage of questions from Lauer last week. She is always the prepared lawyer and gave cogent and truthful answers. Trump, in a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/09/donald-trump-jon-voight-vow-to-save-christianity.html\">speech to religious conservatives in Washington DC last Friday</a>, ripped Clinton for offering different explanations about her private email server at different times. The government\u2019s classification system is byzantine. Explaining why she didn\u2019t see or understand a tiny \u201cc\u201d (for classified) on three emails doesn\u2019t lend itself to pithy answers.</p> <p>While she knows every jot and tittle of policy, Clinton will benefit from more practice answering questions about her ethics, her speeches, the Clinton Foundation, her health and her emails. This is essential before the upcoming debates with Trump. Radical transparency will help her. Enduring more questions about the thorny personal issues she hates talking about will help her. She made a good start by meeting with reporters last week and answering their questions, but it\u2019s only a start. We can all bet that she\u2019ll be brilliantly prepared for the debates and ready for any policy question. On the personal, ethical issues, which Trump will relentlessly pound, it\u2019s harder to predict.</p> <p>Of course, this could all backfire. I\u2019m old enough to remember watching the first woman nominee for vice-president, the Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/geraldine-ferraro-obituary\">Geraldine Ferraro</a>, withering visibly as journalists hounded her about her husband\u2019s business dealings and their taxes. There\u2019s a long list of other politicians who thought they were attempting to \u201ccome clean\u201d but paid a political price anyway.</p> <p>But in Clinton\u2019s case, the price of not being demonstrably more transparent could be even higher \u2013 not only for her, but for the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0598cfc039a0118ca21fc9505c31e5304751ca34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0598cfc039a0118ca21fc9505c31e5304751ca34/0_2_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geraldine Ferraro, Walter Mondale's vice president nominee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first woman nominee for vice-president, the Democrat Geraldine Ferraro: \u2018I remember watching her wither visibly as journalists hounded her about her husband\u2019s business dealings and their taxes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

In June 1992, he actually led the polls \u2013 he had 39% in one Gallup survey \u2013 and was able to use his vast fortune to buy up half-hour blocks of TV time.

making them stand with their arms stretched above their heads for days at a time; leaving at least one of them naked until he froze to death; waterboarding them to the point of catatonia as bubbles rose from their open mouths; and inserting pureed food into their rectums while claiming it was necessary for delivering nutrients. </p> <p>Details of those procedures were outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released\">525 pages</a> which CIA director John Brennan, Barack Obama and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough allowed to become public.</p> <p>The CIA\u2019s response to Jones\u2019s report was split into two corps, one official and one not. The agency itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/10/because-it-might-work-the-cia-rationale-for-torture\">would no longer defend torture outright</a> because that would contradict the Obama White House\u2019s position on the unacceptability of torture. Instead, the agency would say that tortured men produced valuable intelligence, just not necessarily as the <em>result</em> of torture, and that the Senate could not definitively prove the torture did <em>not</em> produce valuable intelligence.</p> <p>Brennan gave a press conference following the release of the report in December 2014. It began with him spending five minutes reciting the unfolding developments of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and crescendoed with him calling the relationship between torture and useful intelligence \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/11/john-brennan-defends-cia-torture-report\">unknowable</a>\u201d.

They laid into the Senate committee with a vigor that Brennan, who still had to answer to it, could not. The Formers, who would in September 2015 attack the report in a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rebuttal-Intelligence-Committees-Detention-Interrogation/dp/1591145872/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471570496&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rebuttal\">Rebuttal</a>, called the committee\u2019s work a partisan hit job. They disdained it for not interviewing CIA officials involved in the program \u2013 all the while ignoring the fact that committee Republicans and Obama\u2019s justice department prevented Jones from conducting those interviews. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/10/former-cia-leadership-fight-back-torture-report\">reiterated the insistence</a> that torture yielded a wealth of intelligence and derided the Senate report for what they called its leaps in logic. One of them was former acting director Michael Morell, a frequent television guest, who would publish a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Great-War-Our-Time-Terrorism/dp/1455585661\">memoir</a> in May 2015 recapitulating much of the standard CIA line.</p> <p>\u201cMorell, he presents himself as this thoughtful guy, who\u2019s really in the weeds and knows things, but he went out and talked about how the report was inaccurate, he wrote a book with inaccuracies. He stated publicly that he had only read 300 pages of the executive summary and told Feinstein he hadn\u2019t read the full report,\u201d Jones said.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was the same problem with the agency, over and over again. Either you are knowingly spreading inaccurate information, which is pretty terrible, or you just don\u2019t want to know, and you take a briefing with inaccurate information and you just repeat it.\u201d</p> <p>CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said that the agency did not coordinate its response with the Formers. The Senate committee \u201cwithdrew its approval to let former officers read the executive summary prior to its release to the public, so some were not able to read or prepare responses to the accusations until [the committee] released its executive summary to the public,\u201d Trapani said. </p> <p>Glenn Carle was a CIA officer from 1985 to 2007. He knew Brennan while at the agency and respects the director\u2019s \u201csubtle and fair mind\u201d. After 9/11, Carle was called upon to interrogate a terrorism suspect <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/07/am-i-a-torturer/\">he now believes is innocent</a>. Although he did not use the brutal techniques called out in the Senate report, the experience deeply affected Carle, who has become a vocal critic of the agency\u2019s post-9/11 torture. </p> <p>While Carle said the CIA often holds a legitimate feeling of besiegement against outside criticism \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re always the ones left holding the bag after we\u2019re asked to mine the harbors or overthrow the government,\u201d he noted \u2013 the fury of the CIA reactions to the Senate troubled him. </p> <p>\u201cI was dismayed by the response, which I thought was in parts intellectually shoddy, simple-minded, unnecessarily defensive, circle-the-wagons reactive and wrong and harmful,\u201d Carle said. </p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe were well outside of the bounds, and it was obvious. And part of the defense the agency used, the Bush administration used, defenders, proponents, Republicans use, is that \u2018You have to understand the context of the times, we were all afraid there was going to be another attack, we had to act.\u2019 That\u2019s all bullshit. No, you cannot do that. Our job is not to react emotionally, and in fear, and reflexively, which is what that is a justification for doing. Our job is to get it right. Our job is to see through that and have the courage to act correctly.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Support Embed\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.svg#GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Sans Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianSansWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  * { box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; color: #333; }  a { text-decoration: none; }  body { max-width: 420px; }  .contribute__wrapper { background-color: #f5f5f5; }  .contribute__header { background-color: #fb0; padding: 4px; border-top: 2px solid #333; }  .contribute__logo { position: relative; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 24px; display: inline-block; color: #333; z-index: 10; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 700; }  .contribute__body { padding: 4px; }  .contribute__paragraph { font-family: 'Guardian Text Egyptian Web'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 24px; }  .contribute__button { background-color: #fb0; color: #333; position: relative; padding: 8px 40px 8px 12px; border-radius: 24px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 6px; }  .contribute__label { font-family: 'Guardian Sans Web'; }  .contribute__icon { position: absolute; right: 4px; top: 1px; }  &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__header&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;contribute__logo&quot;&gt;Support the Guardian's fearless journalism&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__body&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;contribute__paragraph&quot;&gt;From mass surveillance to brutal interrogations, the Guardian's investigative reporting holds the powerful to account.

The Senate committee\u2019s Republicans, who had pulled out of the inquiry in September 2009, savaged it as a Democratic witchhunt \u2013 a critical boost for a CIA that wanted to avoid the narrative that it was pitted against the Senate. </p> <p>While in 2009 the committee Republicans had urged the CIA not to grant interviews while a parallel justice department inquiry unfolded, now they attacked their Democratic colleagues for not renewing a request once the DoJ inquiry was concluded in 2012: \u201cThe committee had a window of opportunity to invite these relevant witnesses in for interviews, but apparently decided against that course of action.\u201d</p> <p>Jones said: \u201cThe Republicans were never supportive of interviews. Period. They just played games with this.\u201d</p> <p>As the CIA\u2019s rebuttal strategy began to unfold, Democrat Mark Udall took to the Senate floor. Udall was less constrained than any intelligence committee member. He had lost his re-election campaign and had only weeks remaining in the chamber. Udall had earlier flirted with reading the entire report into the Senate record and daring the administration to prosecute him. Instead, he excoriated the White House for aligning with the \u201cflippant and dismissive\u201d CIA against the Senate.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile the study clearly shows that the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program itself was deeply flawed, the deeper, more endemic problem lies in a CIA, assisted by a White House, that continues to try to cover up the truth,\u201d Udall said on 10 December 2014. He accused the White House of \u201cletting the CIA do whatever it likes, even if its efforts are aimed at actively undermining the president\u2019s stated [torture] policies.\u201d </p> <p>Udall continued: \u201cDirector Brennan and the CIA today are continuing to willfully provide inaccurate information and misrepresent the efficacy of torture. In other words, the CIA is lying. This is not a problem of the past.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The report was the result of six years of Jones\u2019s work. The seventh year was consumed by two tasks: defending the torture report against its CIA and Republican critics; and attempting to entrench its purpose \u2013 preventing torture \u2013 into law. Success would vary.</p> <p>Jones still wasn\u2019t speaking in public. He was a Senate committee staffer, although he recognized, now that North Carolina Republican Richard Burr was chairman, his position on the committee was untenable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd66c8937f54c93a1d96d1c359d356df37af1649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd66c8937f54c93a1d96d1c359d356df37af1649/0_0_5080_3053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Burr, right, with Dianne Feinstein and Ron Wyden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In his first month in office, Burr took an extraordinary step. The Senate had delivered copies of the classified report across the executive branch to the various agencies \u2013 the justice department, the Pentagon, and so forth \u2013 with equities in it. Burr, in his first month as chairman, formally requested the copies back. Burr\u2019s home-state newspaper, the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article44569983.html#storylink=cpy\">editorialized</a> that the senator preferred \u201cto hide the misdeeds of the CIA\u2019s secret prisons rather than have others in government review what happened\u201d.</p> <p>The ACLU, which had sued for disclosure of the document, filed an emergency motion to block Burr. In response, the administration pledged to \u201cpreserve the status quo\u201d, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t give the classified report back. If there was an opportunity to learn lessons from careful, private reading of the full report, the agencies did not take it \u2013 <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1507956/ssci-foia-gov-mtd.txt\">they did not even remove the 6,700-page classified report from its packaging</a> \u2013 an issue complicated by freedom of information lawsuits that mired the documents in bureaucratic limbo. The report\u2019s advocates considered that a final gut punch from the administration: \u201cThe point is to learn from it,\u201d Jones noted.</p> <p>Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and intelligence committee member, has not given up. \u201cI want the full report out, with necessary redactions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Carl Levin, a recently retired Michigan Democratic senator whose chairmanship of the armed services committee made him a non-voting member of the intelligence panel, considered it a legacy issue for Obama.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe president ended the CIA program by executive order in January 2009, as one of his first actions in office. By distributing the classified Senate study throughout the executive branch as appropriate before he leaves office, he\u2019ll be making it less likely that his executive order will be rescinded by a future president,\u201d Levin said. </p> <p>As the public attacks on the report compounded through 2015, Feinstein opted to wage a continuous response. Jones\u2019s new job was to pore over each criticism from the CIA Formers or other prominent surrogates and rebut them in statements Feinstein would send to reporters and place on her website. The task was not much different from how he had spent the previous six years.</p> <p>The first major salvo came in the name of former Indiana Democratic senator Evan Bayh, himself a former intelligence committee member, barely a month after the Senate report was published.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1d2d72433dc21b6af91a134b9d026edb69b2b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1d2d72433dc21b6af91a134b9d026edb69b2b8a/0_45_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan Bayh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After the inspector general had taken the agency to task for breaching the network firewall, Brennan asked Bayh to convene an \u201caccountability board\u201d to review the episode. As Bayh already served on the CIA\u2019s advisory board, his report, unsurprisingly, exculpated Brennan, walked back the inspector general\u2019s denouncement of the network breach, said the five CIA officials involved in the breach acted reasonably, and criticized the committee. </p> <p>Bayh\u2019s account, issued in January 2015, prominently reiterated that that the CIA and Senate lacked a \u201csigned memorandum of understanding\u201d limiting the agency\u2019s role on the network \u2013 despite the sheaves of agreements in May and June 2009 between Panetta and Feinstein explicitly laying that out \u2013 and noted that the login screen on RDINet referenced the prospect of monitoring and warned of a lack of privacy expectation. Still, even Bayh found the CIA had \u201cimproper access\u201d to the Senate files.</p> <p>Jones, who said \u2013 improbably \u2013 that he doesn\u2019t remember seeing the warning message at login, expressed exasperation with Bayh\u2019s defense. \u201cWe went back and forth, months and months, up to the principals level, where Feinstein\u2019s sitting across the table from Panetta \u2026 and they\u2019re demanding these things happen, and we\u2019re exchanging letters and we\u2019re saying: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve reached agreement.\u2019 It would just be absolutely ridiculous to think that after all those months of negotiations saying the CIA wouldn\u2019t have access to our computers that we would go in there and every time we log on we\u2019d just erase the decision that was made between the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chair and the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee.\u201d</p> <p>Unusually, Bayh\u2019s panel was mostly anonymous. It had five members. The only other named member was Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel who had vouchsafed for the CIA no longer removing torture documents after it was caught taking 900 of them from the Senate in 2010. The other three, CIA officials, were never revealed, not even to the Senate. It is unknown if they played any role in the torture program; the CIA did not answer that question when the Guardian asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe information released with regard to this matter was extraordinary. Nonetheless, some information was appropriately redacted or withheld,\u201d said the CIA\u2019s Trapani, citing a <a href=\"http://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/CIA49.pdf\">legal provision</a> that affords the CIA leverage to withhold its officials\u2019 identity.</p> <p>Bayh has won the Democratic nomination for Senate in Indiana and is currently running to reclaim his old seat. He did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cRegarding the CIA\u2019s search of Senate computer files and their going into the emails of Senate staff, I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said former Senate intelligence committee chairman Jay Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cYou either have oversight and separation of powers with the checks and balances that come with that, or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s amazing that, once again, no one at the CIA was held accountable.\u201d </p> <p>Feinstein told the Guardian that she is not currently inclined to \u201crehash every interaction\u201d in the years-long fight over her report. Instead, she pointed to the CIA\u2019s response as an inadvertent testimony to its rigor. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the report has been relentlessly attacked by the CIA and former agency officials, no factual errors have been found,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cContinued efforts to obfuscate the report\u2019s findings and justify a very dark chapter in our nation\u2019s history do not change the facts, which stand without correction. By contrast, the CIA itself has acknowledged numerous factual errors, not only in its representations about the program but in its 2013 response to the report.\u201d <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As consuming as the rear-guard defense of the torture report was, Feinstein, no longer in possession of a gavel, pivoted to legislating the lesson that motivated it. In June 2015, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 21, Feinstein and John McCain successfully passed an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill prohibiting the CIA from engaging in interrogations more brutal than an army field manual authorized. Obama signed the bill, giving the force of law to his 2009 executive order ending torture.</p> <p>\u201cImplementing all of the reforms needed to address the problems the report exposed is most important to me,\u201d Feinstein told the Guardian, \u201cand I am continually looking at ways to do that.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2015, Jones left the Senate. Feinstein read a tribute to Jones into the record. He joined a <a href=\"http://www.daschlegroup.com/\">Washington consulting firm led by Tom Daschle</a>, Reid\u2019s predecessor as Senate Democratic leader, and started a firm, the <a href=\"http://thepqg.com/\">Penn Quarter Group</a>, to advise businesses and nonprofits on research and investigations.</p> <p>\u201cIt was obvious I needed to leave the committee,\u201d Jones said. While he said senators encouraged him to push back against torture in public, \u201cI needed a break. It\u2019s hard to describe how much of my life\u2026\u201d Jones trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cI was gone from the world for a number of years. It\u2019s a bit of an adjustment to being a normal person.\u201d</p> <p>Rockefeller, the former senator and intelligence committee chairman who hired Jones in late 2006, said: \u201cWe were lucky to have him leading our investigations. He and others devoted so much of their lives to making sure this Senate study got done \u2013 and was done right.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cDan and his team worked under considerable pressure for more than seven years to complete the full 6,700-page classified report on the CIA program,\u201d added Levin.</p> <p>\u201cHe and his colleagues always comported themselves in a professional manner, were diligent, and maintained the highest of ethical standards throughout this ordeal, despite all of the challenges they faced.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has regrets about the way the declassified report turned out. Most prominently, Jones wishes he had gotten declassified the nearly 100-page table of contents for the full 6,700-page torture report, so readers could understand from the headings and subheadings just what the full contours of the torture was: \u201cIt has an incident on a particular day of someone\u2019s detention, and there might be 10 pages on it. Or there might be 50 pages on it. It just shows the level of detail and how these 500 pages is just scratching the surface.\u201d<br></p> <p>Still, Jones considers the inquiry a success, one he attributes to the senators who took real political risks to back him and his team against the CIA. </p> <p>\u201cFor those who worry that Congress is only dysfunctional, this is exhibit A to the contrary,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis was a serious and high-stakes battle between two branches of government. And the legislative branch, in my view, ultimately won. I think our founding fathers would be very proud of Senator Feinstein and the others who worked to get this investigation completed and released.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was gone from the world for a number of years.

Trump has pledged to bring back waterboarding \u201cand a hell of a lot worse\u201d.</p> <p>The anti-torture law Feinstein and McCain passed is one impediment to CIA torture. But before 9/11, US laws were unequivocally against torture as well, and the adoption of torture arose due to political will driving creative lawyering. Brennan in April this year said he would refuse an order to bring back waterboarding, and in July said he would have to be fired rather than implement it. But he indicated that his departure would not necessarily be an impediment to a return to torture.</p> <p>\u201cIf a president were to order the agency to carry out waterboarding or something else, it\u2019ll be up to the director of CIA and others within CIA to decide whether or not that, that direction and order is something that they can carry out in good conscience,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/cias-strategy-in-the-face-of-emerging-challenges/\">told</a> the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>The CIA\u2019s clash with the Senate committee has faded. So has Brennan\u2019s summer 2014 contrition, delivered to Feinstein, about spying on Jones and the committee staff. Brennan\u2019s ire at the torture report has not. </p> <p>On 9 February 2016, Brennan had a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4579908/sen-ron-wyden-questions-cia-director-brennan\">heated exchange</a> with Wyden, who asked about the network search during an unrelated committee hearing. Brennan defended the agency\u2019s actions and again implied that Jones had himself hacked the CIA: \u201cSeparation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, Senator, goes both ways.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUEidBI-zjs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oUEidBI-zjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>February 2016: CIA director John Brennan refuses to admit CIA unauthorized search of Senate files was improper</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Speaking on 19 July to a friendly audience, the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, Brennan <a href=\"http://www.insaonline.org/i/z/docs/2016_BrennanDinner_Transcript.aspx\">went further</a>: \u201cWhen I look at the Senate\u2019s report on the detention interrogation program, it makes my blood boil, because although there\u2019s a lot of things in there that were accurate, it really just focused on the shortcomings of the agency during that period in time.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cIf it was done in a more objective, nonpartisan and fair fashion, it would have put those shortcomings in better context. I fervently believe there was no agency more responsible for preventing a recurrence of 9/11 than the CIA. Unfortunately, that report I think misrepresented the totality of the worth of that program.\u201d </p> <p>Brennan has told colleagues that he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-03/obama-s-cia-director-wants-to-stick-around-for-clinton\">wishes to remain CIA director</a> under Hillary Clinton. In August, Morell published a New York Times op-ed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/campaign-stops/i-ran-the-cia-now-im-endorsing-hillary-clinton.html\">excoriating Trump and endorsing Clinton</a>, which intelligence observers understood as an audition to run Langley. For Jones, their apparent eagerness to lead the CIA is a reminder of a lack of accountability for torture and what he calls a \u201cfailed coverup\u201d by CIA officials, aided by both the Bush and Obama administrations.<br></p> <p>\u201cBoth Morell and Brennan are unfit to be CIA directors based off their response to the report, the way they responded to the Senate, how they view oversight. Under Brennan and Morell, the CIA is defending rectal rehydration as a \u2018well-acknowledged medical technique\u2019 \u2013 nothing to see here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wyden, speaking to the Guardian, said: \u201cI\u2019m exceptionally troubled by Director Brennan\u2019s extraordinary efforts to resist vigorous congressional oversight. I certainly do not have confidence in the director.\u201d</p> <p>Obama has retained Brennan without a word of public criticism. He has kept his job despite the clash with his Senate overseers, just as CIA officials involved in the torture program and its misrepresentation to Congress, the Bush and Obama administrations, and the public still work at Langley.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who played a significant role in this program, who are in the report, continue to play significant roles in sensitive programs at the agency,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>Carle, the former CIA officer and torture critic, disagrees that the agency needed to fire officials involved in torture to hold them accountable. </p> <p>\u201cI do know a number of officers whose careers were certainly impacted, if not derailed, as the result of all this stuff,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Speaking of Brennan\u2019s reaction to the Senate report, Carle continued: \u201cI know John. This was his least impressive moment. I and colleagues have been somewhat mystified that such an intelligent, subtle and open-minded man, on this point, reacted like Jose Rodriguez,\u201d the retired CIA official and torture advocate whose destruction of videotaped interrogations began the Senate inquiry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People who played a significant role in this program \u2026 continue to play significant roles in sensitive programs</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Udall, who had called for Brennan\u2019s job in 2014, told the Guardian that he was \u201cnot aware that there has been accountability for what Director Brennan calls CIA\u2019s \u2018bad mistakes\u2019.\u201d But, he said, the CIA as a whole ought not to bear the blame for torture. </p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ascribe the bad behavior of some to all the employees of the CIA or of the intelligence community,\u201d Udall said. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA writ large wasn\u2019t responsible for developing, implementing and misrepresenting the truth about the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program. In fact, a small number of CIA officers were largely responsible. It is unfortunate that the refusal of the CIA\u2019s leadership to pursue accountability and tell the truth continues to tar the agency as a whole.\u201d </p> <p>Obama is more instinctively skeptical of the intelligence agencies than his potential successors, but the president who banned torture helped CIA officials implicated in torture endure at the agency. Obama\u2019s deep relationship with Brennan and his early commitment not to \u201clook backward\u201d had profound consequences that will outlast his presidency.</p> <p>\u201cThey avoided all the necessary reforms that have to happen at the CIA,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a huge lost opportunity. Here\u2019s an administration that came in and did all the right things within a few days, shutting down the program. But they didn\u2019t want the independent commission. They said the Senate intelligence committee was the right place to do this. And to me, we were just never given a fair airing. No one from the White House would be briefed by us. They were briefed by the CIA.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1550e86d1449a7b1c7ebaddee978e8f40989fc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1550e86d1449a7b1c7ebaddee978e8f40989fc26/0_74_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Bush: 'The United States does not torture'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delivering a speech on the \u2018war on terror\u2019 on 6 September 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Udall agreed: \u201cIt is incumbent on the next administration to acknowledge these mistakes and institute the necessary reforms to restore the CIA\u2019s reputation for integrity and analytical rigor.\u201d</p> <p>Carle is a rare former CIA official willing to praise the Senate torture report. \u201cIt captures exactly \u2013 exactly \u2013 the culture, reality, conversations, pressures, silences, actions, doubts, arguments that I lived.

That said, I think we did lasting harm to ourselves as an institution and as a country.\u201d</p> <p>The Senate investigation Feinstein led and Jones conducted into CIA torture is believed to be the largest in the legislative body\u2019s 227-year history. In May 2016, the CIA inspector general\u2019s office destroyed its only copy of the classified torture report. The agency, Yahoo <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-report-on-cia-torture-1429636113023030.html\">reported</a>, claims the destruction was accidental and that a copy of the report is held elsewhere at Langley.

Within two chapters, your cough will be spraying drops of dark red blood on to your linen kerchief and before long, you\u2019ll be carried off by consumption.</p> <p>These days we don\u2019t live with the constant threat of tuberculosis and yet, from the way a certain segment of the rightwing fever swamp is treating Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, you\u2019d think she was Fantine from Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables. </p> <p>Matt Drudge, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, some ghoul named Steve Malzberg \u2013 who probably can\u2019t help it that he\u2019s a dead ringer for 90s make-believe car salesman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGUBm0XQbqA\">Joe Isuzu</a> \u2013 and even Republican nominee Donald Trump have seized upon Clinton\u2019s seasonal allergies and resulting cough as a sign that she is trembling at death\u2019s door, barely able to function. </p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t cough like that,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/conservative-host-freaks-out-because-media-isnt-obsessed-with-hillarys-cough/\">Malzberg insisted</a> on his Newsmax.com podcast last week. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have coughing fits \u2018all the time\u2019, in public, that go on and on and on and on and on and on. Not unless there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Please allow me to disabuse you of that notion, sir. Plenty of people \u201ccough like that\u201d, myself included. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 19.1 million adults over 18 were diagnosed with seasonal allergic rhinitis \u2013 also known as \u201chay fever\u201d \u2013 in 2014, along 6.1 million children. </p> <p>I\u2019ve got big sinuses. It\u2019s part of what makes my singing voice able to cut through layers of drums and guitars \u2013 a network of large, resonant holes in my skull. My late mother sang opera and had a glorious lyric soprano voice that could fill a whole theater and shake the chandeliers. </p> <p>Twice a year, for two to four weeks in the spring and fall, those holes in my head fill up with gunk and it makes my face and forehead feel like a huge, throbbing, aching, seriously clogged bottle of rubber cement. </p> <p>If I don\u2019t get enough sleep, drink quarts of water, eat right and keep my stress levels down, that respiratory distress will move straight down into my chest and I will develop a booming, persistent cough.</p> <p>For some reason, the fall of 2009 was particularly nasty. I\u2019d quit smoking the year before and thought that would make my seasonal battles with pollen and mold less miserable, but that first year, it seemed to have the opposite effect.</p> <p>That was when I was a late-night classical music DJ. My show went out live to the whole state of Georgia four nights per week. I remember it was Thursday, 10 September, because I was queuing up John Adams\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jCdOjOaJsU\">solemn, exquisite symphonic remembrance of the 9/11 victims, On the Transmigration of Souls</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOur next selection,\u201d I began, \u201cis John Ad\u2013\u201d and I was seized with a violent coughing fit. Most radio consoles have what\u2019s known as a \u201ccough button\u201d for just such an emergency. It mutes your microphone until the cough or sneeze or period of hoarseness passes. </p> <p>But this coughing fit didn\u2019t pass \u2013 it just kept going on and on. I killed my mic and started the music because I wasn\u2019t sure what else to do. I was mortally embarrassed and for an awful moment felt sure I was disgracing the memory of all those people who were killed in the terror attacks of September 11 2001.</p> <p>The control room phone rang. I gulped down two swallows of tepid coffee and answered, still weak-voiced and froggy.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay in there?\u201d It was my boss calling from home. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I sputtered. \u201cJust fighting for breath.\u201d</p> <p>He asked if I needed someone to come take over. I said no, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s already passing. I hung up the phone and it immediately rang again. I picked it up and it was my twin brother calling from his car. </p> <p>\u201cBoy, that sounded terrible,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to quit smoking crack rocks at work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt went out live to the whole state,\u201d I said. \u201cOur listeners probably think I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t, though, any more than Hillary Clinton is. The fact is, even an able-bodied, healthy, athletic person like myself can get a cough that sounds like the end of the world. A week later I was back to running four miles a day and breathing like normal.</p> <p>Sometimes, oh ye rightwing vultures, a cough is just a cough and the female candidate whose health you\u2019ve never cared one iota about before now is probably just fine, suffering from \u2013 as her personal physician <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-health-excellent-doctor-letter-2016-campaign-120861\">disclosed in detail</a> \u2013 a round of seasonal allergies. </p> <p>So, if you\u2019re expecting Hillary Clinton to keel over dead like Mimi, the consumptive heroine of Puccini\u2019s La Boheme, or Hugo\u2019s Fantine, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up. I think she\u2019s got a couple of arias to sing first. <br></p>",
  "<p>All of Donald Trump\u2019s strengths and weaknesses were on display this week as he kicked off the homestretch of his presidential campaign.</p> <p>From a walk through a county fair in Ohio, where throngs of people standing four and five deep along a paved path reached out to touch the waving Trump to a televised interview where the Republican nominee praised Vladimir Putin and denigrated American generals, it was a microcosm of Trump\u2019s campaign. One moment he went out of his way to be accessible to the media extending reporters (including one from the Guardian) an invitation to talk with him on a flight on his private plane. Next, he proclaimed to a shouting crowd that the journalists were a corrupt extension of the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>The Republican nominee started the week in Ohio where he sat down with union workers in the bar of an American Legion hall with a blinking LED sign announcing \u201cwings on Thursday\u201d. There, Trump waxed rhapsodic about Democrats who were now supporting him and the weakness of Barack Obama to a dozen weathered white men who looked to him as a potential savior.</p> <p>The blue-collar tour continued when Trump visited nearby Goody\u2019s Diner, which boasted its country tot bowl on a sign outside. The Republican nominee greeted individual diners there. He was particularly pleased when the first voter he met was a Hispanic who planned on voting for him. Trump pronounced \u201cMexican American supports Trump, Mexican American. It\u2019s so nice\u201d to the reporters surrounding him. Trump, looking quite pleased with himself, then gestured at the reporters and directed them to \u201cmake a note of it guys\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82678156c9481e6b7ac935b4c832010ef506ab36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82678156c9481e6b7ac935b4c832010ef506ab36/0_212_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks to diners during a stop at Goody\u2019s in Brook Park, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republican nominee eventually sat down at a table with beefy, middle-aged men sitting around a pitcher of cola. He proclaimed to an assembled crowd of reporters and diners \u201cthese are the big union folks here\u201d. A longtime Trump aide standing nearby hastened to agree: \u201cAmazing,\u201d he exclaimed. </p> <p>The union folks must have been amazing as a heartened Trump invited reporters on his plane for a 30-minute flight afterwards. Not coincidentally though, the invitation was extended the same day Hillary Clinton started flying on the same plane as her press corps, something presidential candidates have traditionally done for six months before the election. Trump has declined to let reporters join him on his private plane.</p> <p>For this flight, the press sat facing Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, in the main seating area of the cabin, which featured white leather chairs and couches along with shiny wood that a Trump bodyguard anxiously warned the press not to scratch. Each seat was emblazoned with the Trump crest while television screens through the cabin showed flight data. Some reporters had to go to a separate private room for takeoff because they couldn\u2019t sit on the floor for safety reasons. As the plane taxied, Trump got up and visited them, amiably making small talk. By the time the plane landed, Trump pivoted yet again on his immigration plan. Pence had helped one reporter find a missing cellphone that had gone flying across the cabin during takeoff. </p> <p>The next stop was a county fair where Trump received a welcome more akin to the Beatles at Shea Stadium than a presidential candidate in Ohio. Even teenage boys shouted \u201cI love you Donald\u201d as the candidate struggled to walk a block past rows of corndog vendors. Instead of working the crowd, Trump simply had to wave as secret service agents protected him from the crush of humanity eager for a glimpse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7492e27227497ce0e3e801a21e12086a87170460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7492e27227497ce0e3e801a21e12086a87170460/0_313_4696_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Throngs of Trump supporters try to get a photo of the Republican presidential candidate as he walks through the Canfield fair in Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following days for Trump were more conventional. On Tuesday, he held a town hall where in response to softball questions posed by General Mike Flynn, a longtime supporter, he demonstrated his nostalgia for the Iran-Iraq war. \u201cI always say Iran and Iraq were very similar militarily. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight and then they\u2019d rest. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight. And then Saddam Hussein would do the gas.\u201d Trump followed this with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">a primetime rally</a> where he railed against Hillary Clinton as an adoring crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-us-military-spending-sequester-isis\">held a policy speech</a> in a wood-paneled club that has long catered to Philadelphia\u2019s elites, where he suggested \u201csometimes it seems like there wasn\u2019t a country in the Middle East Clinton didn\u2019t want to invade\u201d and railed against her legacy of \u201cturmoil, suffering and death\u201d.

  "<p>On September 11 2001, Merita Zejnuni began her shift at 7am, cleaning offices at Goldman Sachs on Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan. At 8.46am, she was in an internal stairwell.

Then all the bankers began trying to make their way home.</p> <p>\u201cIn one hour, the building was empty,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The boss of her cleaning company asked her and a few others to stay, to clean up. She did not sleep or go home for two and a half days, after which she was reunited with her 12-year-old son at their apartment in Queens. </p> <p>In the days and nights she cleaned, she said, she had no masks left to use herself and no access to a shower or clean clothes.

This weekend, speaking to the Guardian, she gave her first interview. Her lawyer, Troy Rosasco, said Zejnuni only found out last month she could apply for compensation.

Late last year, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/16/congress-spending-bill-budget-zadroga-911-health-and-compensation-act\">agreed</a> to extend the act\u2019s provisions for 75 years.

There is no central record for how many people died between 2001 and 2011 from illnesses linked to 9/11 fumes and debris, Spring said, nor any way of knowing exactly how many other people have died without any record of their illnesses having been caused by exposure near Ground Zero.</p> <p>Melius said: \u201cWe know a significant number of people died before the WTCHP was set up; it\u2019s likely to be in the hundreds. There are also probably hundreds of people outside the program who are sick and may have died.\u201d</p> <p>The WTCHP has certified 37,000 people as suffering from serious respiratory or digestive illnesses, cancer, or a combination. Most of those registered are from New York City and 82% are male.</p> <p>Spring said: \u201cThere are health conditions covered in the program that will take years to develop and we don\u2019t think the cancers we are seeing now is the end of it.

  "<p>New Zealand\u2019s landscapes are well-known on the silver screen. The Lord of the Rings films showed off the majestic mountainous scenery so well they sparked a tourism boom \u2013 and 13% of travellers still cite Peter Jackson\u2019s cinematography in their decision to visit. Out next Friday (16 September), Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a comedy-drama directed by Taika Waititi and starring Sam Neill as Hec, grumpy foster uncle to Ricky (newcomer Julian Dennison), shines the spotlight on the country once again. The story of a city kid\u2019s adventures in the wilderness broke box office records at home and had rave reviews at the Edinburgh International Film Festival (winning the coveted Audience Award). It was filmed largely in the North Island\u2019s Auckland region, where beaches, rainforest and vineyards surround New Zealand\u2019s biggest city. For those inspired to book a Kiwi adventure, here are five of the best film-related options.</p> <h2>Bush survival</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1903a74a5686c25584c2442cf10d488ee2bb4e5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1903a74a5686c25584c2442cf10d488ee2bb4e5e/0_0_3264_2035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bush survival training near Auckland    New Zealand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bush survival training near Auckland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Gilbert SOS Survival Training</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stu Gilbert from SOS Survival Training coaches anyone from airline crews to schoolchildren, so a session with him is a good start for would-be Wilderpeople, as Ricky dubs himself and Hec.

After tuition on the basics, he has participants foraging for logs, branches and bracken to build a makeshift bed and shelter) and trying to light a fire using cotton wool, flint and steel (a dead phone battery can also work, apparently).

Protest, which opens later this month at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, will dramatise some of them. It is a show, in some ways, nostalgic for the dualities of 60s protest (currently celebrated in the V&amp;A exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley\">You Say You Want a Revolution?</a>). Taking as a starting point the American painter Alice Neel\u2019s prophetic 1936 painting, <em>Nazis Murder Jews</em>, which depicts a Communist party torchlight parade through the streets of New York City, it collects new and recent pieces that address in different ways our own disorienting political moment.

The first was that, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">phenomenon of Trump</a> in America and the threats to cohesive democracy in Europe, the need for a politically engaged art has rarely been more urgent. The second was that the means to that end are necessarily nuanced. It is harder to challenge power if, in a globalised world, you don\u2019t know precisely where power lies. How do you stick it to the man, when the man in question is not a state or a corporation, but, increasingly a tax-dodging global network of information systems run by smart former hippies with untold wealth?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81a3bb6b47f2e91635f706a9e7085523134556d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81a3bb6b47f2e91635f706a9e7085523134556d6/0_0_2289_3215/712.jpg\" alt=\"Nazis Murder Jews 1936, by Alice Neel\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazis Murder Jews, 1936, by Alice Neel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Artist\u2019s Estate and Victoria Miro, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Western artists are generally uneasy at being viewed as political in the way that Weiwei has come to accept; they see it as a limit on their asserted freedom.

Sarah Sze, the American sculptor, who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and clarity, she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cProtest requires focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Occupy movement could have focused around one moment or image \u2013 like John and Yoko in a bed \u2013 it would have helped that movement a lot. My work really reflects the sense, I think, that we have masses of information coming at us from sources we don\u2019t know, and the speed of that makes the hierarchy of what to protest against very slippery all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Sze is somewhat wistful for the simple visual protests of her student years. \u201cAt my American college the entire main campus was filled with shanty towns protesting apartheid. A lot of students were kicked out as a result. Those are the kinds of things where art can be dangerous to power.\u201d</p> <p>In our digital age did she feel that any solid act of making becomes a political act?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible longing for stillness,\u201d she said, \u201cin the way that you stand in front of a Vermeer and are having a physical conversation with Vermeer across time and place. The idea of the hand-made itself can be quite conservative. But what seems important to me is how you create a moment where you feel the presence of the maker, a live conversation. You see it in the growth of live events and talks and happenings. The premium on storytelling. Museum attendance rates even have gone through the ceiling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11734090ceb31f463be92e456c1f19c3edb1d2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d11734090ceb31f463be92e456c1f19c3edb1d2e/0_0_4096_2522/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ai Weiwei\u2019s installation depicting a scene from his time in prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ai Weiwei\u2019s installation depicting a scene from his time in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That one-to-one connection in itself might suggest a form of protest at the way culture and relationships are now mediated \u2013 the acceptance that conversation and intimacy are structurally eavesdropped by corporations and government.</p> <p>One of the motivations for American Doug Aitken\u2019s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/25/barbican-station-to-station-art-exhibition-doug-aitken\"><em>Station to Station</em></a> project, which took groups of artists coast to the coast in the States by train, making spontaneous 60s-style happenings on the way, was to avoid any mediation at all.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted something that existed outside any system,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted a living platform for the artists to experiment. To be open to what crosses your path.\u201d</p> <p>What were the moments in that journey that he enjoyed most?</p> <p>\u201cI think of an artist like Ed Ruscha, famous for his painting. His response was to make 300 cactus omelettes out in the desert,\u201d he said. \u201cOr a musician like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/station-to-station-film-review\">Beck </a>who said he had always wanted to work with, like, a huge choir of gospel singers but he had never been allowed to do it in the commercial sector. So we were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of nowhere in America. It feels untethered to any existing system.

It is an honourable tradition. The abstract painter Joan Mir\u00f3 was never a political activist in a conventional sense, but he was always his own man. When he was asked late in life what he had done to oppose General Franco, he didn\u2019t hesitate to reply: \u201cFree and radical things.\u201d</p> <p>Aitken agreed. \u201cAny worthwhile art is never optional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political strategy.

Is it ever more important as an artist to make those statements?</strong><br>Fear is a very unfortunate thing for a culture if you want to make it vibrant and dynamic. And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with everyone holding each other at gunpoint. It also ends up giving men like Nigel Farage or Donald Trump their popularity, because people are fed up being told what they can or cannot say in public. They vote as a protest, no matter what the consequences of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The really frightening thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they don\u2019t believe things can be better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How do we process these things?

You are confronted with something physical and hopefully the art statement is a bit more nuanced and even profound. We recently did a <a href=\"http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/elmgreen-dragset\">show in Israel</a> at the Tel Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of the Berlin Wall. We moved to Berlin soon after the wall came down, so we felt we could speak about walls in general and hoped that it would make people think about the wall that had been built between Palestine and Israel. We come from outside, we don\u2019t live with that conflict. But we could speak about our experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down</p> <p><strong>What response did you get?</strong><br>People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single person being blocked in their movement. And we were of course also speaking about Donald Trump\u2019s idea of building a wall at the Mexican border. It is not uncommon to try to solve problems by putting up a physical barrier.

We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics has just become economics \u2013 how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We call ourselves \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d in a very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s.

That piece was then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to be removed.</p> <p><strong>What was the problem?<br></strong>It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. For this show, I have done the opposite.

He lives, inevitably, in California. </strong></p> <p><strong>Did you see <em>Station to Station</em> in the tradition of the great American road trip of the 50s and 60s?</strong><br>I did, but the project was born out of a desire for action. It\u2019s really interesting how segregated music, art, cinema, books and so on are. With <em>Station to Station</em>,<em> </em>instead of critiquing this, we tried to create something that erases the separation, that allowed many artists to be in motion together.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that fragmentation is a way of controlling those cultural forces?</strong><br>I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a conspiracy. Different mediums create infrastructures and infrastructures slow down the possibilities for change. It\u2019s funny. When I was talking to the gallery about Protest it conjured those ideas of a feminist rally in 1978 and people standing out in the cold with placards. The tools we have to work with now are so different. The power of an image to transmit an idea coherently is so much reduced. Take those seminal images from Vietnam \u2013 the monk setting himself on fire or the child running from the napalm. Those images were disseminated by conventional media. Now there\u2019s a constant river of images from millions of iPhones. The question is: what has potency? Technology is opening up incredible new possibilities but also dangers, not least a sense of the loss of self. It is a twilight that we are living in right now, which is very unpredictable and also very stimulating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t separate social and political work from any other art.

What do you make of the Trump phenomenon?</strong><br>The whole presidential race in America right now is like an enormous hologram projected on the sky. We all look up at it. It is like a cloud that will never leave us but it has no meaning or substance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/79329869\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/79329869\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/79329869\">Watch the trailer for Doug Aitken\u2019s Station to Station.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>At some point soon, though, it might have real meaning for a lot of lives. Do we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?</strong><br>It\u2019s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most interesting projects or groups or actions now don\u2019t exist in opposition in a traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don\u2019t purchase.</p> <p><strong>Can art work in the same way?</strong><br>I don\u2019t separate social and political work as different from any other art. The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. The whole landscape has changed. You don\u2019t have to wait for a single critic in New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don\u2019t have those high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture \u2013 everything is eroded down to this kind of universal jungle.

  "<p>It is lunchtime in east London. In a studio not far from her home, Maya Arulpragasam, the 41-year-old British-Sri Lankan who makes music as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia\">MIA</a>, sits on a low sofa, her leather boots set apart and yellow-flared legs spread, better to arch over a plate of food. Arulpragasam\u2019s hair is dark and wild and hangs down in tangles over a tight white T-shirt that the musician says is on loan from her six-year-old son. She is just back from Himalayan India, there for a month to direct a music video that will accompany the release of her new album, <em>AIM</em>. While she eats, Arulpragasam tells stories about her trip. The time airport police in Delhi almost shot her. The time she argued with a production manager, in Leh, and threatened to burn his house down.</p> <p>Arulpragasam\u2019s manager, Genneah Turner, sits on the sofa listening. She hasn\u2019t seen her client for weeks. When Arulpragasam finishes telling an anecdote about disagreeing with a local physician\u2019s treatment of her altitude sickness, Turner interrupts to ask about the apparent lack of internet in northern India. How else to explain all the important business emails that Arulpragasam failed to reply to over a month? \u201cSeriously,\u201d the musician insists, chewing food, \u201cthe internet wasn\u2019t working where we were.\u201d</p> <p>Turner wonders, gently, how other people on the same trip were able to Instagram so much of it. Arulpragasam, smiling coolly at her plate, says she can\u2019t explain that. \u201cMaybe something went wrong with my phone?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"328d66dbd603dff0bf36f66f4ec453bcd248617f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/328d66dbd603dff0bf36f66f4ec453bcd248617f/591_762_2948_4983/592.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears blouse by Stella McCartney (harveynichols.com) and track trousers by Vetements (matchesfashion.com).\" width=\"592\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears blouse by Stella McCartney (harveynichols.com) and track trousers by Vetements (matchesfashion.com).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who\u2019ve followed her career, since she first emerged as MIA in 2003, will be well aware Arulpragasam has a testy relationship with authority. Across a month in India she managed to threaten a disobliging colleague with criminal arson and, at Delhi airport, provoke police into reaching for their guns.<strong> </strong>Across a decade in pop she has been vexatious, cheeking powerful peers (Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9) as well as influential tastemakers (MTV, <em>New York Times</em>, Google), meanwhile <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse\">live-Tweeting</a> more detail about the private disputes with her American record label (Interscope) than anybody there can be comfortable with. \u201cI talk talk talk,\u201d she raps on her new album, accurately, \u201cuntil I piss \u2019em off.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my head this is like the love album. It\u2019s cute compared to what I usually make</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her lunch finished, we walk to a nearby park, where Arulpragasam lists for me all the managers she\u2019s chewed through since 2003. One left inside a week, she recalls. One manager departed because of the Super Bowl \u2013 that infamous occasion, in 2012, when MIA joined Madonna on stage as part of the event\u2019s halftime show and, during some very limited time on screen, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nfl-sues-m-i-a-for-16-6-million-over-super-bowl-middle-finger-20140317\">managed to flip an unchoreographed middle finger</a> at 167 million viewers. \u201cI\u2019ve had 13 managers in 13 years,\u201d she says, claiming that one of them has since become her boss at Interscope.</p> <p>Arulpragasam triangles her legs, teddy bear-style, and puts her hands out behind her on the grass. \u201cSo there\u2019s some bridges I\u2019ve burned,\u201d she says.</p> <p>We talk about <em>AIM</em>, a curious and appealing muddle of a record that has much of the snarl fans have come to expect from MIA, but an unfamiliar gentleness, too, its softer underbelly most evident in an autobiographical track called \u201cSurvivor\u201d and in the new single \u201cFreedun\u201d, its chorus sung by <a href=\"http://inzayn.com/\">Zayn Malik</a>, one-time glowerer of One Direction. Arulpragasam says the album\u2019s sweeter parts were written after a break-up with a boyfriend late last year. \u201cIn my head this is like the love album,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a cute album, My Little Pony, compared to what I usually make.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s going too far. At least half the tracks sound as if they were written in MIA\u2019s customary battle-crouch, and the album\u2019s thorniest work, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\">Borders</a>\u201d, inspired by the Syrian refugee crisis, was recently the subject of a mean little row between her and MTV. She directed a video for \u201cBorders\u201d last year that featured an image of a boat-load of dead refugees. The film was politically timely, affecting and well praised, but when it was left off the list of nominations for an MTV video music award, Arulpragasam took to Twitter to laugh bitterly (\u201c#hahahahhaahahhaha!!\u201d) and to accuse the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/758621030965506048\">media company of being prejudiced</a> against her subject matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77c1f8131202ff121e5fe4eafd40eb810d2bc578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77c1f8131202ff121e5fe4eafd40eb810d2bc578/0_0_4682_7015/667.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears printed hoodie by Vetements (selfridges.com).\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears printed hoodie by Vetements (selfridges.com).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In conversation she suggests the lack of an MTV nomination amounted to a form of censorship. She says: \u201cIf you have a music industry that\u2019s so ingrained with the political agendas of the time that you censor art like that\u2026\u201d When I suggest another possibility, that MTV didn\u2019t think the video was one of the year\u2019s best, she answers: \u201cYou can think it\u2019s my paranoia. And you can write that, say: \u2018Oh, yeah, MIA, she was super-paranoid about all these people doing all these things, but that\u2019s not true, [her video] was just rubbish.\u2019 You can write that.\u201d But she says she wants her own suspicions registered, too. \u201cIf it\u2019s political, then people have the right to know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it\u2019s political, then people have the right to know</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her war with MTV is actually one of the more manageable conflicts currently occupying her. There is a song on the new album called \u201cVisa\u201d that takes aim at American immigration policy, something Arulpragasam unwillingly knows a lot about. Her application to renew an expired visa has been stuck in mysterious bureaucratic limbo since 2014. In an age when British popstars with any sort of US fanbase are routinely granted permission to work in America, her two-year hobbling seems unconventional. \u201cObviously what\u2019s happening to me is very deliberate,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing it, it\u2019s like fucking playing Cluedo.\u201d</p> <p>She says she has a few theories as to what\u2019s going on \u2013 a few of the bridge-burnees from her past who she worries might be exerting influence. Arulpragasam keeps a <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>-style list in her head, identifying potential enemies, obstructors. \u201cIs that weird?\u201d she asks me.</p> <p>Um.</p> <p>\u201cWell shit happens. It is what happens.\u201d</p> <p>A few of her presumed obstructors cannot be named here for legal reasons. In general, though, she does not pitch her suspicions small. \u201cOn paper I\u2019ve supported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks</a> and stuff. And now Hillary Clinton is running for president. And until that\u2019s solved I might have a problem, because anyone who ever associated with that website is going to get fucked up. Even if you delivered [WikiLeaks] their takeaway, you are going to be on a list. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if she ever worries she\u2019s paranoid and she replies, smartly, that in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>\u2019s revelations about the NSA it\u2019s wrong \u201cto even use the word \u2018paranoia\u2019 as if it\u2019s a weird condition. Because it\u2019s common as a fucking cold now. Everyone has to have an element of paranoia.\u201d</p> <p>She reaches for her phone \u2013 \u201cI would love to not show you this\u201d \u2013 and calls up a screengrab she\u2019s been keeping for months. Last spring, Arulpragasam was removed from the billing of London\u2019s <a href=\"http://afropunkfest.com/london/\">Afropunk festival</a>, after making controversial comments in an <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/single-mother-refugee-campaigner-and-controversialist-meet-mia-a3228831.html\">interview with the <em>Evening Standard</em> </a>about Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar, and their involvement in the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. (\u201cWould Beyonc\u00e9 or Kendrick Lamar say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter?\u201d) The decision that she wasn\u2019t going to perform was reported widely. Oddly, one of the US Embassy\u2019s social media feeds <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/755235104994230272\">retweeted the news</a>. </p> <p>Arulpragasam, screengrabbing, interpreted this as a foreign government\u2019s approval of her difficulties. \u201cIf they care about you getting dropped off a festival,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s not really paranoia, that\u2019s <em>there</em>.\u201d She puts away her phone. Then, without any preamble, she starts a long and involved story about the summer she thought the CIA might be threatening to assassinate her\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d60aeb6a3a56ad57d12822a373170c4c77a53f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d60aeb6a3a56ad57d12822a373170c4c77a53f/468_390_3897_6225/626.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears boiler suit by Iro (selfridges.com); rollneck by Victoria Beckham (net-a-porter.com) and shoes by Nicholas Kirkwood.\" width=\"626\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears boiler suit by Iro (selfridges.com); rollneck by Victoria Beckham (net-a-porter.com) and shoes by Nicholas Kirkwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no great mystery where this inclination to mistrust comes from. Arulpragasam tracks it back to the example of her father, an activist who in the 1970s and 80s was a prominent protester against Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling Sinhalese government. He campaigned for an independent state for the minority Tamil population, and Arulpragasam recalls that when she was young her father used to tell her to write letters as if someone was reading them over her shoulder. \u201cFrom day one he was like that,\u201d she says. When civil war broke out in Sri Lanka in 1983, Arulpragasam, aged six, was moved with her mother and siblings to India while their father stayed behind. When she was 10, they arrived in the UK, the family housed as refugees in London.</p> <p>On her new album track \u201cSurvivor\u201d, she raps in reference to this period: \u201cI arrived through the sea like a pirate.\u201d For a time the young pirate struggled to fit in. Arulpragasam recently unearthed an old family photograph, and laughing over it today she wonders at her rounded Princess Di hair, her primly buttoned-up shirt. At that age, \u201cWhen I gave my seat to old ladies on the bus, they used to reply: \u2018Aren\u2019t you a nice little boy?\u2019\u201d Slowly she found a place for herself as an artist. The go-to person at school for freehand drawings, she went on to <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/\">Central Saint Martins</a> art college. In her 20s she put on visual art shows, made clothes and might have made a film, had anyone funded a documentary she was trying to make about life in Sri Lanka. Her music was encouraged by a friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/justine-frischmann-elastica-interview-volta-art-fair\">Justine Frischmann</a>, then the lead singer in Elastica. Frischmann loaned Arulpragasam one of the band\u2019s synthesisers and she began to write tracks on it.</p> <p>Nobody really knew what to make of her early output as MIA, she recalls. Her stuff was a bit hip hop, a bit dancehall, a bit funk... multi-generically <em>odd</em> in a way that her collaborator and then-boyfriend, Wesley \u201cDiplo\u201d Pentz, urged her to embrace. She remembers practical difficulties, though, getting studios and suppliers to accept oddity. \u201cI told them: \u2018If you don\u2019t know the genre, just put me near the till. You know the lollipops, next to the till? <em>That</em> is me.\u201d If distributors were wary, the music press took to her immediately (that back-story!) and the debut studio album that came in 2005, <em>Arular</em>, was a critical hit, nominated for a Mercury prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99acbf0fd58a98eb4c151c0142e11b7658ef4cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99acbf0fd58a98eb4c151c0142e11b7658ef4cbd/0_0_4678_7009/667.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears track jacket by Neil Barrett.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears track jacket by Neil Barrett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arulpragasam was in her late 20s, and impatient. Against the advice of her then-manager (they split) she moved to the US. \u201cKids in America were downloading my MP3s. It was the country where George Bush was, where shit was happening. I wanted to go.\u201d Her relationship with Pentz ended and Arulpragasam <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arular-10-years-later-m-i-a-reflects-on-globe-shaking-debut-20150320\">later suggested</a> this was due to her growing embrace by the mainstream. She signed to Interscope, a subsidiary of Universal, and had meetings with Kanye West and Timbaland. After the release of her second album, <em>Kala</em>, in 2007, and its high-charting single \u201cPaper Planes\u201d in 2008, the rope properly lifted and MIA became an industry darling. She gigged at the Grammys with Jay-Z, was nominated for an Oscar, and even \u201cmarried into the music industry\u201d \u2013 Arulpragasam\u2019s words to me \u2013 when she got together with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/mia-benjamin-bronfman-son_n_2874890.html\">Ben Bronfman</a>, grandson of the CEO of Warner Music. The couple had a son together, Ikhyd, in 2009.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I came [into the spotlight], I came with all my complications</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Remembering this period of prominence, Arulpragasam says to me: \u201cWhen I came [into the spotlight], I came with all my complications.\u201d The complications started to tell around 2010, when she rowed in blockbuster fashion with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/28/mia-tweets-phone-number-journalist\"><em>New York Times</em></a> over an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30mia-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1\">unflattering profile</a>, and ended up publishing the writer\u2019s personal phone number online. In <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/mia/51302\">another 2010 interview </a>she stated her belief that Google was a stooge company for the CIA, and via her intermittently written blog she got so deep into a war of words with a Sri Lankan rapper called DeLon that it led to accusations of her being a terrorist sympathiser. Her third album, 2010\u2019s <em>Maya</em>, sold a fraction of her big-hit second. After the Super Bowl fiasco in 2012, a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mia-resolves-nfls-war-super-727111\">messy compensation claim</a> followed her around for months. She came to believe her fourth album, 2013\u2019s <em>Matangi</em>, her lowest-seller to date, had been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/765439547421241344\">\u201cburied\u201d by her own record label</a>, because of all the trouble she\u2019d caused them.</p> <p>\u201cStars come and go / just like every empire,\u201d she raps on her new album. Complicated as she was \u2013 as she is \u2013 Arulpragasam was never likely to have an endless career as a mainstream star. She seems relaxed about this, clearly more comfortable as a fringe-dweller, as someone who has talked, talked, talked and finally pissed them off.</p> <p>But the visa thing rankles. Arulpragasam recalls for me her last visit to the US, a brief trip to deliver her son to his father. \u201cI flew there to drop him off and flew back the same day.\u201d Arulpragasam explains that when she and Bronfman separated in 2010, she decided to move back to London to be near her mother. Tomorrow, Arulpragasam says, Ikhyd will arrive back in the UK from a month away with his paternal family. \u201cWe went through a <em>lot</em> to sort that out. It\u2019s kind of like that\u2019s when he gets taken away to get Americanised \u2013 he goes and does all his \u2018Heeeey! Awesome! America!\u2019 stuff, and I\u2019ve just got to let it happen.\u201d</p> <p>When she talks about Ikhyd I understand that her battle over the visa amounts to more than just a rebel\u2019s habitual prickliness at being told no. Arulpragasam is the mother of a dual-nationality child, reasonably appalled that whenever she sees him off a plane at JFK she cannot follow. \u201cIt\u2019s fucked up. You can have a half-American son and they won\u2019t let you in. So if anything happens to him\u2026 Y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>We stay quiet, leaving this worst-case scenario unexplored. Arulpragasam isn\u2019t much of a moper, though, and soon she is rascally chuckling. She still has one or two friends with influence, she says, and the other day she sent a text to Rihanna. Arulpragasam wanted to know if, in a pinch, her friend would help get her over the border. Perhaps via tunnel, \u201csome weird El Chapo move\u201d from Mexico. Or maybe in the boot of a car? The reply came back quickly. \u201cYeah bitch,\u201d Rihanna wrote, \u201cyou know I would.\u201d</p> <p><em>MIA\u2019s new album </em>AIM<em> is out now on Interscope/Polydor</em></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes journalists can\u2019t live by a hand-me-down codebook. They themselves are responsible for what\u2019s published. They live, after all, in the society they chronicle. They are part of that society. And two vivid new examples make the point.</p> <p>One comes from the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/opinion/hillary-clinton-gets-gored.html\" title=\"\"> Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman</a>, addressing various tales of influence-peddling in Hillary Clinton\u2019s foundation hinterland when she was secretary of state. \u201cAs reporters like to say, the sheer size of the [Clinton] foundation \u2018raises questions\u2019. But nobody seems willing to accept the answers to those questions, which are, very clearly, \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Krugman is particularly upset by a report whose example of alleged cash-for-access was Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel peace prize winner who also happens to be a friend of his. \u201cIf that was the best the investigation could come up with, there was nothing there.</p> <p>\u201cSo I would urge journalists to ask whether they are reporting facts or simply engaging in innuendo, and urge the public to read with a critical eye. If reports about a candidate talk about how something \u2018raises questions,\u2019 creates \u2018shadows\u2019, or anything similar, be aware that these are all too often weasel words used to create the impression of wrongdoing out of thin air.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re a US journalist, you may soon be living in a country where Clinton is president. You may discover real problems with that. But raising \u201cshadows\u201d because there\u2019s no evidence to hold up to the light is different. Your newsdesk may want to turn the heat on Mrs C, if only to show they\u2019re \u201ceven-handed\u201d after Trump, but there\u2019s still a lingering responsibility \u2013 a personal responsibility \u2013 to get things right.</p> <p>Which, in a totally different arena, is a Brexit responsibility in Britain too. Whether any of us like it or not, the government will soon embark on two years of exit negotiations. Everyone, from Nobel-winning economists down, has an idea of what that negotiating brief should be. Politicians will be booming and sniping all over the shop.</p> <p>But how do you run a unique, vitally important negotiation with 27 other countries over a minimum of two years? Transparency sounds fine, but it hasn\u2019t lasted two minutes through the junior doctors\u2019 dispute. When the <em>FT</em> negotiates with journalists or the BBC goes deep into union-dispute session, the door closes. Do we want to go into EU battle with running commentaries from Nigel Farage on the <em>Today</em> show? With weekly <em>Times</em> columns from Michael Gove detailing how he\u2019d have handled negotiations? Perhaps not.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t take away journalists\u2019 need to find out what\u2019s going on. But two years, in daily journalism, is an eternity. There\u2019ll be new leaders in France and perhaps even Germany long before the mists clear. In EU-world, everything is mutable and everything is damnably complex. Another land of \u201cshadows\u201d, you might say: a land of incessantly \u201craised questions\u201d. But also one we all have to live in, long after the miasmic grind is over.</p> <p>\u25a0 These will be a defining few weeks for the battling little <em>i </em>newspaper under its new Johnston Press ownership. On the one hand, circulation is fine: up to 297,000 in July from 269,000 a year ago (when the <em>Indy</em> still pulled its strings). Good going. But one critical selling point at launch in 2010 was low price in a cold economic climate: the<em> i</em> arrived costing a mere weekday 20p, 10p less than the <em>Sun</em>.</p> <p>But now watch the escalator run through the years \u2026 30p, 40p and henceforth 50p: price parity with the <em>Sun</em>. Will that harm its sales resilience? Editor Oly Duff, citing increased newsprint bills since sterling\u2019s post-Brexit collapse, clearly hopes not. This is expansion time in his book: new jobs to be filled handling education, video production, design, women\u2019s features. Charge more to get more. Which may be fine, but is not quite the original prognosis. Watch this space.</p>"
