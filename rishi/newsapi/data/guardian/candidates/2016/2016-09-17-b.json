  "<p>Asked by Bloomberg this month about Russian involvement in the hacking of the US Democratic national committee, Vladimir Putin issued a non-denial denial. Basically, his answer boiled down to this: whoever did it did a good thing. This response only added to the stir created by the initial accusation that Russia was behind the activities of the \u201cFancy Bears\u201d. The fear of Russia manipulating presidential elections in the world\u2019s mightiest democracy has been spreading across the United States.</p> <p>Getting to the real perpetrators of hacking attacks is notoriously difficult. Yet seen from the Kremlin hackers perform a valuable public service by revealing secrets \u2013 not to foreign intelligence services, but to the western public. The political power of these revelations was first demonstrated by WikiLeaks, which broke the confidentiality of US diplomatic cables. The effect was much enhanced by the Snowden files, which exposed, <em>inter alia</em>, US spying on other western leaders.</p> <p>Information warfare has become, alongside geo-economics (sanctions and counter-sanctions), one of the principal battlefields in the new confrontation between Russia and the west.</p> <p>Some cases look like direct tit-for-tats. The exposure of the Democratic national committee leadership secretly supporting one candidate against another and thus rigging the primary vote appears as payback for Hillary Clinton\u2019s diatribes against Russia\u2019s own flawed parliamentary elections of December 2011. The opening of World Anti-Doping Agency medical files shows that US Olympic champions did take banned drugs, while Russian athletes were banned <em>en masse</em> from participating in the Rio Games.</p> <p>However, all this is just the tip of the iceberg. It may seem that all Russia is doing is trying to get even and making its accusers appear guilty of the same crimes with which they charge Moscow. There is a big difference, though. Russian public life is permeated with cynicism. The president is a tsar. Elections are about confirming rulers in power, not changing them: \u201cYou first get into the Kremlin, and then I\u2019ll vote for you.\u201d People get rich not before they enter government service or after they leave it, but while they are in government. Law is a tool of the high and mighty. This cynicism has its limits, and the Russian people\u2019s proverbial patience may suddenly snap, but their level of tolerance is generally high. By contrast, western political systems have become used to more than a fair share of hypocrisy. Call it political correctness, or values, or ideology, but western societies are more vulnerable to the exposure of wrongdoing and abuse which is not individual but systemic, particularly when it comes to democracy.</p> <p>It is one thing for the Russian people to be told that their vote has been stolen; it is totally different for the American electorate to believe, as Donald Trump has suggested, that presidential elections can be rigged. And democracy is again becoming an issue all over the European Union and America.</p> <p>Putin certainly sees the widening gulf separating western elites from their disgruntled co-citizens, left behind in the process of globalisation and unrestrained money-making, and \u2013 insult to injury \u2013 branded \u201cdeplorable\u201d. He also notes that the triumph of democracy over communism three decades ago has led to the political systems of Europe and America essentially eschewing any meaningful competition within those systems.</p> <p>With inequality on the rise, this only leads to dissent and challenge emerging from outside the established systems and against them. As someone who is now locked in a battle with the US political establishment, he closely studies the state of his adversary and draws conclusions from it.</p> <p>One conclusion which might surprise him is the notion that he can manipulate not just European politicians but also American elections, and lead, single-handedly, a global challenge against the existing liberal democratic order. By now Putin paranoia has reached a level far above the occasional playing of the \u201cRussia card\u201d against the opponent. This betrays a degree of uncertainty among the ruling elites of the western world which one could not imagine even a few years ago. This uncertainty is not necessarily good for Russia, as the risks tend to mount, but it surely can and will be exploited in the ongoing great power struggle.</p> <p>There are many lessons to be drawn from the demise of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago. One is that imperial hubris is eventually punished; another is that attempts to bring a supposedly advanced political system to a nation unprepared for it usually ends in failure, and that the elites who get too far away from their public are caught up with the reality when it is already too late.</p> <p>Modern western nations are not like the USSR, but their leaders might wish to consider that, in the end, what killed the Soviet system was not Reagan\u2019s Star Wars, or even the scarcity of goods in the shops; the people in that part of the world had known worse. What actually did it was the loss of public faith in the domestic political system. So, improve or beware of exposure.</p> <p> <em>Dmitri Trenin is director of the Carnegie Moscow Center</em></p>",
  "<p>Ever since the internet went mainstream in the 1990s people wondered about how it would affect democratic politics. In seeking an answer to the question, we made the mistake that people have traditionally made when thinking about new communications technology: we overestimated the short-term impacts while grievously underestimating the longer-term ones.</p> <p>The first-order effects appeared in 2004 when Howard Dean, then governor of Vermont, entered the Democratic primaries to seek the party\u2019s nomination for president. What made his campaign distinctive was that he used the internet for fundraising. Instead of the traditional method of tapping wealthy donors, Dean and his online guru, Larry Biddle, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean_presidential_campaign,_2004\">turned to the internet </a>and raised about $50m, mostly in the form of small individual donations from 350,000 supporters. By the standards of the time, it was an eye-opening achievement.</p> <p>In the event, Dean\u2019s campaign imploded when he made an over-excited speech after coming third in the Iowa caucuses \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeZGePI62rU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\u201cDean scream\u201d</a> which, according to the conventional wisdom of the day, showed that he was too unstable a character to be commander-in-chief. Looked at in the light of the Trump campaign, this is truly weird, for compared with the current Republican candidate, Dean looks like a combination of Spinoza and St Francis of Assisi.</p> <p>But the lessons of Dean\u2019s approach to fundraising were not lost on later contenders, particularly Barack Obama, who put together a team of tech whizzes drawn from the big internet companies and deployed all the black arts of surveillance capitalism to target voters, motivate supporters and get out the vote \u2013 on two occasions, 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>These initiatives were first-order effects because they were predictable: they merely harnessed the obvious affordances of online technology \u2013 the ability to communicate efficiently with a large number of people, solicit and process donations, disseminate campaign messages and so on. They changed the way campaigns were conducted but they did not change the nature of politics.</p> <p>The second-order effects of the internet \u2013 the technology\u2019s ability to mobilise and coordinate large-scale collective action \u2013 were first seen in late 2010 when the Arab Spring kicked off. As Helen Margetts of the Oxford Internet Institute and her colleagues argue in their book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2cdnjAm\"><em>Political Turbulence: How Social Media Shape Collective Action</em></a>, the internet did what it had done in every area of commercial life, namely lower the transaction costs of doing something \u2013 in this case engaging in political activity. This is creating, Margetts and her colleagues argue, a new kind of \u201cturbulent\u201d, fast-moving, unpredictable politics.</p> <p>Six years on, the Trump campaign has demonstrated quite how turbulent, fast-moving and unpredictable politics has become. We have seen how the internet (in the shape of social media) has become a powerful enabler of \u201cpost-truth\u201d politics \u2013 defined by <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706525-politicians-have-always-lied-does-it-matter-if-they-leave-truth-behind-entirely-art\">the<em> Economist</em></a> as \u201ca reliance on assertions that \u2018feel true\u2019 but have no basis in fact\u201d. Trump\u2019s brazenness is not punished, but taken as evidence of his willingness to stand up to despicable elites.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d asks Zeynep Tufekci in the <em>New York Times</em>, \u201cthat Hillary Clinton has a body double? She was that blond woman waving at reporters in front of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment a few hours after Mrs Clinton felt unwell and left the September 11 commemoration at ground zero. Did you also hear that Mrs Clinton has Parkinson\u2019s disease? Her coughing fits prove it, as does her latest bout of illness. She has epilepsy, as well as advancing dementia. She has managed to hide all these illnesses through almost a year and a half of a gruelling campaign because the man the world thinks is the head of her secret service detail is actually her hypnotist. He\u2019s also a medical doctor.\u201d</p> <p>This is the kind of stuff that Professor Tufekci, an academic who has been studying the content of social media conversations about the US election, has picked up online. In an earlier media ecology, one dominated by the editorial gatekeepers of newspaper editors and TV news anchors, this kind of conspiratorial fantasising would never have seen the light of day. But now what the comedian Stephen Colbert calls \u201ctruthiness\u201d \u2013 ideas that \u201cfeel right\u201d or \u201cshould be true\u201d \u2013 passes as fact on social media. The days when Daniel Patrick Moynihan could say that \u201ceveryone is entitled to his own opinions, but not to his own facts\u201d are gone. And the internet is largely responsible for their passing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa445b6306cb55a8de247ca8589b53c3d6c8dfd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa445b6306cb55a8de247ca8589b53c3d6c8dfd1/0_193_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump is a genius at exploiting social media to spread ideas that \u2018feel right\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump is a genius at exploiting social media to spread ideas that \u2018feel right\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Luis Magana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways, this was predictable, especially given that <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/07/trump-time-capsule-62-a-man-who-can-be-baited-with-a-tweet/493631/\">Trump turned out to be a genius</a> at harnessing the affordances of Twitter: 140 characters is the perfect length for truthiness \u2013 just enough to make a baseless insinuation. But what makes this election campaign really distinctive is the way in which the intrinsic insecurity of network technology has begun to play a significant role. The United States has a long history of interfering in other states\u2019 elections but this is the first time it has had to contemplate the possibility that a hostile state might be interfering with its own electoral processes.</p> <p>It started in April with the hacking of the Democratic national committee\u2019s computer systems. The intruders stole <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/07/heres-know-russia-dnc-hack/\">private emails</a>, opposition research (including the DNC manual on how to deal with Trump in the general election), and campaign correspondence. In the run-up to the DNC national convention, WikiLeaks obligingly put nearly 20,000 of those private emails online, revealing embarrassing details of the Democratic party\u2019s inner workings \u2013 including correspondence which made it clear how opposed its officials were to Hillary Clinton\u2019s rival, Bernie Sanders. These revelations made a predictable impact on the convention, where Sanders\u2019s supporters were mightily disaffected.</p> <p>Although it is often difficult to attribute responsibility for hacking, in this case it was rapidly established that the hackers were working for not one but two of the <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack\">Russian government\u2019s intelligence services</a> (and, ironically, that neither knew of the other\u2019s activities). From this basic fact came a frantic outbreak of speculation and conspiracy theorising. Were the breaks just examples of Putin\u2019s geeks doing what geeks do when they have free rein? Or were they part of a concerted campaign to undermine Clinton (who takes a conventional establishment line on Putin\u2019s Crimean adventure) and boost Trump \u2013 who has made no secret of his admiration for the Russian leader? The pot was further stirred by Trump himself when, at a press conference in Florida, he urged Russia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">hack into and release Clinton\u2019s emails</a> from the personal server she used while she was secretary of state. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d he said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d</p> <p>Pause for a moment to contemplate this: a candidate for the US presidency is urging a foreign adversary to break into his opponent\u2019s email. And this in a country in which \u201cnational security\u201d has quasi-religious status. The episode demonstrates how far Trump\u2019s mastery of Twitter has enabled him to move the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">\u201cOverton window\u201d</a> \u2013 the range of ideas that are deemed permissible in public discourse.</p> <p>But the audacity of the Russian hacks has introduced an unprecedented level of unease into the election campaign. Ironically, Trump himself started it with continual assertions that if he were defeated it would be because the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/09/15/donald-trump-says-the-election-will-be-rigged-half-of-his-supporters-seem-inclined-to-agree/?utm_term=.109dace951fd\">election was \u201crigged\u201d</a> by \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d and her satraps \u2013 a proposition apparently believed by nearly half of his supporters. But, as it happens, one doesn\u2019t have to be paranoid to worry about the integrity of US presidential election returns. In the old, analogue, days the concern was about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_election_recount\">\u201changing chads\u201d</a>; now it is about the integrity of digital infrastructure. Security experts have been warning for years about the chronic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/2016-elections-russia-hack-how-to-hack-an-election-in-seven-minutes-214144\">insecurity of American voting machines</a> \u2013 which, as one professor put it, \u201cbarely work in a <em>friendly</em> environment\u201d. And last month the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/fbi-states-voting-systems-digital-assualt-227523\">FBI issued an unprecedented nationwide alert</a> after voter databases in Arizona and Illinois were hacked and their data stolen by as-yet-unidentified hackers.</p> <p>So one of the strange outcomes of this weird election campaign is that we are finally beginning to get an idea of the long-term effects of the internet on our politics. It has been obvious for some time that social media were moving us in the direction of a post-truth polity. The rise of Donald Trump (and Brexit) suggests that we have arrived at that particular destination. What\u2019s more worrying, though, is the prospect that the technology\u2019s intrinsic insecurity could undermine one of the fundamental principles of liberal democracy, namely faith in the integrity of the electoral system. If people start to believe that elections are \u2013 or may be \u2013 rigged, then the democratic game is over. \u201cThe only thing we have to fear,\u201d said Franklin Roosevelt, \u201cis fear itself.\u201d Which is why we should be concerned by what\u2019s been happening this year.</p> <p><em>John Naughton is co-director (with David Runciman) of the technology and democracy project at Cambridge University</em></p>",

Sanders and Warren were slated to make some half-a-dozen stops over the weekend.</p> <p>The senators stumped for Clinton as new polls showed that roughly a third of voters under the age of 35 plan to vote for someone other than Trump or Clinton. Only about 30% of such voters support Clinton, or half the number of young and millennial voters who supported Barack Obama in 2012. </p> <p>On Saturday, both senators touted the benefits of Clinton\u2019s platform for young people before audiences of mostly college students. Sanders spoke about Clinton\u2019s support for pay equity and raising the minimum wage, and about the large sums of money conservative donors such as the Koch brothers have fed into the election. </p> <p>Both senators reserved large portions of their speeches for excoriating Trump over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">racist statements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-miami-clinton-disarm-security-obama-birther\">insinuations of violence</a> and the bigoted tone of his campaign.</p> <p>The events of this past few days supplied them with plenty of new material.

In a surprise paper sent to EU leaders on the morning of the summit, the central European quartet also mounted a robust defence of free movement of labour, with an implicit critique of \u201cintra-EU protectionism\u201d.

Trump made the comments at what was billed as a press conference in a downtown Washington hotel. However, the Republican nominee did not take questions.</p> <p>Speaking to the Black Women\u2019s Agenda symposium in Washington, Clinton excoriated Trump for spreading the birther gospel. \u201cFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\u201d she said. \u201cHis campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.</p> <p>\u201cHe is feeding into the worst impulses, the bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country.

And that is what I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands. They include religious freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of political prisoners. Am I right?\u201d</p> <p>Trump also addressed problems in Venezuela, which he said had been \u201crun into the ground\u201d by socialists. Appealing specifically to the sizable Venezuelan community in and around the neighborhood of Doral, home of his Trump Doral golf resort, he said: \u201cMiami is full of hard-working Venezuelans.

After millennia of pharaohs, emperors, kings, queens, sultans, caesars and czars, with all their attendant aristocracies and locked-down social structures, a country was founded where birth and lineage didn\u2019t matter so much, where by application of your talents, energy, labor and willingness to play by the rules, you could improve your material lot in life and achieve a measure of economic security for yourself and your family. Peasants and proles could aspire to more than mere survival. Radical!</p> <p> We know it today as the American Dream. The now-obscure historian James Truslow Adams coined the term in his book The Epic of America, defining \u201cthe American dream\u201d as:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>a dream of a social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.</p> </blockquote> <p> Adams was writing in 1931, but the dream was there from the start, in Jefferson\u2019s \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d formulation in the Declaration of Independence, \u201chappiness\u201d residing in its 18th-century sense of prosperity, thriving, wellbeing. </p> <p>Nobody ever came to America with a starry-eyed dream of working for starvation wages. Plenty of that available in the old country, and that\u2019s precisely why we left, escaping serfdom, peonage, tenancy, indenture \u2013 all different iterations of what was essentially a \u201crigged system\u201d, to put it in current political verbiage \u2013 that channeled the profits of our labor upstream to the Man. We came to America to do better, to secure for ourselves the liberation that economic security brings, and for millions \u2013 mostly white males at first, and then slowly, sputteringly, women and people of color \u2013 that\u2019s the way it worked out, nothing less than a revolution in the human condition.</p> <p> Upward mobility is indispensable to the American Dream, the notion that people can rise from working to middle class, and middle to upper and even higher on the model of a (fictional) Horatio Alger or an (actual) Andrew Carnegie. Upward mobility across classes peaked in the US in the late 19th century. Most of the gains of the 20th century were achieved en masse; it wasn\u2019t so much a phenomenon of great numbers of people rising from one class to the next as it was standards of living rising sharply for all classes. You didn\u2019t have to be exceptional to rise. Opportunity was sufficiently broad that hard work and steadiness would do, along with tacit buy-in to the social contract, allegiance to the system proceeding on the assumption that the system was basically fair. </p> <p>The biggest gains occurred in the post-second world war era of the GI Bill, affordable higher education, strong labor unions, and a progressive tax code. Between the late 1940s and early 1970s, median household income in the US doubled. Income inequality reached historic lows. The average CEO salary was approximately 30 times that of the lowest-paid employee, compared with today\u2019s gold-plated multiple of 370. The top tax bracket ranged in the neighborhood of 70% to 90%. Granted, there were far fewer billionaires in those days. Somehow the nation survived.</p> <p> \u201cAmerica is a dream of greater justice and opportunity for the average man and, if we can not obtain it, all our other achievements amount to nothing.\u201d So wrote Eleanor Roosevelt in her syndicated column of 6 January 1941, an apt lead-in to her husband\u2019s State of the Union address later that day in which he enumerated the four freedoms essential to American democracy, among them \u201cfreedom from want\u201d. In his State of the Union address three years later, FDR expanded on this concept of freedom from want with his proposal for a \u201cSecond Bill of Rights\u201d, an \u201ceconomic\u201d bill of rights to counteract what he viewed as the growing tyranny of the modern economic order:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This Republic had at its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights \u2013 among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship \u2026 As our nation has grown in size and stature, however \u2013 as our industrial economy has expanded \u2013 these political rights have proved inadequate to assure us equality. We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.</p> </blockquote> <p> Political rights notwithstanding, \u201cfreedom\u201d rings awfully hollow when you\u2019re getting nickel-and-dimed to death in your everyday life. The Roosevelts recognized that wage peonage, or any system that inclines toward subsistence level, is simply incompatible with self-determination. Subsistence is, by definition, a constrained, desperate state; one\u2019s horizon is necessarily limited to the present day, to getting enough of what the body needs to make it to the next. These days a minimum wage worker in New York City clocking 40 hours a week (at $9 per hour) earns $18,720 a year, well under the Federal Poverty Line of $21,775. That\u2019s a scrambling, anxious existence, narrowly bounded. Close to impossible to decently feed, clothe, and shelter yourself on a wage like that, much less a family; much less buy health insurance, or save for your kid\u2019s college, or participate in any of those other good American things. Down at peon level, the pursuit of happiness sounds like a bad joke. \u201cIt\u2019s called the American dream,\u201d George Carlin cracked, \u201cbecause you have to be asleep to believe it.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cNecessitous men are not free men,\u201d said FDR in that 1944 State of the Union speech. \u201cPeople who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.\u201d A dire statement, demonstrably true, and especially unsettling in 2016, a point in time when the American Dream seems more viable as nostalgia than a lived phenomenon. Income inequality, wealth distribution, mortality rates: by every measure, the average individual that Eleanor Roosevelt celebrated is sinking. Exceptional people continue to rise, but overall mobility is stagnant at best. If you\u2019re born poor in Ferguson or Appalachia, chances are you\u2019re going to stay that way. Ditto if your early memories include the swimming pool at the Houston Country Club or ski lessons at Deer Valley, you\u2019re likely going to keep your perch at the top of the heap.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>That we should allow for wildly divergent opportunities due to accidents of birth ought to strike us as a crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Income inequality, gross disparities in wealth: we\u2019re told daily, incessantly, that these are the necessary consequences of a free market, as if the market was a force of nature on the order of weather or tides, and not the entirely manmade construct that it is. In light of recent history, blind acceptance of this sort of economics would seem to require a firm commitment to stupidity, but let\u2019s assume for the moment that it\u2019s true, that the free market exists as a universe unto itself, as immutable in its workings as the laws of physics. Does that universe include some ironclad rule that requires inequality of opportunity? I\u2019ve yet to hear the case for that, though doubtless some enterprising thinktanker could manufacture one out of this same free-market economics, along with whiffs of genetic determinism as it relates to qualities of discipline and character. And it would be bogus, that case. And more than that, immoral. That we should allow for wildly divergent opportunities due to accidents of birth ought to strike us as a crime equal in violence to child abuse or molestation.</p> <p> Franklin Roosevelt: \u201c[F]reedom is no half-and-half affair. If the average citizen is guaranteed equal opportunity in the polling place, he must have equal opportunity in the market place.\u201d The proposition goes deeper than sentiment, deeper than policy, deeper even than adherence to equality and \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d as set forth in the Declaration. It cuts all the way to the nature of democracy, and to the prospects for its continued existence in America. \u201cWe may have democracy in this country,\u201d wrote supreme court justice Louis Brandeis, \u201cor we may have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d Those few, in Brandeis\u2019s judgment, would inevitably use their power to subvert the free will of the majority; the super-rich as a class simply couldn\u2019t be trusted to do otherwise, a thesis that\u2019s being starkly acted out in the current era of Citizens United, Super Pacs, and truckloads of dark money.</p> <p> But the case for economic equality goes beyond even equations of power politics. Democracy\u2019s premise rests on the notion that the collective wisdom of the majority will prove right more often than it\u2019s wrong. That given sufficient opportunity in the pursuit of happiness, your population will develop its talents, its intellect, its better judgment; that over time its capacity for discernment and self-correction will be enlarged. Life will improve. The form of your union will be more perfect, to borrow a phrase. But if a critical mass of your population is kept in peonage? All its vitality spent in the trenches of day-to-day survival, with scant opportunity to develop the full range of its faculties? Then how much poorer the prospects for your democracy will be.</p> <p> Economic equality can no more be divorced from the functioning of democracy than the ballot. Jefferson, Brandeis, the Roosevelts all recognized this home truth. The American Dream has to be the lived reality of the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">not just a pretty story</a> we tell ourselves.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have always gotten much more publicity than anybody else.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Donald Trump</em></p> <p> Then there\u2019s that other American dream, the numbed-out, dumbed-down, make-believe world where much of the national consciousness resides, the sum product of our mighty Fantasy Industrial Complex: movies, TV, internet, texts, tweets, ad saturation, celebrity obsession, sports obsession, Amazonian sewers of porn and political bullshit, the entire onslaught of media and messaging that strives to separate us from our brains. September 11, 2001 blasted us out of that dream for about two minutes, but the dream is so elastic, so all-encompassing, that 9/11 was quickly absorbed into the the matrix of FIC.

How else to explain Trump, a billionaire on an ego trip <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/republican-party-donald-trump-madman-in-his-castle\">capturing a major party\u2019s nomination</a> for president? Another blunt-speaking billionaire tried twice for the presidency in the 1990s and went out in flames, but he made the mistake of running as himself, a recognizably flesh-and-blood human being, whereas Trump comes to us as the ultimate creature, and indisputable maestro, of the Fantasy Industrial Complex. For much of his career \u2013 until 2004, to be exact \u2013 he held status in our lives as a more or less normal celebrity. Larger than life, to be sure, cartoonishly grandiose, shamelessly self-promoting, and reliably obnoxious, but Trump didn\u2019t become Trump until \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d debuted in January 2004. The first episode drew 20.7 million viewers. By comparison, Ross Perot received 19,742,000 votes in the 1992 presidential election \u2013 yes, I\u2019m comparing vote totals with Nielsen ratings \u2013 but Trump kept drawing that robust 20 million week after week. The season finale that year reached 28 million viewers, and over the next decade, for 13 more seasons, this was how America came to know him, in that weirdly intimate way TV has of delivering celebrity into the very center of our lives.</p> <p> It was this same Trump that 24 million viewers \u2013 a record, of course \u2013 tuned in to watch at the first Republican debate last year, the glowering, blustering, swaggering boardroom action figure who gave every promise of shredding the pols. One wonders if Trump would have ever been Trump if there hadn\u2019t been a JR Ewing to pave the way, to show just how dear and real a dealmaking TV rogue could be to our hearts. Trump\u2019s performance on that night did not disappoint, nor through all the debates in the long march that followed, and if his regard for the truth has proved more erratic even than that of professional politicians, we should expect as much. In the realm of the Fantasy Industrial Complex, reality happens on a sliding scale. The truth is just another possibility.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I speak the password primeval.</p> <p>I would give the sign of democracy;</p> <p>By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass</em></p> <p> In nine days Trump and Hillary will take the stage for their first face-to-face debate. There will be blood. The knives are going to be out, and the ratings are bound to be, need it be said, yuge. The American Dream will no doubt be invoked from both podiums, for what true-blue patriot was ever against the American Dream? And yet for the past 30 years the Democratic candidate has worked comfortably within a party establishment that\u2019s battered the working and middle classes down to the bone. The \u201cnew\u201d Democrats of the Clinton era are always strong for political rights, as long as they don\u2019t upset corporate America\u2019s bottom line. Strong for racial and gender equality, strong for LGBT rights (though that took time). Meanwhile this same Democratic establishment joined with the GOP to push a market- and finance-driven economic order that enriches the already rich and leaves the rest of us sucking wind.</p> <p> That\u2019s the very real anger Trump is speaking to, no fantasy there. Bernie as well; small wonder their constituencies overlapped, though Trump\u2019s professed devotion to the common man stumbles over even the simplest proofs. On whether to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, Trump\u2019s moral compass has spun from an implied no (wages are already \u201ctoo high\u201d), to implied yes (wages are \u201ctoo low\u201d), to weasel words (leave it up to the states), to yes and no in the same breath (\u201cI would leave it and raise it somewhat\u201d), and, finally, when pressed by Bill O\u2019Reilly in July, to yes-but (raise it to $10, but it\u2019s still best left to the states). All this from the candidate who\u2019s firmly in favor of abolishing the estate tax, to the great benefit of heirs of multimillionaires and none at all to the vast majority of us.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the Fantasy Industrial Complex is doing just fine this election season, thank you. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley investors\u2019 conference in March, one of the commanders of the FIC, Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS and a man whose 2015 compensation totaled $56.8m, had this to say about the Trump campaign. \u201cIt may not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS. The money\u2019s rolling in and this is fun \u2026 this [is] going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It\u2019s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.\u201d</p>",

The administration official said there might be more steps to come before Obama leaves office in January.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a whole lot of other steps the administration is looking at, and right now it is an open book as to what will be decided,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Nuclear disarmament was one of the signature ambitions of Obama\u2019s first months in office. In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered\">speech in Prague in April 2009</a>, he pledged US commitment \u201cto seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\u201d. However, he approaches the end of his eight years in office having made <a href=\"https://fas.org/blogs/security/2016/05/hiroshima-stockpile/\">fewer reductions</a> to the US arsenal than any president since the end of the cold war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He has good a record on the nuclear issue but it probably falls short of his own hopes for progress</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Einhorn, former state adviser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, part of the price of persuading the Senate to accept the New Start Treaty was agreeing to a modernisation programme of air, land and sea delivery systems, as well as warheads, that is expected to bring the cost of the US deterrent to $1tn over 30 years. </p> <p>Robert Einhorn, the state department\u2019s special adviser on non-proliferation and disarmament from 2009-13, argues that Obama did the best he could in difficult circumstances. </p> <p>\u201cHe has good a record on the nuclear issue but it probably falls short of his own hopes for progress,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/robert-einhorn/\">Einhorn</a>, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe was operating in an environment that was not at all conducive. Unfortunately the whole Prague agenda has become so politicised there is little room for manoeuvre and you have an international climate that is not terribly conducive.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe US has been prepared to reduce our deployed stockpile a third below New Start. Russia has said it has zero interest.\u201d</p> <p>Disarmament advocates like <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/about/dkimball\">Daryl Kimball</a>, executive director of the Arms Control Association, say unfavourable circumstances at home and abroad are only a partial excuse. </p> <p>\u201cObama has missed multiple opportunities to realise lasting change in nuclear weapons policy,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cHe has adjusted but not transformed the issue. Part of that is a failure of leadership and imagination. He now has a disappointing legacy.\u201d</p> <p> However, Kimball said it was not too late to improve that legacy, even in the last months of the Obama presidency.</p> <p>The most far-reaching option still under active consideration is a one-third cut to the US deployed strategic arsenal, from the 1,550 warheads agreed with Moscow in the New Start Treaty to just over 1,000. Obama offered to make the reduction in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/19/remarks-president-obama-brandenburg-gate-berlin-germany\">2013 speech in Berlin</a>, on condition Russia did the same. But Vladimir Putin has shown little interest in disarmament, instead emphasising his country\u2019s nuclear might.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What Obama could and should do now is act on our own determination on what it is that we need</p> <footer> <cite>Daryl Kimball, Arms Control Association</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Berlin offer was based on a US assessment that it could reduce its nuclear missile arsenal by a third and still \u201cmaintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent\u201d. On the basis of that assessment, disarmers inside and outside the administration have argued that Washington should make the cut unilaterally for cost-saving reasons and to make a more convincing argument to non-weapons states that the US is sticking to its side of the bargain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. </p> <p>\u201cWhat Obama could and should do now is act on our own determination on what it is that we need, and that we\u2019re not going to tie our budget decisions and arsenal to Russia\u2019s decisions,\u201d Kimball said, pointing out that both presidents Bush made unilateral reductions to US nuclear force levels without being blocked by Congress. However, the current Obama proposal is strongly opposed by the Department of Defense, which is concerned it would send a message of weakness to Moscow. </p> <p>\u201cThere would have been a small chance of that before, but what happened in Crimea and the Donbass wiped that off the table,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/steven-pifer/\">Steven Pifer</a>, a former senior state department official deeply involved in past relations with Moscow and arms control. </p> <p>More politically palatable options on the table are a reduction to the \u201chedge\u201d stockpile of <a href=\"https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/\">more than 2,500 reserve</a> warheads and military stores of hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) held for the production of future warheads. Both are widely considered being surplus to requirements.</p> <p>In a 2013 Nuclear Employment Strategy document, it was decided that the warheads held in reserve as a hedge against technical failures in deployed weapons could also serve as a hedge against geopolitical surprises, rather than having two separate reserves. However, the consequent cut to the stockpile has not yet been made.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a chance they will announce a reduction of the hedge,\u201d said <a href=\"https://fas.org/expert/hans-kristensen/\">Hans Kristensen</a>, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. \u201cBut they would in any case not cut the whole hedge, perhaps about 50% of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/faculty-staff/zia-mian/\">Zia Mian</a>, from the programme on science and global security at Princeton University, said fissile material stocks could also be cut. They are now believed to constitute 243 tons of HEU and 38 tons of plutonium.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf say, a typical US warhead has 25kg of HEU and 4kg of plutnium, then if the US were to reduce to 1,000 operational warheads (as Obama says they can) and say 1,000 reserve warheads, it would need only 50 tons of HEU and eight tons of plutonium for its nuclear arsenal and the rest could be declared excess,\u201d Mian said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/13/us-nuclear-bombers-fly-over-korean-peninsula-in-joint-exercises-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z8v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714283\"            data-video-name=\"US nuclear bombers fly over Korean peninsula in joint exercises \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7b3a6e4b08465d45001da\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/13/us-nuclear-bombers-fly-over-korean-peninsula-in-joint-exercises-video\">US nuclear bombers fly over Korean peninsula in joint exercises</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A further option known to be under consideration would be delaying some of the ambitious nuclear modernisation programmes that are still in their very early stages. A planned air force fleet of nuclear-capable B-21 stealth bombers <a href=\"http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=2299\">is priced at $80bn</a>, while proposed nuclear long-range stand-off cruise missiles are estimated to cost $30bn. </p> <p>Critics have said it is unclear how such weapons <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USNuclearModernization\">will be funded</a> when the major expenditure is due in the 2020s, and that each makes the other redundant. The cruise missiles have been described as potentially destabilising because they can be launched without warning and are impossible to distinguish from their conventional counterparts. </p> <p>\u201cIf you now have the B-21 coming online able to penetrate enemy defences, why do you need a cruise missile, and if the B-21 is not going to penetrate, why is it being developed? The military is asking for things it may not need,\u201d Pifer said. </p> <p>\u201cI would like to see them cancel the cruise missile. It would be a useful change, but I just can\u2019t see them doing it in the last few months of the administration.\u201d </p> <p>Even staunch arms control advocates such as <a href=\"http://www.ploughshares.org/about-us/staff-board/joseph-cirincione\">Joseph Cirincione</a> of the Ploughshares Fund said the administration may have left it too late to make meaningful changes.</p> <p>\u201cThey took their eye off the ball,\u201d Cirincione said. \u201cIf last year they wanted to do some of these things, it would have been easier. Now it\u2019s not outside elements that are the only problem, but the politics during the presidential election. I would be surprised if they did anything controversial.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Presidential campaigns drain away life in many ways. When Bernie Sanders finally returned home to Vermont this summer, after 15 months flying the country in search of the Democratic nomination, a long-abandoned family car had to be jump-started by his wife, Jane.

When Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">fell ill last Sunday</a>, at a memorial for 9/11 victims in New York, she was on day 518 of an almost non-stop campaign. Despite all predictions of a \u201ccoronation\u201d, that campaign has segued seamlessly from a tougher-than-expected primary fight against Sanders to a battle against Donald Trump that she calls \u201cthe most consequential vote of our lifetimes\u201d.</p> <p>Although Clinton, a former globe-trotting secretary of state, claims a four-day rest has cured the allergy-induced pneumonia which caused her legs to buckle, she remains on a 10-day course of the antibiotic Levaquin and faces more than 5,000 miles of travel and debate prep in the next week alone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances,\u201d Clinton confided to students on Thursday, as campaign aides watched nervously from the sidelines of a rally in North Carolina. \u201cBut with just two months to go until election day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>One challenge is that many more states are in play than usual. In 1960, Richard Nixon was deemed foolish for promising to visit all 50. Since then, candidates have tended to concentrate on a handful of genuinely competitive battlegrounds \u2013 with just brief fundraising forays to rich coastal donors to interrupt an otherwise intense focus on Middle America\u2019s swing voters.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s appeal to blue-collar Democrats (and rejection by more educated Republicans) has added places like Michigan and Arizona to the list that may determine who gets to sit in the Oval Office. Opinion polls suggest the national race is on a knife-edge.</p> <p>The vast distances of a politically-fractured US are exacerbated by a desire among both candidates to head home to New York each night, to sleep in their own beds wherever possible. Though Clinton has a house in Washington DC, she prefers to point her Boeing 737 toward the leafy suburb of Chappaqua, then return to nearby Westchester airport each morning.</p> <p>Even Trump, whose Boeing 757-200 is configured for just 43 passengers and has a silk-lined master bedroom to go with his gold taps, favours leaving \u201cTrump Force One\u201d at Teterboro airport in New Jersey and sleeping in his Manhattan tower.</p> <p>Neither campaign jet can match the logistical polish provided to the victor. The president\u2019s fleet of planes and helicopters provides a near frictionless ability to stroll from the Resolute desk and be in the air, surrounded by an array of modern communications, within minutes. Aboard Air Force One, there is a Zen-like calm that feels very different to the chaos of a campaign plane.</p> <p>While Trump occasionally shows off by buzzing crowds with his helicopter, the reality of daily commuting for both candidates is a cumbersome secret service convoy shuttling them from private airport terminals to college gymnasiums and conference arenas, a nauseating blur of identikit rallies.</p> <p>One handicap they do increasingly share with the commander-in-chief is the almost constant presence of cameras. Faced with criticism about hiding from the press, both candidates recently agreed to let journalists travel on their planes.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s enlarged jet was quickly littered with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-plane.html?_r=0\">banana peels, monogramed cocktail napkins and power cords</a>; Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">white leather chairs and polished woodwork were marred</a> by the sight of reporters shuttling back and forth to a separate cabin, because they could not sit on the floor during take-off.</p> <p>This is the real reason why both candidates add to grueling itineraries by flying back to the east coast most nights. Even though, or perhaps because, they are surrounded by dozens of burly secret service agents at all times, there is a little privacy on the trail.</p> <p>Hotel floors tend to be block-booked, but that only increases the difficulty of avoiding awkward encounters with staff. Though Clinton hid her pneumonia from all but the closest of confidants, a slew of others inside the bubble later revealed that they too had been hit by an epidemic of exhaustion-related viruses.</p> <p>Explaining her reluctance to allow a \u201cprotective pool\u201d \u2013 reporters who follow candidates and presidents wherever they go \u2013 Clinton told aides she wanted to preserve the ability to \u201cgo out for ice cream in the middle of the night\u201d without scrambling the press vans.</p> <p>Yet spontaneity is an undoubted casualty of life already. \u201cLike a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details,\u201d Clinton said on Thursday. \u201cFrom now until 8 November, everywhere I go, I\u2019m going to talk about my ideas for our country\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/clinton-taco-truck-delicious-donald-trump-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53ahx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724004\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: 'A taco truck on every corner sounds delicious' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc017ce4b0df02df202e3f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916clintontaco_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572819&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572819&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/clinton-taco-truck-delicious-donald-trump-video\">Hillary Clinton: \u2018A taco truck on every corner sounds delicious\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A vast army of \u201cadvance\u201d staff is expected to co-ordinate every detail of candidates\u2019 public appearances, in case something goes wrong in an election so tight.

  "<p>At 11.41am on Friday, Herman Mashaba, the new mayor of Johannesburg, sent an email to all the top officials of South Africa\u2019s sprawling, chaotic commercial capital.</p> <p>The tycoon, who took office in the city of 5 million people less than a month ago, ordered more visible policing, a clean-up campaign, repairs to roads and a dedicated civil servant to liaise with private property developers.</p> <p>\u201cIn the next few days, not weeks, you will see some big improvements in the city,\u201d the new mayor told the Guardian 20 minutes later during an interview in his downtown office.</p> <p>Such measures are hardly controversial. But Mashaba, a political novice who recently published a semi-autobiographical book called Capitalist Crusader and inveighed against a \u201cculture of dependency\u201d in South Africa, has much more ambitious plans. He wants to see a transformation of Johannesburg, and the country too, in line with his own unapologetically rightwing principles.</p> <p>\u201cI am against government trying to solve everything,\u201d Mashaba, 57, said. \u201cSociety deserves less government \u2026 As a democrat and a libertarian, I believe in freedom for everyone \u2026 I want human beings not to depend on government \u2026 As long as we don\u2019t adopt freedom policies we are not going to succeed.

With the support of the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters, it was enough to oust the ANC from city hall for the first time in the post-apartheid era. In its place came the DA, which has run Cape Town for a decade and has been branded a white, elitist movement by opponents, with politicians like Mashaba accused of being sellouts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/anc-elections-south-africa-democracy-zuma\">South Africa has broken the post-colonial narrative.

He also wants to do away with any mention of race \u2026 saying that he does not want to still be classified as a black man by government.\u201d </p> <p>Talking to the Guardian, Mashaba accused the ANC, which has ruled South Africa for 22 years, of \u201cusing race to divide the nation\u201d and said he has deep reservations about its flagship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/31/southafrica-small-business\">affirmative action legislation</a>. <br></p> <p>He also described the imposition of a minimum wage on employers as \u201can evil system to deny poor uneducated people the opportunity to advance\u201d.</p> <p>Yet such rhetoric resonates with a much broader constituency than many believe, said Anthony Butler, professor of politics at the University of Cape Town.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a much stronger pro-commerce sentiment and stronger anti-welfare state sentiment among many black South Africans than many outsiders realise. The ANC talk a kind of quasi-Marxist language but in fact the country has had a black commercial class for a century and a half ... There is no stigma attached to being a successful businessman or arguing that people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps,\u201d Butler said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/search-successor-public-protector-thuli-madonsela-south-africa\">Search for successor to revered public protector grips South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Few doubt the challenges facing the new mayor.

How can you justify not having the budget to give dignity to our fellow citizens and building cycle lanes in [wealthy areas]?\u201d Mashaba said.</p> <p>But Johannesburg also has a booming creative scene, world-class museums, an increasing number of tourist visits and steady investment from overseas.</p> <p>Mashaba said his message to the city was simple: if he didn\u2019t deliver, he should be fired. \u201cThis was the last job in the world I needed [but] I couldn\u2019t just sit by and watch the ANC destroy my country \u2026 Johannesburg is the foundation of this country. If Johannesburg works, South Africa works. I want to turn this city into a construction site. It is just a matter of political will.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Australia will seek out alternative free trade agreements in the region should the Trans-Pacific Partnership fail to pass a US Congress vote, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has said.</p> <p>Bishop made the comments while addressing reporters in Washington, where she has met representatives for US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
