  "<p>It gets to the point with Donald Trump where you think: why am I even shocked any more? The non-payment of taxes, the Mexican wall, the endless lies, the relentless sexist and racist torrent\u2026</p> <p>And yet, the latest revelation of his boorishness is shocking, maybe more so, because this time it isn\u2019t just hearsay or \u201che said/she said\u201d. It\u2019s a recording, a recording that is more than a decade old, but a recording nonetheless. Trump is with Billy Bush, a television host (Bush laughing along, it should be noted). As well as talking about a married woman he tried to seduce and commenting on a TV actress\u2019s appearance, Trump talks about how women allow \u201cstars\u201d (like him) to do anything they want. \u201cGrab them by the pussy,\u201d says Trump. \u201cYou can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Now Trump is claiming that it was locker-room talk, the tape is a decade old and (his clincher) Bill Clinton has said far worse to him on the golf course. It\u2019s the same old squirm/weasel/distract Trump routine, but this time it seems that even Republicans have had enough and who could blame them? \u201cGrab them by the pussy\u201d \u2013 how could <em>that</em> guy become president of the United States?</p> <p>There was a time when I felt slightly conflicted by Trump. I used to watch his US version of <em>The Apprentice</em> and it was notable how much respect he had for a female executive who helped him, and also for his daughter Ivanka.</p> <p>The fact that Trump had daughters also tapped into my notion that, for some men, daughters can be enlightening, an \u201ceducation\u201d if you will \u2013 fast-tracking insights into the female experience. This could also happen via other females (wives, girlfriends, mothers, sisters, friends), but there\u2019s just something about daughters that men have raised and nurtured.</p> <p>While a father can love a boy just as fiercely and completely, with girls, there may be the added sting of knowing what\u2019s in store for them out there in the \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d. How many men have said to grown daughters: \u201cI know how men think\u201d, when what they\u2019re really saying is: \u201cI know how I used to think \u2013 and I want you to be spared that\u201d?</p> <p>However, even if Trump had this education, he failed the test \u2013 flunked it, big time. Donald is a classic compartmentaliser of women, someone for whom the age-old Madonna/whore routine is in full swing. A textbook case of: \u201cWomen I love, like, respect or am related to, up here; the rest of you, down there\u2026 And, If I want to, I\u2019ll grab your pussy.\u201d</p> <p>As if this male entitlement weren\u2019t grotty enough, Trump stirs star-power into the mix. It\u2019s telling and chilling, especially in these post-Savile times, how hyper-aware Trump is of how celebrity gives him levels of leeway, opportunity and access he wouldn\u2019t otherwise enjoy.</p> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t even bother pretending that he can take these liberties because he\u2019s so personable and charismatic. In his mind, his celebrity gives him a free pass to opportunism, lechery and boorishness and he\u2019s going to use it.</p> <p>All this considered, it\u2019s farcical how Trump tries to get himself out of his self-dug hole by dragging Bill Clinton into it. Whatever people think of Clinton\u2019s behaviour, there\u2019s a big difference between a \u201cshagger\u201d (even a lying, cheating, manipulative one) and the near-reptilian, calculated and, above all, dehumanising contempt for women that Trump exhibits on that recording.</p> <p>Even if you think that Bill was just as bad (on the golf course with Trump, and everywhere else), let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s Hillary, not Bill, who\u2019s running for the presidency now.</p> <p>The fact that Trump still doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend that, to the point of bringing up Clinton\u2019s husband at every opportunity he can, even to create a diversion for his own grubby behaviour, is all anyone needs to know about the deep-rooted misogyny of Republican presidential candidate, Donald John Trump.</p> <h2>It\u2019s my party, I\u2019ll leave if I want to...</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92eaff83abf3afc77d351c9b96f16ba0c3ab32fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92eaff83abf3afc77d351c9b96f16ba0c3ab32fe/328_473_4057_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Please, Jeremy, let me leave Labour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Please, Jeremy, let me leave Labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew MacColl/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have written before about leaving the Labour party. Now it seems this must be amended to: \u201cPlease God, let me leave the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure whether people realise how tricky it is to leave. It\u2019s not just about stopping payments; you must also resign in writing. Otherwise you could remain counted as a member, which happened to me.</p> <p>I stopped paying when Jeremy Corbyn was first elected as leader, but I still received Labour emails. Months later, when the next leadership election loomed, I checked and I was still a member; I just had to pay the overdue subs (I was quite pleased because it meant I could vote).</p> <p>After the second Corbyn victory, I finally, with some difficulty, found out how to leave properly (there\u2019s nothing on the Labour website) and duly sent off my Disgusted of south-west London missive.</p> <p>Since then, I\u2019ve received yet more Labour emails; the latest one said they were giving me more time to \u201creconsider\u201d. Reconsider what?</p> <p>Is the next stage sobbing down the phone at me? It feels as though I\u2019m trying to shake off a bad, clingy boyfriend.</p> <p>Yet this is significant. After Corbyn\u2019s victory, many people revoked their memberships, some posting photos of their cut-up Labour cards on social media.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I leave the Labour party?\u201d was the most popular Labour-related term on Google. I\u2019m now wondering whether everybody who \u201cleft\u201d realised about putting it in writing.</p> <p>I\u2019m also wondering what the true Labour figures are \u2013 whether they\u2019re being artificially inflated by people who, like me, unwittingly remained members. A huge fuss has been made of those membership numbers and the mandate they give to Corbyn. At least they should be accurate, right?</p> <h2>Have we reached peak indifference to the Stones?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68d1883f1b838d17b5b785f8723f6c2aacbe2ddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d1883f1b838d17b5b785f8723f6c2aacbe2ddb/0_126_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks for the memories, Mick, but enough is enough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thanks for the memories, Mick, but enough is enough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rolling Stones\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/rolling-stones-announce-new-album-blue-and-lonesome\"><em>Blue &amp; Lonesome</em>, a covers album</a>, and their first studio outing in a decade, comes out in December, just in time for yon Christmas market. If you listen hard, you can hear the sound of millions of people not caring very much, including the vast majority of Stones fans. If this new album \u2013 done and dusted within three days; don\u2019t put yourselves out, gentlemen \u2013 appeals to anyone bar obsessed Stones completists, I\u2019d be delighted for them, but also amazed.</p> <p>The Stones have long been a heritage touring act, albeit a very high-grade, cherished one. Long before the record industry imploded, their value lay in performing live for nostalgia junkies. This is not to criticise the Stones (what band wouldn\u2019t kill for their back catalogue or live global appeal?) and maybe the new album is brilliant.</p> <p>However, hearing about it reminds me of the perennial muso-interview cliche that drove me bonkers as a music journalist but suddenly seems rather poignant. As in: \u201cWe make music for ourselves \u2013 if anyone else likes it, it\u2019s a bonus.\u201d</p> <p>The Christmas market aside, these days, the Stones probably are just making music for themselves.</p>",
  "<p>The winner of this year\u2019s Nobel peace prize was, for reasons of time difference, still asleep when the honour was announced on Friday morning \u2013 it was the middle of the night in Colombia, where Juan Manuel Santos is president. According to Norwegian television, his staff are so loyal they refused to awake him.</p> <p>The award to Santos was remarkable, mostly for its timing, in a different way. It came just days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/colombia-referendum-rejects-peace-deal-with-farc\">Colombians had voted to reject a peace deal</a> that his government had secured after four years\u2019 negotiation with the Farc guerrilla group.</p> <p>The Nobel committee made it clear that the award was didactic: given to someone who had failed to secure peace so far, but in the hope that he might succeed. The committee said: \u201cThe referendum was not a vote for or against peace. What the No side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The plebiscite last Sunday was supposed to bring an end to the world\u2019s longest-running war, between the Colombian military and the Marxist guerrilla insurrection of Farc, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. Farc was founded in 1964 in response to an army attack on a rural enclave occupied by armed peasants affiliated to the Communist party. Farc\u2019s protest originated in the systemic concentration of agriculture in the hands of a few landowners which had continued from Spanish colonial rule into independence.</p> <p>The peace deal had been acclaimed by Pope Francis, President Obama and diplomats from around the world. Two weeks ago, it was signed in Cartagena in front of the world\u2019s media and a host of global dignitaries, only for the Colombian people to reject the accord by a margin of 0.4% of the vote.</p> <p>While Santos had received acclaim internationally, as the Nobel prize attests, he faced a much tougher battle at home. There, he had been confronted by the former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/the-biggest-obstacle-to-peace-in-colombia-may-not-be-farc-but-an-ex-president/2016/07/06/09834850-3d79-11e6-9e16-4cf01a41decb_story.html\">orchestrated the No campaign</a>. Uribe, whose father was killed by Farc during a kidnap attempt in 1983, was unrelenting in his criticism of a deal he said was too soft on the movement he characterised as \u201cterrorists and narco-traffickers\u201d.</p> <p>Santos now sends his diplomats back to Havana to try to renegotiate peace. If he can manage that he will be a worthy successor to the likes of Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev and Martin Luther King. The prize may yet help revive a stalled process that looked to be unravelling rapidly \u2013 and dangerously.</p> <p>Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n comes from one of the wealthy and weighty families that constitute a spine of continuity among Colombia\u2019s educated urban elite, <em>Colombia Permanente</em> as people say. From the beginning of the 20th century, the Santos family owned a majority stake in the country\u2019s most influential daily newspaper, <em>El Tiempo</em>, which it maintained until 2007.</p> <p>Juan Manuel was born in 1951 in the capital and family seat, Bogot\u00e1, and, after a brief spell in the navy, studied business and finance at the University of Kansas. While a representative for Colombia\u2019s coffee growers at the International Coffee Federation in London, he completed a master\u2019s at the LSE, then another at Harvard, before returning to become deputy director of the family newspaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d97d0cd3da79508dedda6266ca188b1a01afeed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d97d0cd3da79508dedda6266ca188b1a01afeed/0_184_4020_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvaro Uribe leaves a meeting with President Santos after the peace deal, which he had campaigned against, was rejected.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvaro Uribe leaves a meeting with President Santos after the peace deal, which he had campaigned against, was rejected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Legaria/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005, Santos founded and led the Social Party of National Unity, which sought to fix the old rupture between liberal and conservative parties that had taken Colombia to civil war from 1948 to 1958. The party promised to support Uribe\u2019s presidency, then in the middle of Plan Colombia, the US-backed onslaught against Farc.</p> <p>In 2006, Santos was appointed Uribe\u2019s minister of defence. In May 2009, Santos resigned, only to fight and win the 2010 presidential election. <br></p> <p>It was his dramatic proposal to rewrite and, if necessary, tear up the language and premise of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d that first catapulted Colombia\u2019s new president on to the world stage.</p> <p>Santos revealed his intention in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/colombia-juan-santos-war-on-drugs\">an interview with this newspaper in 2011</a>, saying: \u201cThe world needs to discuss new approaches\u2026 we are basically still thinking within the same framework as we have done for the last 40 years\u2026 A new approach should try and take away the violent profit that comes with drug trafficking\u2026 If that means legalising, and the world thinks that\u2019s the solution, I will welcome it.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next three years, Santos addressed the UN and gathered support from a coalition of South American presidents who agreed that the \u201cproducing countries\u201d \u2013 and not the \u201cconsuming countries\u201d of the west \u2013 were the ones suffering most from the violence and carnage that resulted from the war on drugs.</p> <p>Santos\u2019s intervention was, and remains, the most dramatic in challenging the west to take greater responsibility for the impact of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. As he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/16/war-drugs-colombia-un-new-approach\">explained to the <em>Observer</em></a>, for his country, drugs are \u201ca matter of national security\u201d, whereas for other consuming countries, \u201cit is mainly a health and crime issue\u201d. The price of feeding the west\u2019s appetite for drugs, along with the pressures of fighting Farc, threatened to render Colombia a \u201cfailed state\u201d in the 90s. \u201cWe have gone through a tremendous experience \u2013 dramatic and costly for a society to live through. We have lost our best judges, our best politicians, our best journalists, our best policemen in this fight against drugs and the problem\u2019s still there.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the best signals that Santos was really heading for peace is that he sent acting military generals</p> <footer> <cite>Timochenko, Farc's supreme commander</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Colombia\u2019s ambassador to London, N\u00e9stor Osorio Londo\u00f1o, explained to the <em>Observer</em> how Santos\u2019s narco-traffic initiative was \u201cinextricably linked to the peace process. The accord requires a major trafficking organisation, Farc, to join the Colombian army to eradicate coca-growing. This is historic, Santos\u2019s way of saying to the world, \u2018We\u2019re doing our bit, now you do yours.\u2019\u201d The history of that peace process has come to define the Santos presidency, lose him the plebiscite, but now win the Nobel prize.</p> <p>It began with Santos instructing his former closest aide at the defence ministry,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/colombia-end-in-sight-longest-running-conflict\"> Sergio Jaramillo</a>, to conduct what Jaramillo described to the <em>Observer </em>as \u201csecret talks about talks about talks\u201d, with Farc as far back as 2011.</p> <p>The crucial difference between this and many previously failed attempts at peace was that Santos agreed that senior Colombian military officials would attend the peace negotiations. Farc\u2019s commanders have told the <em>Observer</em> how crucial this was: \u201cOne of the best signals that we received, that Santos was really heading for peace, is that he sent active military generals to talk peace. That was something we had always requested in previous peace talks \u2013 but never got,\u201d said Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Timole\u00f3n Jimenez, known as Timochenko.</p> <p>At the core of the peace deal was a pledge by Farc to surrender their weapons and take part in elective politics and for the government to enact major land reforms. Farc leaders could avoid harsh prison sentences by admitting their guilt and offering compensation to victims. It was a huge gamble and seemed until last weekend to have paid off. But at the heart of the campaign was a personal battle between Santos and his former mentor Uribe.</p> <p>They could not be more different: Santos urban and urbane, Uribe from a cattle-ranching family, flamboyant, with a populist touch. From the start of the peace process, Uribe, mostly through Twitter, had launched a vicious campaign against Santos and the peace process. The great Colombian writer H\u00e9ctor Abad wrote after the vote that between Santos and Uribe there exists \u201ca personal affair, too personal, of pure vanity. Peace, yes, but signed by me\u201d. Abad now tells the <em>Observer</em>, in rage at Uribe\u2019s campaign: \u201cUribe said that \u2018Santos was a Farc infiltrator in my government\u2019. They put his photo on big hoardings all around the country surrounded by Timochenko, [Cuban leader Raul] Castro and [Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro. It was awful\u2026 The Nobel prize gives us new life, not only Santos. Now the people will understand the terrible campaign based on fear and lies.\u201d</p> <p>The No campaign manager, Juan Carlos V\u00e9lez, boasted last week, in an extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.larepublica.co/el-no-ha-sido-la-campa%C3%B1a-m%C3%A1s-barata-y-m%C3%A1s-efectiva-de-la-historia_427891\">interview in <em>La Rep\u00fablica</em></a>, that he deliberately set out to inflame public opinion and that the campaign had purposefully avoided telling the public about the real contents of the peace deal. \u201cThere were no winners last Sunday,\u201d one senior official close to the talks said. \u201cSantos lost because he thought a deal with Farc was all he needed and failed to reach other communities in Colombia, not least those who didn\u2019t vote. Farc lost because they weren\u2019t contrite early enough and Uribe lost because his was a campaign of hate and fear based on the past and not the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d93f802b61f1aa327f077e2e7e393d7290c6276f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d93f802b61f1aa327f077e2e7e393d7290c6276f/0_196_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march for peace through the streets of Medellin on the eve of the referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march for peace through the streets of Medellin on the eve of the referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Eduardo Noriega A./EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Uribe has won a chair at the next round of negotiations, from which he has been hitherto excluded. Quite where a compromise will come from is hard to see. Uribe said the agreement needs to be renegotiated while Timochenko has said Farc will not change \u201cso much as a comma\u201d.</p> <p>However, Farc and the government negotiators did release a joint statement on Friday saying: \u201cProposals for changes and clarifications that result from the process [of talks between the Santos government and so-called Uribista promoters of No] will be discussed by the government and Farc to give everyone guarantees.\u201d</p> <p>A bilateral truce has been extended but only to the end of this month. The biggest prize of all \u2013 peace for Colombia \u2013 remains tantalisingly out of reach, for now. The Nobel peace laureate who has so far taken his country to the brink of peace, but no further, must now try to stop a slide back to war.</p> <h2>THE SANTOS FILE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n 10 August 1951 in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to a political family.

The couple wanted to recruit Trump to back their American Dream festival, in which Harth oversaw a pin-up competition known as American Dream Calendar Girls. Harth described that meeting as \u201cthe highlight of our career\u201d.</p> <p>But in other ways, it was something of a lowlight: Trump took an interest in Harth immediately and began subjecting her to a steady string of unwanted sexual advances, detailed by Harth in her complaint.</p> <p>There was the initial leering in that first December meeting in Trump Tower, and the inappropriate questions after her relationship status. It continued the next night over dinner at the Plaza Hotel\u2019s Oak Room, where at a dinner with beauty pageant contestants she alleges he groped her under the table.</p> <p> It culminated in January 1993, when Harth and Houraney were visiting his Florida mansion, Mar-a-Lago, to finalize and then celebrate the beauty pageant deal with a party.</p> <p>After business concluded, Harth and Houraney were on tour of Mar-a-Lago along with a group of young pageant contestants \u2013 Trump wanted to \u201csee the quality of the girls he was sponsoring\u201d, Harth recalled \u2013 when he pulled her aside into one of the children\u2019s bedrooms.</p> <p>\u201cHe pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,\u201d Harth said, \u201cand I had to physically say: \u2018What are you doing?

It was stressful, it gave me anxiety, it definitely wounded my marriage \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the death knell, but it wounded it, it was stressful having to handle this.\u201d</p> <p>She recalled how Trump \u2013 who had just gone through a divorce from his first wife, Ivana, and was in a relationship with Marla Maples, who would become his second wife \u2013 pursued her and urged her to leave Houraney. </p> <p>\u201cTrump did everything in his power to get me to leave him. He constantly called me and said: \u2018I love you, baby, I\u2019m going to be the best lover you ever had. What are you doing with that loser, you need to be with me, you need to step it up to the big leagues.\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cHe was constantly working on me during that time and that took a toll on me.

I\u2019m a Christian, I moved on.\u201d<br></p> <h2>\u2018They tried to get me to say it never happened\u2019</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s decision to run for president brought the question to the fore for her once more. And initially, she said she was inclined to let bygones be bygones.</p> <p>She concedes she even found herself getting excited at the thought that someone she knew so well was running for president.</p> <p>A recent Trump rally she attended seemed to confirm her decision to lie low. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to say anything bad, we\u2019ve moved on, we\u2019re friendly,\u2019\u201d Harth recalled in her interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>When Trump thanked her and gave her a hug, she thought he wouldn\u2019t say anything either.</p> <p>The interaction, Harth said, reaffirmed her decision to stay quiet. That is, until she saw Trump dismiss media reports referencing her case as \u201cmeritless\u201d, or worse.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">the New York Times ran a story</a> in May this year about Trump\u2019s history with women, including an account of Harth\u2019s story, Trump\u2019s campaign even reached out to her to pressure her to take back her account, she told the Guardian on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cHis office \u2013 and I have it on my voicemails that he called, that they called \u2013 they asked me to recant everything when the New York Times article came out. They were trying to get me to say it never happened and I made it up. And I said I\u2019m not doing that,\u201d she recalled. Trump\u2019s office denied this.</p> <p>She was further upset by an interview Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka gave in the wake of the New York Times article saying her dad is \u201cnot a groper\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody was defending me, that's why I'm talking \u2026 I went through hell and I still have to relive this again</p> <footer> <cite>Jill Harth</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI understand that the girl wanted to defend her dad, being it\u2019s her dad,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what did she know?

She didn\u2019t know what her father was about, what he was doing, how he was acting.\u201d </p> <p>Such statements felt defamatory to Harth, adding insult to injury.

  "<p>The shock is that people are shocked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Donald Trump thinks he is entitled to grope women</a>, grab their crotches, to describe sexual assault as some kind of banter. Trump wears his misogyny as proudly as his hair. Feel it, he says, go on see if it\u2019s real. It\u2019s real enough. He is telling it like it is, this is how men are with women. There is no difference between truth and lies. There is only power and its constant neurotic need to reassert itself.</p> <p>His campaign is an anxiety performance. Machismo by its nature is always an exaggeration, an overcompensation. It works for losers precisely because it covers loss. Look, he says to the disempowered, white male, look at me and my phallic boasting. I will make you hard again.</p> <p>His hatred of women, his refusal of their bodily autonomy, whether over sex or reproductive rights, is not suddenly being revealed. This is his lifestyle. Now he has crossed a line apparently. Well, the line is a moveable feast when you can hint at assassinating your opponent, at the black vote being rigged, at interviewers menstruating. Multiple choice offence is his USP. Suck it up, bitches.</p> <p>And they do. Most senior Republicans have not withdrawn their endorsements. They just feel a bit queasy. Mostly because they have wives and daughters and stuff. Potential gropees. Poor men having their property tampered with. What a violation, but it\u2019s not the worst. You think I am joking? I have been to Republican rallies where the stickers read: \u201cMy wife yes, my dog maybe, my gun never.\u201d</p> <p>Hilarious!</p> <p>Now some of these guys think Trump has made unacceptable remarks. They must just mean \u201crecorded\u201d, as if saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">women are pigs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">Mexicans are rapists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/us-military-veterans-donald-trump-petition-john-mccain\">war vets are sissies</a> is just tickety-boo. They must sense and fear that Trump\u2019s strength depends on defining what is weak and negating it. Nothing then is off limits.</p> <p>The good guys are also out in force, telling us they don\u2019t speak about women like this and have never heard anything like it. They are forever respectful. Well respectfully, they should shut up and listen. I have heard men speak like this all my life. The idea that men are suddenly discovering misogyny because of Trump is somewhat strange. Where have they been?</p> <p>Trump is hardly the first entitled politico. Silvio Berlusconi and Dominque Strauss-Kahn bought the bodies of young women. Everyone at the IMF knew no woman could be alone with Strauss-Kahn. Westminster has its share of gropers and grabbers who know not what they do because they are \u201cdepressed\u201d. Men let other men off the hook or, when confronted, say they didn\u2019t realise the full extent of what was happening.</p> <p>So I would rather hear from women and they are all over Twitter telling of the first time they were sexually assaulted, some at eight, 11, 13. A brother\u2019s friend. A neighbour. A man on a bus.</p> <p>The first time is when you realise that your body is up for grabs, that the sexual pleasure taken from it does not belong to you. Sex is something that is done to you, not done by you. And if it hurts, just grow to like the pain. This is the culture I grew up in, it\u2019s the culture my daughters grow up in.</p> <p>This absolute refusal to say misogyny involves all men because it is a system by which the abuse of women acts as a guarantor of masculinity is part of the problem. Women have to modify their behaviour. Walk home that way, don\u2019t wear that, don\u2019t answer back, don\u2019t drink too much, don\u2019t post that selfie, smile before you run for your life. Believe it\u2019s not all men or your life would not be worth living.</p> <p>When one man speaks up applaud him. Here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/robert-de-niro-donald-trump-is-totally-nuts\">Robert De Niro</a> who can\u2019t take it any more. But where are the other guys who have had this tape for a while? Why, as it features Billy Bush, did they not put it out when Jeb Bush was being hammered in the primaries? Why did we need a tape to find Trump abhorrent?</p> <p>Of course some women will continue to collude with these scumbags, they will vote for Trump, they will excuse him. Women are good at excusing men. If we weren\u2019t, the human race would die out. Some women will look away, believing men can\u2019t help it and carry on humouring the \u201cbanter\u201d. You drop something in a restaurant and a guy says: \u201cWhile you are down there love\u2026\u201d and you laugh because if you didn\u2019t you might stick a fork in his eye. And you remember being 14 and being bruised from mere \u201cgroping\u201d but thinking yourself lucky because the worst didn\u2019t happen. You think about how you knew the practice of misogyny long before you heard the theory, so wonder how the good guys are slightly baffled by it.</p> <p>But now with Trump, there is evidence. On a tape. Had they not heard the stories women tell? Yes, America could still elect the man <a href=\"http://blogs.bookforum.com/review/2015/08/05/will-the-real-american-psycho-please-stand-up-why-donald-trump-was-patrick-batemans-hero/\">idolised</a> by Patrick Bateman in <em>American Psycho</em>. For misogyny is not some secret society, a form of freemasonry. It is mainstream. It is endorsed by Trump. It is not simply unacceptable, it is murderous.</p> <p>Kill it dead.</p>",
  "<p>As I watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">tape</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> joking about sexually assaulting women, there were multiple moments that disgusted me, but only one that literally turned my stomach. It wasn\u2019t when the Republican presidential nominee talked about trying to \u201cfuck\u201d a woman who wasn\u2019t interested, or made a joke about her \u201cbig phony tits\u201d. It wasn\u2019t when he said that famous men can do anything to women, even \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. The moment that literally nauseated me came later, when Trump knew he was being taped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth, woman who sued Trump over alleged sexual assault, breaks silence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Access Hollywood host Billy Bush and Trump spend a few minutes making lascivious comments about actor Arianne Zucker, they meet the woman they were just objectifying. The woman that Trump \u2013 who has just taken some Tic Tacs \u201cjust in case I start kissing her\u201d \u2013 called \u201cit\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHow about a little hug for the Donald?\u201d Bush says, smiling. He then asks for his own embrace.</p> <p>In that moment, Bush and Trump are in on a joke and Zucker is the punchline.</p> <p>It\u2019s painful to watch not just because Zucker doesn\u2019t know what was said about her, but because this is what women are afraid of. That the men we know, the men we work with \u2013 or even love \u2013 say horrible things about us. That despite assurances that they respect us and consider us equals, men are secretly winking behind our back. That we are not really people to them, but things.</p> <p>When women watch that interaction between Trump, Bush and Zucker, they\u2019ll think of the countless times they walked up to a group of jovial men in mid-conversation and felt something in the pit of their stomach. They\u2019ll wonder if their sneaking suspicion was right all along \u2013 that they were on the outside, that they were the joke.</p> <p>Trump says that this is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">locker room banter</a>\u201d. Claiming that all men talk like this behind closed doors is his way of normalizing what he did and what he said. It\u2019s a sentiment I\u2019ve heard used in Trump\u2019s defense quite a bit since yesterday. But whatever happened to \u201cnot all men\u201d?</p> <p>If we want to believe \u2013 as we should \u2013 that sexism is aberrant behavior in men, then we can\u2019t excuse what\u2019s on this tape as commonplace. Sexually assaulting women is not normal, if even if it is routine. And as familiar as that stomach-churning interaction is to women, it\u2019s also one we won\u2019t accept as our lot in life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ffv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2786643\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump's sex boasts: 'When you are a star they let you do anything' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f87665e4b0e4aaeaa8d24b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s sex boasts: \u2018When you are a star they let you do anything\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That\u2019s why Trump won\u2019t recover from this tape.

The sneaker-wearing feminist favorite Wendy Davis, the former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams and the Orange is the New Black star Lea DeLaria presented awards, while other celebrities \u2013 including comedians Sarah Silverman, Samantha Bee and Broad City\u2019s Ilana Glaser and Abbi Jacobson \u2013 appeared in recorded videos. </p> <p>The Golden Probes is just the latest project by Lady Parts Justice (LPJ), an organization created in 2012 aimed at using humor and the internet to fight for reproductive health.</p> <p>LPJ creates and posts funny political videos online, \u201cdropping information into popular culture spaces so people can swallow it in a way that\u2019s palatable, and feel outraged and motivated\u201d, said co-founder Lizz Winstead.

In Montgomery, Alabama, members worked as clinic escorts helping women pass through lines of activists and also threw clinic workers a party. In Louisville, Kentucky, they hosted a breakfast for workers and held a comedy show. And in Buffalo, New York, they delivered cupcakes to a clinic.</p> <p>Next week they\u2019re off to Fort Worth, Texas, to build a fence for an abortion clinic.</p> <p>The last few years have seen a \u201cconstant onslaught\u201d of laws aimed at restricting abortion access, with 2,000 proposed or passed in state legislatures since 2013, Winstead said. LPJ attempts to highlight the often forgotten work of the states \u2013 whether related to shutting down abortion clinics, restrictive voter ID laws or restricting bathroom access to trans people.</p> <p>\u201cMost important legislation is coming out of the states and it\u2019s happening because people don\u2019t know how all this anti-choice legislation is drafted,\u201d said Winstead.</p> <p>State politicians who make these laws \u2013 usually white, cisgender men \u2013 often run in elections with low voter turnout and little public interest, allowing them to slip under the radar. \u201cIt\u2019s not people driven by science, facts, constitutional law or even working knowledge of anatomy that are elected,\u201d noted Winstead.</p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s healthcare is compromised in order for Republican officeholders to promote their own agenda,\u201d said Davis, who founded the political organization Deeds Not Words. She noted that the Texas maternal death rate has doubled in the last five years and that women are self-inducing abortions in higher numbers. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a whirlwind of misogyny. We see it on full display in this election, but those of us who have been fighting on behalf of gender equality for this country have been seeing it every day on both local, state and national levels,\u201d Davis said.</p> <p>At the Golden Probes, Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, might have narrowly missed out on the \u201coutstanding underperformance by a politician in a leading role\u201d award (that went to Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, for claiming that the blood of innocents will need to be spilled if Hillary Clinton is elected president), but several high-profile guests said they\u2019d award their own Golden Probe to Pence\u2019s presidential running mate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say real things.

More recently, when his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with battery for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-charged-assault\">yanking Michelle Fields\u2019 arm</a> as she tried to ask questions, Trump was quick to accuse the reporter of changing her story.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/240462265680289792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ariannahuff\">@ariannahuff</a> is unattractive both inside and out.

In 2006, during an appearance on Entertainment Tonight, Trump said she was \u201cdisgusting, both inside and out. If you take a look at her, she\u2019s a slob. How does she even get on television? If I were running The View, I\u2019d fire Rosie. I\u2019d look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and say, \u2018Rosie, you\u2019re fired.\u2019 We\u2019re all a little chubby but Rosie\u2019s just worse than most of us\u201d.</p> <p>The verbal assault did not stop there, as he continued to attack her personal life and offend the LGBT community at the same time: \u201cRosie\u2019s a person who\u2019s very lucky to have her girlfriend. And she better be careful or I\u2019ll send one of my friends over to pick up her girlfriend. Why would she stay with Rosie if she had another choice?\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/307719783141498880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForeverMcIn\">@ForeverMcIn</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> how much would it take for you to make out with Rosie O&#39;Donnell?&quot; One trillion, at least!</p>&mdash; Donald J.

But then after that, not as good, right?\u201d And after the singer Cher\u2019s criticism of Mitt Romney, he promised \u201cnot to talk about your massive plastic surgeries that didn\u2019t work\u201d. </p> <p>Nor have Trump\u2019s fellow politicians and their spouses been spared from the line of fire. He questioned whether anyone would vote for Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard boss and his Republican candidate rival, stating: \u201cLook at that face \u2026 Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d</p> <p>There was a major fallout after he insulted the appearance of Heidi Cruz, a partner at Goldman Sachs bank and the wife of his leading opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz\">Ted</a>, by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/712850174838771712\">re-tweeting a supporter\u2019s split-screen image</a> featuring an unflattering picture of Heidi next to a shot of Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, a former model, from a GQ magazine photoshoot in 2000. \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words,\u201d the post said. </p> <p>On policy issues, Trump was forced into a quick retreat after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-punishment-abortion-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders\">advocating \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who had abortions</a> if the procedure became illegal. He previously supported the pro-choice lobby, but he has since said he believes individual states should be granted the right to ban the practice, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is at stake.</p> <p>Verbal indiscretions aside, perhaps what many fear most is the more serious allegations about Trump\u2019s conduct towards women. Jill Harth, a woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against the billionaire, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">spoke for the first time in July about her personal experience with him</a>. The makeup artist has accused Trump in a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/300193678/1997-Jill-Harth-Lawsuit\">lawsuit</a> of cornering and groping her in his daughter\u2019s bedroom. She told the Guardian that she stood by her charges, which her lawyers described in the lawsuit as \u201cattempted \u2018rape\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Shortly after Trump announced his bid for president it emerged that his first wife, Ivana, had alleged in testimony during their divorce that he had raped her in 1989. When the allegation resurfaced in the Daily Beast, a lawyer and aide to Trump told a reporter that the claim was moot because \u201cyou cannot rape your spouse\u201d. In a statement issued through Trump\u2019s lawyers, Ivana later said she did not want \u201crape\u201d to be \u201cinterpreted in a literal or criminal sense\u201d.</p> <p></p>",

After all, his video apology for the \u201cgroping\u201d tape included the following not-very-apologetic words: \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>This is, remember, the candidate who began one primary debate with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/04/trump-defends-his-manhood-after-rubios-small-hands-comment-video\">reference to the size of his genitalia</a>. The Trump camp, the Clinton camp and indeed anyone who feels the dignity of western politics is dangling by a thread after this year must be praying that, just for once, the shoot-without-aiming demagogue can keep his cool, however unlikely that may now seem. </p> <p>You could say this will be a good temperament test for a man who may yet take control of the nuclear arsenal. </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>And the winner is \u2026 Mike Pence! No surprise that the Republican National Committee should declare their man victorious in the vice-presidential debate this week. What did raise eyebrows, however, was the timing: the article was put online a couple of hours before the contest had even begun. </p> <p>Such premature publication is the nightmare of every newspaper obituarist. Twitter erupted and the RNC hastily took the article down, but there was no sign of an apology stating that Pence\u2019s triumph had been greatly exaggerated.</p> <p>As it happens, most watchers did declare Pence the winner once the debate had actually happened. But there was little to suggest that anyone cared. The Huffington Post called it <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-spencer/the-thrilla-in-vanilla_b_12378426.html\">\u201cthe thrilla in vanilla\u201d</a> while Politico mused that it was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/pence-kaine-debate-229169\">\u201cless a game changer than a channel changer\u201d</a>. About 37.2 million people tuned in to the nine television channels that carried it live, according to Nielsen, making this the least-watched VP duel since Dick Cheney v Joe Lieberman in 2000. The first Clinton-Trump debate got around 84 million.</p> <p>But Tuesday night\u2019s TV audience did include Walter Mondale, vice-president under Jimmy Carter. He took part in a live interaction with the New York Times website, headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/us/politics/walter-mondale-reaction.html\">\u201cMessaging With Mondale: Real-Time Reactions From an Ex-Vice President\u201d</a>.

Fox News itself, however, is in disarray this year following the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">abrupt departure of Roger Ailes</a>, the once all-powerful chairman at the centre of a sexual harassment investigation.</p> <p>The discord deepened this week when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">host Megyn Kelly complained that Trump only speaks to friendly interviewers</a> such as her colleague Sean Hannity \u201cand will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days\u201d.

Peter Wolland first came to the US from New Zealand in the late 60s as the drummer for the band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-TCEHJCd4Q\">Mary and the Maoris</a>. He quit the band in the early 70s and got his citizenship; now, he\u2019s a Trump supporter.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of all the lying that goes on in Washington,\u201d he said at a Trump rally in Reno, Nevada. For Wolland, when Trump said in last week\u2019s debate that he was being smart by not paying any federal taxes, he was \u201cjust being honest\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has \u201ca great attitude towards women\u201d, Wolland said through an impressive moustache. \u201cHe\u2019s hired more women \u2013 more people \u2013 than Hillary even knows. Some of his top executives are women.\u201d<br></p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>There is confidence in Britain, at least, that Trump won\u2019t be a kind of Brexit redux. Bookmaker William Hill says it has taken the biggest bet ever staked on either the UK general or US presidential elections: \u20ac550,000 (equating to \u00a3481,232 or $615,000 when it was struck) on Hillary Clinton becoming president, at odds of 4/11. As a result of the wager, placed by a 46-year-old woman, William Hill has shortened Clinton\u2019s odds to 1/3 (75% chance) and lengthened Donald Trump\u2019s from 9/4 to 5/2.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Gaffe</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019ve whipped out that Mexican thing again.</p> </blockquote> <p> \u2013 Mike Pence finally takes the bait during the vice-presidential debate<br></p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Zinger</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>See, I told you his hair wasn\u2019t orange!</p> </blockquote> <p> \u2013 Children in Las Vegas <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2dx5Je5\">react to Trump during his visit</a> to their school<br></p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Tweet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/783848742759829510\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump\">@IvankaTrump</a> in a city of 8 million - we meet face 2 face - i thank u 4 listening - mother 2 mother - on this new years week -  my best 2 u</p>&mdash; Rosie (@Rosie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/783848742759829510\">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p></p> <p>Rosie O\u2019Donnell on her chance meeting with arch-enemy Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka at a Manhattan restaurant.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Number</h2> <p><strong>72</strong>: times that Tim Kaine interrupted Mike Pence during the vice-presidential debate, according to a video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHqJGgdPe48\">Tim Kaine Interrupts</a>, compiled by the Republican National Committee.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Photo of the week</h2> <p>Ted Cruz, runner-up to Donald Trump in the Republican primary election, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/06/sad-ted-cruz-phone-banking-for-donald-trump-is-a-pretty-great-meme/\">phone banking</a> for the party and apparently telling whoever will listen: \u201cI coulda been a contender.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2746de7a17128f3925f7b27e498417248e71064e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2746de7a17128f3925f7b27e498417248e71064e/31_0_682_409/500.png\" alt=\"Ted Cruz, manning a Trump phone bank.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ted Cruz, manning a Trump phone bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@dallasnews</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>It\u2019s going to get worse for Donald Trump and his Republican party. Much worse.</p> <p>Normal candidates might have realized they were bumping along the bottom of their election \u2013 if not, their life \u2013 when video emerged of them bragging, as a newlywed, about forcing themselves on women, genitals and all.</p> <p>But not the man who promises to make America great again. No, Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">so-called apology video</a> was even more incompetent and incoherent than the rest of his campaign to date. And that\u2019s quite an achievement for a man who has attacked a grieving, Gold Star family.</p> <p>Trump pretended he was a different man. A changed man. A man humbled by meeting real people on the campaign trail.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who knows me, knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am,\u201d he said, before dismissing the whole thing as a distraction. But then he dropped the humility and apology shtick for not-so-subtle hint of how he intends to play this.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said some foolish things, but there\u2019s a big difference between the words and actions of other people,\u201d he said. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\u201d</p> <p>If you think talk of sex is a distraction, you probably shouldn\u2019t make it clear you\u2019re going to continue the conversation at the next TV debate.</p> <p>And you probably shouldn\u2019t attack a wife for her husband\u2019s affairs if you want to win back a couple of women voters. Even if that wife is your opponent. </p> <p>Then again, this is a Republican nominee who urged the world via Twitter to check out the non-existent sex tape of a former Miss Universe who criticized him for demeaning her. This is a presidential candidate who has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-appeared-in-a-2000-playboy-softcore-porn?utm_term=.hm3KEJnjd#.yfABzQJr0\">made an appearance in part of</a> a soft porn video. This is a supposed leader who takes political advice from Roger Ailes, who was forced out of Fox News after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-news\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual harassment.</p> <p>This is Donald Trump: a man no longer fit for polite company. His name will be torn off walls just as Ailes\u2019 was. Republican candidates up and down the land will be chased to election day with their previous endorsements and quotes praising the groper-in-chief.</p> <p>Condemning Trump\u2019s words will not be enough to save them. It was just a few days ago that the US senator in New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte, said \u201cabsolutely\u201d when asked if she would tell kids to look up to Trump. She has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/sen-ayotte-trump-absolutely-a-role-model-for-kids-229076\">since said</a> she \u201cmisspoke\u201d. But no amount of regret and criticism will erase that foolish misjudgment.</p> <p>Ayotte\u2019s misjudgment is really shared by an entire party establishment that is now stampeding for the doors. Republican leaders thought they could cutely tiptoe between their Trump-loving base and Trump-disgusted moderates. Just as they have tried to appease the Tea Party, Obama-hating fringe for the last eight years. Now they find themselves consumed by their own compromises.</p> <p>You know it when you see it. That moment when an election turns decisively. Not a blip, not a gaffe, not a bad few days. But instead the point of no return for candidates and undecided voters alike.</p> <p>In 2008 you could sense it in the 24-hour period around the first debate: when John McCain suspended his campaign, then revived it, ahead of his big moment on stage with Barack Obama. Erratic was the rap against McCain, and erratic was how he behaved.</p> <p>Four years later, it came with the 47% video of Mitt Romney talking at a private fundraiser. Out-of-touch elitist was the caricature, and that\u2019s how Romney sounded behind closed doors.</p> <p>Now we have the grotesque video of Donald Trump bragging: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d With it, Trump showed he is indeed the sum of all the sexist snippets we\u2019ve heard so far.</p> <p>The basket of deplorables just found their Mr Universe.</p> <p>There is no point in pretending that Trump can claw his way back from here. He has now confirmed that he disdains women, and many women voters will surely return the favor.</p> <p>Until now, Trump\u2019s defenders liked to justify his remarks about Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Megyn Kelly by saying that the GOP nominee was just an entertainer. That\u2019s not possible any more. Trump\u2019s disgusting comments were made in private, not as a public performance. And that\u2019s precisely why they are indelible.</p> <p>Trump was hardly in good shape with women voters before he slobbered over the prospect of assaulting them. They have represented the majority for almost 40 years of presidential elections, and this cycle will be no exception.</p> <p>Given his disastrous position with minorities, Trump\u2019s sole hope was to win among white voters. But he was already losing to Clinton among white women: a voting group that Romney won. There simply aren\u2019t enough white voters for Trump to win without sweeping the votes of white women.</p> <p>\u201cI pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down,\u201d Trump said in his half-baked apology video.</p> <p>Of all the unbelievable words that have come out of his pouting lips, these may be the least credible. Donald Trump will let his party down on Sunday, live on national television. The only remaining question in this election is whether his party can rescue anything of its own reputation even as he flushes his own down the sewer.</p> <p>On the campaign trail John McCain liked to quote the bleak joke from Charles Schulz, the cartoon creator of the perennial loser Charlie Brown: \u201cIt always looks darkest just before it gets totally black.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time to say good night to the Republican party as we have known it for the last eight years.</p>",
  "<p>There is no good time for party leaders to call the actions of their presidential candidate \u201csickening\u201d, \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d, but such a chorus of condemnation 31 days before an election that is already sliding out of view suggests more than just the White House is at stake.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Donald Trump forced into apology as sex boast tape horrifies Republicans</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Reaction to hearing Donald Trump boast of molesting women</a>, in a tape reported by the Washington Post, was particularly fierce among Republicans in Congress, who are not only worried about losing control of the Senate but perhaps even the House of Representatives too, with this man at the top of their ticket.</p> <p>To see Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, describing the taped comments as showing \u201cutter lack of respect for women\u201d and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, quickly canceling a planned campaign event was on one level unsurprising. Even Trump is now apologising for Trump.</p> <p>Both have held their noses before.

A lot of these attacks are traced to the territory of the USA, but we do not blame the White House or Langley each time,\u201d he told the Interfax news agency.</p> <p>The Russian foreign ministry said Washington lacked any evidence for its accusations, which were an attempt to fan \u201cunprecedented anti-Russian hysteria\u201d. </p> <p>The deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said: \u201cThis whipping up of emotions regarding \u2018Russian hackers\u2019 is used in the US election campaign, and the current US administration, taking part in this fight, is not averse to using dirty tricks.\u201d</p> <p>He said Moscow reiterated an offer to US officials, first made last year, to hold talks on fighting cybercrime together. </p> <p>The White House declined to say whether the formal attribution would trigger sanctions against Russia.<br></p> <p>The US agencies said that some US states had detected attempts to breach their election systems, and that most of those attempts originated from servers operated by a Russian company. \u201cHowever, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>The agencies said that the \u201cdecentralized nature\u201d of the US voting systems, as well the lack of connectivity between voting machines themselves, would protect against Russian-sponsored electoral tampering. </p> <p>But they urged states across the country to seek additional cybersecurity aid from the DHS.

An internal investigation by Wada itself this week found that the leaked information had been partially falsified before it was distributed.</p> <p>Security firms believe a single operation is behind the attacks into the closed digital systems. The hacking group has been assigned different shorthand names by different analysts \u2013 including the flamboyant moniker Fancy Bear \u2013 as well as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 28 and the Sofacy group. Fancy Bear is believed to be operating under the aegis of the GRU, Russia\u2019s largest intelligence service.</p> <p>A second group, codenamed Cozy Bear or CozyDuke, appears to have broken into the DNC as well, but has not yet distributed whatever information it may have retrieved. Cozy Bear is believed to be affiliated to the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency most directly descended from the KGB. </p> <p>Democratic lawmakers had long pushed the administration to lay the blame for the digital intrusion on the Kremlin\u2019s doorstep. </p> <p>\u201cI applaud the administration\u2019s decision to publicly name Russia as the source of hacks into US political institutions. We should now work with our European allies who have been the victim of similar and even more malicious cyber interference by Russia to develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling,\u201d said congressman Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the US House intelligence committee.</p>",

The hurricane smashed through Haiti\u2019s western peninsula on Tuesday with 145 mile-per-hour (233 kph) winds and torrential rain. At least three towns in the hills and coast of Haiti\u2019s fertile western tip reported dozens of people killed, including the farming village of Chantal where the mayor said 86 people died, mostly when trees crushed houses. Food was scarce in Haiti and at least seven people died of cholera, likely because of flood water mixing with sewage. The Mesa Verde, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship, was heading for Haiti to support relief efforts. </p> <p>Matthew has also triggered mass evacuations along the US coast from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina. It is forecast to move near or over the South Carolina coast Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center reports, and it will near North Carolina\u2019s southern coast by Saturday night. </p> <p>The hurricane sideswiped Florida\u2019s coast with winds of up to 120 mph (195 kph) but did not make landfall in the state. There were at least four storm-related deaths in Florida but no immediate reports of significant damage in cities and towns where the storm swamped streets, toppled trees and knocked out power to more than 1 million people. Two people were killed by falling trees, according to Florida officials, and an elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator while sheltering from the storm inside a garage. </p> <p>The hurricane raked the Georgia coast, including some of the state\u2019s islands such as St. Simons and Tybee. </p> <p>At 2 a.m. EDT, Matthew had sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), and was centered 45 miles (70 kilometers) south of Hilton Head, South Carolina.

It is moving north as the nearby coastline bends to the northwest, so the storm is getting farther from the coast. The geometry changes over the next 24h (beginning Friday evening) because the coastline of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina bends back to the northeast. </p> <p>Although the storm may also start bending more to the northeast, that probably won\u2019t happen until the storm center draws nearer to the coastline. The storm may actually make a brief landfall in South Carolina on Friday as a category 1 or 2 hurricane. The storm did not make landfall in Florida which was a great relief because that kept the strongest winds just offshore.</p> <p>Although the most intense winds stayed offshore, bands of moderately strong winds and intense rains are hundreds of miles across and have produced heavy rain and large storm surges along the coast.

In a category 3 hurricane, winds of up to 129mph are expected, homes are likely to be damaged, and trees will be uprooted, blocking roads. Power and water outages are also likely and could last \u201cseveral days to weeks after the storm passes\u201d.</p> <p>Pretty much the only comfort to be had is the fact that Matthew is no longer expected to be a category 4 hurricane \u2013 these are classed as causing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage, with roofs ripped off houses and walls blown down in winds of up to 156mph, leaving residential areas cut off by fallen trees and power poles, and the area \u201cuninhabitable for weeks or months\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T09:03:38.057Z\">at 10.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f745cee4b05c2f1e952ead\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:07:53.799Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you\u2019re in the region, you can share your experiences of what it\u2019s like where you are by filling in the form below, or by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top of this article.

And as many Floridians heeded calls to evacuate, both candidates began the delicate and difficult task of pursuing votes during a crisis. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign asked the state for more time to register voters a request Florida governor Rick Scott rejected and the Trump team pulled its negative TV ads. </p> <p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s a big one and it\u2019s going to be a bad one,\u201d said Trump at a town hall in New Hampshire. \u201cPlease know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path: You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself, you\u2019ve got to get out of the area, you\u2019ve got to listen.\u201d </p> <p>The hurricane is expected to hit Trump\u2019s prized Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, \u201cMr. Trump spoke with employees yesterday to ensure they are safe and following instructions from local officials.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton tweeted: \u201cHurricane Matthew is a major storm. ... Stay safe Florida.\u201d </p> <p>Both stayed far away, preparing for their second debate, a town hall-style faceoff on Sunday in St. Louis. Trump was holding a dry run town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire, while Clinton was speaking at fundraisers in New York. </p> <p>Along the Southeast coast, Matthew was expected to bring dangerous conditions to Georgia, South Carolina and, possibly, North Carolina. But it was the impact on vote-rich Florida, a must-win state for Trump, that had the campaigns on high alert. The hurricane closed in just as both sides ramped up their early-vote push and just days before a voter registration deadline. </p> <p>Vote-by-mail ballots are being sent to voters across the state this week, leaving the potential for ballots to arrive just as voters temporarily abandon their homes. So far, a record 2.5 million people nearly one-third of those who voted in 2012 have made requests for the early ballots. </p> <p><strong>Scott said Thursday evening that he would not consider extending the 11 October voter registration deadline. </strong></p> <p>\u201cEveryone has had a lot of time to register,\u201d Scott said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to make any changes.\u201d </p> <p>Scott, a Republican, is a strong supporter of GOP nominee Donald Trump and chairman of a Super PAC running Clinton-bashing television ads. </p> <p>Disruptions in Florida campaigning were immediate. In Palm Beach County, local Republican Chairman Michael Barnett said Matthew already had forced cancellations, including phone-banking operations and an event where Ivanka Trump was the headliner.

  "<p>To make estimates about what a certain group of people are thinking, pollsters need to speak to enough people from that group. Generally speaking, though, the smaller the group, the harder it is to get respondents. That\u2019s why, when they\u2019re gauging opinion among different racial groups, pollsters rarely manage to get further down the list beyond white (approximately <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/03/2016-electorate-will-be-the-most-diverse-in-u-s-history/\">69% of all voters</a>), black (12%) or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/25/us-hispanic-latino-voters-us-election-2016\">Hispanic</a> (12%).</p> <p>But that last 7% is a significant share of the electorate that simply gets lumped together under the category \u201c<a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/\">other</a>\u201d. According to the LA Times polling data (which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/sep/28/donald-trump-poll-la-times-usc-clinton\">tends to skew</a> a little more Republican) it is this \u201cother\u201d racial group that is the most closely split about who they intend to vote for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b39b276f7c53cdc47ff2b00edf7c9ff9b046d22c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b39b276f7c53cdc47ff2b00edf7c9ff9b046d22c/0_0_1180_202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LA Times racial polling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"171\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LA Times racial polling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LA Times</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just who is an \u201cother\u201d, though?

Last week a group of US universities conducted a joint <a href=\"http://naasurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NAAS2016-Oct5-report.pdf\">survey</a> of 1,694 Asian Americans as well as using existing polling. The responses skewed heavily Democratic \u2013 when asked who they would choose in a race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, just 10% said Trump. </p> <p>Because the survey was focused on only Asian Americans it meant they could understand differing opinions within this group (which is still a pretty crude category). Responses were broken down by state, foreign born/native born, age, gender as well as origin \u2013 Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Korean, etc.</p> <p>But such surveys are expensive and time consuming (remember what I said at the start \u2013 it\u2019s hard enough to get people to respond to surveys and once you get picky about who you want to respond, things get even harder). That means there are around seven out of every 100 voters about whom we know very little. As if there weren\u2019t already enough uncertainty around this election.</p>",

Chili Sal, a 44-year-old banker living in Manila, thinks Duterte is unfit for the job. \u201cHe has and continues to exhibit appalling, unstatesmanlike behaviour when faced with criticisms of his policy in addressing the war on drugs. His blabbering blustering machismo attitude clearly shows he is inept.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is more worrying is his attitude that he is beyond reproach, thereby seemingly encouraging a somewhat culture of impunity amongst the ranks fighting his drug war for him. He is also a major failure in diplomacy and foreign relations. I can\u2019t even begin to fathom the damage or strain in relations with the US and EU he has caused during the short time that he has been president. He is an embarrassment.\u201d</p> <p>From the hundreds of responses we received to <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2016/sep/30/what-do-you-think-of-rodrigo-dutertes-first-100-days-as-philippine-president\">our callout</a> the main objection against the international media was not criticism for what Duterte has said or done, but the lack of recognition for the positive things his administration has implemented.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/572418/news/nation/dar-opens-its-main-gates-after-2-decades\">gates of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR)</a> have reopened for the first time in 18 years, after they were closed to stop protesters from accessing the building. During his administration, former president Benigno Aquino III ordered for metal grills to be installed on windows and doors to protect employees. Opening the gates in July, the agrarian reform secretary, Rafael Mariano, one of Duterte\u2019s cabinet ministers, said he hoped to <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/794277/no-more-dar-barricade-welded-gates-now-open\">break down walls</a>. \u201cThis symbolises that DAR, on all levels, will maintain open.

The <em>tanim bala</em> (bullet planting) scam saw staff insert bullets into the luggage of passengers as a means to extort them for money.

I see a people with their good values slowly being destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte also prompted an international backlash after calling both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/son-of-a-whore-was-not-meant-to-be-personal-duterte-tells-obama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/4328906/rodrigo-duterte-pope-francis-philippine-president-son-whore/\">Pope Francis</a> a \u201cson of a whore\u201d. He has said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/rodrigo-duterte-to-end-joint-us-and-philippine-military-drills\">end joint US-Philippine military drills</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/30/rodrigo-duterte-vows-to-kill-3-million-drug-addicts-and-likens-himself-to-hitler\">appeared to compare himself to Hitler</a>. Responding to questions on the criticism he has received Duterte said: \u201cMasyado kayong bilib sa America, bumilib kayo dito sa atin [You believe too much in America, believe in us].\u201d</p> <p>The undersecretary and presidential spokesman for Duterte, Ernesto Abella, was also reported as saying, \u201cLet\u2019s try to use our creative imagination OK? Wag tayo masyadong literal [Let\u2019s not be too literal].\u201d</p> <p>Father Joey Evangelista, a Roman Catholic priest based in Mindanao, says Duterte\u2019s way of simplifying things is his major flaw. \u201cHe is unable to perceive nuances in many delicate issues.

That was a misunderstanding of Tagalog vernacular. I also think the international media are ignoring the fact that he is outspoken about the control the United States has on the Philippines for their failure to answer for the abuses they committed during their occupation of our country.</p> <p>\u201cAs a nationalist, I absolutely agree with him that the US has been abusing its relationship with the Philippines to gain unfair strategic military advantage in south-east Asia.\u201d</p> <p>Randal, who originally voted for Grace Poe but now supports Duterte, said: \u201cHis implementation is coming in fast. He did more for our country in just three months compared to other past presidents. I believe he is the right kind of leader in this point in our nation\u2019s history. I believe he will wipe out crime and corruption more than anyone can, and will also bring order and discipline which we desperately need. He is a wonderful president but needs to shut up sometimes.\u201d<br></p> <p>But for an anonymous 28-year-old government employee, Duterte\u2019s performance so far has been dismal. \u201cHe is singlehandedly destroying democracy and decency in our country. If there is any move to kick him out of office, count me in.\u201d</p> <p>According to a survey by leading Philippine public opinion polling body <a href=\"http://www.sws.org.ph/swsmain/home/\">Social Weather Stations</a>, Duterte\u2019s first 100 days as president have been <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/148359-duterte-very-good-rating-sws-survey-100-days\">\u201cvery good\u201d</a>, with 76% of the 1,200 respondents saying they were satisfied with his performance. Filipinos may be divided in what they think of their president, but for the majority of the population he is seen as someone fighting for the dignity of the country and doing so with a can-do attitude. But what about what the rest of the world think? Father Joey Evangelista said: \u201cThe world did not care about the Philippines before. Why is it, all of a sudden, concerned about the Philippines now?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Speeches given by Hillary Clinton to major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs, long kept under wraps, have <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927\">apparently been released by WikiLeaks</a>.</p> <p>The lucrative speeches were a recurring theme in the Democratic primary campaign; accused of being the pro-Wall Street establishment candidate, Clinton faced calls from rival Bernie Sanders to make them public.</p> <p>The speech excerpts came to light on Friday when WikiLeaks published thousands of what it claimed were hacked emails from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The campaign refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of the documents.</p> <p>On Friday the US government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">formally named</a> the Russian government as responsible for recent hacks intended to interfere with the US presidential election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Glen Caplin, Clinton campaign national spokesman, said:<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>\u201cWe are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange [of WikiLeaks] who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton. Guccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign.\u201d</p> <p>If genuine, the WikiLeaks emails appear to show Clinton enjoying warm relations with Wall Street and admitting she is \u201cfar removed\u201d from ordinary citizens.</p> <p>In a speech to the Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit in October 2013, Clinton apparently complained of \u201ca bias\u201d against successful people in Washington that stops them retaining their wealth.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know what Bob Rubin said about that,\u201d she is quoted as saying. \u201cHe said, you know, when he came to Washington, he had a fortune. And when he left Washington, he had a small \u2026\u201d</p> <p>A man called Mr Blanfein interjected: \u201cThat\u2019s how you have a small fortune, is you go to Washington.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton resumed: \u201cYou go to Washington. Right. But, you know, part of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives. You know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary.\u201d</p> <p>At the same event, Clinton appears to have discussed the 2008 financial crisis. <strong>\u201c</strong>I think that there\u2019s a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened with greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening?\u201d<br></p> <p>The former senator and secretary of state added: \u201cThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry\u201d \u2013 a comment that might have been seized on by Sanders, who was demanding that Wall Street not be given a free hand to self-regulate.</p> <p>After leaving office as secretary of state in 2013, Clinton embarked on a career speaking to banks, securities firms and other financial institutions. Tax returns show that her minimum fee was $225,000 per speech.</p> <p>In remarks to Banco Ita\u00fa, she allegedly spoke in favor of trade in a tone very different from her current opposition to Barack Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-tpp-survey\">Trump supporters split on his opposition to TPP, survey shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSecondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it\u2019s not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade\u201d</p> <p>The excerpts were revealed in a January 2016 email from Tony Carrk, research director of the Clinton campaign, to Podesta and other senior campaign officials, highlighting politically sensitive sections.</p> <p>In an address to Goldman Sachs/BlackRock in April 2014, Clinton allegedly said: \u201cI am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle-class upbringing.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe had good public schools. We had accessible healthcare. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn\u2019t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I\u2019m kind of far removed because the life I\u2019ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven\u2019t forgotten it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67ba4e3b54113869046e7a01e2ea45eb70e6b878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67ba4e3b54113869046e7a01e2ea45eb70e6b878/0_0_4636_2781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton had previously faced calls from rival Bernie Sanders to make the speeches public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinton had previously faced calls from rival Bernie Sanders to make the speeches public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melanie Maxwell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a speech to the National Multi-Housing Council in April 2013, she admitted a need for a private and public position on policy. \u201cPolitics is like sausage being made,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody\u2019s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\u201d</p> <p>And in a speech for General Electric\u2019s global leadership meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, in January 2014, Clinton acknowledged that anyone who runs for president must raise vast sums of money. \u201cI would like it not to be so expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no idea how you do that.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, in my campaign \u2013 I lose track, but I think I raised $250m or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign President Obama raised 1.1bn, and that was before the Super Pacs and all of this other money just rushing in, and it\u2019s so ridiculous that we have this kind of free-for-all with all of this financial interest at stake, but, you know, the supreme court said that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re in for.</p>",

Bush led the charge as an industry insider and friend to the stars, often appearing on red carpets, cozying up with talent at the Golden Globes, Grammys and Academy Awards, among other glitzy events. From 2004 through 2006, ABC had him host its live pre-show for the Oscars, as Ryan Seacrest does most years for the E! network.</p> <p>Before joining Access Hollywood as the east coast correspondent in 2001, Bush put his smooth voice to work on radio, hosting multiple programs, including his own, Billy Bush and the Bush League Morning Show, which aired until he joined the celebrity news show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Donald Trump Billy Bush\">  <iframe width='480' height='290' scrolling='no' src='https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/c/embed/3bf16d1e-8caf-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The Today Show welcomed him into the fold in 2016, bringing him on as a full-time host after having him contribute to the network\u2019s Olympics coverage.

Trump sold the Miss Universe organization in 2015, after two television partners dropped the broadcast in response to Trump\u2019s controversial comments about illegal immigrants made on his presidential campaign. </p>"
