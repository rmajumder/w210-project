  "<p>A Trump loyalist nominated as director of national intelligence (DNI) looked set to sail through Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday, only nine months after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">forced to withdraw</a> for having exaggerated his security experience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">John Ratcliffe: Trump's intelligence chief pick withdraws amid qualification doubts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman who fiercely defended the president in last year\u2019s impeachment hearings, told the Senate intelligence committee that he would speak truth to power if confirmed as DNI.</p> <p>Ratcliffe was reminded by Democratic senators that his two predecessors had been forced from their posts because the findings of the intelligence community irritated Donald Trump, and that the spy agencies were <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/21/richard-grenell-dni-the-death-of-truth-to-power/\">currently under pressure</a> to provide evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that the coronavirus outbreak started in a Chinese laboratory.</p> <p>\u201cRegardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,\u201d Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks at his <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-nomination-john-l-ratcliffe-be-director-national-intelligence\">confirmation hearing</a>, held under social distancing rules, with most of the senators and staff wearing masks. \u201cAbove all, my fidelity and loyalty will always be to the constitution and rule of law, and my actions as DNI will reflect that commitment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2442964fe844b7d62c721dff4e26a8ef843d8fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2442964fe844b7d62c721dff4e26a8ef843d8fcc/0_242_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senators wear masks and practice social distancing rules at the nomination hearing of John Ratcliffe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senators wear masks and practice social distancing rules at the nomination hearing of John Ratcliffe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However Ratcliffe, a fiercely partisan congressman, dodged questions on which Trump has broken with his own intelligence briefers, such as whether there has been any progress towards North Korean disarmament (there has not) and whether Iran was in compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal when Trump pulled the US out of the agreement (it was).</p> <p>Ratcliffe said that if confirmed, he would focus on the impact of coronavirus, questions about its origins in China and US competition with Beijing.</p> <p>\u201cI view China as the greatest threat actor right now,\u201d he said. \u201cLook with respect to Covid-19 and the role China plays; the race to 5G; cybersecurity issues: all roads lead to China,\u201d he told the panel.</p> <p>Ratcliffe <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ratcliffe-withdraws-from-consideration-for-intelligence-chief-trump-says/2019/08/02/9f3c42cc-b551-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html\">withdrew his first nomination</a> five days after Trump first named him as a candidate \u2013 to widespread surprise \u2013 last July, after it was found he had grossly overstated his national security experience.</p> <p>He had falsely claimed on his website to have \u201carrested over 300 illegal immigrants in a single day\u201d and had \u201cput terrorists in prison\u201d although he had not tried a terrorism case in his time as a US attorney.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what has changed since last summer \u2026 when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,\u201d the ranking Democrat on committee, Senator Mark Warner, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>However the committee chair, Senator Richard Burr, and the other Republicans on the panel, indicated they would back Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination and quickly put it to a vote in the full Senate, despite a legal requirement that the DNI \u201cshall have extensive national security expertise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democrats in the committee and the Senate seem strongly opposed, but Ratcliffe seems likely to secure confirmation, probably on a party-line vote,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.</p> <p>Tobias suggested that Ratcliffe\u2019s promises to be objective may have assuaged doubters on the committee, or that Burr\u2019s standing and independence may have been weakened after he was found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\">sold hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> in stocks in mid-February, a few days after publishing a commentary for Fox News claiming that the US was \u201cbetter prepared than ever before\u201d to confront the virus.</p> <p>Katrina Mulligan, a former official who worked for more than 10 years in the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI), suggested another factor that has changed since last summer could be that the Senate is eager to replace the current acting DNI, Richard Grenell, another partisan with even less experience than Ratcliffe and who is not answerable to Congress because he is not confirmed in the role.</p> <p>Mulligan added that US intelligence officials may be resigned to Ratcliffe getting the top job for similar reasons.</p> <p>\u201cThe morale at ODNI is so low right now and people are so fearful, that I think that there is a real sense that it could be worse,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense that at least he can form coherent sentences, and at least he has a modicum of experience which the current acting DNI really did not.\u201d</p>",

In the past month, at least two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">pairs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8201467/Twin-sisters-66-die-coronavirus-four-days-other.html\">twins</a> have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?</p> \n  <p>Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person\u2019s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.</p> \n  <p>A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has reported that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/study-of-twins-reveals-genetic-effect-on-covid-19-symptoms\">symptoms appear to be 50% genetic</a>. </p> \n  <p>But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,\u201d Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/genetics-in-focus-after-coronavirus-deaths-of-siblings-and-twins\">Genetics in focus after coronavirus deaths of siblings and twins</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb159848f083e60eea309f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:19:11.765Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mayor of <strong>The Hague</strong> has issued a statement ordering police to break up a demonstration by around 200 people who had gathered to protest against measures ordered by the government to slow the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. </p> \n  <p>Police said in a statement that they were \u201cdetaining demonstrators that ignore the mayor\u2019s order\u201d. <span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Local press agency ANP said dozens had been detained.</span></p> \n  <p>The Dutch government has banned public gatherings since mid-March, with people required to stand at least 1.5 metres apart in public spaces.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:54:17.226Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb1584b8f083e60eea309f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:17:05.083Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Overcrowded, unhygienic prisons in <strong>Latin America</strong> and the spread of the coronavirus both in regional prisons and in the <strong>US</strong> are a source of \u201cmajor concern\u201d, the UN rights office (OHCHR) has said. </p> \n  <p>In some cases, fear of infection has led to riots, killing dozens of inmates in <strong>Venezuela, Peru and Colombia</strong> in recent weeks. </p> \n  <p>OHCHR called for prompt, independent investigations into these incidents. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn many countries of Latin America, you have really serious overcrowding,\u201d OHCHR spokesman <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rupert Colville</strong> told a Geneva briefing, referring to the trend as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic problem across the continent and in some cases it can be deadly,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>In some places, overcapacity levels are as high as 500%, a UN official said, adding that new detentions due to violations of Covid-19 measures in places like Peru have exacerbated this.</p> \n  <p>The UN has already voiced concern over hundreds of thousands of people arrested or detained for quarantine violations. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the situation in US jails, he said that thousands of cases of infections in prisons were a \u201cmajor concern\u201d, naming specifically <strong>New York and Chicago</strong>.

The total number of cases stands at 3,582,469. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 251,510.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong economy suffers deepest contraction. </strong>Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, has recorded its worst decline on record.The region\u2019s GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Chief executive Carrie Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</li> \n   <li><strong>Five Eyes network contradicts theory Covid-19 leaked from lab.</strong>There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">intelligence sources have told the Guardian</a>, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>WHO says has no proof from US on \u2018speculative\u2019 Wuhan lab claims. </strong>The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support \u201cspeculative\u201d claims by US president Donald Trump and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>Fauci says there is no scientific evidence virus came from Chinese laboratory. </strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the foremost US expert on infections diseases and a key member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said in an interview with National Geographic that there is <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/anthony-fauci-no-scientific-evidence-the-coronavirus-was-made-in-a-chinese-lab-cvd/\">no scientific basis</a> for the theory that coronavirus was man-made in a Chinese laboratory, or escaped from a laboratory after being brought in from the wild.</li> \n   <li><strong>Chinese state media on Monday denounced Mike Pompeo as \u201cinsane</strong>\u201d. Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization, which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was also asked about the lab theory. </strong>Morrison said there had been no change to the Australian position on the theory, which is that no possibilities could be ruled out, but the most likely origin of the virus is a wildlife wet market. He reiterated calls for a \u201ctransparent\u201d review into the outbreak and the World Health Organization\u2019s response to the outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand records no new cases for second day in a row,</strong> as the government considers whether to further relax the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Monday was the first time since before New Zealand\u2019s national shutdown began on 25 March that there were no new cases of the virus diagnosed. </li> \n   <li><strong>Australia and New Zealand confirm plans for \u201csafe travel zone\u201d. </strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have officially confirmed plans for a \u201csafe travel zone\u201d between the two countries.

Italy and Spain each said they would provide more than \u20ac100m.</li> \n   <li><strong>Austrian unemployment at all-time high. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%.</li> \n   <li><strong>Carnival to resume cruises in August. </strong>Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry\u2019s possible role in spreading the disease around the globe.</li> \n   <li><strong>Plane carrying aid supplies crashes in Somalia. </strong>The accident, involving an African Express Airways plane<strong>, </strong>killed seven people on board, a security official said.</li> \n   <li><strong>US supreme court</strong><strong> hears arguments by teleconference for first time</strong>.

Yes,\u201d Trump said during a trip to Arizona \u2013 a battleground state in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 on Tuesday. \u201cBut we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an interview with David Muir of ABC News on Tuesday evening, Trump was asked directly: \u201cDo you believe it\u2019s the reality we\u2019re facing, that lives will be lost to reopen the country?\u201d</p> \n<p>The president said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible there will be some because you won\u2019t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is, but at the same time we\u2019re going to practise social distancing, we\u2019re going to be washing hands, we\u2019re going to be doing a lot of the things that we\u2019ve learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back.\u201d</p> \n<p>A prolonged shutdown, Trump added, came with its own costs in terms of increased drug use and suicide.</p> \n<p>Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1257751854831800330?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cIt appears the plan is, shamefully, to have no plan. Americans will suffer. We must replace this administration in November.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1257756811630792704?s=20\">added on Twitter:</a> \u201cIf you can\u2019t shut down the virus, shut down the taskforce.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pence was responding on Tuesday to questions about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-live-news.html#link-2bae7229\">a New York Times report</a> that said officials in the Trump administration were telling the 22 taskforce members and their staff to expect the group to be phased out within weeks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-economic-recovery\">Trump gives up on virus fight to focus on economic recovery \u2013&nbsp;and re-election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to look at the Memorial Day [25 May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,\u201d the vice-president said, according to a pool report.</p> \n<p>Pence insisted that \u201cit really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we\u2019ve made as a country\u201d and promised to keep the response coordinator, Deborah Birx, \u201caround every bit as long as we need to\u201d.</p> \n<p>Birx herself said: \u201cWe\u2019ll still keep a close eye on the data because we have very good data now. It took us a while to build that capacity. And we\u2019ll make sure that, you know, we\u2019re watching that at a federal level.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there was also immediate confusion. Even as Pence spoke, Anthony Fauci, a leading taskforce member, was denying the Times\u2019s report. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d the infectious disease expert told CBS News. \u201cI\u2019ve been in every taskforce meeting, and that\u2019s not what they are doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The taskforce was created in late January and Pence was named as chairman in late February. It met frequently to address the rapidly spreading pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings dominated by Trump that sometimes lasted more than two hours.</p> \n<p>But the president was accused of using the platform to score political points, with Republican allies eventually warning that the briefings were damaging him at the polls.</p> \n<p>After a briefing in which Trump floated the idea of treating the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">with disinfectant injections,</a> the events were soon killed off. There has now been no briefing for more than a week and the taskforce is meeting less frequently.</p> \n<p>Its demise would be the latest sign that the White House is pivoting towards the first phase of Trump\u2019s plan to reopen the country after many states ordered people to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. The president has urged supporters to \u201cliberate\u201d states from pandemic restrictions and signalled approval for armed protesters who have defied his own social distancing guidelines.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Trump held a Fox News virtual town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and was joined by Pence and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, putting an emphasis on the economy.</p> \n<p>Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host whom Trump follows closely, applauded the winding up of the taskforce. \u201cFor too long it seemed like unelected doctors were making policy,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cEconomic toll was disastrous.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, denied that health concerns were being neglected: \u201cReporting on the task force is being misconstrued to suggest the White House is no longer involving medical experts,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThis is totally false. President Trump will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening.\u201d</p> \n<p>But to critics, the timing is awry. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000 from 72,400 on 29 April. The change reflected \u201crising mobility in most US states\u201d with an easing of business closures and stay-at-home orders expected in 31 states by 11 May, the institute said.</p> \n<p>Fauci warned in a CNN interview on Monday that there would be a \u201crebound\u201d of new coronavirus cases in the US if the country rushes towards a \u201cpremature\u201d reopening of society and business. \u201cHow many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/elaine-kamarck/\">Elaine Kamarck,</a> a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said any attempt to sideline Birx and Fauci was doomed. \u201cHe might try to marginalise them but the press isn\u2019t going to try to marginalise them.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are the people with the data and with the expertise and nobody with data and expertise is going to be marginalised. It\u2019s going to be the politicians who don\u2019t listen to the scientists who are going to get marginalised.\u201d</p>",

The group, it said, would work together to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus in the US and keep the public informed about important public health and travel guidance.</p> \n<p>By March, as the US reported thousands of new cases of Covid-19 every day, the taskforce gave daily press briefings, ostensibly to update Americans about the public health emergency.</p> \n<p>But at the end of April, the briefings stopped. The last press conference was held on 24 April. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-stays-away-from-briefings-amid-fallout-from-disinfectant-comments\">reports</a>, Trump\u2019s advisers said his daily appearances were hurting his chance of re-election in November, especially after he suggested \u2013 with no evidence \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">disinfectant could fight the virus in human bodies</a>.</p> \n<h2>Who is on the taskforce?</h2> \n<p>Headed by Mike Pence, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/\">taskforce</a> is made up of members of Trump\u2019s cabinet, including Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, and Steve Mnuchin, secretary of the treasury. There are also representatives from different departments, such as transportation and defense, and various advisers to the president.</p> \n<p>Trump appointed two well-respected epidemiologists, Drs Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, to the taskforce. Both, though especially Fauci, have been widely regarded as the sober voices centered on public health, in contrast with the political figures on the taskforce.</p> \n<h2>What effect is Covid-19 having on public health in the US?</h2> \n<p>Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and released on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/05/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-warns-against-rush-reopen-trump-cuomo-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5eb1aa4d8f08da022712b0eb#block-5eb1aa4d8f08da022712b0eb\">showed</a> that the number of coronavirus deaths in the US had passed 70,000 \u2013 far more than any other country, and over a quarter of all coronavirus deaths in the world.

This has resulted in a wave of unemployment throughout the US: more than 22 million people have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economic-toll-jobless\"> filed for unemployment</a> since the crisis began, a number likely to rise as states work through the backlog of applications.</p> \n<p>Industries such as restaurants and travel have been decimated by shutdown orders with uncertainty over when, if ever, business will return to normal.

  "<p>One of the most immediate and unavoidable consequences of the coronavirus pandemic was that \u201cpolitics as usual\u201d quickly ground to a shuddering halt. In Britain, mayoral and council elections due to be held this week were postponed for a year.</p> <p>A democratic hiatus of this kind is never to be welcomed. But delaying an election in order to conduct it properly is far preferable to the current state of affairs in Poland. This Sunday, as Poles tentatively emerge from two months of lockdown and continue to physically distance, an electorate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\">of</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\">more than 30</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\"> million people</a> is due to elect a new president by postal vote \u2013 the first such poll in the nation\u2019s history. The date of the election was fixed in pre-coronavirus times. By insisting that it goes ahead, the rightwing Law and Justice-led government has taken the maxim \u201cnever let a crisis go to waste\u201d to a new level.</p> <p>The decision to hold an improvised postal election is being contested by all the opposition parties. Key allies in Law and Justice\u2019s own ruling coalition also oppose the move; the deputy prime minister, Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/tickers/147999\" title=\"\">resigned in protest</a> last month, arguing that the country should be focused on battling coronavirus and rebuilding the economy. The other objections are numerous. There are enormous practical difficulties to organising an unprecedented ballot in such a short space of time and widespread concerns over possible fraud. Since ordinary campaigning on the streets has been impossible for two months, there are also issues of political balance, given the <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/25/poland-public-television-law-and-justice-pis-mouthpiece/\" title=\"\">pro-government affiliations</a> of Polish broadcast media.</p> <p>The simplest explanation for the government\u2019s determination to press ahead regardless is naked opportunism. Since taking power in 2015, Law and Justice has acquired a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/29/world/europe/29reuters-eu-poland.html\" title=\"\">well-deserved reputation</a> for playing fast and loose with democratic norms, particularly in relation to the judiciary and media. In this instance, it appears the party has calculated that in times of national crisis, populations tend to rally round the government. In April, it rushed a bill through parliament to allow a postal ballot poll, ignoring a legal prohibition on rule changes less than six months from an election. From then on, the political playing field has been relentlessly skewed in favour of the government\u2019s preferred candidate, Andrzej Duda, who is seeking a second presidential term. Mr Duda has enjoyed a high-profile role in the government\u2019s strategy to combat Covid-19, receiving plaudits from government-friendly media. The candidate for Civic Platform, Poland\u2019s main opposition party, has endorsed a mass boycott of the election while, confusingly, staying in the race. Unsurprisingly, given that backdrop, polls suggest that Mr Duda is set to win by a landslide.</p> <p>With the country split over the vote, and Sunday\u2019s election in danger of descending into farce, it is still possible that Poland\u2019s parliament <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2020/05/05/polands-presidential-election-will-the-government-collapse/\" title=\"\">will overturn the earlier decision</a> to allow it to take place. On legal, logistical and ethical grounds that would be the right course of action. A pandemic is not the appropriate context for an experiment in postal voting that has no credibility among large swathes of the electorate. In the interests of democracy, this election should be postponed.</p>",

  "<h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>As several states began tentative, and risky, reopening measures, Donald Trump held a town hall at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday night exclusively for Fox News \u2013 which \u201cmakes sense\u201d, said Seth Meyers on Late Night, because Trump is \u201cconstantly either in a state of watching Fox or appearing on Fox or watching himself appearing on Fox. Eventually Fox is just going to turn into a 24/7 feed of Trump watching himself on Fox like an infinity mirror.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMCQwgHMXHw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HMCQwgHMXHw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The White House has basically become a Fox News offshoot of advisers for the president, Meyers continued, such as his new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-lie-kayleigh-mcenany-press-secretary-coronavrius-michael-flynn\">held her first press conference last week</a>. The hiring of McEnany, a former Fox production assistant, epitomizes \u201cthe feedback loop of disinformation and propaganda that exists between the Trump White House and Fox News\u201d, said Meyers. McEnany is known, for example, for defending Trump on cable news in February with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-press-secretary-quotes\">\u201coutlandish lies\u201d</a> such as \u201cthis president will always put America first, he will always protect American citizens, we will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here\u201d.</p> <p>Fox News also played a destructive role in what the Washington Post called Trump\u2019s \u201clost month\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/34-days-of-pandemic-inside-trumps-desperate-attempts-to-reopen-america/2020/05/02/e99911f4-8b54-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html\">\u201cdesperation and dysfunction\u201d</a> as he ignored and then gave up on fighting coronavirus and instead focused, at the behest of aides and his favorite Fox News hosts, on prematurely opening up the economy. The Post reports that frequent Fox News guest and \u201cTrump\u2019s toothless vampire\u201d Rudy Giuliani and host Laura Ingraham lobbied the president repeatedly, in White House meetings and on air, to embrace the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (\u201cRemember when everyone cared about that for a second? The Tamagotchi of Covid cures,\u201d said Meyers) as a coronavirus treatment (it is not proven and can have fatal side-effects). \u201cYeah, the TV president who played a TV businessman is listening to TV doctors,\u201d Meyers said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/01/stephen-colbert-trump-coronavirus-late-show-recap\">Colbert: Trump 'wants everything to go back to normal because he\u2019s bored'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, it\u2019s confirmation that \u201ca Fox host with no medical expertise [Ingraham] is directly advising the president on a deadly pandemic, while that same president hires pundits he sees on TV and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus\">fires or punishes actual experts</a> and inspector generals who criticize him\u201d, said Meyers. \u201cThis is what you get when you make a TV star president. Because when you\u2019re on TV, no one ever tells you you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany, meanwhile, \u201ccompleted the Fox News feedback loop\u201d and transitioned seamlessly to \u201cWhite House liar\u201d on Friday by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-lie-kayleigh-mcenany-press-secretary-coronavrius-michael-flynn\">ending her briefing with a plug</a> for Trump\u2019s town hall on Fox, which she promised would have high TV ratings. \u201cOh, cool, so in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the White House press secretary is like a glorified TV Guide channel,\u201d said Meyers, breaking out a faux-promo voice: \u201cLooking for willful ignorance from a soulless sociopath? Check out the Fox News Town Hall at seven.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>\u201cNo surprise, Trump is lying,\u201d said Stephen Colbert of the president\u2019s Fox News town hall on Sunday night. \u201cHe\u2019s willfully endangering the lives of Americans\u201d with his plan to reopen, as confirmed by an internal government memo, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-death-toll.html\">leaked to the New York Times</a>, which revealed the Trump administration predicts a near doubling of the daily death toll by June.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_8Cms364Sg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K_8Cms364Sg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThat means infection rates will skyrocket!\u201d said Colbert. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to have to go back inside and America\u2019s going to have to find another animal exploitation true crime drama to watch.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s town hall was billed as \u201cAmerica Together: Returning to Work\u201d, \u201cand Trump not only thought that the returning to work would happen soon, he thought this disaster might actually make things better\u201d, said Colbert, pulling up a clip of Trump promising: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get another job, but you\u2019re going to get a better job. You\u2019ll get a job where you make more money, frankly, and I think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? A better job, with more money? So it\u2019s kinda good that you ignored the virus?\u201d Colbert scoffed, whipping out his Trump impersonation: \u201cI think this is gonna be even better because the pigs that just flew out of my butt told me they\u2019re hiring, so that\u2019s a positive.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was also asked about his combative stance with the press, which he defended as necessary because he\u2019s \u201ctreated worse\u201d than Lincoln was. \u201cReally? You\u2019re going to compare yourself to Abraham Lincoln?\u201d said Colbert. \u201cWell I\u2019d like to point out that none of his supporters carried Confederate flags.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed plans to reopen state economies, even as coronavirus case numbers increase across the country. \u201cYou would think an increase in cases would mean that maybe now is not the perfect time to open everything up,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbut many states in America are saying, \u2018hey man, this summer is not gonna enjoy itself.\u2019\u201d Florida beaches, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/florida-grim-reaper-beach-video-coronavirus\">are teeming with people again</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1257498693386805254\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As America&#39;s coronavirus death toll races past Trump\u2019s predictions, the only adjustment he\u2019s made is to the goalposts. <a href=\"https://t.co/gVUdQR54Q1\">pic.twitter.com/gVUdQR54Q1</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1257498693386805254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 5, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Still, \u201cpeople on the beach might be the least of America\u2019s worries,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbecause there are other groups doing much crazier things,\u201d such as protesting against shutdown measures by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">storming statehouses with weapons</a>. \u201cGoddamn, only in America do protests <em>start</em> with storming the Capitol with assault rifles.

  "<p>Last Wednesday, aerial photographs captured a snaking queue, 4km long, of thousands of hungry residents from shantytowns outside Pretoria in South Africa awaiting food packages from a charity organisation. There was a chilling resonance with the images of 27 April 1994, 26 years ago, when citizens lined up to vote for the first time, and put Nelson Mandela into power.</p> <p>Today\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to find a balance between saving \u201clives <em>and</em> livelihoods\u201d in his government\u2019s response to Covid-19. And he has done well so far with the former. South Africa has been justly lauded for acting quickly to flatten the curve, delaying the pandemic\u2019s exponential trajectory with one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns, now in week six, so that it could screen people in hotspots and prepare its ill-equipped health system to manage the load.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have been nearly 120,000 arrests for non-compliance, and at least two people have been murdered by security forces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in a country that now faces unemployment shooting up to <a href=\"https://ewn.co.za/2020/05/04/sa-s-unemployment-rate-could-possibly-reach-40-due-to-covid-19-mogajane\">more than 40%</a>, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, Ramaphosa\u2019s balance is increasingly hard to strike. And the rigid and unexplained way the government began this week\u2019s easing of the lockdown has brought its admirable reliance on science, and sense of empathy, up against its own political baggage. This has caused a perhaps inevitable fraying of common purpose in this fractious country.</p> <p>Although the curve has been flattened \u2013 only 6,336 confirmed infections by the end of last week, and 133 deaths, in a population of 58 million people \u2013 a wave of infections at some point this year is almost inevitable. All the state can do is delay it. Given that, does it make sense to keep schools and the economy largely shut, and to deny certain freedoms too? The restrictions include a strict nightly curfew, limited and illogical exercise hours, and a total ban on alcohol and tobacco sales.</p> <p>As a direct result of the alcohol ban, and the closure of the ubiquitous shebeens, the trauma wards of the major hospitals are largely empty: in South Africa, many injuries are a result of drinking, from fights to road injuries. The tobacco ban is harder to justify, and the industry has declared a legal challenge. Sin taxes are high, and the finance minister, Tito Mboweni, has <a href=\"[https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-04-30-tito-mboweni-reveals-he-does-not-support-ban-on-alcohol-and-cigarette-sales/\">complained publicly</a> about the bans: he is losing \u00a370m a month at a time he can ill-afford it, given the \u00a35bn he has to find in the state coffers as part of a projected <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">\u00a317</a><a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">b</a><a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">n bailout</a>.</p> <p>Ramaphosa has a background in both the trade union movement and the corporate world, and he ran the negotiations that brought about democracy in South Africa. He has used the pandemic to accelerate his ideology of \u201csocial compacting\u201d \u2013 bringing government, business, civil society and labour together \u2013 and has been astonishingly successful at getting big business to pitch into the bailout. He has presented the lockdown restrictions to his compatriots with a kind of mournful compassion, apologising for the tough decisions he has had to make.</p> <p>But this trust is being rapidly eroded by the actions of some of his ministers. The police minister, Bheki Cele, in particular, has brought a martial swagger to the table, threatening harsh retribution for contravening lockdown regulations. It is not surprising the UN Commission for Human Rights has explicitly called South Africa out for using <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-04-30-lockdown-curfew-overkill/\">undue force in the lockdown</a>; there have been nearly 120,000 arrests for non-compliance, and at least two people have been murdered by security forces. </p> <p>The minister responsible for managing the state of disaster, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, lectured the country last week in a castigating tone. Dlamini-Zuma is the ex-wife of the former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/zuma\">Jacob Zuma</a>, and narrowly lost the ANC leadership battle to Ramaphosa in 2017, in which she was widely believed to be a stalking horse for Zuma and his cronies.</p> <p>Dlamini-Zuma <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-05-04-john-steenhuisen-shades-nkosazana-dlamini-zuma-over-cigarette-ban/\">champions the tobacco ban</a> (as health minister, she banned public smoking in 2001), and journalists and opposition parties have alleged she has connections to tobacco smugglers. Both Dlamini-Zuma and the alleged tobacco smugglers have denied any wrongdoing. Such claims notwithstanding, she represents the old-school vanguardism of the African National Congress leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/may/01/africas-heavy-handed-lockdown-policing-must-not-become-the-new-normal-coronavirus\">Africa's heavy-handed lockdown policing must not become the new normal | Karen Allen and Anton du Plessis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many in the party came to power in 1994 with Soviet-style ideas of state control, but were unable to put them into practice because of the globalisation of free-market economics, the negotiated settlement, and the kind of liberal multiparty democracy that fostered a vibrant civil society. The compromises that the movement\u2019s leaders have had to make have left, in many of them, a profound sense of disappointment, one borne out by the reality of South Africa today. It is the world\u2019s most unequal society, and \u2013 particularly given the expectations of 1994 \u2013 one of its most disaffected. And, to be fair to Cele, South Africa is not Sweden. Due first to apartheid and then to the corruption of the state, South Africans are not known for respecting the law.</p> <p>Into this reality sailed the Covid-19 pandemic. For Ramaphosa, and the reformers in the party, it has presented an opportunity to implement a more collaborative approach to government. But for Dlamini-Zuma and others, it offers an unprecedented opportunity to take control. Already, young South Africans feel alienated from the party\u2019s paternalistic leadership: in the 2018 general election, only 20% of eligible first-time voters even registered to vote.</p> <p>Ramaphosa himself has noted that there can be no business as usual in the post-Covid-19 world. What this means, exactly, remains to be seen: here, as everywhere. What is at stake now in South Africa is far more than a power struggle within the ruling party, now fought on the battleground of the pandemic. Rather, it is the nature of trust itself, at a time when this is most necessary. Without such trust, based on the mutual respect between citizens and their elected leaders, rather than a government\u2019s command of its subjects, South Africa\u2019s fragile contract will disintegrate.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Gevisser\u2019s next book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pink-line-9781788165143.html\">The Pink Line: The World\u2019s Queer Frontiers</a>, will be published in July.</p>",
  "<p>To exist at this moment is to navigate (or try to fend off) the flood of grief that threatens to submerge even our rare, buoyant moments. We mourn the death of friends and relatives, the absence of human contact and the everyday pleasures we once took for granted. We can\u2019t stop thinking about the tens of thousands of families facing hunger, bankruptcy and homelessness even as they struggle to endure the loss of someone they dearly loved.</p> <p>What\u2019s striking, if not surprising, is that this deluge of sorrow has run dry at the door to the Oval Office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/donald-trump-america-weimar\">Under Trump, America has gone a bit late Weimar. We know how that ended | Lloyd Green</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One\u2019s heart goes out to the reporters who have sifted through the Donald Trump\u2019s press briefings on the current pandemic \u2013 hour after hour of bombast, self-promotion, vitriol, lies and recklessly unscientific speculation \u2013 for any evidence of sympathy for those who are in pain. It\u2019s hardly a shock to learn that our president\u2019s expressions of care and compassion have occupied a total of less than five minutes, out of all that time.</p> <p>After all, a man who mocked a disabled journalist and boasted about grabbing women wasn\u2019t elected for the depths of his kindness and the purity of his moral conscience. And it seems unrealistically optimistic to have hoped that the extremity of this crisis should have inspired, in our leader, a deep and essential change of heart.</p> <p>Arguably, few politicians seek (and are elected to) office out of an excess of compassion. Even those who respond to catastrophe in more appropriately \u201chuman\u201d ways \u2013 George W Bush mourning the victims of 9/11, Obama tearing up at the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting \u2013 have been parochial in their sympathies; there was little ceremonial grieving for the innocent child-casualties of our bombing and drone strikes in the Middle East.</p> <p>And yet we can\u2019t help thinking how much less worried we would be if a humane, competent, well-informed adult was making the decisions that affect us all. Though we\u2019ve learned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned away refugees from Hitler\u2019s Europe, we can still imagine how comforting it was, for those who lived through the Great Depression, hearing his radio speeches: absorbing their message of reassurance and hope, his determination to comprehend and mitigate the sufferings of our nation.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s enraged, self-infatuated maunderings are the opposite of Roosevelt\u2019s calm resolve. Yet ultimately our president\u2019s failure of empathy is less disturbing than the ways in which it appears to resonate with his supporters. He and his allies have framed our response to the crisis in terms of partisan politics, to imply (incorrectly, as the polls suggest) that tough conservatives are eager to get back to work sooner than scaredy-cat, stay-at-home progressives.</p> <p>The flag-waving, gun-toting, defiantly unmasked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">ers storming the capitol buildings in Michigan</a> and Wisconsin would seem to support that view. This, too, is a situation that could have been defused by a president who projected sympathy, who persuaded his listeners, as Roosevelt did, that the pain of those who have lost jobs and businesses is shared by us all. Instead we see Trump\u2019s efforts to stoke rage and bitterness because he suspects that it might help solidify his base.</p> <p>It may be that the deepening polarization in our country \u2013 the suspicion, grievance and rage that the president is spouting and encouraging \u2013 is less political than spiritual. These divides go deeper than how we vote; they express our core beliefs about our responsibility to those with whom we share this brief span on this damaged planet. As Slate editor Tom Scocca posted on Twitter: \u201cConservatives have by now been conditioned to believe that thinking about other people \u2018s needs or interests in any way is tyranny by definition,\u201d a sentiment echoed by Emily Raboteau in the Huffington Post: \u201cI can\u2019t debate someone into caring about what happens to our fellow human beings.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This idea that empathy and altruism are expressions of weakness and naivety is nothing new; it\u2019s the foundation of novelist Ayn Rand\u2019s Objectivism, and it received a major boost during the Reagan-Bush years, when \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics did little to stem the growing problem of homelessness. But it\u2019s never seemed so virulent as it does today, perhaps because it has never been so openly advocated \u2013 so blatantly demonstrated \u2013 by our president. It\u2019s hard to think of anything more corrupt or corrupting than to boast about one\u2019s success when (as I write this) more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/04/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">60,000 Americans have died of Covid-19</a>. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants.</p> <p>What\u2019s most frightening to me is that the lack of empathy \u2013 the selfishness, the resentment, the hope that others will suffer even more than we are suffering \u2013 is itself a kind of virus: contagious, dangerous, possibly even lethal. I\u2019ve heard people say that the Wisconsin and Michigan protesters \u2013 shouting shoulder to shoulder, refusing to observe the simple rules of social distancing \u2013 won\u2019t learn how profoundly Trump has betrayed them until they themselves contract the virus that they have been encouraged to downplay. I\u2019ve even heard it said how unfair it is that our overweight, out-of-shape politicians \u2013 too vain to wear a mask, flouting scientific advice and the dictates of common sense \u2013 have proved immune to the disease that has felled so many decent, generous people.</p> <p>But such statements echo the absence of compassion that Trump, by tweet and by example, is encouraging us to feel. It\u2019s become another thing to resist. I don\u2019t want to wish that <em>anyone</em> will learn that particular hard lesson, in that particularly hard way: not the governors opening their states for business before it\u2019s safe, not the demonstrators on the state capitol steps, not our president. Despite my own anger, frustration and fear, I still can\u2019t bring myself to claim suffering as a success.</p>",

And then she found herself pregnant again, just as the lockdown loomed. \u201cMixed in with the fear and stress of uncertainty, there was also a guilty kind of sadness for the things I would not get to do,\u201d she writes.</p> \n<h2>Opinion: Normal People is a deathly dull romance</h2> \n<p>Normal People is one of the big, home-viewing hits of the lockdown era, based on a beloved novel about two clever, fragile young Irish people edging towards love and self-acceptance. It\u2019s a story as old as time, says Jessa Crispin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/sally-rooney-normal-people-hulu-bbc-soap-opera\">which is why she found it deathly dull</a>.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The desire to tell an old story in a new way only really works if you actually have something new to say.

  "<p>Rare is the NFL draft that provokes second guessing about a kicker. But this year\u2019s edition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/nfl-virtual-draft-television-abc-espn\">was no ordinary draft</a> (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.</p> <p>When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn\u2019t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser\u2019s career.</p> <p>And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm \u2013 of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/justin-rohrwasser-new-england-patriots-kicker-tattoo-three-percenters-nfl-draft\">the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters</a> \u2013 a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/06/nick-bosa-donald-trump-san-francisco-49ers-nfl-draft\">If athletes like Nick Bosa support Trump they should at least be honest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the na\u00eff. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he\u2019d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/justin-rohrwasser-tattoo-new-england-patriots-three-percenters\">all the while apologizing to friends and family</a> whom he\u2019d put in the \u201ccompromising position\u201d of having to defend the indefensible.</p> <p>Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn\u2019t followed and \u201cliked\u201d so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\">Jordan Peterson</a> and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads \u201cLiberty or Death\u201d. That\u2019s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who\u2019d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman\u2019s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations</a> at her state capitol \u2013 which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses \u2013 brought back memories of \u201csome of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.\u201d</p> <p>So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser\u2019s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach <a href=\"https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/05/04/patriots-kicker-justin-rohrwasser-broke-down-crying-tattoo-controversy/\">shared with the Boston Globe</a>. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they\u2019re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hispanic teammates. (<a href=\"https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/kerry-collins-used-the-n-word-at-training-camp-while-drunk-with-carolina-teammates-in-1997-a-year-later-he-was-gone-to-new-orleans-01dxggp6jweh\">He blamed it on the alcohol</a>.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1723166-riley-cooper-caught-on-tape-saying-racial-slur-at-concert\">\u201cfight every nigger here.\u201d</a> (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/04/richie-incognito-leave-miami-what-next-dolphins\">bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin</a> \u2013 \u201ca half-nigger piece of shit,\u201d in Incognito\u2019s estimation \u2013 out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he\u2019s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/24/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-teams-response-interest\">you may well find your football career is over</a>.

We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends <a href=\"https://www.cincyjungle.com/2020/4/28/21238980/bengals-espn-tee-higgins-mother-clemson-tigers-football\">with a bullet point</a> about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/25/nick-bosa-nfl-draft-san-francisco-49ers-colin-kaepernick\">racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked</a> (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year\u2019s draft.</p> <p>For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro \u2013 the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports \u2013 these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What\u2019s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN\u2019s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It\u2019s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings. </p> <p>If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it\u2019s the Patriots\u2019 Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders<strong> </strong>and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a \u201cWest Nile\u201d-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose.</p>",
  "<p>Relaying accurate information, in the normal course of events, is vital. Scrutinising government, in the normal course of events, is also vital. But these are not normal times. And our ability to carry out the functions of a news organisation is reliant on the financial resources that evidence-based reporting requires.</p> <p>However, the Guardian, alongside many businesses, has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Like many other news organisations, we are facing an unprecedented collapse in advertising revenues that further imperil the industry\u2019s sustainability.</p> <p>We rely to an ever-greater extent on our readers both for the moral force to continue doing journalism at a time like this and for the financial strength to facilitate that reporting.</p> <p>And there has never been a greater need for that reporting. At a time when science and reason should be steering public policy, we see conjecture and instinct driving the US\u2019s response. From touting untested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">hydroxychloroquine</a> to suggesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">ingesting bleach</a>, the White House has ventilated anti-science. Drs Birx and Fauci have been all but silenced. Meanwhile, anti-vaxxers are storming state capitols and infiltrating the lockdown protests.</p> <p>Science is fighting hard to be heard but the drumbeat of economic interests is drowning it out. The Guardian, however, will continue to give science a voice so that the US public can make informed decisions based on data, not dogma. Even as coronavirus cases rise across much of the country, the president has become the cheerleader-in-chief for reopening the states. Logic dictates we do otherwise but logic and reason are in short supply. And these decisions matter. It is critical that news organisations properly invigilate government policy and show how it shapes peoples\u2019 lives \u2013 and their deaths. Without reader support, our ability to do so will be limited.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At a time like this, an independent news organisation that fights for data over dogma, and fact over fake, is essential</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In our coverage to date, we have highlighted how this pandemic is disproportionately impacting people of color \u2013 both their health and economic wellbeing. African Americans have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">dying in record numbers</a> because they often live in polluted environments, have less access to healthcare and have more underlying conditions due to toxic stress. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">economic terms</a>, black and Hispanic Americans have been the hardest hit. This gives the lie to the so-called \u201cbooming economy\u201d, which was already under-serving millions and millions of Americans. Race is never far from the surface of the country\u2019s inequalities. With this pandemic, it is front and center.</p> <p>And in our special project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/lost-on-the-frontline\">Lost on the Frontline</a>, we have been determined to record the lives and deaths of frontline workers. Many of these workers are immigrants \u2013 even as this administration uses the pandemic to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/26/donald-trump-xenophobia-re-election-campaign-2020\">further its war</a> on legal and illegal immigration.</p> <p>As an outside news organisation headquartered in the UK, we can bring a different perspective to some of the more bizarre behaviors evident throughout the pandemic.

But here they are encouraged by the president. As Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman from Michigan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">said</a> at the weekend: \u201cBlack people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten state legislators and staff.\u201d</p> <p>As we said, these are not normal times.

But there was an unusual angle to those charges. When arrested and taken to police headquarters for questioning, Laidley was dressed in women\u2019s clothing.</p> <p>The disgraceful actions of a senior constable in allegedly snapping and then distributing on social media pictures of Laidley taken from outside the interview room have been rightly condemned by the public and the force itself.</p> <p>The policeman will be charged and could face up to two years in jail and fines of $40,000. He has been suspended with pay, but is likely to lose his job. Remorseful as he subsequently was, he knew what he was doing was both illegal and immoral.</p> <p>Predictably, those images on Sunday evening were soon doing the social media rounds. Not for the first time, that presented a challenge for mainstream media outlets in terms of their responsibilities. And not for the first time, too many of them failed it.</p> <p>There was obvious voyeuristic appeal in running the photographs. But even the knowledge they had been taken and spread with complete disregard for any notion of basic legal rights wasn\u2019t enough to stop some, with the usual cop-out now reserved for such situations that enough people had already seen them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They didn\u2019t just transgress one individual\u2019s legal rights, they inflicted a whole lot more hurt and pain on a whole lot more people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Except, in the case of the Herald Sun, which has a significant percentage of older readers not likely to be all over social media, that wasn\u2019t necessarily true.</p> <p>Well, not until they saw the Monday morning print edition, which had one photo of Laidley inside the interview room and another of his make-up-smeared face plastered all over the front page.</p> <p>The Herald Sun\u2019s online edition on Monday had an even more confronting juxtaposition. Those same photographs ran alongside a story quoting Victoria police slamming the actions of their own senior constable, and a series of legal opinions all condemning the taking and sharing of the images. Right next to the images.</p> <p>That\u2019s about as ironic as it gets. The hypocrisy however (and the Herald Sun isn\u2019t the only newspaper guilty of it) is in how mental health issues are treated by these same organs which regularly pat themselves on the back about bringing you (insert name\u2019s) \u201cbrave story\u201d and pulling the good citizen card by running contact details for various helplines at the bottom of those stories.</p> <p>Talking that talk is easy when it\u2019s about campaigns or raising funds. Walking the walk for media is a lot harder when there is an immediate case which requires a degree of sensitivity, not to mention in this case an obvious legal issue.</p> <p>Publishing those pictures obviously guaranteed more views and clicks. It also further jeopardised the mental health not only of Laidley, whose lawyer had requested urgent psychiatric treatment for her client, but his three adult children, and yes, the alleged victim of his stalking.</p> <p>The Herald Sun might argue that the wide circulation of the pictures on social media left it no choice. But Melbourne\u2019s other major daily newspaper, The Age, clearly felt it still had one, and chose not to publish the images.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest irony here is that it is the popular media which routinely chooses to portray the world of AFL football as full of immature men behaving badly.</p> <p>And yet the response to the news about Laidley from AFL officials, from Laidley\u2019s colleagues such as former North Melbourne teammates Corey McKernan, David King and former Collingwood coach Mick Malthouse, with whom Laidley worked as an assistant, has uniformly been empathic, not dismissing the serious charges, but at least refusing the opportunity to childishly cackle at the circumstances of his arrest.</p> <p>In contrast, media outlets which did publish the pictures may not have been overtly sniggering in their reportage and commentary, but running the photos amounted to pretty much the same thing.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t just transgress one individual\u2019s legal rights, they inflicted a whole lot more hurt and pain on a whole lot more people. They could have just done the right thing, but chose the bottom line of clicks and dollars.</p> <p>And that makes all those fine words about care for mental health in mainstream media seem hollow indeed.</p> <p>\u2022 Rohan Connolly is managing director of <a href=\"https://footyology.com.au/\">Footyology</a></p>",

I always start with the basic figures, from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland:</p> <ul> <li>US cases: 1,157,875</li> <li>US deaths: 67,677</li> <li>New York cases: 316,415</li> <li>New York deaths: 24,708</li> </ul> <p>New York is the hotspot, other states are badly hit: New Jersey (7,871) and Michigan (4,053) and Massachusetts (4,004) have had the next most deaths.</p> <p>The weekend saw Donald Trump lead his country through the crisis mostly by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJHarrisJr/status/1256935288749752321\">retweeting conspiracy theories</a> and tweeting complaints before staging on Sunday night <strong>a Fox News town hall</strong> which saw more of the latter.</p> <p>Fox News put the event at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall, prompting the 45th president to complain that he had been treated worse by the press than the 16th \u2013 who, remember, guided the Union through a horrific civil war, managed to legislate slavery out of existence and was shot dead on a trip to the theatre.</p> <p>Among other points, Trump boosted efforts in more than half of the states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">to reopen their economies</a> despite warnings from public health experts that it could well be too soon to do so safely; said there would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/trump-adviser-larry-kudlow-coronavirus-relief-aid-sanctuary-cities\">no more stimulus aid</a> for struggling states <strong>without a payroll tax cut</strong>, a controversial move to say the least; and said he had \u201csaved hundreds of thousands of lives\u201d before projecting a final death toll of around 100,000, up from his previous estimate of 65,000 (see 67,677 figure above). </p> <p>Earlier, White House task force member Dr Deborah Birx <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/03/birxs-fox-news-sunday-interview-lays-bare-discord-trumps-coronavirus-response/\">told Fox News Sunday</a>: \u201cOur projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost, and that\u2019s with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance\u201d.</p> <p>Trump also said \u201c<strong>We may have to put out a fire</strong>\u201d, when asked if he was worried about a coronavirus resurgence in the fall.</p> <p>And he said the administration would present evidence for <strong>its claim the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory</strong> \u201cat the right time\u201d. The right time obviously wasn\u2019t ABC\u2019s Sunday talkshow earlier, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">secretary of state Mike Pompeo made the claim</a> and said he\u2019d seen evidence, but didn\u2019t of course provide any.</p> <p>Later the vice-president, Mike Pence, admitted his mistake in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/mike-pence-face-mask-mayo-clinic-visit-coronavirus\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">not wearing a mask</strong></a> while visiting the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last week \u2013 a rare enough step in this administration.</p> <p>Anyway, that Lincoln quote. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/11/abraham-lincoln-verge-book-ted-widmer-interview\">I\u2019m a Lincolnhead</a>, so indulge me.
