As the economy reopens and people return to work, person-to-person contact will increase and an already \u201cshocking number of infections and deaths among workers will rise,\u201d the union said.</p> <p>In its two-page ruling, the appeals court said OSHA is authorized to issue an emergency temporary standard, or ETS, if it determines that employees are exposed to grave danger from a new hazard in the workplace, and that an emergency rule is needed to protect them from that danger.</p> <p>The decision not to issue an ETS \u201cis entitled to considerable deference,\u2019\u2019 the court said.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the regulatory tools that the OSHA has at its disposal to ensure that employers are maintaining hazard-free work environments, OSHA reasonably determined that an ETS is not necessary at this time,\u2019\u2019 the ruling said.</p> <p>The ruling was signed by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao. Henderson and Rao were appointed by Republican presidents and Wilkins by a Democrat.</p> <p>The Labor Department said in a statement Thursday that officials were pleased at the ruling, which backed its contention that existing rules and regulations are protecting Americas workers and that an emergency temporary standard is not needed.</p> <p>\u201cOSHA will continue to enforce the law and offer guidance to employers and employees to keep Americas workplaces safe, said the statement, issued by Loren Sweatt, a top Labor Department official who oversees OSHA, and Kate OScannlain, the department\u2019s top lawyer.</p> <p>OSHA\u2019s performance came under fire at a contentious House hearing last month, in which Democrats accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic.</p> <p>Instead of an emergency standard, OSHA has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps.</p> <p>But the guidance is not mandatory, and Covid-19 cases have spiked at meatpacking plants, prisons, nursing homes and other workplaces deemed essential during the pandemic.</p> <p>AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said he was disappointed that three federal judges \u201cdid not deem the lives of Americas workers worthy of holding an argument or issuing a full opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe post-it length response to the union\u2019s lawsuit acknowledges the unprecedented\u201d nature of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cbut repeats the false claim by Big Business that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration already has done what is needed to protect workers,\u2019\u2019 Trumka said in a statement.</p> <p>More than two million Americans have been infected with Covid-19, and more than 110,000 have died, according a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

Beijing-backed influence operation that deceptively spread messages favorable to the <strong>Chinese </strong>government, including about coronavirus.</p> <p>The company suspended a core network of 23,750 highly active accounts, as well as a larger network of about 150,000 \u201camplifier\u201d accounts used to boost the core accounts\u2019 content.</p> <p>Twitter, along with researchers who analyzed the accounts, said the network was largely an echo chamber of fake accounts without much further traction.</p> <p>The company also removed two smaller state-backed operations which it attributed to Russia and Turkey, both focused on domestic audiences.</p> <p>Twitter said the Chinese network had links to an earlier state-backed operation dismantled last year by Twitter, Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube that had been pushing misleading narratives about political dynamics in Hong Kong.</p> <p>The new operation likewise focused heavily on Hong Kong, but also promoted messages about the coronavirus pandemic, exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui and Taiwan, the researchers said.</p> <p>Renee DiResta, at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the network\u2019s coronavirus activity ramped up in late January, as the outbreak spread beyond China, and spiked in March.</p> <p>\u201cAccounts praised China\u2019s response to the virus, while also using the pandemic to antagonise the United States and Hong Kong activists\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Open-source researchers at Graphika and Bellingcat had earlier flagged the re-emergence of the so-called \u201cSpamouflage

legitimate non-governmental organizations and journalists.</p> <p>A Twitter spokeswoman on Thursday said the network it removed was not related to what the State Department had identified.<br></p>

Or do not socially distance themselves?\u201d Huffman asked during Senate testimony.</p> <p>\u201cCould that just be the explanation of why theres a higher incidence?</p> <p>Dawson, who is black, responded: \u201cThat is not the opinion of leading medical experts in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Dawson was among a number of people testifying in support for the resolution that would establish a variety of resources to address racism in the state.</p> <p>Shibani Chettri, an epidemiology PhD student and researcher at Ohio State University, also testified Tuesday as a proponent for the resolution and said witnessing Huffman\u2019s comments was egregious.</p> <p>\u201cThis really brings attention to how we need to do a better job of addressing pervasive racism in health care if a sitting senator and medical professional can ask these sort of patronizing and racist questions\u201d, Chettri said.</p> <p>In a statement, Huffman said he regretted how his question was perceived.</p> <p>\u201cI asked a question in an unintentionally awkward way that was perceived as hurtful and was exactly the opposite of what I meant,\u201d the senator said.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to focus on why Covid-19 affects people of color at a higher rate since we really do not know all the reasons.\u201d <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee29f888f08969537f780c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:21:40.348Z\">10.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Friday\u2019s UK edition of The Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271188324192063490\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GUARDIAN: Tensions rise over race as more statues are targeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dMT42IvxUU\">pic.twitter.com/dMT42IvxUU</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271188324192063490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee29e508f08969537f780c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:13:36.065Z\">10.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>UK </strong>has scrapped plans for full border checks with the EU on January 1st amid pressures caused by the pandemic, according to Friday\u2019s edition of the Financial Times.</p> <p>It reports that Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has accepted that businesses cannot cope with problems caused by the outbreak and deal with post-Brexit disruption at the border and is considering a temporary light-touch system at ports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271184160531664903\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FT UK: Post Brexit border controls to be limited after government U turn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/x5ZE2AOqeG\">pic.twitter.com/x5ZE2AOqeG</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1271184160531664903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:14:26.793Z\">at 10.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee29c368f08969537f780b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/hannah-devlin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T21:04:51.817Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was no \u201cpatient zero\u201d in the <strong>UK\u2019s Covid-19 epidemic</strong>, according to research showing that the infection was introduced on at least 1,300 occasions.</p> <p>The findings, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, have prompted further criticism that opportunities to suppress the spread of infection in February and March were missed.</p> <p>The study by the consortium \u2013 which was set up to sequence the virus\u2019s genetic code \u2013 shows that introduction of the virus into the UK peaked in mid-March at a time when infection rates were surging in European countries, but before the government clamped down on non-essential travel.

Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House task force Pence chairs, has expressed concern about the protests taking place during the pandemic. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/california-coronavirus-cases-spikes-latest\">nine California counties have reported a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalizations</a>. New diagnoses are up partly due to more available testing, but loosening of restrictions and flouting of public health rules are also factors. </p> <p>Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Mexico City will embark on a large-scale testing effort as the centrepiece of its plan to reopen its economy,</strong> its mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said. The plan sees it diverge from the federal government\u2019s strategy, which has shunned widespread testing as a waste of resources. The goal will be performing about 100,000 tests per month by July and trying to detect and isolate new infections as quickly as possible, Sheinbaum said. The Associated Press reported that it would be paired with an intensive information campaign.</li> <li><strong>France saw a below-average increase in deaths.</strong> The death toll has risen by only 23 \u2013 well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks \u2013 to 29,319. That is the fifth-highest nominal total in the world.</li> <li><strong>Hollywood productions will be allowed to resume from Friday, local authorities said.</strong> While work could resume, cinemas must remain closed, California state officials said.</li> <li><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, has reported a record number of deaths for the second day running</strong> \u2013 even as its metropolis allowed shops to reopen. The centre of the Brazilian epidemic has recorded 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours, raising the state\u2019s confirmed death toll to 9,862, a fourth of the country\u2019s total fatalities, the governor\u2019s office said.</li> <li><strong>The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven into alleged errors made by authorities</strong>. Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst-hit by the virus, will also question the health minister and the interior minister.</li> <li><strong>A US pharmaceutical company claimed a drug specifically designed to treat Covid-19 could be authorised for use as early as September.</strong> The chief scientist at Eli Lilly and Co told Reuters the feat could be achieved if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing.</li> <li><strong>Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined \u20ac10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cord</strong><strong>\u00f3</strong><strong>ba, </strong><strong>where he caught Covid-19</strong><strong>. </strong>Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cord\u00f3ba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants.<br></li> <li><strong>France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned</strong>, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown.

  "<p>Nanette Burstein\u2019s series documentary&nbsp;Hillary&nbsp;(Sky Documentaries) is a four-hour portrait of probably the most famous and divisive female figure in modern politics. It was assembled from more than 2,000 hours of backstage footage from her 2016 election drive, interviews with 45 of the people who know her best (from childhood friends to her campaign aides, alongside her daughter Chelsea and \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you remember this guy but \u2013 her husband Bill) and 35 hours of face-to-face interviews with the woman herself. It interweaves the story of the fateful election with her personal history, recapping her upbringing as the child of staunch Republican Methodist parents, her academic brilliance, the influence of second wave feminism, her professional success as a lawyer and her marriage. There is, of course, much on her political career and the media narratives that have been endlessly constructed and deconstructed around her, as the peaks (such as beating Bernie Sanders in Iowa) and troughs (oh dear God, the troughs) of the campaign trail are navigated.</p> <p>Everything you would expect to be here is here. The problem is that this four-hour portrait has the full involvement of its subject and sanctioned cooperation of everyone around her. We have the friends who attest to her early interest in public service, the professor who talks of her pragmatic, problem-solving attitude and fierce intelligence. The Whitewater scandal is noted, but only&nbsp;Clinton\u2019s disbelief at the subsequent conspiracy theories are given any airtime. The Monica Lewinsky revelations are raked over \u2013 Bill teary-eyed with regret at \u201cthe things I did for years to manage my anxieties\u201d \u2013 as we see the former communications director marvelling at&nbsp;Hillary\u2019s courage during the fallout.</p> <p>It\u2019s not exactly a hagiography, but there is no grit in the oyster. The bookending of each episode with faux-informal chat between her and Burstein as&nbsp;Clinton&nbsp;has her face powdered and prepares for filming proper are cloying attempts at conveyingintimacy. Burstein has spoken about the refusal of any Republicans to take part in the film because, she says, they felt that Clinton\u2019s central involvement would result in their claws being pulled in the edit. Whatever the truth of that, the result is that the closest we get to criticism &nbsp;is a journalist describing her in relation to her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street companies as \u201cextremely confident in her own righteousness \u2013 and that can trip anyone up\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton is rarely pressed on any personal or political issues and in a sense there would be no point in doing so. She has been doing this for too long and under far more extreme and challenging circumstances to give away any morsel of herself more than she chooses now. Weaselly reframings (\u201cI suffer from the responsibility gene\u201d, she says in explanation of her inability to deliver the kind of simple messages demanded by a presidential nominee or candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say something I know isn\u2019t doable\u201d), passive-voiced glosses, and not-quite apologies are allowed to stand. A flash of anger about Sanders (\u201cHe just drove me crazy \u2026 no one wanted to work with him, he got nothing done, he was a career politician\u201d) only serves to throw the careful, controlled blandness of the rest into relief.</p> <p>Of the darker allegations about corruption and sexual scandal that have dogged the Clintons, almost nothing was said.&nbsp;Elsewhere, Burstein has stated that she took a conscious decision not to ask the Clintons about Juanita Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Bill raped her (which he denies), nor any of the other assault allegations, lest it \u201cbecome more about his story than hers\u201d. Hmm.</p> <p>Still, watching her lose to the bullyboy tactics of Trump remains an agony. Her interviews were filmed in November 2018 and you find yourself shaking your head and muttering \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it, lady\u201d in despair. As the final hour of the quartet marched on, it dawned on me that existence since 2016 has been like living in a counterfactual. Someone was writing a what-if novel or film or television series as the Brexit and US election votes came in and somehow there was a slip, a glitch in the matrix, and we have been living with the results ever since. Love&nbsp;Clinton&nbsp;or hate her, it could \u2013 and, according to the popular vote, should \u2013 have been so different.&nbsp;</p>",

When the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies discussed contact tracing in early May, according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888807/S0402_Thirty-second_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">the minutes (pdf)</a> \u201cit agreed that at least 80% of contacts of an index case would need to be contacted for a system to be effective.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But these figures don\u2019t tell the story. There are at least four potential drawbacks.</p> \n  <p><em><strong>1 - Positive cases never referred to the service</strong></em></p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891703/NHS_test_and_trace_bulletin__England__-_28_May_to_3_June_2020.pdf\">statistical bulletin (pdf)</a> from the Department of Health and Social Care says 8,117 people who tested positive between 28 May and 3 June were referred to the test and trace service for England. But these were probably only a small proportion of the new cases that week. According to <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/5june2020\">an ONS survey</a>, there were an estimated 39,000 new cases in England every week during May. Towards the end of the month the infection rate was falling, but these figures suggest thousands of cases are being missed by test and trace, largely because people are getting infected but not getting a test.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>2 - People who don\u2019t cooperate</em></strong></p> \n  <p>In his video message (in which he also says the system will get better over time), Hancock says that 85% \u201cof all those who needed to be contacted\u201d were contacted. That\u2019s misleading. Some 85% of the contacts who were actually identified - ie, people named as having been in close contact with someone who tested positive - were reached by the service and told to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>But only 67% of those who tested positive and whose names were passed on to the service provided names of their contacts. For the 33% who did not provide any names, for obvious reasons 0% of their contacts were contacted.</p> \n  <p>If 5,407 people testing positive provided the names of 31,794 contacts, then on average each Covid-positive person had 5.88 contacts who might be at risk. That means if there were 8,117 people testing positive being referred to the service, there were around 47,700 people in total who needed to be reached and told to self-isolate. In the event 31,794 people were contacted - a \u2018success rate\u2019 of 67%.</p> \n  <p>Arguably that\u2019s still quite reasonable for the first week, but it is well short of Sage\u2019s target of 80%.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>3 - People who don\u2019t cooperate on time</em></strong></p> \n  <p>The figure quoted above is based on the 67% of Covid-positive people referred to the service who did provide details of their contacts. But, as the statistical bulletin shows, only 79% of people provided details of their contacts within 24 hours. <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the chair of the Commons health committee, says that if you ignore the other 25% who took longer, you get a different success rate.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt/status/1271060790599200768\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the face of it these are encouraging no.s.

But, in <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/why-i-broke-boris-johnson\">an article for the New Statesman</a>, he says he has lost faith in the prime minister because he now thinks the PM has given up listening to a wide range of voices and is now intolerant of criticism. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It took six years for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s governments to begin to stop listening to alternative voices. The same patterns had emerged within six months of Johnson becoming prime minister, and within six weeks of his general election victory last December. In her early years the Iron Lady relished argument and intellectual debate \u2013 and those internal jousts strengthened her for the public battles with her true opponents. In the starkest of contrasts, the team inside today\u2019s No 10 has often preferred to greet internal dissent with retribution \u2013 much of it pre-briefed to favoured journalists. Throughout the Westminster village every Tory had quickly learned the score: do, say and tweet as you are told \u2013 or else. In February\u2019s reshuffle we learned that earning the disfavour of key prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings was fatal, even if you were chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone was dispensable. Except Dom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview on the World at One, Montgomerie, who is particularly close to Sajid Javid, the former chancellor who was effectively sacked because he would not let No 10 choose his advisers, said he was especially worried about the influence of Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I worry about is that [Cummings] is a brilliant figure, but half of his ideas are crazy, and half of his ideas are good. He shouldn\u2019t be in a leadership position, he shouldn\u2019t be in a dominant position. And I\u2019m afraid that is what has happened inside Downing Street ... The Vote Leave operation that Dominic Cummings ran during the EU referendum has essentially been transplanted into Downing Street, and there is a lack of diversity in thought and personnel as a result.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6de455cf94a9cdd3a43f6c0b88820254b2b7a3fe\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6de455cf94a9cdd3a43f6c0b88820254b2b7a3fe/165_186_1723_1033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Montgomerie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Montgomerie.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Meddle/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T13:26:52.470Z\">at 2.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2277e8f089c0fbf3588f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T12:47:57.456Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Probation services in England and Wales to be brought back into public ownership</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Probation services in England and Wales will be fully restored to public ownership and control, the justice secretary has announced, marking the final nail in the coffin of Chris Grayling\u2019s disastrous privatisation reforms.</p> \n  <p>Under Grayling\u2019s widely derided shake-up in 2014, the probation sector was separated into a public sector organisation, the National Probation Service (NPS) managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders.</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) previously announced that all offender management, around 80% of all probation work, would be brought under the state-run National Probation Service (NPS).</p> \n  <p>The remaining services, such as rehabilitation and the provision of unpaid work, will no longer be offered up for private tender, the justice secretary said, marking the complete return of probation services to the public sector.</p> \n  <p>Around 2,000 workers at the private providers, known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs), are to be brought over to HM Prison and Probation Service.</p> \n  <p><strong>Robert Buckland</strong> told the Commons: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The delivery of unpaid work, behavioural change programmes will be brought under control of the NPS alongside offender supervision when current CRC contracts end in June next year.</p> \n   <p>This will give us a critical measure of control, resilience and flexibility with these services which we would not have had were they delivered under 12 contracts with an umber of organisations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T13:49:06.816Z\">at 2.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2108c8f0880e1bd40304d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T12:41:47.375Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Much of the Downing Street lobby briefing was taken up with a discussion of the test and trace figures.

The SNP has actively been exploring the idea - <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister recently described it as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/universal-basic-income-ubi-scotland-uk-nicola-sturgeon-coronavirus-a9498076.html\">an idea whose time has come </a>- and the Scottish government had funded a modest pilot to examine the feasibility of the idea.</p> \n  <p>Its <a href=\"https://basicincome.scot/2020/06/10/draft-final-report-cbi-feasibility-study/\">final report</a> is now out. And the Scottish government has concluded that, although the idea is \u201cdesirable\u201d, it would be impossible to introduce one without the support of the UK government because of the way so much welfare and tax policy is still decided in London.</p> \n  <p><strong>Aileen Campbell,</strong> the Scottish government\u2019s communities secretary, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the UK social security system and strengthened calls to further explore how a universal basic income could provide support to people and reduce poverty. We now have the perfect opportunity to take that forward.</p> \n   <p>The Scottish government agree with the report\u2019s conclusion that while introducing a basic income pilot is desirable, it can only be done with the full cooperation and collaboration of all relevant parties, particularly the UK government. That is why I have written to UK ministers urging them to engage constructively with us on this matter and discuss next steps towards a universal basic income pilot.</p> \n   <p>This is now the time to seriously consider a basic income pilot as part of a UK-wide Covid-19 programme of support to ensure a strong and fair economic and social recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s appeal to the UK government for help implementing a universal basic income is almost certainly doomed to failure. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the chancellor, has repeatedly said he is not in favour (eg<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46#block-5e95e8d48f082c29014b0d46\"> here</a>).</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:16:41.317Z\">at 12.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee20e848f089c0fbf358766\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T11:03:30.356Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>After Boris Johnson yesterday said that all pupils would return to school in <strong>England</strong> after the summer holidays, one of the UK\u2019s main teachers\u2019 unions has issued what it calls a \u201cnational education recovery plan\u201d.<br><br>The prime minister said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, will next week issue details of what he called \u201ca huge amount of catch-up for pupils over the summer months\u201d.

The NEUs 10-point plan addresses significant issues that have to be considered.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we has actually peaked in infection rates before we went into lockdown, and that was therefore coming already down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he went on to allege that Ferguson and his epidemiological modelling was discredited. Duncan Smith said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think this piece of information comes from the man who ran the Imperial College model which has been now roundly trashed by almost every single scientist, particularly in Oxford and Edinburgh.

As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Milley and Esper were part of a large entourage that walked with Trump from the White House to the church, moments after a press conference in which the president had threatened the exceptional move of unilaterally sending in US troops to put down unrest in cities around the country if their mayors or governors were not able quickly to restore law and order.</p> \n<p>If states want to resort to using troops to quell protests, they use their local national guard, and the president is constitutionally expected to refrain from using federal military in domestic law enforcement unless requested by a state governor. However, the president has jurisdiction in the District of Columbia, which is not a state and has a mayor but no governor.</p> \n<p>Esper and Milley have said they thought they were merely going to inspect troops who were ranged outside the White House in Lafayette Square, or look at damage to the church located there.</p> \n<p>But before the temporary curfew imposed in Washington DC began, military police and law enforcement suddenly used teargas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs to chase away demonstrators crowded into Lafayette Square, in front of the church.</p> \n<p>TV footage showed people running, falling and scrambling for safety as officers removed them by force. One woman was carried away by fellow protesters because she was injured and unable to walk.

  "<p>Unsurprisingly, Benjamin Netanyahu has now made things starkly clear. On 28 May the Israeli prime minister explained that when \u2013 not if \u2013 his government goes ahead with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/what-would-israel-annexing-the-west-bank-mean\">unilateral annexation</a> of parts of the occupied West Bank, thousands of Palestinian residents would be granted neither citizenship nor equal rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/palestine-says-it-will-declare-statehood-if-israel-annexes-west-bank\">Palestine says it will declare statehood if Israel annexes West Bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly before that, a group of Israeli settlers <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium--1.8894785\">posted a photograph</a> of themselves gazing at a map of what they, like Netanyahu, call by the biblical names of Judea and Samaria, prompting comments from Palestinians \u2013 and liberal Israelis \u2013 that the image captured the institutionalisation of a formal apartheid system. It is hard to argue with that conclusion.</p> <p>Netanyahu made his statement after three deadlocked elections enabled his Likud party to finally <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/27/in-israel-benny-gantz-decides-to-join-with-rival-netanyahu/\">form a coalition</a> with his former rival, the centrist Blue and White leader Benny Gantz. Under their agreement, from 1 July, in coordination with the US, steps will be taken to formally annex illegal Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley.</p> <p>It is not yet certain exactly what will happen. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects are an important variable, given the volatile domestic situation in the US, as are likely reactions from Jordan and Egypt \u2013 the only Arab states to have peace treaties with Israel. But the devil is not in the detail. If annexation of any territory goes ahead it will flagrantly breach international law and countless UN resolutions. It cannot go unanswered. Israel should face sanctions, just as Russia did when it annexed the Crimea from Ukraine.</p> <p>And worse, it will be the final nail in the coffin of what for decades has been rightly seen as the only possible solution to the world\u2019s most intractable and divisive conflict \u2013 two sovereign states for the two peoples who inhabit the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, whether they like it or not (and many, of course, do not).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has become fashionable to argue that Netanyahu\u2019s move will clarify, once and for all, that two states is a fantasy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Increasingly, supporters of Palestinian rights welcome this looming Israeli threat.&nbsp;\u201cBring annexation on!\u201d they insist. The worse, the better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an anarchist or a Marxist to see the latent opportunity in this terrible vision,\u201d as Gideon Levy, the Haaretz columnist, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-let-israel-annex-the-west-bank-it-s-the-least-worst-option-for-palestinians-1.8833755\">argued recently</a>.

The current, \u201cone-state reality\u201d has been in place for a long time.</p> <p>Advocates insist that annexation will mean no longer focusing in vain on a cost-free occupation, but on a rights-based approach that will transform Israel into apartheid-era South Africa, albeit one with more or less equal populations \u2013 not the 11% white minority that ruled from Pretoria until 1994. Impunity will end.</p> <p>Now, it is certainly hard to claim that two states is within reach. No peace negotiations have been held since 2014. In 2008 Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-abbas-olmert/abbas-says-olmert-was-two-months-from-peace-deal-idUSBRE89D0G420121014\">came close to a deal</a> but failed to deliver it. Before that, the high hopes of the first intifada in 1987 evaporated as it became clear that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/10/israel-plo-oslo-agreement-1993\">Oslo agreement of 1993</a> was not going to deliver a Palestinian state. The second intifada dealt them a near-fatal blow. But is there an alternative?</p> <p>The truth is that no one has a remotely workable strategy for achieving one unitary state with equal rights for all. On the Israeli side, the tiny movement of \u201cTwo States, One Homeland\u201d is the nearest anyone has come to mapping out a confederal relationship: that would permit, in theory at least, Palestinians to exercise their right of return and Israeli Jews being able to live in places that matter to them on religious or nationalist grounds. It is a stretch to believe in that, to put it mildly.</p> <p>Annexation will make things worse: short-term risks include the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and an end to what remains of Oslo, a crisis in Israel\u2019s relations with Jordan and Egypt with its de facto allies in the Gulf, and, above all, a resurgence of violence that could make the last intifada look tame. It will also destabilise an already volatile region, offering rich opportunities for Iran and Hizbullah to exploit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Palestinians will suffer directly. \u201cIt will lead,\u201d as the lawyer <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-the-three-most-common-mistakes-about-the-annexation-1.8893292\">Michael Sfard has warned</a>, \u201cto massive expropriation, automatic in some cases, of Palestinian land and property, the subsequent expulsion of individuals, families and entire communities from the annexed territories.\u201d And the situation in blockaded Gaza, home to two million Palestinians, will remain unchanged.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the big picture, annexation will mark a historic turning-point for Palestine. Future historians will compare it with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/17/centenary-britains-calamitous-promise-balfour-declaration-israel-palestine\">Balfour Declaration of 1917</a> and the wars of 1948 and 1967. It will overturn the fundamental principle, recognised by <a href=\"https://ecf.org.il/issues/issue/234\">Britain\u2019s Peel Commission in 1937</a> and by the fledgling United Nations in 1947, that the only way to resolve the conflict is to partition the Holy Land into separate Jewish and Arab states, guaranteeing national self-determination for both peoples who claim it as their own.</p> <p>Amidst unprecedented global distractions, signs of a concerted international response are hardly encouraging. Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d has understandably been dismissed by Palestinians, wherever their loyalties lie. The democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, is not radical enough to undo the damage Trump has caused. The European Union is divided. Britain is preoccupied by the unresolved issues of a post-Brexit world, and looks unlikely to act in any meaningful way.</p> <p>Unilateral annexation will lead Israelis and Palestinians and their profoundly asymmetrical conflict into uncharted territory. But if history teaches one lesson, it is that facts on the ground, illegal or not, are unlikely to be reversed without violence. And even if annexation is delayed or does not happen, the situation will not have improved.

The Department of Justice has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor,\u201d Barr said.</p> <p>He referred to the ICC as \u201clittle more than a political tool employed by unaccountable international elites\u201d.</p> <p>The ICC responded on Thursday night with a statement expressing \u201cprofound regret at the announcement of further threats and coercive actions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court\u2019s judicial proceedings,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey are announced with the declared aim of influencing the actions of ICC officials in the context of the court\u2019s independent and objective investigations and impartial judicial proceedings.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>An attack on the ICC also represents an attack against the interests of victims of atrocity crimes, for many of whom the Court represents the last hope for justice.</p> <p>Judges at the ICC gave the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/05/icc-greenlights-afghanistan-investigation\">green light in March</a> to an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, and began an investigation into crimes by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/20/icc-to-investigate-alleged-israeli-and-palestinian-war-crimes\">Israeli and Palestinian forces </a>in December. In his remarks, Pompeo made clear the US sanctions were also aimed at defending Israel.</p> <p>\u201cGiven Israel\u2019s robust civilian and military legal system and strong track record of investigating and prosecuting wrongdoing by military personnel, it\u2019s clear the ICC is only putting Israel in his crosshairs for nakedly political purposes,\u201d Pompeo said.</p> <p>Human rights activists say that the Israel Defence Forces have operated with<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/12/17/born-without-civil-rights/israels-use-draconian-military-orders-repress\"> virtual impunity in the West Bank and Gaza</a>.</p> <p>The secretary of state urged other ICC members to join its campaign against the court.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot, we will not, stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,\u201d Pompeo said, warning US allies: \u201cYour people could be next, especially those from Nato countries who fought terrorism in Afghanistan right alongside of us.\u201d</p> <p>David Bosco, who wrote a book on the ICC, Rough Justice: The International Criminal Court in a World of Power Politics, said: \u201cI think this is as much directed at the looming Palestine situation as it is at the Afghanistan investigation. The executive order clearly allows for sanctions against ICC personnel who investigate US allies who have not consented to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</p> <p>Bosco, an associate professor at Indiana University, added: \u201cThe actual effect on the court\u2019s Afghanistan investigation will probably not be significant.

Bill Clinton signed for the US in 2000, but said the statute would not be sent to the Senate for ratification until the US had assessed the court\u2019s operations.</p> <p>George W Bush informed the UN in 2002 that the US <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2450&amp;context=faculty_scholarship\">would not join the court</a>.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> has predicted the military will escort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> from the White House should the president lose November\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election</a> but refuse to leave office.</p> \n<p>Biden, speaking to the Daily Show\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/trevor-noah\">Trevor Noah</a>, said that his single greatest concern is that the president will \u201ctry to steal this election\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Democratic presidential nominee cited Trump\u2019s baseless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-mail-in-voting-election-2020-election-attacks\">linking of mail-in ballots to voter fraud</a>, even though he has used this method of voting himself, and his accusations, without evidence, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> are trying to rig the election.</p> \n<p>Before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a> election Trump claimed the poll was rigged against him and even after he triumphed over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> he asserted, again with no evidence, that millions of people voted illegally against him. He estimated this cohort to consist of 3 million votes. This was the number Clinton beat him by in the popular vote, as opposed to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/12/trump-electoral-college-2020-election-popular-vote\">electoral college system</a> that determines who ascends to the White House.</p> \n<p>Biden told Noah that he has thought about a scenario where Trump would refuse to relinquish power after losing the election but said he was confident top military figures would intervene. \u201cI am absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch,\u201d Biden said.</p> \n<p>Trump is trailing Biden in most opinion polls, with the president\u2019s election campaign demanding that CNN retract a \u201cstunt and phony\u201d poll that found the incumbent is trailing his challenger by 14 points. CNN has said it stands by its poll.</p> \n<p>On Thursday afternoon, Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign, said of Biden\u2019s remarks: \u201cThis is just another brainless conspiracy theory from Joe Biden as he continues to try to undermine confidence in our elections.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cPresident Trump has been clear that he will accept the results of the 2020 election.\u201d</p>",

It spurred more than two weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">of worldwide protests</a>.</p> <p>From 1882 to 1986, Congress failed to pass anti-lynching legislation 200 times, but this moment appeared to be different.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cory-booker\">Cory Booker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/tim-scott-senate-floor-speech-racism-police-shootings\">Tim Scott</a>, the only three African American members of the Senate, led the unanimous passage of the legislation in that chamber in 2018 and 2019. The House of Representatives then <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/politics/anti-lynching-bill.html\">passed it by a 410-4 vote</a> in February but renamed it for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">Emmett Till</a>, a 14-year-old boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955.</p> <p>That was the only change that returned the bill to the Senate, which makes Paul\u2019s sudden objection all the more idiosyncratic.</p> <p>The Democratic congressman Bobby Rush, who proposed the House legislation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepBobbyRush/status/1267988133477564417?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe language of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is IDENTICAL to the bill that was unanimously approved by the Senate. The only conclusion I can draw from Rand Paul\u2019s sudden opposition is he has an issue with the House bill being named after Emmett Till.\u201d</p> <p>But Paul, a licensed doctor, is notorious for rousing colleagues\u2019 ire by stalling legislation and for a life and career that are seldom conventional.</p> <p>In 2017 he was physically assaulted by a neighbour while mowing his lawn; in 2018 he visited Russia and delivered a letter from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>; earlier this year he became the first senator to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">test positive</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>, shortly after being the only one to vote against a bipartisan $8bn deal to provide emergency coronavirus funding.</p> <p>He now argues that the anti-lynching legislation is drafted too broadly and could define minor assaults as lynching.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill as written would allow altercations resulting in a cut, abrasion, bruise, or any other injury no matter how temporary to be subject to a 10-year penalty,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMy amendment would simply apply a serious bodily injury standard, which would ensure crimes resulting in substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain be prosecuted as a&nbsp;lynching.\u201d</p> <p>He has previously worked with Democrats in pushing for criminal justice reform and taken a more progressive stance than many Republican colleagues.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://hosted.ap.org/reformer/article/72d611401f3306ac4c058a68ebba83fb/sen-rand-paul-kentucky-strong-words-about-floyds-death\">the Associated Press reported</a>, while speaking with activists in Louisville in his home state of Kentucky, Paul criticised no-knock search warrants, such as the one used at the home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot dead by police in March, and the militarisation of police departments. And he said he is likely to support some form of federal legislation aimed at overhauling police procedures.</p> <p>Challenged about his opposition to the bill, Paul called lynchings a \u201chorror\u201d of American history and said he supports the bill, the AP added, but reiterated that its language is too broad.</p> <p>Last Thursday, as Floyd was mourned at a memorial service in Minneapolis, Paul proposed an amendment to the bill, which would require a vote of the full Senate and would send the bill back to the House \u2013 currently out of session \u2013 for additional consideration.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">The amendment was defeated</a> after emotions ran high on the Senate floor. Booker, of New Jersey, said: \u201cOne man, one man is standing in the way of the law of the land changing because of a difference of interpretation. Does America need a win today on racial justice?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/501652-kamala-harris-insulting-rand-paul-held-up-anti-lynching-bill-on-day-of-george\">Appearing on The View</a> on the ABC network, Harris described the senator\u2019s contrarian stance as \u201cinsulting\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat Rand Paul is doing, which is one man holding up what would be a historic bill recognising one of the great sins of America \u2013 and it was on the day of George Floyd\u2019s funeral which just added insult to injury and frankly made it so painful that on that day that\u2019s what was happening.\u201d</p> <p>Although Paul is often an outlier, there are fears that the holdup could be indicative of wider Republican reluctance to tackle systemic racism in the police and embrace reforms. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moevela?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Moe Vela</a>, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, said on Wednesday: \u201cMy thoughts on it are very simple: birds of a feather.</p> <p>\u201cIf Rand Paul somehow doesn\u2019t believe we need an anti-lynching bill in the United States and his Republican colleagues can\u2019t get him to release the hold, to me it says everything Americans need to know about the Republican party. Either you\u2019re for lynching or you\u2019re against lynching. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer</a>, a political commentator and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, was less critical, noting the consistency of Paul\u2019s libertarian streak.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that he wants to strengthen the bill with certain language as an amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want it to go away. He wants it to be strengthened from his perspective.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a bit out of step with the political climate that we\u2019re in \u2026 So he\u2019s going to get the backlash, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/tim-scott-says-he-wants-to-team-up-with-rand-paul-on-anti-lynching-bill\">Senator Tim Scott said</a> he\u2019s going to talk to him and see if they can work something out in the language. I think they will come to some type of agreement and it will eventually pass. I don\u2019t see it being held up forever.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Protesters have pulled down a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Civil War-era president of the Confederacy, amid continuing protests triggered by the police killing of George Floyd and the wider issue of racism in the US.</p> <p>The statue of Jefferson, a Mississippi Democrat who served as the president of the Confederate states from 1861 until 1865, was toppled shortly before 11pm in Richmond, Virginia, the place Davis set up as his capital.</p> <p>Police were on the scene in Monument Avenue and videos on social media showed the statue being towed away as a crowd cheered.</p> <p>There are escalating efforts worldwide to remove statues associated with slavery and racial oppression, which have resulted in the toppling of the statue of the prominent slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, UK, and the removal of monuments to Belgium\u2019s King Leopold II.</p> <p>In Barcelona on Thursday afternoon the statue of Christopher Columbus that has stood at the foot of La Rambla since 1888 appeared on Google and Google Maps as the \u201cstatue of Columbus the enslaver and colonizer\u201d after someone&nbsp;tweaked the pages. In 2016 a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/call-to-topple-christopher-columbus-statue-from-its-barcelona-perch\">group of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/call-to-topple-christopher-columbus-statue-from-its-barcelona-perch\">councillors in the city called for the statue</a>&nbsp;to be removed on the grounds that it glorified the conquest of America and said it should be replaced with a memorial reflecting \u201cAmerican resistance to imperialism, oppression and indigenous and African-American segregation\u201d.</p> <p>The toppling of the Davis statue in Virginia came a day after protesters tore down a Christopher Columbus in Richmond which was set on fire before being dumped in a nearby lake. A second statue of Columbus was torn down in Minnesota, while other Columbus statues in Houston and Miami were splattered with red paint.</p> <p>The statues have been targeted by campaigners, including Black Lives Matter and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the US, as an offensive reminder of slavery and racial oppression.</p> <p>Other statues on Richmond\u2019s tree-lined mall include monuments to the Confederate military figures JEB Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Matthew Fontaine Maury and Gen Robert E Lee, all of which have been graffitied in recent days, as well as a bronze statue of the black American tennis player Arthur Ashe put up in the 1990s amid resistance from some so-called \u201cheritage\u201d groups.</p> <p>Among graffiti painted on the Davis monument was the question: \u201cHow much more blood?\u201d</p> <p>In a comment piece in Politico reflecting on the removal of Davis\u2019s statue John F Harris who lived in Richmond in the 1990s described the dynamic that saw the statues pushed to the forefront of debate.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did I tolerate, and even, at times, take friends to see the statues?\u201d wrote Harris. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the legacy of the Confederacy didn\u2019t offend me. It was that the statues depicted a history that seemed functionally dead. They also seemed like a joke\u2014and the joke was on the very racists who had erected them in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWhat has become steadily more clear over the years\u2014and crystallized dramatically in the national reckoning over the murder of George Floyd\u2014is that the history the statues depict is not dead. The throngs of protesters on Monument Avenue in recent days gathered precisely because they know the symbolism of the statues is very much alive\u2014toxic and radiant.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for the removal of Confederate statues and symbols had become a prominent area of contention even before the protests triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&nbsp;has urged Congress to take steps to remove from the US Capitol 11 statues representing Confederate leaders and soldiers from the civil war. \u201cTheir statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to leaders of a congressional committee in charge of managing the statues in the Capitol.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing US military leaders expressed a willingness to rename bases associated with Confederate figures \u2013 such as forts Bragg, Benning, AP Hill and Lee \u2013 a move, however, that was firmly rejected in a tweet by Donald Trump on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cMy Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOur history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\u201d</p> <p>Along with Lee and the distinctive rebel flag, Davis has long been one of the most prominent symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy and the target for removal.</p> <p>The statue was knocked down, and then removed by police, just a week after the mayor of Richmond, Levar Stoney, said he planned to push legislation to remove all four of the prominent Confederate monuments on Monument Avenue.</p> <p>\u201cRichmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy \u2013 it is filled with diversity and love for all \u2013 and we need to demonstrate that,\u201d Stoney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>But amid the outrage over the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, which has triggered nationwide and international protests over systemic racism against black people, including against statues seen as symbols of racial oppression, protesters took matters into their own hands.</p> <p>Like many other civil war-era monuments, the Richmond statue of Davis \u2013 regarded as a weak and divisive leader even within the Confederacy he led \u2013 was put up decades after the conclusion of the conflict, in 1907, amid a revisionist romanticisation of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d.</p> <p>Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, had already said he planned to order the removal of the Gen Robert E Lee statue from Monument Avenue a move now blocked by a court ruling.</p> <p>The toppling of Davis\u2019s statue, which depicted him at the moment of his resignation speech, is one of 10 controversial statues to have been removed in recent days. Branches of the US military and the Nascar stock car racing association said they would ban Confederate symbols, including flags.</p> <p>In Richmond there has also been pressure from the local branch of the NAACP to rename the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis Highway.</p> <p>Unpopular even among many of his own generals, Davis was arrested and imprisoned at the conclusion of the war before being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1868.</p> <p>Protesters in Portsmouth, about 80 miles from Richmond, beheaded and then pulled down four other statues that were part of a Confederate monument on Wednesday, according to media outlets.</p>",

judge appointed to review the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss criminal charges against <strong>Michael Flynn</strong> has concluded that the move represented an abuse of power.</p> \n  <p>Former US district judge <strong>John Gleeson </strong>argued in a new court filing that the justice department\u2019s motion to dismiss should be denied because there is \u201cclear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gleeson, who was appointed by US district judge <strong>Emmet Sullivan </strong>to review the unusual request, accused the justice department of engaging in \u201chighly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Flynn, <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 about his contact with the former Russian ambassador to the US. </p> \n  <p>Flynn was waiting to be sentenced by Sullivan when the justice department announced it was moving to drog the charges against him. The situation has put Sullivan in a unique and difficult position, and the judge will now have to determine whether to grant the justice dpeartment\u2019s request.</p> \n  <p>If Sullivan moves forward with sentencing, Flynn\u2019s team will almost certainly appeal the decision, so this legal saga is likely to continue.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T17:11:13.951Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee10d7a8f08beee219d908a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T16:52:04.349Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">More than 1,200 former DOJ staffers call for investigation into Barr's role in removing protesters</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 1,200 former employees of the justice department are calling for an investigation into attorney general <strong>William Barr</strong>\u2019s role in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters from near the White House last week.</p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dojalumni/doj-alumni-letter-to-inspector-general-michael-horowitz-8011bb12167b\">a letter</a> to the justice department inspector general <strong>Michael Horowitz, </strong>the former staffers said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the Department\u2019s actions, and those of Attorney General William Barr himself, in response to the nationwide lawful gatherings to protest the systemic racism that has plagued this country throughout its history, recently exemplified by the brutal killings of <strong>George Floyd</strong> and <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong> by sworn law enforcement officers acting under the color of law.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The letter noted that those who have signed on to the request have worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations.
