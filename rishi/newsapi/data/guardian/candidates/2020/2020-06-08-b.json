Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, spoke to Trump on Monday afternoon by phone when he said they discussed \u201cthe importance of keeping Nato strong in an increasingly competitive world\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/trump-orders-9500-us-troops-to-leave-germany\">Donald Trump orders 9,500 US troops to leave Germany</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That came after the defence chief made some pointed observations to the Nato 2030 conference: \u201cThe challenges that we face over the next decade are greater than any of us can tackle alone. Neither Europe alone. Nor America alone. So we must resist the temptation of national solutions.\u201d</p> <p>Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee in the UK parliament, said he was not certain that Trump\u2019s decision was final and that it would be challenged by the US military.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWeakening Nato in the hope this will lead to increased German defence is a dangerous game which plays into Russia\u2019s hands.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s decision comes after several years of complaining about Nato, without taking any specific action. In July 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/donald-trump-nato-summit-chaos-germany-attack-defence-spending\">he threatened \u201cgo it alone\u201d</a> if Nato members \u2013 and in particular Germany \u2013 did not raise their defence spending to 2% of GDP in order to reduce the cost incurred by the US from providing transatlantic defence against Russia.</p> <p>Others add that the real damage would be to the already battered diplomatic credibility of the White House. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, said Trump\u2019s surprising decision would encourage European nations \u201cto listen less to the US\u201d while he remained in power.</p> <p>Bastian Giegerich, director of defence and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said that until now \u201cUS officials had argued Europeans should not listen to what Trump says and instead look at what he does.\u201d The latest threat means \u201cthis had gone out of the window\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The move has been widely interpreted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/world/europe/germany-troop-withdrawal-america.html\">as a personal rebuff to Angela Merkel</a> following what was reportedly a frosty phone call between the two at the end of May, when the German chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/merkel-wont-attend-trumps-in-person-g7-unless-course-of-pandemic-changes\">torpedoed Trump\u2019s hopes to hold a G7 summit in the US in June</a>.</p> <p>Historically, the military alliance between the two countries has been close. US troops have been deployed in Germany since the end of the second world war, and although the numbers are sharply down from the 400,000 at the height of the cold war, their presence is partly designed to deter Russian aggression.</p> <p>Jamie Shea, professor of strategy and security at the University of Exeter, said troop numbers \u201cwere always an exercise in political psychology\u201d but one that mattered given that, with troops stationed in all three Baltic states, Nato faces as many as 500,000 Russian troops in its western military district.</p> <p>Estimates from the <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/blogs/military-balance/2018/07/us-and-nato-allies-costs-and-value\">IISS thinktank suggest that the US </a><a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/blogs/military-balance/2018/07/us-and-nato-allies-costs-and-value\">spent about $36bn (\u00a328bn) on European defence in 2018</a>, compared with total defence spending of European Nato allies of $239.1bn; a cost that countries like the UK, France and Germany would not be able to make up, particularly in the light of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>Experts say the US cannot operate in the Middle East or Afghanistan without the vast Ramstein air base in western Germany, which acts as a logistics staging post, while Stuttgart is also the headquarters of the US Africa Command as well as its European operations.</p> <p>Shea, a former Nato spokesperson and senior official, said: \u201cI see a lot of pain and not much gain, as you still have to pay the troops wherever they are based,\u201d although he wanted to see full details of what the US was proposing, amid reports that some of the US troops could be moved to Poland.</p> <p>But Karin von Hippel, the director general of the Royal United Services Institute, cautioned western countries from overreacting to what she described as characteristic grandstanding from Trump: \u201cI just don\u2019t think it will be implemented in the next few months before a presidential election because Congress or the Pentagon will find ways to block it; but if he wins, then, yes, anything can happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The latest job numbers in the United States are a warning that during this time we need to more than ever keep our heads and not fall for spin or conspiracy.&nbsp;</p> <p>When analysing Donald Trump, it is never clear if he is lying, ignorant or deluded.

But normal has not only left the room, it has left the building and caught the last train for the coast.&nbsp;</p> <p>Employment grew 2.9% in May, but it fell 14.4% in April.

  "<p>Democrats in Congress have unveiled a sweeping new set of proposals aimed at reforming policing and transforming law enforcement across the country.</p> \n<p>The new legislation, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, comes during ongoing mass protests across the country in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">death of George Floyd while under police custody</a>, and is the most ambitious change to law enforcement sought by Congress in years.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,\u201d said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, drawing on the nation\u2019s history of slavery.</p> \n<p>Before unveiling the package, House and Senate Democrats including Chuck Schumer, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Cory Booker, held a moment of silence at the Capitol\u2019s Emancipation Hall, reading the names of Floyd and others killed during police interactions.</p> \n<p>They wore kente cloths handed out by the Congressional Black Caucus and knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds, now a symbol of police brutality and violence \u2013 it is the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned under a white police officer\u2019s knee before he died.</p> \n<p>Representative Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which is leading the effort, called it bold and transformative.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in this country,\u201d Bass said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA profession where you have the power to kill should be a profession where you have highly trained officers that are accountable to the public,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>The legislation would ban chokeholds by police, including the one used for Floyd, set up a national database for tracking police misconduct and would bar types of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">\u201cno-knock\u201d warrants</a>, according to an early draft.</p> \n<p>The bill also aims to make it easier to pursue legal damages when police violate civil rights, stop racial profiling and racial bias in policing, and limit the transfer of military hardware to police forces.</p> \n<p>However, the package stops short of fulfilling calls by leading activists to defund the police, a push to dismantle or reduce financial resources to police departments that has struck new intensity in the weeks of protests since Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>In Minnesota on Sunday, Minneapolis city council members voted to disband the police force there and rethink how it handles emergency response, with a focus on community and social services. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a first step. There is more to come,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cOnce the House passes the Justice and Policing Act [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell will, hopefully, take it up. During the Congress, the president must not stand in the way of justice, the Congress and the country will not relent until this legislation is made into law.\u201d</p> \n<p>The presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who will visit Floyd\u2019s family in Houston, Texas, has backed a ban on chokeholds and other elements of the package. On Monday, his campaign issued a statement saying that though he \u201cshares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d he \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the bill\u2019s path to becoming law is likely to be precarious, and has to go through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is unclear if law enforcement and the powerful police unions will back any of the proposed changes or if congressional Republicans will join the effort.</p> \n<p>Throughout the press conference on Monday, the Democratic lawmakers vowed to fight for its passage \u2013 a subtle concession that the proposal may actually stall somewhere in the legislative process.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has never been done before. At the federal level in the Senate Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this a reality,\u201d Schumer said. He added that \u201cnow we must collectively, all Americans, raise our voices and call on Leader McConnell, to put this reform bill on the floor of the Senate before July, to be debated and voted on\u201d.</p> \n<p>A far less controversial bill that would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">explicitly make lynching a federal crime</a> for the first time in US history stalled just last week.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200224/BILLS-116hr35-SUSv2.pdf\" title=\"\">Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act</a> is named&nbsp;after the 14-year-old black boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi</a>, whose death helped spark the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Though the bill passed overwhelmingly in the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives earlier this year, one Republican senator has succeeded in blocking its path.</p> \n<p>Republicans responded to the bill by arguing&nbsp;it was a move to effectively defund police everywhere. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee both sent out statements saying Democrats wanted to defund police&nbsp;departments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat once lived on the liberal fringe has now broken through in serious way,\u201d said the NRSC communications director, Jesse Hunt. \u201cSenate Democrats everywhere are going to have to answer to voters about how they plan to keep Americans safe while their party seeks to \u2018defund the police\u2019.\u201d<br><br></p> \n<p>Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign manager, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1270021700718034944\">weighed in on Twitter</a>, claiming: \u201cDemocrats like Joe Biden want to defund the police.

OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high... We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE4y_9Hj2S/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/drew-brees-nfl-trump-instagram-trnd/index.html\">Brees then addressed the president directly</a> in an Instagram post, saying he stood by his apology. \u201cWe can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThrough my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag.

  "<p>Pressure from Facebook staff is continuing to mount on Mark Zuckerberg over his policies towards posts by Donald Trump, with moderators joining those criticising their boss for his stance.</p> <p>The moderators penned an open letter to their colleagues in support of virtual walkouts that have broken out at the company, after Zuckerberg refused to take down posts by Trump that many believed breached the site\u2019s policies on incitement of violence.</p> <p>\u201cWe would walk out with you \u2013 if Facebook would allow it,\u201d the moderators write. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@fbcontentmods/this-is-a-message-of-solidarity-from-a-group-of-current-and-former-content-moderators-at-facebook-6af1b3b2a020\">In their statement</a>, all the company\u2019s currently employed moderators remained anonymous, highlighting the precarious nature of their employment, which is subcontracted out through third parties.</p> <p>\u201cAs outsourced contractors, non-disclosure agreements deter us from speaking openly about what we do and witness for most of our waking hours. Safety and data protection are important, but so is a healthy debate about what happens at Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t walk out, but we cannot stay silent \u2026&nbsp;Facebook can do better,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cWe need to express that Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s words about personal dismay caused by Trump\u2019s \u2018looting and shooting\u2019 rhetoric are not enough. The benefit of the doubt this politician is being given as a user, even with such a large platform, is unparalleled \u2013 the attempt to retroactively place his words behind the context of other posts actually has had effect of putting it on an isolated pedestal. This may be the ultimate exhibit of white exceptionality and further legitimisation of state brutality we have witnessed in the last weeks.\u201d</p> <p>The precariousness of their employment situation has even limited the ability of the moderators to put together a statement of support. \u201cWe are so alienated, even more with working from home,\u201d one currently employed moderator told the Guardian. They, and a colleague, both asked to speak anonymously for fear that they would lose their jobs for breaking a non-disclosure agreement. \u201cWe are not able to speak freely because we communicate mainly on the company channels. It\u2019s really tricky to even talk about it, to find someone and ask if they want to sign this sort of statement.\u201d</p> <p>The letter was co-ordinated by the <a href=\"https://www.foxglove.org.uk/\">legal nonprofit Foxglove</a>, whose co-founder Cori Crider said: \u201cZuckerberg could do so much more to make his platform safe and equal, and the real experts in that are the moderators themselves \u2013 people who clear the hate speech and violence off Facebook day in and day out.&nbsp;But their contracts are so precarious it\u2019s almost impossible for them to organise, or to speak up the way employees can. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/02/google-workers-sign-letter-temp-contractors-protest\">Google walkout showed massive&nbsp;solidarity&nbsp;with Google\u2019s precarious contract workers</a>; this is a golden opportunity for Facebook staff to follow suit.\u201d</p> <p>The walkouts began on 1 June, as dissatisfaction within Facebook spilled out into the public sphere. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump\">Employees took to Twitter</a> to state their opposition to Zuckerberg\u2019s personal decision to take no action against Trump for a post published amid unrest in Minneapolis that said \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. Twitter hid Trump\u2019s post and added a warning, but Zuckerberg decided to leave the post intact.</p> <p>Employees then staged a virtual walkout that was quickly endorsed by the company as an act of protest. \u201cWe encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said at the time.</p> <p>After the walkouts, pressure mounted: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/02/mark-zuckerberg-criticised-by-civil-rights-leaders-over-donald-trump-facebook-post\">employees resigned</a> as activist leaders condemned Zuckerberg for \u201csetting a very dangerous precedent\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/06/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-scientists\">more than 140 scientists directly funded</a> by the Facebook founder\u2019s personal charity called on him to take action over the weekend. On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/05/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-policies-review\">Zuckerberg made another public statement</a>, promising to \u201creview potential options\u201d for how to intervene.</p> <p>As well as expressing general support for their directly employed colleagues, the moderators wanted to highlight the direct effects racism and police brutality has on their work. \u201cWe are definitely seeing more difficult content in our [moderation] queues recently,\u201d one told the Guardian. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of police brutality \u2013&nbsp;the images we are seeing from the US are just terrible. My colleague told me they are quitting the queues today because they saw three videos from the protests in a row and they can\u2019t handle it.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re also seeing an increase in hate speech and racism, not only in our queues but also amongst ourselves. I have heard a few people, who I would have never expected, express racist opinions \u2013&nbsp;this work is impacting our attitudes and our views.\u201d</p> <p>The moderators\u2019 letter ends with a plea to Zuckerberg \u201cand the rest of Facebook management to reconsider this decision [to take no action against] Donald Trump, to listen and honour the voices of its black employees and users.</p> <p>\u201cTo the employees themselves \u2013 solidarity. Let\u2019s mourn. Let\u2019s organize. Let\u2019s unionize. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d</p>",

My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</em></p> \n  <p><em>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families. So I think we need to keep that in mind as well.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Florida congresswoman and former Orlando police chief, <strong>Val Demings</strong>, was also on the show and disagreed with Wolf\u2019s comments. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to solve some of America\u2019s toughest problems, <strong>we\u2019ve got to be painfully honest about what those problems are</strong>,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know that we have been fighting systemic racism in this country for 400 years. We know that it has found its \u2013 or reared its ugly head in law enforcement agencies, in housing, in education, in \u2013 in too many other places. And so while I heard what the secretary said, we have a lot of work to do. And systemic racism is always the ghost in the room.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Demings, who is a potential running mate for Joe Biden in November, spoke about <strong>her own experiences after a 27-year career as a police officer</strong> in Orlando.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked beside some of the bravest men and women with hearts big as gold that America has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cWas everybody perfect? Were we completely perfect? Of course not. But what I have seen across the nation involving law enforcement officers and their reaction, in many instances unprovoked, has been extremely troubling. And what we have to do as a nation is hold police accountable, provide the necessary oversight to do that, look at training standards, look at use of force policies, look at who we are hiring, look at diversity within those agencies, and come together and create legislation that will support initiatives like that.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edcf4d68f0883ec2fc1c60f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T14:22:29.485Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has said the <strong>national guard are withdrawing from Washington DC</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control,\u201d wrote the president on Twitter. \u201cThey will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed.

  "<p>With the US presidential election looming, equal rights groups and others on the left say the protests<strong> </strong>sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death can translate into a surge in young people voting in November.</p> <p>While Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic response to the demonstrations has shocked young people into action in the US and beyond, advocates believe the movement against police brutality has energized youth voters to think beyond the presidential election, which could have a real impact on state and local elections, where decisions about policing and criminal justice are made.</p> <p>Around the country, people running for local office say they are already seeing a spike in enthusiasm among 18- to 29-year-olds, who historically vote in smaller numbers than their elders.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many young kids reaching out to our campaign, saying: \u2018How do we volunteer, can I intern to learn more, I\u2019d really like to run for office,\u201d said Nada Elmikashfi, a 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.nadaforwisconsin.com/\">candidate for state senate</a> in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cI think whatever political apathy afflicted our generation, it isn\u2019t a choice any more.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Elmikashfi, who has been part of protests in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, said the brutal death of Floyd has \u201cbrought a lot of attention on down-ballot races\u201d, but she isn\u2019t sure whether that enthusiasm will carry over to the presidential election, where Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for his responses to the demonstrations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64da25304afa6480725db6d2252d97f1fce0dac3\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom conversations that I\u2019ve been having with people my own age, and whether this is right and wrong, it\u2019s this idea that the Democrats are putting Trump as \u2018This is the sole reason you should vote for us\u2019,\u201d Elmikashfi said.</p> <p>\u201cI think constituencies across the country are put in a tight spot, where you have a fascist president who is incredibly destructive to America, but then you also have Democratic party leadership that isn\u2019t very progressive, that doesn\u2019t uplift the working class, but that feels entitled to your vote.</p> <p>\u201cYoung kids understand Trump is more damaging, the question is: is it really gonna change under Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to Floyd\u2019s death, and the ensuing surge in protests nationwide, has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-police-oversight-board/\">included him musing</a> that police officers could shoot suspects in the leg, \u201cinstead of in the heart\u201d, a suggestion that seemed to overlook the issue of people of color being apprehended at far higher rates than white people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The former vice-president, who is 78 years old, struggled to attract young supporters during the Democratic primary, weighed down by a problematic record that includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\">opposing bussing minority students</a> to different school districts, and his lead role in a 1994 \u201ctough on crime\u201d law that some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">blame for mass incarceration</a> in the US, and seems in danger of misjudging the level of emotion and the desire for change.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of George Floyd is emblematic of everything that\u2019s wrong with America, whether it\u2019s how we handle Covid, to the existing racism and police brutality that black and brown communities have suffered for years,\u201d said Moumita Ahmed, who is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disruptionary?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">running for district leader</a> in New York\u2019s 24th assembly district.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ahmed, 30, said Floyd\u2019s death, along with the recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\"> in Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\">Breonna Taylor</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\"> in Kentucky</a> had \u201copened eyes for a lot of young people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger generation are just so much more aware and active and ready to make a difference,\u201d said Ahmed, who co-founded the group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bernlennials\">Millennials for Bernie</a>, which supported Bernie Sanders during his 2016 and 2020 election campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people are going to start paying attention to local elections,\u201d Ahmed said.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government can do a lot, but the local government has a lot of power in the police departments. They can do so much more than the federal government.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is precedent for protest movements prompting real change. In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\">stronger gun laws</a>, while young climate activists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/the-weekly/democrats-climate-change-green-new-deal.html\">succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal</a> environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed.</p> <p>On Monday George Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence Floyd, called for people to vote in November, particularly in statewide and local elections like Ahmed and Elmikashfi\u2019s. That effort to build on the energy of the past two weeks is being supported by organizations like <a href=\"https://www.organizing20.org/\">Organizing 2.0</a>, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, which aims to build equal rights in the US.</p> <p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the <a href=\"http://naacpyc.org/\">NAACP youth &amp; college division</a>, said it has been registering people to vote at demonstrations, demonstrate how the voting process works and help people find their voting precincts. Loftin said young people had been stunned by Trump\u2019s advocating of violence against protesters and \u201cencouragement of police violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is resonating with young black voters across the country, they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Loftin said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re done. So that is definitely a motivation to go to the polls. I want to be clear \u2013 it\u2019s not a scare tactic. We\u2019re not afraid of Donald Trump being president for another four years.\u201d</p> <p>Loftin said the NAACP has also encouraged people to take part in the 2020 census, a once-a-decade event that will influence the amount of government funding neighborhoods receive, and potentially how they are represented in Ccongress. Like Ahmed and Elmikashfi, she said local races are just as important as the headline-grabbing Trump v Biden election.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a laser focus on district attorney races, mayoral races, district races, the president and what their decisions are going to mean for how black folks in this country walk and experience their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of participating in elections was on the minds of people at a protest in New York City on Tuesday, where thousands walked through Manhattan to demonstrate at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another stage of this movement that does need to happen. I think voting is important,\u201d said Justin Withers, 23.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that this does change the voting. I hope it does. We\u2019ve failed in the past but I hope now because it\u2019s so many people that people will finally wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Just 46.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">voted in the 2016 presidential election</a>, compared with an overall turnout of 61.4%. The highest turnout, meanwhile, was among people aged 65 and over, who are statistically more likely to be conservative.</p> <p>In the 2018 midterms, the less glamorous elections that re-elect members of the House of Representatives and some senators as well as local officials, 36% of young people voted \u2013 although this was a big increase on the 20% of 18 \u2013 29-year-olds who voted in the 2014 midterms.</p> <p>That could suggest interest and awareness is growing among younger voters. Although Withers, who lives in Brooklyn, predicted that despite renewed enthusiasm, the turnout in 2020 would remain relatively low among people of color \u2013 due to efforts in states around the US to make it more difficult for black people, and other minority groups, from voting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">the Voting Rights Act was weakened</a> in 2013, many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/which-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election\">brought in laws making it more difficult to vote</a>, from purging people from electoral rolls if they have not voted in a given amount of time, to preventing efforts to register voters, to requiring government-issued photo ID to vote \u2013 something people of color and low-income Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">are less likely to have</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is voter suppression is still happening,\u201d Withers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still 10 times harder for the people who know what\u2019s right, for the people who are minorities, to be able to vote. That\u2019s still a problem. And because of that I know that it won\u2019t be the numbers we want.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Moments before powerlifters attempt a superhuman feat of strength, they like to hold a capsule of ammonia to their nose, snort deeply, and feel a huge jolt of adrenaline rip through their bodies. But it is going to take far more than smelling salts to revive weightlifting\u2019s reputation after the publication of a truly eye-bulging independent investigation by the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren. Corruption. Cronyism. Cover-ups. Bribes. An omerta that would impress the five families. It\u2019s all there in <a href=\"https://mclarenweightliftingenquiry.com/wp-content/themes/mclarenweightlifitingenquiry/assets/mclaren-independent-investigator-report-iwf-final.pdf\" title=\"\">a 122-page report</a> that leaves the reader feeling they have bathed in a fetid swamp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/06/ioc-very-serious-allegations-weightlifting\">IOC concerned by \u2018very serious\u2019 doping allegations in weightlifting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Think Fifa and double it. The IAAF and quadruple it. McLaren\u2019s investigation found that more than $10m (around \u00a37.9m) was unaccounted for in the books of the International Weightlifting Federation, that 40 doping positives were covered up and vote-buying to ensure the re-election of the former president Dr Tamas Ajan was rampant. And that was just for starters.</p> <p>The Hungarian, a senior figure in the sport since 1976, also \u201cran the IWF as if it was his own personal fiefdom\u201d, concluded McLaren, whose team also established that Ajan was \u201cthe sole person making all cash deposits into the IWF\u2019s bank accounts\u201d and \u201cmillions of dollars in cash withdrawals conducted by Ajan were never recorded\u201d.</p> <p>A confidential witness told McLaren\u2019s investigation team that at one point Ajan even called up the head of the Albanian weightlifting federation and issued an ultimatum: pay a $100,000 fine for doping offences \u2013 in cash \u2013 or his team would not go to the Rio Olympics. Cue a comical scene involving four Albanian officials taking $25,000 each in cash on a road trip from Tirana to Budapest. At least Ajan gave them a receipt.</p> <p>Other countries \u2013 including Russia and Romania \u2013 did not even get that. No wonder an expert in money laundering quoted in McLaren\u2019s report described Ajan\u2019s modus operandi as apparently \u201csymptomatic of corruption or criminal activity\u201d. Investigators also uncovered a deleted letter addressed to Ajan from the Azerbaijan National Olympic Committee\u2019s president in 2016 \u2013 thanking him for delaying the doping suspensions of certain Azeri weightlifters so they could compete. Meanwhile, McLaren\u2019s report notes the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections were \u201castonishingly bribery prone\u201d, with Ajan securing his presidency \u201cby paying member federations cash bribes ranging from $5,000-30,000 to vote for him and his team of cronies\u201d.</p> <p>It is astounding stuff. The question is, why did all this take so long to come out? Part of the explanation, surely, is that Ajan established a culture of fear, with McLaren also reporting: \u201cIn one historical instance, he stated to a confidential witness that he could turn their athletes\u2019 samples \u2018dirty\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of financial scrutiny must be another factor. Until 2009, the work of the IWF\u2019s internal auditors committee consisted of \u201cgoing to Budapest, collecting $100 or a bottle of whiskey and listening to Ajan say: \u2018Here you are, here are the books. Sign them and we go to dinner.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ac81f34f6f8083ae8dcb868edae719103a95a0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac81f34f6f8083ae8dcb868edae719103a95a0f/0_216_3445_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamas Ajan, the Hungarian former president of the International Weightlifting Federation, pictured in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamas Ajan, the Hungarian former president of the International Weightlifting Federation, pictured in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rotten people in rotten sports federations largely get away with it because there is no sports sheriff to watch over them, no sports judge to jail miscreants and little public thirst in scrutiny. No one cares enough.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee, whose money keeps many sports organisations afloat, could do it although it has previously shown scant sign of wanting to do so. Indeed, McLaren\u2019s report recounts that when Dr Antonio Urso, the president of the European Weightlifting, complained millions were missing from the IWF\u2019s Swiss bank accounts more than a decade ago nothing was done \u2013 with the IOC ethics commission stating it was an issue for the individual federations. Since the report has been published the IOC has issued a statement noting the \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d contents of McLaren\u2019s report and undertaking to \u201csupport the efforts\u201d of IWF to reform its governance.</p> <p>The answer, surely, is for an independent enforcer, packed with serious investigative muscle, to scrutinise international sports bodies more closely. Why not McLaren and his team, given their record with weightlifting and, before that, Russian state-sponsored doping. There is an obvious problem, though: who would fund it? As things stand, it is journalists who usually shine the initial light. McLaren began his investigation at the behest of the IWF after the ARD documentary Lord of the Lifters. The German broadcaster also exposed the extent of Russian doping \u2013 and how the IAAF had accepted secret payments to ignore doping cases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/hafthor-bjornsson-game-of-thrones-mountain-breaks-world-deadlift-record\">Hafthor Bjornsson, Game of Thrones' 'Mountain', breaks world deadlift record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other organisations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/31/japan-businessman-admits-giving-gifts-for-successful-tokyo-olympic-bid\" title=\"\">including the Guardian</a>, have exposed corruption in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic bid and in AIBA, amateur boxing\u2019s governing body.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s special relationship with the US may end if Donald Trump wins a second term, some of the UK\u2019s most senior retired diplomats and Conservative foreign policy specialists have said. They also say that if the Democrat Joe Biden wins, Washington may view the EU rather than the UK as its primary partner.</p> <p>The anxious assessment of what is at stake for Britain in the US presidential election in November has been made on and off the record in a variety of seminars over the past month, and underlines concerns at Trump\u2019s performance during the coronavirus pandemic. It also reflects diplomatic outreach to the UK by Biden\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, Antony Blinken.</p> <p>UK diplomats have instead been looking to form a broader alternative alliance of democracies that dilutes dependence on the US.</p> <p>Rory Stewart, the former Conservative international development secretary, said in one assessment: \u201cIf Trump comes in for another four years that will be very challenging for the global system and for Britain\u2019s relationship with the US. If we were to move away from the US, and Trump obviously poses the challenge that that may have to happen, we are going to find ourselves in a situation in which much of our Foreign Office infrastructure had been predicated on working very closely with the US for a very long time.</p> <p>\u201cIf we have to move away from the US, it will involve a much bigger shift in national security infrastructure than we have ever experienced.

He does not really believe in American leadership in the world. We are seeing in this pandemic for the first time what a crisis is like without American leadership. It is the first time in our lifetime we have experienced that.</p> <p>\u201cIf he gets elected for a second time some of the changes we have seen in the past few years will become embedded and entrenched and then, absolutely Britain will not be so much a bridge between the US and Europe. We will need to be bounding closely together with our European partners\u201d .</p> <p>Speaking before the Black Lives Matter protests, he said the election was poised 50-50, and that if Biden were elected the UK would not simply be able to get back into bed with the US as it had been in the past. He called for \u201cmiddle-level powers to come together to tackle China and climate change\u201d. Both men were speaking at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics.</p> <p>In a sign of British diplomats\u2019 despair with Trump, Sir Peter Westmacott, a former ambassador to Washington, said: \u201cI would love to say, as we look to the future, would it not be nice to see political leadership also addressing old-fashioned principles such as accountability, respect for the rule of law, independent judiciary, telling the truth, institutional independence and indeed the importance of a free press?</p> <p>\u201cThat may not be what public opinion is crying out for, but they are not very far removed from the principles that \u2026 Biden believes in. Otherwise the chances of the western world retaining any sort of moral leadership and giving itself the right to call out other people when they behave badly will be gone forever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99/0_134_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Westmacott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Westmacott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Debate is fierce in British diplomatic circles about whether Trump merely marks the acceleration of a pre-existing trend to a more disengaged US, and whether Biden is either willing or able to reverse the trend.</p> <p>Blinken has tried to reassure British diplomats that Biden will re-engage with multilateral institutions, and told the London thinktank Chatham House that US leadership would return. \u201cWhen Joe Biden looks at the world, one thing stands out. Whether we like it not, the world tends not to organise itself and, for 75 plus years, the US played the leading role in working to organise the world, establishing the institutions, writing the rules and setting the norms,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are not doing that, then one of two things happen. Either someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interest and values, or no one is, and that can be even worse. Then you have a vacuum which tends to be filled by malevolent things before good things. So the US has a responsibility and self-interest in leading with humility.\u201d</p> <p>Many senior former UK ambassadors are desperately hoping Washington will lead again. One said: \u201cI think that if you have a different, more internationally minded leadership in the US then a lot of what has happened over the past few years can be reversed. If we get another four years of this leadership, then some of the bonds and some of the cement that holds the west together, and holds Europe and America together will be broken forever. If things change in November then we can recapture things if we get the right sort of leadership in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The same diplomat also said, however, that Biden might \u2013 like Barack Obama \u2013 see Europe and particularly Germany as his primary interlocutor: \u201cIf you get a Joe Biden presidency in the US, then the relationship will focus again on Europe, on Germany and France, and we may feel a little neglected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674/0_0_2468_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kay Nietfield/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that although Boris Johnson was closer to Trump than most European leaders, the importance of the special relationship was overrated. \u201cIf I\u2019m brutally frank it has not been that special for awhile,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Obama wanted to know what Europe thought about something his first call was to Merkel.\u201d</p> <p>Another ambassador from Tony Blair\u2019s time as prime minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to imagine restored American leadership to a multilateral world. I do not think it is all over, but it does make the November election incredibly important. I cannot see that happening under a Trump II administration. It\u2019s possible, however, to imagine Joe Biden trying to lead us back to a more normative, multilateral and cohesive world.\u201d&nbsp;He pointed to Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw 9,500 US troops from Germany as a sign of the pressure likely to be placed on Nato if he is re-elected.</p> <p>In his address to Chatham House, Blinken gave the impression that the US under Biden would seek to revive the Iran nuclear deal Obama signed but which Trump abandoned. Although he was unremitting in his criticism of Iran\u2019s behaviour in the Middle East, he stressed that the original deal was designed to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and not its wider behaviour.</p> <p>Blinken was also critical of China for its lack of transparency over the coronavirus, and called on Beijing to be a responsible stakeholder, a phrase first used in 2005 by the then US assistant secretary of state Robert Zoellick.</p>",

The remaining three council members are broadly supportive of the effort as well, but were not ready to sign on, activists said.&nbsp;While the mayor has oversight over the police, the city council has authority over the budget and policy, and could work to dismantle the department through cuts and ordinances.</p> \n<p>The formal effort to abolish a major-city police department in America and replace it with a different model of safety would have been almost unthinkable even weeks ago and is a testament to the impact of the protests that began with Floyd\u2019s death on 25 May. The unarmed 46-year-old was killed by Minneapolis police when an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded for him to stop.&nbsp;Four officers now face criminal charges.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa880d569bc85b4671fb14e288ad5aa98d7a5624\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa880d569bc85b4671fb14e288ad5aa98d7a5624/0_0_3600_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alondra Cano, a city council member, speaks at Powderhorn Park on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"521\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alondra Cano, a city council member, speaks at Powderhorn Park on Sunday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerry Holt/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis is a moment that\u2019s going to go down in history as a landmark in the police and prison abolition movement,\u201d said Tony Williams, a member of MPD150, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPD_150/status/1269769940829114370\">Minneapolis group</a> whose literature on building a <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/resources/\">\u201cpolice-free future\u201d</a> has been widely shared during the protests. \u201cThere\u2019s a groundswell of support for this. People are grounded in the history of policing in a way that has never happened before. It\u2019s visible that police are not able to create safety for communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>The council members are expected to face opposition from law enforcement officials and the police union, though activists emphasize that the veto-proof majority has the authority to move forward regardless of opposition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the political will is here, and they can\u2019t stop it,\u201d said Williams, noting that even if police officers opposed the move, a vast majority of them live outside Minneapolis and cannot vote on their elected leaders.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">Donald Trump</a> tweeted his apparent opposition to the Minneapolis move on Monday morning: \u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!\u201d</p> \n<p>Spokespeople for the Minneapolis mayor did not immediately respond to inquiries on Sunday. The police department declined to comment.</p> \n<p>After Minneapolis\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, would not commit to abolishing the police at a demonstration on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-mayor-jacob-frey-walk-of-shame.html\">protesters shouted</a>, \u201cGo home, Jacob!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d until he left.&nbsp;Minneapolis is also home to a powerful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/minneapolis-police-union-bob-kroll-us\">union leader who has aggressively resisted any reforms</a> to the department despite the agency\u2019s history of racial abuse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b39126e4-5f16-46af-bbe8-dc593951ee0c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kmx1lRc9sL4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lawmakers and advocates across the US will probably be closely watching what happens next in Minneapolis. It is unclear how quickly this process could move, and what the transition could look like. Supporters are pushing for the council to start with taking money away from the police budget and investing in other government departments, social services and programs, while launching a community process for creating alternative systems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An alternative safety model, advocates say,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a>&nbsp;with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a>&nbsp;counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like many US municipalities, Minneapolis was already facing a budget shortfall due to the Covid-19 crisis, and defunding police could help address some of those gaps. There are a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/be62ee3dee3094f2ecf8f841a198aadd?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">handful of examples</a> of governments disbanding troubled local police agencies in the US over the years, though the authorities have had other regional law enforcement entities take over policing.</p> \n<h2>Police reforms around the country</h2> \n<p>While the effort in Minneapolis is the most radical, a number of other US mayors and local leaders have reversed their positions on police funding. The mayor of Los Angeles said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police this week, just days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%.</p> \n<p>Following days of protests and widespread accounts of police misconduct in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that some funding would be moved from the police to \u201cyouth initiatives and social services\u201d. Some council members and others, however, have been pushing for a $1bn divestment from the NYPD.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead, but I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cAnd I also will affirm while doing that, we will only do it in a way that we are certain continues to ensure that this city will be safe.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>De Blasio also announced that enforcement of regulations involving street vendors \u2013 many of whom are persons of color and, or immigrants \u2013 should not be handled by police. \u201cCivilian agencies can work on proper enforcement and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do going forward,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenGymAtLarge/status/1268893914074775552?s=20\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectRyanDorsey/status/1268909453988020224?s=20\">Baltimore</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/dc-city-council-janeese-lewis-george-election/\">Washington DC</a>, <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21281670/sf-mayor-defund-police-black-community-sfpd\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvp7OgYQ40zWjyhl15TLouRMCFhZ_ApjuJ5m1HmBurk/edit\">other cities</a>, local policymakers have expressed support for some form of defunding or opposing police budget increases in the last week.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For years, abolitionist groups have advocated for governments to take money away from police and prisons and reinvesting the funds in other services. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">basic principle</a> is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Advocates for defunding argue that recent police reform efforts have been unsuccessful, noting that de-escalation training, body cameras and other moves have not stopped racist brutality and killings. Police in America kill more people in days than many other countries do in years.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Amid the current protests, abolitionist groups have <a href=\"https://www.8toabolition.com/\">put forward concrete steps</a> toward dismantling police and prisons, arguing that defunding police is the first move, and that cities need to remove police from schools, repeal laws that \u201ccriminalize survival\u201d such as anti-homelessness policies, provide safe housing for people and more.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/06/02/heels-george-floyd-killing-colleges-have-moral-imperative-not-work-local-police\">Colleges</a>, public school&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">systems</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/museums-police-divest-black-lives-matter-1202690076/\">museums</a>&nbsp;and other institutions have also increasingly announced plans to divest from police.</p> \n<p>The Minneapolis announcement could inspire other cities to follow, Williams said: \u201cI do believe we are on the precipice of a major global shift.
