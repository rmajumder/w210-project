  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is culpable in the deaths of thousands of Americans by using the coronavirus pandemic to boost his electoral prospects and line the pockets of big business, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/noamchomsky\">Prof Noam Chomsky</a> has said.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian, the radical intellectual argued the US president was stabbing average Americans in the back while pretending to be the country\u2019s saviour during the worst health crisis in at least a century.</p> \n<p>He said Trump, who will seek re-election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">later this year</a>, had cut government funding for healthcare and research into infectious disease for the benefit of wealthy corporations.</p> \n<p>Chomsky said: \u201cThat\u2019s something that Trump has been doing every year of his term, cutting it back more. So [his plan is] let\u2019s continue to cut it back, let\u2019s continue to make sure that the population is as vulnerable as we can make it, that it can suffer as much as possible, but will of course increase profits for his primary constituents in wealth and corporate power.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chomsky also said the president had abandoned his duties by forcing individual state governors to take <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/trump-versus-the-governors\">responsibility for combating the virus</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s a great strategy for killing a lot of people and improving his electoral politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked to clarify if he viewed Trump as culpable in the deaths of Americans, he said: \u201cYes but it\u2019s much worse than that, because the same is true internationally. To try and cover up his criminal attacks against the American people, which have been going on all of this time, he\u2019s flailing about to try and find scapegoats.\u201d</p> \n<p>The professor said Trump\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">freeze payments to the World Health Organization</a>, would lead to deaths in Yemen and across the African continent. </p> \n<p>Chomsky was speaking in an interview to mark the launch of the <a href=\"https://progressive.international/\">Progressive International</a>, a global initiative to unite, organise and mobilise progressive forces around the world.</p> \n<p>First convened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a>, the Vermont senator, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yanis-varoufakis\">Yanis Varoufakis</a>, the former Greek finance minister, it aims to mount a fightback against the increasing rise of rightwing populist movements around the globe.</p> \n<p>Other members include Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, the Icelandic prime minister, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the authors Naomi Klein and Arundhati Roy, and Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador. In September, pandemic permitting, the council will convene for an inaugural summit in Reykjavik.</p> \n<p>Also speaking in an interview to mark the launch, Varoufakis said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/future-of-the-international-left\">articles he and Sanders wrote in the Guardian</a> two years ago were among catalysts for launching the Progressive International.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s been urgent for quite a while now. If anything I\u2019m worried that we\u2019re coming to the party too late. I hope not..\u201d</p> \n<p>Expressing anger at the EU response to the pandemic as a \u201cvery sad dereliction of duty\u201d, he said the crisis could tear apart the euro single currency bloc. \u201cI don\u2019t think the eurozone can survive it. But it can survive long enough to deplete huge amounts of wealth and social capital. Europe is rich enough, it can pretend and extend.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>EU leaders have agreed to draw up a \u20ac540bn (\u00a3480bn) package of emergency measures. However, there is a deep split between countries demanding grants for stricken economies, such as Italy and Spain, and northern members such as Germany who favour loans.</p> \n<p>The launch of Progressive International comes amid growing calls to drastically alter the global economic and political status quo as Covid-19 continues to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/coronavirus-equal-society-britain-wellbeing-economic-growth\">expose</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/coronavirus-equal-society-britain-wellbeing-economic-growth\"> and exacerbate</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/coronavirus-equal-society-britain-wellbeing-economic-growth\"> entrenched levels of inequality</a> and poverty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/10/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pressure had also been mounting since the 2008 financial crisis to reverse more than four decades of government retreat from intervening in the economy, amid widespread dissatisfaction with modern capitalism from supporters and detractors.</p> \n<p>Faced with rightwing nationalist responses and the growing urgency to combat global heating, McDonnell said the new organisation would help develop and promote a more progressive vision of the future.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, he said: \u201cThis initiative comes at just the right time. It\u2019s about the nature of society we want. It\u2019s also about how we tackle the real threat upon us from climate change.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Comparing the threats from rightwing populism to the rise of Nazism in 1928 when he was born, Chomsky said two approaches were being promoted in the response to Covid-19.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cOne is let\u2019s take the savage, Reagan, Thatcher approach and make it worse. That\u2019s one way. The other way is to try to dismantle the structures, the institutional structures that have been created; that have led to very ugly consequences for much of the population of much of the world, [and] are the source of this pandemic. To dismantle them and move on to a better world.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. There are forces fighting back. The International is going to be facing similar attacks. To overcome them, it depends on the peasants with the pitchforks.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global death toll passes 280,000</strong></h2> <p>The total number of fatalities from Covid-19 stands at 282,495, <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus resource center</a>. Globally, 4,091,297 cases have been confirmed.</p> <h2>\u2018This is not the time to end the lockdown,\u2019 says Boris Johnson</h2> <p>In a speech criticised by some as confusing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">UK prime minister said</a> some schools in England and some shops might be able to open next month, and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work if they cannot do so from home. Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">urged workers to avoid public transport</a>, and said restaurants and cafes should not expect to open until at least July.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa passes 10,000 confirmed cases</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa stands at 10,015, including 194 fatalities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb86f458f08464cd4297ad8#block-5eb86f458f08464cd4297ad8\">health minister Zwelini Mkhize has announced</a>. 84% of new cases were in Western Cape and Eastern Cape, and eight new deaths had been recorded.</p> <h2><strong>Leading Latin American airline files for bankruptcy</strong></h2> <p>Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s second biggest airline and one of the oldest in the world, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb85bc68f0858b1a8107873#block-5eb85bc68f0858b1a8107873\">filed for bankruptcy</a>, after failing to secure aid from Colombia\u2019s government and with a bond payment deadline looming. If it fails to come out of bankruptcy, Avianca would be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic, which has caused a 90% decline in global air travel.</p> <h2>Poland must declare new election date within 14 days</h2> <p>The head of Poland\u2019s electoral commission has said the speaker of parliament has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb854a48f08c0a2409bb32e#block-5eb854a48f08c0a2409bb32e\">14 days to declare the date of a new presidential election</a>. The country had been due to hold a presidential election on Sunday and, while the vote was not officially cancelled or postponed, the electoral commission had said on Thursday it could not be held due to the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2><strong>France exempt from UK\u2019s quarantine restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The British and French governments have released a joint statement saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb84c018f08c0a2409bb2f9#block-5eb84c018f08c0a2409bb2f9\">French will be exempt from the UK\u2019s proposed quarantine restrictions</a> following a call between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The statement stresses \u201cthe need for close bilateral, European and international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>France reports lowest daily death toll since lockdown</strong></h2> <p>France reported 70 more coronavirus deaths on Sunday, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb8441c8f08464cd42979d7#block-5eb8441c8f08464cd42979d7\">lowest daily toll since the lockdown began on 17 March</a>, as it prepared to ease restrictions. The new deaths brought the total toll in hospitals and nursing homes from the pandemic in France to 26,380, the health ministry said.</p> <h2><strong>WHO suspends activity in Yemen\u2019s Houthi-held areas</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization has suspended staff activity at its hubs in Houthi-held areas of Yemen in a move sources said was aimed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb839e58f08c0a2409bb286#block-5eb839e58f08c0a2409bb286\">pressure the group into being more transparent about suspected coronavirus cases</a>. The Houthis have reported just two cases, compared with the government\u2019s figure of 34. The war-torn country is split between a Saudi-backed government temporarily based in the south and the Houthi movement that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in the north in late 2014.</p>",

Democrats who control the House want one of those but the White House doesn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s the short version.</p> <p>The White House is \u201cabsolutely pushing for a payroll tax cut\u201d, Mnuchin says. Most observers think that is a non-starter, because Democrats won\u2019t let it.

If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession. It could give employers more money, which could reduce the need to lay off employees. </li> </ul> <p>But here\u2019s what it says would happen:</p> <ul> <li>The tax cut would <strong>disproportionately give more money to people with higher incomes</strong>, who typically have more savings to fall back on during a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. A payroll tax cut would also <strong>do nothing to help those who lost their jobs because of the crisis,</strong> especially lower-income people in industries like tourism, hospitality, and dining that have been especially hit hard by the pandemic and decline in demand from consumers. </li> </ul> <p>Here\u2019s our business editor, Dominic Rushe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-jobs-unemployment-kurzarbeit-us-europe\">on the economic crisis</a>:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-jobs-unemployment-kurzarbeit-us-europe\">US job losses have reached Great Depression levels.

Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a \u201csketch of a roadmap\u201d. Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a \u201csense of a way ahead\u201d. Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives \u2013 stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing.</p> \n  <p>Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this.</p> \n  <p>Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the \u201clight of science\u201d.</p> \n  <p>There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to \u201crobust health\u201d, the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:28:01.620Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb860498f08c0a2409bb384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:17:02.565Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM's message telling workers to return to factories is 'recipe for chaos', says TUC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s speech as \u201ca recipe for chaos\u201d because safety measures for a return to work are not in place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/1259551752443002880\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lots of working people will feel confused and anxious after listening to Boris Johnson.<br> <br>Govt still hasn\u2019t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe.

This was the second time he\u2019s done it during this crisis. But tonight\u2019s event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown \u201cfreedom\u201d, and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won\u2019t come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow.</p> \n  <p>Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place</strong>. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.</p> \n   <p>Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n   <p>And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Johnson also stressed that these dates were \u201cdependent on a series of big ifs\u201d and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a<a href=\"https://www.gov.ie/en/news/58bc8b-taoiseach-announces-roadmap-for-reopening-society-and-business-and-u/\"> \u201croadmap for reopening society and business\u201d</a> that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-lockdown-to-last-three-more-weeks-62z2brv36\">a report in the Times last week (paywall)</a>, Johnson was under pressure from \u201cdatists\u201d in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the \u201cdatists\u201d secured only to the bare minimum.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it.</strong> The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5#block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5\"> 7.14pm.)</a> That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed#block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed\">6.30pm.) </a>Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4#block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4\">7.11pm.)</a> This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3#block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3\">4.56pm)</a>, in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The \u201ccareful\u201d steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. </strong>Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But for most of the last seven weeks the government\u2019s line has been that people should go to work if they can\u2019t work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying \u201call non-essential premises must now close\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-pmqs-boris-johnson-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-recess?page=with:block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24#block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24\">this line was swiftly removed from the document</a> because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt.</p> \n  <p>Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.</p> \n   <p>You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And<a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/COVID-19/Documents/What-constitutes-a-reasonable-excuse.pdf\"> official police guidance (pdf)</a> said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be out under the regulations).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf#block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf\">7.07pm.)</a> This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, <a href=\"https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/04/23/statement-by-president-cyril-ramaphosa-on-south-africas-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-union-buildings-tshwane/\">in a speech last month.</a> Here is the South African system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db/0_0_1498_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South African government</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level. (Perhaps there will be more detail in the document being published tomorrow.)

Over the last three months (like most politicians, and even many scientists), he has had to drastically revise his assessment of the threat it poses and what needs to be done. </p> \n  <p>Here are nine quotes that show how much his stance has changed.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 Johnson says he won\u2019t let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</strong> One of his first public references to coronavirus came in a speech devoted to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">at Greenwich on 3 February</a>, when he said he would not let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is somewhat hard to square with the news that Johnson is now planning to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK, although this is a public health policy, not a trade policy.</p> \n  <p><strong>2 Johnson avoids being alarmist as he publishes the government\u2019s first coronavirus action plan.</strong> The document was published on 3 March, when Johnson attended a press conference with Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/03/labour-facing-one-of-worst-local-election-performances-in-recent-history-leaked-party-report-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b#block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b\">Johnson stressed that most people had no need to fear the illness.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3 Johnson calls for a balanced approach.</strong> Two days later, on 5 March, Johnson told ITV\u2019s This Morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">at that point it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d.</a> He also said the government was going for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance.</p> \n   <p>I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In fact no one in the UK was saying the government should just \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, but at that point government advisers were telling ministers that if they tried to suppress coronavirus completely, they would just risk a worse second peak later in the herd. A more balanced approach would allow \u201cherd immunity\u201d to develop, they argued.</p> \n  <p><strong>4 Johnson changes tone, and warns that \u201cmany more\u201d people will die.</strong><em> </em>At another Downing Street press conference, on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630#block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was also the moment when Johnson said<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796#block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796\"> the government was no longer trying to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus</a> and had instead moved to the stage where it was focusing on \u201cdelay\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>5 Johnson tells people to stay at home if possible.</strong> With the crisis intensifying, at the first of what No 10 said would be daily press conferences, Johnson announced on 16 March what amounted to a soft lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">He said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need people to start working from home where they possibly can.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine \u2013 and you should do this as little as you can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>7 Johnson himself then went down with coronavirus, and he ended up in hospital, where he spent three nights in intensive care.</strong> On leaving hospital he recorded <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-12/coronavirus-prime-minister-boris-johnson-s-easter-sunday-message-in-full/\">an Easter Sunday message</a> (the resurrection video) in which he movingly described how he had come close to death, thanked the nurses who had looked after him, and paid tribute to the contribution of the public. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset - our National Health Service.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>8 On 27 April, on his first day back at work in Downing Street after his recuperation, Johnson says that preparations to ease the lockdown have been under way for weeks, but that the government will proceed cautiously.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2#block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2\">He said: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity.

It is a meeting note, dated 1 April, prepared for a Sage meeting on 2 April.</p> \n  <p>The newly released material is everything from point 3, starting with the headline: \u201cSpecific comments about new suggestions for improving adherence within the Framework (27 March)\u201d. It shows Sage rejected three proposals to toughen the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The framework proposes four new suggestions for increasing adherence, numbered as options 17 to 20 that SPI-B have not commented on before. These focus on: 17) increasing the financial penalties imposed; 18) introducing self-validation for movements; 19) reducing exercise and/or shopping; 20) reducing non-home working. We have reservations about options 17 to 19. </p> \n   <p>First, we are unclear what the evidence base is that the targeted behaviours are a substantial contribution to disease transmission, particularly given the high adherence rates currently observed in the community. Is there evidence, for example, that exercise conducted more than 1km away from the house leads to higher rates of transmission than exercise conducted within 1km of the house? Indeed, for this option, there is a risk that reducing the ability of people to apply some flexibility in choosing where to exercise will increase risk by preventing people from spreading out in nearby open space. Tightening restrictions without clear epidemiological need may lose support among people who have been attempting to adhere.</p> \n   <p>Second, the implicit assumption underlying options 17 to 19 is that people lack motivation to adhere to current guidance. This may apply to some specific subgroups (the example of young men has been given), but broadly the current levels of adherence we are witnessing suggest this is not the issue. </p> \n   <p>Third, there are equity issues within options 17 to 19. Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households, while the assumption that printing and completing paperwork is straightforward for all households can also be challenged. The assumption underlying restrictions on shopping frequency is that people can afford to buy in larger quantities. The risk of tension arising as the police are required to start penalising those who are not adhering should also be factored into considerations. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T16:39:16.216Z\">at 5.39pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb81d178f08c0a2409bb1ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T15:31:22.583Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier <strong>Arlene Foster,</strong> the first minister of Northern Ireland, said that, along with the Scottish and Welsh governments, the Northern Ireland executives would be keeping the \u201cstay at home\u201d message.

The protest, which was promoted on various Facebook groups linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and anti-vaxxers, featured signs about China and the Murray-Darling basin. People also chanted: \u201cArrest Bill Gates.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there is a lot of \u201cvery silly misinformation\u201d out there, such as that the 5G network spreads the virus. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p><strong>Anthony Albanese will use a speech on Monday to demand a post-Covid-19 recovery \u201cin which no one is left behind\u201d</strong> and there is no return to \u201cthe law of the jungle and unfettered market forces\u201d.<strong> </strong>As the political contest shifts from the public health response to economic recovery, the Labor leader will call on the government to bring forward infrastructure projects and increase investment in affordable housing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we are still saying, \u2018We are all in this together,\u2019 after the lockdown has come to an end \u2013 and not just saying it; living up to that standard,\u201d Albanese will say. \u201cLet\u2019s not snap back to insecure work, to jobseekers stuck in poverty, to scientists being ignored.\u201d Albanese makes his speech as a new report from Deloitte Access Economics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">warns that national income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Donald Trump continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday</strong>, more than a year after the special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges against the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">but only three days after the US justice department said it would drop its case</a> against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Trump used Twitter to accuse Barack Obama of the \u201cthe biggest political crime in US history\u201d. The tweet accompanied a conservative talkshow host\u2019s claim that Obama \u201cused his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. Since Flynn\u2019s acquittal, Trump has attacked journalists who reported on the events leading to what he describes as \u201cthe impeachment scam\u201d. Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia in his inquiry but did lay out extensive links with Moscow and instances of possible obstruction of justice by the

  "<p>The number of jobless people in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">rose by more than 20 million in April</a>, something deemed worthy of a mention in the \u201cand in other news\u201d slot on the BBC\u2019s evening TV bulletin.</p> <p>Sure, it was the 75th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day\">VE day</a> and there were socially distanced street parties to cover and archive footage of crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to treasure.</p> <p>But hang on a minute. In the past, literary careers have been built on the sort of employment catastrophe that has just befallen the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is worth recalling that the war commemorated last week had its roots in Germany\u2019s 6-million long dole queues in the early 1930s.</p> <p>It matters a lot that the official US unemployment rate rose by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7% in a single month, that the real level of joblessness is actually around 25% and is likely to reach 30% before it peaks.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The April rise in unemployment was bigger than anything seen during the collapse of the US economy during the Great Depression, an economic tragedy that took several years to unfold. Inevitable once the decision was taken to shut down businesses in order to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-\">Covid-19</a> virus from spreading, layoffs are hitting the poorest workers hardest. An employee in the bottom 20% of earners was four times as likely to lose their job last month as someone in the highest earning 20%.</p> <p>As in the UK, shuttering businesses across the country is proving easier to do than reopening them. The number of airline passengers currently stands at 7% of last year\u2019s level; in the states where restaurants have reopened for business the number of customers is around 10% of its pre-pandemic levels. The number of weekly jobless claims has come down from its peak but is still running at more than 3 million.</p> <p>All of which suggests that unemployment is going to stay high for some time. The chances of the jobless rate being below 10% by the time Donald Trump stands for re-election in November look remote.</p> <p>Unemployment \u2013 and the risk of being made unemployed \u2013 makes people miserable. There has been plenty of speculation in the past couple of months about whether the lockdown has been good for levels of wellbeing, but the survey evidence and the economic literature suggests it has not.</p> <p>Here in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the levels of people reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/04/half-of-british-adults-felt-anxious-about-covid-19-lockdown\">high levels of anxiety</a> more than doubled when the economy went into hibernation at the end of March. More than half the adult population \u2013 25 million people \u2013 said they were worried about their health, the security of their job or having enough money to get by.</p> <p>A separate coronavirus study from the Mental Health Foundation found that 34% of UK adults surveyed and in full-time work were concerned about losing their jobs; 20% of unemployed people surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts and feelings within the last two weeks; and 11% of unemployed people who have experienced stress during the pandemic said nothing had helped them to cope with the worry and anxiety.</p> <p>There may well be people who are sailing through the lockdown untroubled, but they probably don\u2019t include those who have lost their jobs, think they might be laid off once the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, or feel responsible as the owner of a small business for the livelihoods of others. Not for them the luxury of working from home on full pay or retirement on an indexed-linked final salary pension.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it is reasonable to expect similar levels of stress and despair to be prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic, where the welfare state is not known for its generosity. Indeed, the work of economists such as <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w14318.pdf\">Danny Blanchflower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2234639?seq=1\">Andrew Oswald</a> has highlighted how higher unemployment is the economic variable most strikingly linked to rising unhappiness, and the longer the spell of unemployment the greater the cost to personal wellbeing.</p> <p>Academic interest in the impact of unemployment on physical and mental health picked up in the 1980s, when deep scars were left by workers enduring long spells of joblessness and in some cases losing touch with the labour market altogether.</p> <p>A priority, therefore, is to prevent temporary layoffs becoming permanent, because that is the path to more poverty, more ill-health, more crime, more relationship breakups and more social alienation. Hence the current heightened interest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">job guarantee schemes for the young</a> and universal basic income for all to supplement strong doses of economic stimulus.</p> <p>The textbook free-market solution to unemployment is that workers can always price themselves back into a job by being willing to take a pay cut. Fortunately, no government in the world believes this nonsense, and the story of the past couple of months has been frantic attempts to prevent a health emergency from morphing into an employment emergency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s furlough scheme has been one response to this incipient crisis, but there has also been a response in the US, where Trump, keen not to become the new Herbert Hoover, has adopted a three-pronged approach. Firstly, the administration has provided an extra $600 (\u00a3474) a week in unemployment benefits until the end of July. Secondly, the president has pushed for a reopening of the economy on the grounds that the cure for Covid-19 should not be worse than the disease itself. Finally, he has sought to blame China for America\u2019s problems, because this a lot easier than blaming himself.</p> <p>What does that mean? It means the US has mass unemployment, an explosion of unhappiness, and a sabre-rattling populist leader willing to do anything to hold on to his job. Now, in other news \u2026</p>",
  "<p>The allegations of sexual misconduct by Tara Reade against the former vice-president Joe Biden have caused new fault lines within the Democratic party, especially between its left wing and the establishment.</p> <p>Reade is a former Biden Senate staffer who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">accused </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of sexually assaulting her</a> while she worked in his office in the 1990s. Biden and his campaign have flatly denied the allegations and major news outlets have continued to investigate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, liberal grassroots activists have clashed with centrist Democrats and senior party figures over how to respond to the allegations. The arguments often point to how Democrats approached previous high-profile sexual assault allegations, such as the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh during the now supreme court justice\u2019s contentious confirmation hearings.</p> <p>Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist who has argued that the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d has moved to undercut Reade\u2019s allegations, said three basic factions had emerged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/tara-reade-joe-biden-sexual-assault-allegations-democrats-response\">Who is Tara Reade and what are her allegations against Joe Biden?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou have Biden\u2019s opponents on the Republican side and they\u2019re going to seize on this,\u201d Daou said, adding that there was also \u201cthe left \u2013 progressives and leftists\u201d who want to see Reade\u2019s allegations taken more seriously, and then the Democratic party establishment figures who are trying to undermine Reade. The latter group, Daou said, is \u201cjust absolutely wedded to Biden right now, will not let go, so they\u2019ll defend him at all costs \u2013 even if that means completely destroying the #MeToo movement\u201d.</p> <p>Daou pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/joe-biden-allegations-physical-behavior-women\">other women</a> have accused Biden of unwanted touching. In response to those accusations, Biden has said he would work to better respect other people\u2019s personal spaces.</p> <p>Republicans have been eager to confront as many rank-and-file Democratic politicians as possible with the allegations. The National Republican Congressional Committee has been blasting out emails targeting specific Democratic House candidates over Reade\u2019s claims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"936f4283245fe4f7a88bf40ae26eaa95798882c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/936f4283245fe4f7a88bf40ae26eaa95798882c2/0_0_3614_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Reade was a staffer for Joe Biden in the 1990s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tara Reade was a staffer for Joe Biden in the 1990s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The subject line of a Friday email from the NRCC read: \u201cWhy does McBath not believe Tara Reade?\u201d It asked why the Georgia congresswoman Lucy McBath was \u201cyet to say whether she\u2019ll stand by her endorsement of Biden amidst allegations of sexual assault, although she was quick to support Dr Ford during the Kavanaugh hearings\u201d.</p> <p>Similar questions are being asked by progressives and some more moderate Democratic party leaders. David Sirota, a former speechwriter and senior strategist for Bernie Sanders, has argued that Democrats have been too eager to discount Reade\u2019s allegations.</p> <p>A small group of insurgent Democratic congressional candidates have begun to raise concerns that Reade\u2019s allegations are not being taken seriously enough. Rebecca Parson, a liberal Democrat challenging the Washington state congressman Derek Kilmer, said in an interview on Friday that Biden should step down over Reade\u2019s allegations. Parson said she believes Reade and thinks the charges create too much of a vulnerability for Biden in the 2020 presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cI want to defeat Donald Trump in November and yes, I\u2019m a progressive and I\u2019m in the left-wing of the party, but something that really unites the people in the centrist wing and the progressive wing is we all want to defeat Trump,\u201d Parson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we do that with somebody who has all these allegations against him, especially because Donald Trump has assault allegations against him and unfortunately with Donald Trump, Trump doesn\u2019t care about being a hypocrite.\u201d</p> <p>Parson added: \u201cI think that Biden should withdraw and any one or more of the candidates who aren\u2019t running should restart their campaign because the Democratic primary isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p> <p>Those arguments aren\u2019t shared by many of the most high-profile figures in the Democratic party. The New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a leading advocate against sexual harassment and sexual assault, told reporters on Tuesday that she supported Biden amid the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cSo when we say believe women, it\u2019s for this explicit intention of making sure there\u2019s space for all women to come forward to speak their truth, to be heard. And in this allegation, that is what Tara Reade has done,\u201d Gillibrand said, according to CNN. \u201cShe has come forward, she has spoken, and they have done an investigation in several outlets. Those investigations Vice-President Biden has called for himself. Vice-President Biden has vehemently denied these allegations and I support Vice-President Biden.\u201d</p> <p>The former Georgia state house minority leader Democrat Stacey Abrams also said she believed Biden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe New York Times did a deep investigation and they found that the accusation was not credible.

A Politico/Morning Consult poll found that over a third of Democratic voters surveyed say the party should switch out Biden as their presumptive nominee because of the allegations.</p> <p>Other Democrats argued that Biden can both adequately address Reade\u2019s allegations and still be a viable opponent against Trump. The Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, a progressive favorite, wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@AyannaPressley/its-2020-and-we-still-don-t-know-what-survivor-justice-looks-like-983d7a94173c\">Medium post</a> arguing that the allegations can be examined without undercutting Biden\u2019s chances of beating Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI reject the false choice that my party and our nominee can\u2019t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House,\u201d Pressley wrote.</p>",

Will Harris, a cattleman at White Oak Pastures in southern Georgia, said he always knew a \u201ctrainwreck\u201d would hit the factory farming industry.</p> <p>Harris knows intimately how fragile factory farms and their supply chains can be, because for two decades, he raised cattle for the industrial beef production system. </p> <p>\u201cFor the past 70 years, big multinational corporations have moved our food system further and further down the road of focusing only on efficiency, only on taking costs out of production,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd in doing that they created a very fragile food system where a lot of things can go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>But Harris said there is an alternative: his style of farming.</p> <p>Harris moved towards sustainability in the 1990s because of concerns about the environment and animal welfare. White Oak Pastures, which has $20m in annual sales to Tyson\u2019s $42bn, has not sent panicked missives warning about meat shortages and is not being forced to kill its animals, as farmers who rely on corporate processing plants are.</p> <p>Instead, online sales have jumped fivefold; it has hired 16 more full-time employees; and any slowdown in processing will simply mean cows have more time to munch and meander in the grass.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not bulletproof. I could have a lot of people get this sickness and have to close the plant. I hope not, but it could happen,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut we are doing all we can to prevent it, not just because of the economics of closing the plant but because we don\u2019t want our people sick.\u201d</p> <p>In a country where people consume on average more meat each day than <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-availability-and-consumption/\">the government recommends</a>, the Covid-19 outbreak is far from catalysing a meat-free America.</p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s exposing how fragile big meat\u2019s supply chain is and making a case for smaller, more resilient models.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is a warning shot, and it provides us with an opportunity to change our food system in ways that are less susceptible to disruption,\u201d said Bob Martin, food system policy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.</p> <p>Issues with factory farming are well-documented.

  "<p>Traditionally, American presidential candidates pick vice-presidential running mates largely in secret, outside the view of the public or even members of their own party so as to maximize news value \u2013 and not offend those passed over for the job.</p> <p>But in 2020 \u2013 during a campaign already driven mostly online due to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 Joe Biden\u2019s quest to make a vice-presidential pick has been an unusually open, vocal and public audition, both within the campaign and outside it.</p> <p>A range of organizations and political figures have either covertly or overtly told Biden who he should pick as his running mate and vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cWe know now that the VP selection committee has been named and they\u2019re starting to meet,\u201d said Aimee Allison, co-founder of the She The People outside group.</p> <p>Allison and her group want to see Biden pick a woman of color \u2013 which has matched some of Biden\u2019s allusions to what he is looking for in a running mate. \u201cThis is our moment, this is a make-or-break moment for the Democrats, so we\u2019re doing everything we can to both show the strategic wisdom and how valuable it would be to have the enthusiasm of women of color.\u201d</p> <p>The most commonly mentioned names for Biden\u2019s running mate are the California senator Kamala Harris, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former Georgia state house minority leader Stacey Abrams, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. They have all emerged on the national stage in the last 10 years \u2013 as opposed to Biden who has been on the scene for decades.</p> <p>Publicly or privately they have all expressed openness to accepting an offer to be vice-president. Allies of those Democrats as well as potential Biden running mates have tried to tip the scales in their favor publicly and privately. But those efforts have varied.</p> <p>\u201cObviously Abrams is doing a sort of a different strategy \u2013 much more aggressively vying for it whereas Warren\u2019s people have been much more low-key about vying for it,\u201d said Sean McElwee, a liberal activist and co-founder of the Data for Progress thinktank.</p> <p>Biden himself has openly described some of the criteria he is looking for. He has vowed to pick a woman. The former vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee on multiple occasions has said he\u2019s looking for someone who is naturally \u201csimpatico with me\u201d adding \u201cwho is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment\u2019s notice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job,\u201d Biden said during a fundraiser in late April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636ab43c56b0507182d0111d08a6bb7dfd7ea6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636ab43c56b0507182d0111d08a6bb7dfd7ea6c2/0_91_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Abrams has been the most upfront about her willingness to serve as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Abrams has been the most upfront about her willingness to serve as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael McCoy/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As many as a dozen candidates have been mentioned as serious candidates. His selection is especially important as he has begun framing himself as a \u201ctransition candidate\u201d who would bridge high office to the next generation of Democratic and liberal lawmakers. That suggests that Biden\u2019s running mate could be a strong contender to run for president as soon as 2024 if Biden won the 2020 presidential election and opted to serve only one term.</p> <p>Harris, Whitmer and Klobuchar have all done fundraisers for Biden or been guests on his podcast, where the former vice-president interviews them. Influential Democratic party figures have pushed Biden to consider other rising stars, such as the Nevada senator Catherine Cortez-Masto or Florida congresswoman Val Demmings.</p> <p>Abrams has been the most overt in her eagerness to be considered. In interviews she has repeatedly said Biden would benefit from having her as a running mate and that she would accept an offer. . Lauren Groh-Wargo, a top aide for Abrams and her former campaign manager, penned a New York Times op-ed titled Stacey Abrams Knows the Secret to Winning the White House. </p> <p>Abrams herself wrote an article for Foreign Affairs critiquing Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. There is a long history in American politics of politicians trying to demonstrate foreign policy knowledge to show well-rounded qualifications for the White House.</p> <p>Donors and allies of Abrams have also been encouraging Biden and his team to strongly consider choosing her.</p> <p>Among liberal outside groups and grassroots, Abrams and Warren are the favored candidates. A <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/study-finds-stacey-abrams-biden-s-best-choice-here-s-n1164361\">poll</a> commissioned by Way to Win, a women-run group of Democratic donors, suggested that Abrams would be the best running mate for Biden.</p> <p>A recent tracking poll commissioned by MoveOn found Warren with the clear lead among a list of about a dozen potential picks. Our Revolution, the outside group aligned with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, conducted a poll of its members and found members \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d preferred Warren.</p> <p>\u201cFor progressives there\u2019s really two options it\u2019s either Warren or Abrams as the top pick,\u201d McElwee said.</p> <p>Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, has been an outspoken proponent of Biden picking Warren as his running mate. She argued that a progressive favorite is the way to boost turnout Democrats need.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to turn out an inspired and engaged electorate and the way to do that is to bring together a coalition of voters that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Nelson said.</p> <p>Nelson warned that without support from liberal activists and grassroots progressives who back Warren or other members of that wing, Democrats could lose to Trump in November.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a problem because we need that energy,\u201d Nelson said. Nelson said she thinks the Biden campaign seems \u201cpretty pragmatic\u201d about that.</p> <p>But other Democrats have argued that picking a liberal darling like Warren would undercut Biden\u2019s chances of winning over conservative voters open to voting for someone other than Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4554515448491b47ed8f16762df1a3c58dcabec5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4554515448491b47ed8f16762df1a3c58dcabec5/1023_0_2559_3198/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gretchen Whitmer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gretchen Whitmer has gained publicity during the Covid-19 pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Goldis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less a favorite of progressive activists, Whitmer has been catapulted into the national spotlight partially because of her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. She has publicly said she would accept and has kept in contact with the former vice-president. The ties between Biden and Whitmer go back before the 2020 presidential race. He endorsed her during the 2018 Michigan Democratic primary for governor. When the two were discussing Whitmer endorsing Biden in the presidential race, part of the discussion veered to how Biden would approach picking a running mate if he won the nomination, according to a Democrat with knowledge of those conversations.</p> <p>Other major Democratic party figures have been pushing Biden to consider other candidates. The former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has strongly encouraged Biden to consider Senator Cortez-Masto, a favorite for some Hispanic Democrats, according to two Democrats with knowledge of those conversations.</p> <p>Congressman Jim Clyburn has encouraged Biden to pick an African American woman like Harris or a lesser-known figure like the former Obama administration national security adviser Susan Rice. Influential Democratic donors have voiced support for Harris or Demmings. Harris allies have also been pushing Biden aides and allies to consider Harris.</p> <p>Rumblings about Harris\u2019s prospects as a potential vice-presidential pick for Biden began immediately after she <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-03/harris-exit-preserves-viability-as-a-potential-vice-president\">dropped</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/kamala-harris-campaign-meltdown/603358/\">out</a> of the Democratic primary, with some Democrats saying she ended her campaign partially to preserve her chances of being selected for the eventual ticket. </p> <p>Of all the interest groups, operatives and lawmakers pushing various candidates or types of candidates, arguably the strongest has been the push for Biden to pick an African American woman as a running mate. A group of 200 women recently <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/black-women-leaders-letter-to-support-black-women-for-vp/\">signed a letter</a> urging Biden to pick a black women as his running mate.</p> <p>\u201cChoosing a white running mate right now is not a safe choice. It doesn\u2019t broaden the coalition,\u201d Allison, who signed the letter, said. \u201cThe safe choice is to choose a running mate who can attract vital parts of the electorate, who pulls together a multiracial coalition and gets people to the polls.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ralph Reed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/06/republicans-us-politics\">an evangelical leader and conservative political activist</a>, first met Donald Trump in 2011, after being \u201ccoincidentally\u201d seated next to Ivanka Trump at a meeting.

In a book that is part history of the 2016 campaign, part <em>apologia</em>, part work of political theory, and part political shell game, he chooses not to include here 1 Timothy 6:10: \u201cFor the love of money is the root of all evil.\u201d</p> <p>Reed purports to offer \u201cthe Christian Case for Trump\u201d but his preaching is largely to the converted \u2013 and, most urgently, to those worried by the potential flames of Joe Biden.</p> <p>For Reed, Trump offered an appealing path: \u201cWith his money and celebrity, combined with a socially conservative message aimed at evangelicals, he could make a serious run\u201d for president and secure policy victories galore.</p> <p>Reed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/28/mike-pence-shadow-president-review-path-to-power\">very fond of Mike Pence</a>, and likely wishes the vice-president were top of the ticket this year. But he sees success under Trump on issues including abortion, religious freedom, support for Israel and helping ex-offenders re-enter society through the bipartisan First Step Act.</p> <p>Ultimately, abortion and the supreme court are more important than personal failures. Talk about issues and a dig at Hillary constituted Reed\u2019s response to the misogynistic Billy Bush video, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/sexual-assault-definition-trump-comments\">Trump boasted of sexual assault</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is pure and simple advocacy, and it is deceptive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reed writes that \u201cTrump has led with great moral clarity [on religious freedom]. If keeping one\u2019s word is central to one\u2019s character \u2013 and it clearly is \u2013 then Donald Trump has shown he has far more character than his critics.\u201d</p> <p>Writing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/19/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-church-state-separation-missouri\">the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court</a>, Reed claims \u201call the doubts, reservations, even suspicions \u2013 every one of them had been false.\u201d</p> <p>Every one?</p> <p>Reed\u2019s reliance on the \u201cteaching of Jesus about the difference between words and works\u201d is misplaced. He writes: \u201cI measure a man more by his actions than by the occasional rash or ill-advised word.\u201d How about false? <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-wins-appeal-allegedly-defamatory-tweets-1066737\">Allegedly defamatory</a>? <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/870368/65-worst-trump-tweets-2010s\">Demeaning</a>? <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-worst-offense-mocking-disabled-reporter-poll-finds-n627736\">Belittling</a>? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741827580/go-back-where-you-came-from-the-long-rhetorical-roots-of-trump-s-racist-tweets\">Racist</a>?</p> <p>And this: \u201cI have learned to be suspicious of the smooth talker who never delivers.\u201d</p> <p>As have those who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-university-court-upholds-25m-settlement-to-give-students-money-back\">plumped down money for Trump University</a>.</p> <p>This is pure and simple advocacy, and it is deceptive. Reed\u2019s statements often have qualifications, feints and writing designed to obscure or distract. For instance, he writes: \u201cThe fact that [Trump] didn\u2019t act or talk like a typical evangelical, didn\u2019t come from the Bible Belt, and didn\u2019t attend a Christian college or quote scripture also meant he could reach a new \u2013 and larger \u2013 audience.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s missing here? Oh yes \u2013 Trump <em>didn\u2019t usually attend church</em>. (Barack Obama did, generally at Camp David so as not to disturb worshippers in regular churches.)</p> <p>In essence, Reed invites readers not to look behind the curtain, positing instead a simple choice between Trump and \u201cliberals\u201d. His first and last chapters focus on the left, with bonus \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and \u201cLiberal Hypocrisy\u201d in the middle. Elsewhere, it\u2019s Trump or \u201ccivic withdrawal\u201d, a true straw argument.</p> <p>Some of his political science has a point. Trump did talk about issues that mattered to many voters. But Reed can\u2019t quite make up his mind.</p> <p>\u201c[E]vangelicals gravitated to Trump with ambivalence and more than a little reluctance,\u201d he writes. \u201cSome were dragged kicking and screaming to the voting booths.\u201d</p> <p>He seems happiest at a rally in Valdosta, Georgia: \u201cIt was as if a seventies band reunion had met a Nascar race \u2013 all for the enjoyment of the great unwashed of the American heartland, the forsaken and forgotten, the rejected and looked-down upon \u2026 these voters had found their Pied Piper, and his name was Donald J Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Following the Pied Piper did not end well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c65e159b3fbc96a0c320b78cd7084190727fb94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c65e159b3fbc96a0c320b78cd7084190727fb94/0_84_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Reed at the White House in January, for remarks by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Reed at the White House in January, for remarks by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does Reed really believe all this? Occasionally, glimpses of an earlier Republican party and flashes of honesty peek through the rhetoric. He gives some play to the opposition of evangelical critics such as Russell Moore, Al Mohler and Mark DeMoss. He offers nice words on the former Ohio governor John Kasich and Medicaid expansion. He writes that \u201c[Jesus] showed concern for people\u2019s physical needs for food, water, shelter and health, and so should we.\u201d He even comments favourably on Hillary Clinton\u2019s faith and devotional life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/07/donald-trump-evangelical-supporters\">Faith and freedoms: why evangelicals profess unwavering love for Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And he is correct that many evangelicals did change their views on politicians who commit immoral acts. But here are straw arguments again: \u201cDoes the Gospel teach that someone who has had a personal moral failing is disqualified from serving in a position of public trust? In fact, the Bible teaches the opposite, offering redemption and hope through faith in Christ to all sinners.\u201d</p> <p>Curiously, Reed uses the example of Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus and subsequent office in the church rather than the most obvious example in the state: King David\u2019s adultery with Bathsheba and murder of her husband.</p> <p>The key is \u2013 or should be \u2013 repentance, and Reed claims Trump \u201cfreely acknowledges \u2026 flaws and mistakes of his past\u201d. Then why so many false statements, including those that are easily checkable? Avoiding responsibility seems the exact opposite of repentance \u2013 and leadership. Reed also omits Trump\u2019s appalling behavior at two <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhV9RMEko3E\">National Prayer Breakfasts</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes, Reed gets the theology right \u2026 He quotes Psalm 146: 'Put not your trust in princes'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reed\u2019s definition of the 2016 election is flawed: a choice between \u201cdiametrically opposed political agendas \u2013 one of which embraced the intrinsic good while the other advanced grave evil\u201d. Surely, too narrow a definition on both counts.</p> <p>Simple distortions of fact abound, formed by putting one hand on the scale and ignoring other evidence. Reed is quick to dismiss accusations against Trump while not giving the full story. His chapters on Russia and impeachment are particularly, almost clownishly one-sided.</p> <p>Reed writes of \u201cthe Russia hoax\u201d. Robert Mueller said election interference \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-russian-election-interference-not-a-hoax-sot-vpx.cnn\">was not a hoax</a>\u201d.

Political power should indeed be used \u201cprimarily to glorify God\u201d.

Why has everything gone so tragically wrong?</p> <p>Some of it is due to Trump and his hapless and corrupt collection of grifters, buffoons, sycophants, lobbyists and relatives.</p> <p>But there are also deeper roots.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>American workers are far less unionized than workers in other advanced economies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The coronavirus has been especially potent in the US because America is the <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/21/mark-pocan/universal-health-care-diagnosis-mark/\">only industrialized nation lacking universal healthcare.</a> Many families have been reluctant to see doctors or check into emergency rooms for fear of racking up large bills.</p> <p>America is also the only <a href=\"https://cepr.net/documents/publications/psd-summary.pdf\">one of 22 advanced nations failing to give all workers some form of paid sick leave</a>.
