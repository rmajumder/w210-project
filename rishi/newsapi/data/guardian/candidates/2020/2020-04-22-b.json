The resolution (<a href=\"https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/2231(2015)\">UNSC 2231</a>) said: \u201cIran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.\u201d</p> <p>Although there is technological overlap between space launches and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), Iran denies that the aim of its space programme is to pursue ICBM technology.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s achieving both their objective of flexing muscle and implying they have the ability to go further if needed without giving the US the legal grounds to go to the UNSC,\u201d said Ariane Tabatabai, Middle East fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the US.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 hasn\u2019t slowed down the tensions between the two sides, it\u2019s exacerbated them.

  "<p>Finally. Someone with actual power and clout prepared to stand up to the despotic thugs of Saudi Arabia, and lobby the Premier League to block the proposed takeover of the cherished community institution Newcastle United. But wait. Who are these mysterious philanthropists, these heroic knights of human rights? Angels of justice, reveal yourselves at once! Oh. Hello there, Qatar. Right. That\u2019s a bit awkward.</p> <p>Still: any port in a storm, as they say. And the news that the most significant opposition to the purchase of Newcastle comes not from the Premier League or from Newcastle fans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/bein-sports-asks-premier-league-to-block-saudi-newcastle-deal-over-piracy\" title=\"\">but from beIN Sports</a>, the home of Richard Keys and Andy Gray and in effect the media arm of the Qatari government, should at the very least offer us pause for thought. These are disorienting times, and so perhaps it\u2019s only to be expected that a few unholy alliances are going to be formed along the way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/government-not-set-to-intervene-in-saudi-led-newcastle-takeover-football\">Government unlikely to block Saudi-led Newcastle United takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just take Keys himself as an example, who on his beIN show this week has been gravely opining on the proposed Saudi takeover of Newcastle, opposing it on \u2013 wait for it \u2013 ethical grounds. \u201cIf you are a host country, then I think you have a right to say: look, here are the rules,\u201d Keys said, still somehow managing to avoid making eye contact with the elephant stampeding through the studio. \u201cAre we to look away and forget everything?\u201d</p> <p>You know your takeover is going through a rough patch when Richard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/26/andy-gray-richard-keys\" title=\"\">\u201cDid you smash it?\u201d</a> Keys is lecturing you on moral rectitude. When you run an absolute monarchy, you\u2019re probably not overly accustomed to dissent, and certainly not from a former TV-AM presenter who looks like he smells faintly of the inside of a Rover 800.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that Qatar\u2019s objections to the Newcastle takeover do not rely on this same rock-solid logic. The letter that beIN has sent to all 20 Premier League teams, as well as its chief executive, Richard Masters, wisely steers clear of morality altogether, which is probably just as well given the mere mention of the word would probably have sent most chief executives hunting for a dictionary. No, if the first rule of writing is to speak your reader\u2019s language, then beIN has pitched its perfectly: underlining the grave threat posed by Saudi Arabia to the league\u2019s broadcast revenue streams.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Welcome to the new orthodoxies. Saudi Arabia is good. Amnesty is bad. New signings are more important than murder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNot only has the potential acquirer of Newcastle United caused huge damage to your club\u2019s and the Premier League\u2019s commercial revenues, but the legacy of the illegal service will continue to impact you going forward,\u201d writes beIN\u2019s chief executive, Yousef al-Obaidly. \u201cWhen the Premier League season recommences in the coming months, all of the league\u2019s broadcasters\u2019 content will continue to be readily and illegally available.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cillegal service\u201d in question is beoutQ, a cartoonishly brazen Saudi piracy operation that broadcasts a range of global sporting events by simply siphoning off beIN\u2019s broadcast signal. Essentially, it\u2019s the large-scale equivalent of the oldest pub trick in the book: sticking up a foreign satellite dish to circumvent the Saturday broadcast blackout and show the 3pm kick-offs illegally. And who says Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t understand English football culture?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14abfc2b1d39d7d3442ca55911dba5fc648e25c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14abfc2b1d39d7d3442ca55911dba5fc648e25c9/0_163_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The broadcaster Richard Keys (pictured in 2011) has expressed opposition to Newcastle\u2019s takeover, making him an unlikely ally of human rights campaigners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The broadcaster Richard Keys (pictured in 2011) has expressed opposition to Newcastle\u2019s takeover, making him an unlikely ally of human rights campaigners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here, though, the stakes are far higher: beIN is the Premier League\u2019s biggest overseas broadcast partner, with a deal worth \u00a3500m. And there is of course a far larger context at work here, one with its roots in the vast proxy war between Qatar and Saudi Arabia being waged on several fronts. Already, some of the less self-aware Newcastle fans on social media are busily trashing Qatar\u2019s own human rights record as a reason not to care about Saudi Arabia\u2019s.</p> <p>Equally, though, Qatar\u2019s heavy-handed intervention may just harden the significant body of opinion within Newcastle\u2019s fanbase that are delighted to see the back of Mike Ashley yet harbour deep concerns about who they may be letting through the door. Taking on Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch is one thing. But if Qatar can be reframed as the real enemy here, then perhaps a few Newcastle fans will be persuaded to swing behind their prospective new owners as the most biddable of a bad bunch.</p> <p>This, in a way, was always the danger of opening up the Premier League so accommodatingly to the toxic influences of global geopolitics. Partly, of course, it is simply a reflection of how wars are fought these days: not just on the ravaged battlefields of Yemen but in the commercial real estate offices of Manhattan and London, the bully-pulpits of social media, and now the Zoom meetings of English football. The Premier League has long sold itself on the basis of tribal conflict, endless narrative and wall\u2011to\u2011wall entertainment. Perhaps establishing itself as a theatre for actual war is simply the next logical step.</p> <p>And so, welcome to the new orthodoxies of English football. Saudi Arabia is good. Amnesty International is bad. New signings are more important than murder, broadcast rights are more important than women\u2019s rights, and a sense of basic humanity is ultimately expendable if you can scrape into next season\u2019s Europa League. It\u2019s a manifesto, to be sure. Just don\u2019t expect anyone with a scintilla of decency to feel warmly about it.</p>",

  "<p>Dave\u2019s Mercury prize-winning debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/19/best-albums-2019-no-2-dave-psychodrama\">Psychodrama</a>, was the biggest-selling British rap album in the UK in 2019, certified gold for selling more than 100,000 units. Those numbers wouldn\u2019t even have landed him in the top 10 biggest rap albums in France last year, where <a href=\"https://djbooth.net/features/2020-01-09-france-got-something-to-say-album-sales\">artists from greater Paris sell more rap albums than acts from any other city</a>. But, while Dave won album of the year at this year\u2019s Brit awards, and gave a nationally televised performance decrying the prime minister as racist, at last month\u2019s Victoires de la Musique \u2013 France\u2019s equivalent of the Brits \u2013 none of France\u2019s black or Arab rappers were nominated in an album, artist or song category.</p> <p>Days after the ceremony, French music industry body SNEP, which is responsible for collating the charts, distributing royalty payments and more, declared rap music an \u201coverexposed phenomenon\u201d in <a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/actualites-du-snep/marche-2019-de-la-musique-enregistree-decryptage-des-resultats/\">their 2019 market report</a>. It argued that \u201cfan support for urban music must not eclipse the performances of other musical genres\u201d \u2013 an explicit call for less promotion and celebration of the most successful French popular music movement of all time.</p> <p>This popularity, SNEP said, would be \u201ccorrected\u201d as older listeners \u2013 who are assumed to listen to other types of music \u2013 started paying for subscriptions to streaming services. Unlike in the UK and US, SNEP does not count ad-supported streams or YouTube views towards sales \u2013 an unfortunate decision for rap, given that it is the country\u2019s most streamed genre. These constraints notwithstanding, last year French rappers were responsible for 16 of the 19 No 1 singles in France, and topped the album chart for 31 weeks.</p> <p>Domestic rap has become the soundtrack to a national identity crisis, viewed by its detractors as a threat to the cultural landscape of a country marked by bitter racial divides. Yet, after three decades of attempts to delegitimise it, many artists have come to ambivalently accept the persistent discrimination. There was no outrage at their being overlooked at the Victoires. Most musicians and industry figures I approached for comment were not prepared to speak publicly about prejudice within the industry, even while acknowledging it as omnipresent. One artist manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s not shocking, it\u2019s always been here.

France had been largely white until the 1950s. An increase in migrants from the country\u2019s North African former colonies throughout the 60s and 70s paralleled a period of immense economic change intensified by the oil crisis in the 70s.

The future president led a decade-long campaign against rap, bringing libel charges against <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/world/europe/23iht-rapper.4.16422288.html\">La Rumeur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/11/arts.france\">Sniper</a>, and making it an imprisonable offence to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/07/france.jonhenley\">offend the dignity of the republic</a>\u201d. Sarkozy\u2019s issue with rap rested on its alleged anti-white racism, a declaration supported by more than 200 parliamentarians, who, following the 2005 French riots, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2005/11/24/des-parlementaires-reclament-des-poursuites-contre-des-rappeurs_713789_3224.html\">accused</a> multiple rappers of inciting violence and racism. The same year, Sarkozy\u2019s UMP party instituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/15/highereducation.artsandhumanities\">a law</a> requiring schools to teach students the positives of colonialism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a02f5a8ec12d82a7eed7e35a1d092ecd8c20f90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a02f5a8ec12d82a7eed7e35a1d092ecd8c20f90/0_0_5186_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French rapper Gradur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Political rhymes\u2019 ...

Before his campaign for re-election, his ally and interior minister Claude Gu\u00e9ant infamously declared that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20120205-france-minister-slammed-unequal-civilisations-politics-gueant\">all civilisations are not of equal value</a>\u201d. Journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RphlDC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rapha\u00ebl Da Cruz</a> says that Sarkozy\u2019s legal pursuits validated the anti-immigrant sentiment that most rappers had faced throughout their lives, \u201cresulting in a generation of rappers avoiding airing their grievances with politicians and police brutality, for fear of cancelled concerts, losing record deals or political reprisal\u201d.</p> <p>When Sarkozy stepped down in 2012, rap was in the midst of a renaissance, facilitated by the rise of the group<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN2ozTZNJC0\"> Sexion </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN2ozTZNJC0\">d\u2019Assaut</a>, who left social commentary behind to embrace a pop-friendly, confrontation-averse style. The group\u2019s success renewed major label interest and coincided with the streaming revolution. With access and distribution democratised, a new generation of minority French youths could now break into the charts \u2013 and make money.</p> <p>SNEP integrated streams into sales in 2016, and the resulting tidal wave of domestic rap that entered the charts was typified by French-Algerian brothers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PODnRarD78\">PNL</a>, who independently sold a million copies of their album, Dans la L\u00e9gende. Like France\u2019s World Cup-winning football players \u2013 who in 2016 were up against an attempt by the French Football Federation to introduce a quota system to restrict players of African origin \u2013 France\u2019s black and Arab rappers rose from ostracised communities to provide the country with its most notable 21st-century cultural achievements. As Le Pen\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine</a>, made historic gains from the anti-Islam mood in the wake of the Paris terror attack in 2015, Muslim rappers such as PNL and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/05/mhd-so-many-french-rappers-are-inspired-by-american-hip-hop-im-the-opposite\">MHD</a> emerged to front a domestic rap revolution from the throes of racial intolerance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PNL atop the Eiffel Tower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Domestic rap revolution\u2019 ...

MHD, who is currently awaiting trial for a 2018 murder allegation, blended contemporary trap with the pop music of his Senegal and Guinea heritage, and, Sylla says, \u201ccreated space for a new generation of Afro-French artists such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqYxVsEaypk\">Ninho</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPGgnzc34tY\"> Aya Nakamura</a>, and even encouraged established rappers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stet_4bnclk\">Booba</a> to embrace their roots\u201d. As Le Pen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/marine-le-pen-promises-liberation-from-the-eu-with-france-first-policies\">popularity</a> led to a run-off with Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 presidential election, France\u2019s widening schism was underscored by a record breaking year for rap: 11 No 1 albums, with SNEP handing out more than 200 gold, platinum and diamond singles sales plaques to French rappers.</p> <p>But four months into 2018, SNEP hastily<a href=\"https://www.lebureauexport.fr/en/news/2018/04/france-snep-will-no-longer-take-free-streaming-into-account/\"> reformed</a> its chart criteria, disqualifying all streams played without a paid subscription. The organisation \u2013 composed of members from all major labels in France \u2013 insisted that the change (aligning with Germany and Italy, but not the US or UK) was made to ensure a sales system more reflective of revenue. However, an A&amp;R director of a major French record label, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, maintains the sudden change was \u201cclearly a response to rap\u2019s unanticipated success\u201d.</p> <p>The amendments did little to impede rap\u2019s growth, which in 2018 led to nine No 1 albums and 14 No 1 singles (almost twice the number of rap hits to ever top the US Billboard 100 in a year). SNEP retorted in January of 2019, this time with another revision to album classifications that divided the number of streams of the most played song on an album in half. Still, rap\u2019s success continued. In 2019, PNL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/pnl-deux-freres-review\">Deux Fr\u00e8res</a> was one of 10 No 1 French rap albums and one of five to be certified multi-platinum; former Sexion d\u2019Assaut frontman Gims <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5_KIs-wbY\">filled</a> the 81,000-capacity national stadium and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQK0f6wzww8\">Soprano</a> played two sold-out concerts to 100,000 fans in <a href=\"https://www.laprovence.com/actu/en-direct/5821137/2019-dans-le-retro-une-annee-marquee-par-le-double-de-soprano.html\">Marseille</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce/0_0_2799_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, at this year\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKZLOOr4wGU\"> Victoires de la Musique</a>, rap\u2019s landmark achievements were whitewashed in favour of purveyors of the French <em>chanson</em> style. Aside from PNL\u2019s cursory nomination for an audiovisual award, decided by a public vote, only two rappers, both white, were nominated. Both lost. For the first time in 20 years, there was no category for urban album, previously known by the bizarre racial catch-all \u201crap, reggae or groove\u201d award. Victoires\u2019 president, Romain Vivien, <a href=\"https://www.tplmusique.org/romain-vivien-representer-la-filiere-musique-dans-son-entier/\">refuted claims</a> of a lack of minority representation,<strong> </strong>saying that the nominations merely reflected its members\u2019 sympathies, though this itself is arguably a sign of institutional racism.</p> <p>The Victoires, created by the ministry of culture as part of its objective to promote and protect French cultural heritage, were not designed for hip-hop, according to Jonathyne Briggs, author of Sounds French: Globalisation, Cultural Communities and Pop Music. \u201cRap has always been seen as something external, imported to France, only exacerbated by its connection to the culture of \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d, he says. Briggs believes the continued focus on traditional pop forms will do little to hinder rap\u2019s popularity, though: \u201cPop music is about conformity. Rap\u2019s nonconformity is still able to amplify discourse outside of existing structures.\u201d</p> <p>The late funk musician Manu Dibango <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2020/01/31/au-fil-des-voix-militant-pour-la-diversite-culturelle_6027994_3246.html\">lamented</a> the homogeneity at this year\u2019s Victoires, claiming the list of nominees read like a \u201cvain search for diversity\u201d. According to Olivier Cachin, a journalist and presenter of rap TV shows for 30 years, what began as indignation 20 years ago is now an irreconcilable \u201cdivorce\u201d. From the humiliation of Celtic trio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80hMEKlLVgQ\">Manau</a> infamously besting French rap royalty Supr\u00eame<em><strong> </strong></em>NTM, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_6KlvS992Q\">Arsenik</a> and MC Solaar to the first rap award in 1999 to the inexplicable exclusions in 2020, Cachin says the message to rap was always clear: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.francetvinfo.fr/culture/musique/victoires-de-la-musique/c-est-vu-comme-une-sous-categorie-pourquoi-les-victoires-de-la-musique-et-le-rap-n-arrivent-pas-a-accorder-leurs-violons_3822861.html\">You\u2019re not welcome</a>.\u201d Many believe it\u2019s time for rap to have its own award show, such as the Mobo or BET awards; a statement ceremony that, in France, would only serve to spotlight the gross racial divide within the industry.</p> <p>A spokesperson for SNEP suggested to me that rap\u2019s presence in France is merely cyclical, pointing to pop\u2019s success in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember the biggest selling album of the year was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">Ang</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">\u00e8le</a>\u2019s,\u201d they said, referring to the 24-year-old Belgian singer. \u201cWhile urban music comprises much of the top albums and singles, it doesn\u2019t reflect the interests of France as a whole, which are still largely pop, rock and <em>chanson fran\u00e7aise</em>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4/0_0_2953_4429/667.jpg\" alt=\"Aya Nakamura.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Demarcated down ethnic lines\u2019 ... Aya Nakamura.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a telling statement, one that aims to downplay the Frenchness of those listening to rap music, in keeping with how the terms \u201cchanson\u201d and \u201crap\u201d are demarcated down ethnic lines. Malian-French <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFupjRKwZY\">pop</a> star Aya Nakamura was inaccurately labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-Music-Report-2019-_Site.pdf\">the voice of French rap</a>\u201d by SNEP. When PNL submitted their album Dans la L\u00e9gende for the Victoires in 2017, they declared the project not to be urban, but <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEbJwZOkvDM\">chanson</a></em>. While they were not selected for the ceremony, their reasoning was later given as a reason for getting rid of the rap category.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanskywalker\">Lansky</a>, journalist for French rap website <a href=\"https://yard.media/\">Yard</a>, doesn\u2019t see these industry machinations as obstacles for French rap in the long-term: \u201cThe reality is that rap is the new pop, and many current artists labelled as pop, such as Ang\u00e8le, Louane and Kendji Girac, are looking to rap and related genres for inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>In the French charts so far in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-weeknd\">the Weeknd</a>\u2019s Blinding Lights provided a one-week break in nearly four otherwise continuous months of No 1 singles by black or Arab French rappers: Gradur, Gambi, Naps and Ninho. This is against the backdrop of Le Pen, whose newly named National Rally defeated Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">to win France\u2019s European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">elections in 2019</a>, preparing to challenge the incumbent president once again in 2022.</p> <p>French rap was once on the periphery of acceptable taste, loudly reporting on the cracks in France\u2019s supposed universalism. The attempts to quell it show how powerful it has now become, with its successful black and Arab rappers challenging the very idea of what it is to be French. As the anonymous A&amp;R director asserts: \u201cA genre that has been established in a country for more than 30 years cannot be qualified as a phenomenon. Today, rap is as much a part of France\u2019s culture as its cuisine, wine or bad faith.\u201d</p>",

The league says teams will start training from 4 May. But there are lots of unanswered questions over the announcement.</p> \n  <p>In a press conference, <strong>Wayne Pearce</strong>, the Balmain legend tasked with heading up the league\u2019s grandly titled \u201cProject Apollo\u201d to get the season running again, said the NRL had achieved \u201ca lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are\u201d and that \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d were \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their plans.</p> \n  <p>What he didn\u2019t say was what those protocols were, and which government authorities the league has been talking to. Basically, who in the government has given the league sign-off to begin playing again?</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve been trying to find out this afternoon, with little joy.</p> \n  <p>We know that the NSW police commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>, who is in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, previously wrote to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing despite strict public health orders</a>. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s because the league was given an exemption under the original PHOs issued last month, and stopped playing matches voluntarily. </p> \n  <p>However in the letter Fuller also said the league would have to develop protocols to demonstrate it could resume safely. The premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, said something similar when she was asked about it last week. </p> \n  <p>So who has signed off on the protocols? NSW Health still hasn\u2019t responded to my queries, and the NSW police seems to think there\u2019s nothing to be signed off on. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s what a spokeswoman told me:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As far as we are aware, there is nothing to be \u2018signed-off\u2019. The commissioner has stated previously that the letter was advice in response to their inquiry. I don\u2019t have anything further to provide you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll hear more from the NSW government later tonight or tomorrow, but it seems odd that neither the NRL nor the state government has explained who is in charge of making this decision.</p> \n  <p>The NRL is also still awaiting clearance from the federal and New Zealand governments for the New Zealand Warriors to arrive in Australia on May 3, a day before the rest of the competition resumes training. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland premier, <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong>, has also previously said she would not look kindly on the three teams from her state travelling back and forth to NSW for matches.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:25:50.482Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea005078f085a072d3bced8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:06:05.348Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Need a distraction from Covid-19?

Mikakos noted that some of the procedures that will now be allowed, eg IVF or dental work, could still largely be happening in the private system.</p> \n  <p>When she was asked what the point was, then, of having private health insurance at a time like this when you\u2019re not getting any benefit out of it, she said part of the government funding for the private sector was to keep the private hospitals running at this time. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252840162414874628\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A slowdown in new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases has allowed our public &amp; private \ud83c\udfe5 to carefully resume more category 2 &amp; some category 3 elective surgeries from next week. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2695\ufe0f \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f We thank Victorians for their patience &amp; helping save lives by staying \ud83c\udfe0 to slow the spread of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/springst?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#springst</a></p>\u2014 Jenny Mikakos MP #StayHomeSaveLives (@JennyMikakos) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252840162414874628?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:05:48.157Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ffc9c8f085a072d3bce9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T08:20:30.138Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good evening. <strong>Graham Readfearn</strong> here taking you through the final hours of our live coronavirus coverage.</p> \n  <p>A quick check around the updates from states and territories today shows very low numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported. </p> \n  <p>There were no new cases reported by Queensland, Western Australia, Northern Territory or the ACT.

It\u2019s business investment that drives productivity which drives higher wages. So that\u2019s the problem, let\u2019s frame that up first. Look I think it is important for us to put it back on the table but along with other tax reform. It\u2019s not the only thing that needs to be done. It\u2019s important that we look at the state taxes, the productivity sapping stamp duty taxes, payroll tax. It is interesting how much payroll tax has been deferred. <br></p> \n   <p>The whole question of the right configuration of the state taxes. Whether or not we bring forward those other income tax cuts. So it\u2019s not just company taxes but it is important we have a competitive company tax rate. To the treasurer\u2019s point, we\u2019re not asking, in the Business Council, for us to have the lowest rate, we\u2019re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country. <br></p> \n   <p>Because we already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world. As you and I have talked about many times, at the height of this debate, 63% of Australians supported lowering the corporate tax rate. It was people in this building, in Parliament House, who didn\u2019t see this as something that was in the national interest. <br></p> \n   <p>And we would be in a much better starting position on recovery if we had that 25% rate. So I think we have to put it back on the table. I think we have to stop the ideological wars about it. I think we have to be willing to have a conversation not just about that tax but about the whole tax system or as much of the tax system as we have the stomach to do reform on to make us a country that rewards innovation and incentive. <br></p> \n   <p>And obviously puts money into the pockets of Australians.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T01:04:58.836Z\">at 2.04am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f96ab8f087a826b68acae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:58:59.369Z\">1.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In case you haven\u2019t seen this as yet, or cried today, I am giving this another run, because we all need a bit of heartbreakingly lovely in our lives. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheMancUK/status/1252235035379265538\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After noticing that Ken slept with a photo of his late wife every night, one of the carers at Thistleton Lodge presented him with this incredible gift... <a href=\"https://t.co/Q1v8V8HUFS\">pic.twitter.com/Q1v8V8HUFS</a></p>\u2014 The Manc (@TheMancUK) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMancUK/status/1252235035379265538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T01:00:26.069Z\">at 2.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f93e58f087a826b68ac95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:46:55.340Z\">1.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A group of friends who gathered at one of their homes to play video games are <strong>among 95 people to be issued with a $1,600 on-the-spot fine for allegedly breaching Victoria\u2019s social distancing laws in the past 24 hours</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Police in Victoria said they also fined three people who, they claim, \u201cbooked a short stay accommodation so they could hand out and take drugs\u201d, as well as two people who were stopped in a car in Box Hill. <br></p> \n  <p>As we have seen in a number of these cases in recent weeks, police allege another offence was being committed at the same time \u2013 the driver of that car in Box Hill was unlicensed, the passenger was apparently brandishing a weapon.</p> \n  <p>The social distancing laws give police another reason to stop people and question their movements. <br></p> \n  <p>As <strong>Michael McGowan </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/victorians-describe-feeling-intimidated-by-police-enforcing-lockdown-laws\">reported yesterday</a>, a number of people fined in Victoria say the<strong> police were \u201cintimidating\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d and the laws were confusing.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p> But police have the discretionary power to issue on-the-spot fines and question people\u2019s movements, and they are using that power. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:49:12.451Z\">at 1.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f93878f087a826b68ac93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:45:35.408Z\">1.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252753358336581632\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are 1,336 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases in Victoria (2 added, 2 removed as interstate). 135 cases may indicate community transmission. 29 people are in hospital, inc 12 in ICU. 1,243 people have recovered &amp; &gt; 90K Victorians have been tested.

Is that you can either fork out the money and pay for 10,000 or 15,000 people on the dole, or you could see an underwriting of a convertible note or a loan, which provides some equity, which then eventually the gGovernment can recoup. <br></p> \n   <p>So, really when you stop to think about it and get beyond the simple headlines of saying, \u201cIs it a foreign airline?\u201d <br></p> \n   <p>Even though there are tens of thousands of local jobs, is it something that government should be just providing money for? <br></p> \n   <p>There\u2019s a big difference between paying people unemployment benefits and providing support which allows investors the certainty to make sure that we have two major airlines \u2013 Qantas and Virgin \u2013 with sustainable jobs, high-skilled jobs, here in Australia. <br></p> \n   <p>Because if we don\u2019t rescue Virgin in some form, what will happen is that, sooner or later, a foreign airline will come in. And who knows, there could be foreign crews flying over Australian air and sky, with foreign pay and conditions. <br></p> \n   <p>So at the end of the day, this is about keeping skilled jobs, this is about making investments where perhaps the taxpayer doesn\u2019t ultimately foot the entire bill. <br></p> \n   <p>So I think there\u2019s a deal to be done in voluntary administration, but I tell you what, for the regions, for our tourism, for low fares, and for the taxpayer not having to pay the massive costs if tens of thousands of people just lose their jobs, I think a deal should be done.

So there are exceptional circumstances where further restrictions might be placed on people living in residential aged care facilities in terms of access to visitors. <br></p> \n   <p>But those additional restrictions are the exception, they are not the rule, and we think it is a good thing for people to have those visits in accordance with those screening procedures and other things that are necessary to protect elderly residents in those situations. <br></p> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done out of the convenience of isolation in terms of how these facilities are run, it should always be done always only in the interests of the care of those who are living in those facilities. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:50:18.282Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f799b8f08b5c61713e4ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:54:59.712Z\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland reports no new infections</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>Great news.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:59:07.627Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f772f8f087a826b68ac18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:47:56.213Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has undertaken the suppression method in response this pandemic.

That\u2019s an honest view. If, in the process of suppressing, we get to the point of eradication, then that would be a magnificent outcome.

  "<p>The Trump administration is being challenged to reveal how many troops the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria \u2013 and to explain why it stopped publishing those figures more than two years ago.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/\">Just Security</a> website and the <a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/\">Project on Government Oversight</a> have filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) for the number of military and civilian defence personnel assigned to the three countries since December 2017, when public records were stopped. They also requested \u201cunderlying documents that explain why the [defence department] withheld the numbers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States Government and all its institutions represent and are accountable to the American people,\u201d the former defence secretary Chuck Hagel wrote in support of the requests. \u201cThe public and those who serve and defend this country and their families are entitled to know where we are sending our service men and women, why, and the numbers. That\u2019s democracy. The Government works for the people.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Goodman, the co-editor of Just Security and a former Pentagon legal adviser said: \u201cProviding this information would be a show of respect for the American public, who ultimately must decide what sacrifices our country should make in sending troops into war.\u201d</p> <p>The administration\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/04/09/dod-strips-iraq-afghanistan-syria-troop-numbers-from-web/\">stop publishing troop numbers</a> ended a decade-long policy of transparency started in the George W Bush administration. In December 2017, the Pentagon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_reports.jsp\">defence manpower data centre </a>published its quarterly report with blank spaces where troop numbers in combat zones would normally be. Corresponding figures for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were also stripped retroactively from the previously released September report.</p> <p>The decision to remove the data from the Pentagon website was the initiative of former defence secretary James Mattis, according to retired army Lt General Thomas Spoehr.</p> <p>\u201cHe became convinced the Department of Defence was revealing too much information publicly,\u201d Spoehr, head of the center for national defense at the Heritage Foundation, said. \u201cI could never find a written memo, but he essentially told all the services to clamp down on what they were releasing to the public.\u201d</p> <p> In the move to greater secrecy, Mattis drew support from the president.<strong> </strong>In August 2017, Trump said in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-strategy-afghanistan-south-asia/\">speech in Virginia</a>. \u201cWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities \u2026 America\u2019s enemies must never know our plans, or believe they can wait us out.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/syria-us-troops-mission-qamishli-quagmire\">Deadly clash in Syria a vivid reminder of US troops' ill-defined mission</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goodman said such reasoning was contradictory. \u201cI think the public justification has crystallized around the idea of operational security \u2013 \u2018we don\u2019t want to tell the enemy\u2019 \u2013 in part because it is such an easy, off-the-shelf explanation to present,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that makes no sense given the long period in which the military has released these numbers to the public without hesitation.\u201d</p> <p>Spoehr argued that Mattis had gone too far in withdrawing information from the public domain, but argued for a compromise in which approximate figures were disclosed, and with greater secrecy for Syrian operations, which tend to be more covert.</p> <p>Troop numbers are also politically sensitive, particularly in an election year, as Trump has made his vows to bring US troops home from Afghanistan and the Middle East one of the central planks to his campaign message.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the things that DoD has done to limit public access to information, this is probably the most egregious,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists government secrecy project. \u201cThe idea that the scale of the US military presence in a war zone should be kept secret from the public is a mistake. That\u2019s not how democracies fight or win wars.\u201d</p>",

Riley\u2019s speakers kept malfunctioning and the stream was glitchy. At one point R&amp;B singer Toni Braxton tweeted her frustrations: \u201cAre we really starting over?

The man who has long been <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/piers-morgan-flip-trump-critic-social-media-wondering-if-twilight-zone/\">a cheerleader for Donald Trump</a> (and who loves referring to the president as his friend) found himself trending on Twitter over the weekend after delivering a searing criticism of the US\u2019s abysmal response to the crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/media/reliable-sources-piers-morgan/index.html\">Speaking on CNN\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/media/reliable-sources-piers-morgan/index.html\">Reliable Sources</a>, Morgan said he had been watching Trump\u2019s White House briefings \u201cwith mounting horror\u201d and accused the president of \u201cfailing the American people\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s turning these briefings into a self-aggrandising, self-justifying, overly defensive, politically partisan, almost like a rally to him \u2013 almost like what\u2019s more important is winning the election in November,\u201d Morgan said.</p> <p>Ya think? Well done, Piers! You\u2019ve finally realised Trump is a dangerous narcissist who does not care if Americans lose their loved ones as he long as he gains in the polls.

And so his lack of empathy is directly linked to his kind of rush to reopen the economy, which in another president\u2019s hands might seem very different.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike most national disasters, the coronavirus emergency is not a discrete event that concludes abruptly with a price tag attached for total damages, or a summary death toll.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis is malleable, analysts said, and can be made bigger or smaller, longer or shorter, by how the White House responds, and by how the president encourages tens of millions of people to act. Epidemiological models portray how reopening the country too soon would lead to additional waves of infections, and many more deaths.</p> <p>But the message Trump delivers each day in press briefings seems to be motivated more by his quest for re-election than any fellow feeling for beleaguered Americans, said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump people feel, and they may be right, that his re-election prospects are dependent on a thriving economy,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s imperative for his re-election that the economy open again.\u201d</p> <p>Trump often makes reference in his daily press briefings to the death toll in the US, which at about 45,000 represents about one-quarter of coronavirus deaths worldwide. But apart from some narrowly scripted remarks delivered in an uninterested monotone, Trump fails, day after day, to deliver expressions of sympathy for the loss of life, which remains on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1250902556718649350\">grim trajectory</a>.

  "<p>Donald Trump has announced a 60-day ban on immigrants seeking to live and work in America permanently, and said he could extend it depending on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>The US president framed the executive order, which he expects to sign on Wednesday, as an effort to protect American workers from foreign competition. He said it would apply only to those seeking green cards and not temporary workers, but he did not explain how those whose applications are currently being processed would be affected.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens \u2013 so important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.\u201d</p> \n<p>The \u201cpause\u201d would be in effect for 60 days, he added, after which the need for an extension or alternation would be reviewed \u201cbased on economic conditions at the time\u201d. Under questioning, he confirmed that he might then decide to add a further 30 days or more.</p> \n<p>Trump said: \u201cThis order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency. In other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. It will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis ... We want to protect our US workers and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president, who has long campaigned against illegal immigration and again touted his US-Mexico border wall at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, added that the move would help conserve medical resources for US citizens.</p> \n<p>About a million people were granted green cards last year. The biggest share are family-based immigration sponsorships for permanent residency of foreign nationals by their American spouses.

In a policy white paper in June 2014, China asserted that it had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong and in August that year, ruled that it would allow \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d so long as it can first vet the leadership candidates.

Draconian anti-subversion laws passed under article 23 \u201cwould give the authorities new powers to persecute and purge the pro-democracy leaders and activists before the legislative council election in September,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To ensure that the outcomes of the election are controlled, Chan expected that Beijing may seek to disqualify some democrats, or cancel the election altogether and appoint a \u201cprovisional Legislative Council\u201d filled with pro-establishment figures.</p> <p>With Beijing\u2019s recent manoeuvre, it might be puzzling why China does not seem to care about throttling \u201cthe goose that lays the golden eggs\u201d. But Tsang said even though China is still dependent on Hong Kong for trade and business, its dependency has lessened markedly over the past three decades, with Hong Kong\u2019s GDP sliding from about a third the size of China\u2019s in the 1980s to less than 3% in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe loss of 3% of GDP would be painful but not intolerable,\u201d Tsang said of Chinese leaders\u2019 mentality. \u201cSo it is not unreasonable for Beijing to feel that \u2026 it would be a price China can pay. So, why not take a hard line now?\u201d</p> <p>London-based Hong Kong Watch points out that the Asian financial hub\u2019s value should however not be understated as it remains a gateway for western capital to reach mainland markets - it is the home to the largest number of initial public offerings by Chinese firms and the largest offshore centre for bond sales by Chinese companies.</p> <p>But as resilient as China may seem, analysts and activists warn that this is not the end of the game. Beijing-based political commentator Zhang Lifan said China\u2019s \u201cMao-era struggle mentality that wants to win at all cost\u201d may ultimately backfire.</p> <p>Joshua Wong, the 23-year-old political activist, does not believe China will succeed in intimidating Hongkongers but would instead \u201cprompt them to resist\u201d.</p> <p>If the anti-subversion law goes ahead, hundreds of thousands are expected to be up in arms again, reigniting the anti-government movement which has largely paused amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cDriving the opposition into the political wilderness serves Beijing\u2019s short-term interest, but it will embolden the opposition in civil society and attract more, not less, international attention,\u201d Chan said.</p> <p>Martin Lee, a drafter of the Basic Law, said he felt \u201cproud to walk the road of democracy with the outstanding youths in Hong Kong\u201d and his experience has only strengthened his will.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll not give up,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p>",

About one in three Americans are concerned about paying their bills and affording basic necessities over next month, but that number includes 48% of Hispanics and 39% of blacks, in comparison to 23% of whites.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T13:06:29.416Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9edf8d8f08cd080212f82a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amanda-holpuch\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T12:40:55.504Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mayor: Georgia reopening decision 'reckless, premature and dangerous'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Georgia mayor has criticized the governor\u2019s decision to re-open the state this week as \u201c<strong>reckless, premature and dangerous</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"071949b40ae8f0d6b3c5c0f64b4d5d2cfe26aa4a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071949b40ae8f0d6b3c5c0f64b4d5d2cfe26aa4a/543_0_2133_2667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Kemp.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Kemp.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Harris/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Governor <strong>Brian Kemp</strong>, a Republican, said businesses including bowling alleys, tattoo studios and hair salons would reopen this week. </p> \n  <p>The Democratic mayor of Savannah, <strong>Van Johnson</strong>, said Kemp\u2019s decision was \u201cnot based in any type of science or best practices\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople can see it for themselves.
