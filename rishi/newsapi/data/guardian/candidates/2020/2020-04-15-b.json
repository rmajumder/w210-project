Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of unbreakable employment contracts, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>Lebanon</strong>, where an economic meltdown had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organisation fear that many domestic workers are no longer being paid. There are concerns that with families confined to homes, workers have been forced into more intensive and dangerous work, facing obsessive demands to clean inside the house, and dangerous xenophobia on rare trips outside. </p> \n  <p>Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As one of the most marginalised groups in Lebanon, the government needs to clearly warn that it will prosecute employers who exploit or abuse migrant domestic workers. It should also ensure they are granted access to health care during the pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Lebanon, the 250,000 strong migrant workforce consists primarily of domestic workers who usually live in the homes of their employers.</p> \n  <p>In the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where foreign workers make up 90% of the population of the <strong>UAE</strong>, 60% in <strong>Kuwait</strong>, 50% in <strong>Bahrain</strong>, and 33% in <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, large numbers of migrant workers are instead housed in labor camps. Many have been stood down since the corona outbreak, and can neither depart for their home countries or leave their compounds. Social distancing is very difficult and access to advanced health care is often limited.</p> \n  <p>While official coronavirus numbers in the Gulf states are relatively low, compared with the region\u2019s most seriously affected state, Iran, there are concerns that migrant camps are dangerous incubators for the virus, and are not adequately checked by authorities who give precedence to citizens and expatriate residents.</p> \n  <p>When the region\u2019s airports eventually open, potentially by the end of Ramadan in late May, some GCC countries are expecting many laid off skilled and unskilled workers \u2013 who can still afford to leave \u2013 to attempt to do so. In the meantime, several million others face what NGOs believe to be a heightened risk and increasing uncertainty</p> \n  <p>The coronavirus crisis has crippled employment across the Gulf and could spell ruin for construction, retail and other sectors. The upshot could threaten the very future of migrant labour in all countries \u2013 and in turn threaten the viability of some of the world\u2019s richest economies.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:31:17.639Z\">at 12.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e96ea678f082a2cd32a7171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:07:42.335Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>EU</strong>\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has slammed the US decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1250356625803599875\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WHO</a>.

At his press conference Hancock wrongly said that he had not set a target of 25,000 tests a day. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9739718f08ea7431f436e0#block-5e9739718f08ea7431f436e0\"> 5.45pm.)</a> But he did recommit himself to the 100,000 tests a day target by the end of the month - despite widespread doubts as to whether this is achievable. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And as we build capacity further over this month and then beyond to that 100,000 a day target by the end of this month we\u2019ll expand further those who are eligible for tests - all as part of the plan to get a hold of this virus and make sure that we support the key public services that we need as this moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He published <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">a coronavirus action plan for adult social care (pdf)</a>. </strong>The plans involve increased testing and improved access to protective equipment for people in care homes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said that the daily death toll from coronavirus in the UK was reaching its peak.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On the issue of the peak, our view is that it is probably reaching the peak overall. That is what the flattening shows. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Whitty also said the number of deaths might go up tomorrow. That was because, after every weekend, there was a dip in reported deaths at the weekend, and for two days afterwards, followed by a rise. And he said deaths would continue at a high rate for a while. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the moment we are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak and we can start thinking very much about the next phases. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty also said that the experts did not know yet what the reproduction number for coronavirus was (the rate at which it is transmitted). It was between 0.5 and 1, he said. (One is the point where one new person gets infected for every person with the virus etc. The reproduction number has to be below 1 for the epidemic to be on the decline.) He said the better the understanding of this number, the more easy it would be for the experts to anticipate what would happen next.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that he wanted to change hospital rules so that \u201cwherever possible\u201d people will be given the \u201cchance to say goodbye\u201d to loved ones dying with coronavirus.</strong> He said that \u201cwanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts\u201d, and that he wept at reports of 13-year-old Ismail dying without a parent at his bedside. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving people\u2019s closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he was promoting a badge for carers, so that they would be able to receive the same public respect as NHS staff.</strong> Displaying the badge, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo. I know that many businesses will want to offer the same recognition and benefits as they do wonderfully to the NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It subsequently emerged that the badge was first launched last year.

Forsyth writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The thinking is that a delay would not solve the fundamental policy problems and that a deal is either possible or not. Another factor, I understand, is that the government worries about the cost of any extension. There is concern that extending could drag the UK into the arguments about who pays for the various EU schemes designed to protect the European economy and preserve the eurozone. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Government sources are saying this afternoon that, when <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, spoke to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier today about the next round of the Brexit talks, he stressed that the UK does not intend to ask for an extension.</p> \n  <p>However, Forsyth also floats the possibility that the EU could request an extension, not the UK. \u201cIf the EU did ask for more time, it would put the government in a difficult position,\u201d Forsyth writes. \u201cRejecting the request would sit ill with the idea that the UK wants to be a good neighbour to the EU.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under the withdrawal agreement the transition can be extended for one year or two years if both sides agree before 1 July. However the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act says UK ministers are not allowed to agree to an extension. For the government to allow an extension, it would have to pass legislation amending the act.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344/473_20_2298_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frost.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e971f448f0895d83068e8f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T15:13:42.826Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Turning away from coronavirus for a moment, <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary, has used <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/04/unite-behind-keir-starmer-to-cleanse-labours-shame/\">an article for LabourList</a> to urge Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to publish a redacted version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/labour-leader-sir-kier-starmer-orders-urgent-review-leaked-antisemitism-report\">the internal party report leaked at the weekend</a> that showed how hostile some party officials were to Jeremy Corbyn.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> has endorsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, the third major endorsement for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in as many days as the party comes together in the run-up to the November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">general election</a>.</p> \n<p>Warren <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/elizabeth-warren-quitting-2020-democratic-presidential-race\">exited</a> the race last month after a disappointing showing on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday\">Super Tuesday</a>, where she finished third in primary voting in her home state of Massachusetts. As other former rivals quickly aligned behind Biden, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, Warren waited, declining to immediately throw her support behind him or Bernie Sanders, an ideological ally.</p> \n<p>Sanders ended his campaign last week and endorsed Biden on Monday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>, who remained publicly neutral during the primary, endorsed Biden on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods,\u201d Warren wrote in a fundraising email sent to donors on Biden\u2019s behalf.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American,\u201d she added, in a strong statement amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Warren was the last of Biden\u2019s major opponents to endorse him and her support helps the party present a united front against Trump as it prepares for what will probably be a historically divisive general election.</p> \n<p>Unlike in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>, when the Democratic primary race extended late into the summer, the process of choosing the party\u2019s nominee was relatively short, despite a record field. Though Biden likely won\u2019t accumulate enough delegates to officially claim the nomination until June, he started to build an insurmountable lead in early March and within weeks was the party\u2019s presumptive standard-bearer.</p> \n<p>The swift backing of his rivals will help ease the often-fraught process of bringing the party together after a hard-fought primary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/democratic-primary-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020\">The Democratic primary was a wild, unpredictable ride \u2013 except the result</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her endorsement comes as speculation builds around who Biden will choose as a running mate. Biden has been unusually forthcoming in discussing his search, vowing to choose a woman and many party leaders are urging him to consider his former rivals, Warren among them.</p> \n<p>Warren was the last major female candidate in a historic field of Democratic women and her demise led to vocal calls for Biden to choose a woman. Some of the party\u2019s more liberal members believe choosing Warren would help Biden appeal to progressives and young voters who remain deeply skeptical of his campaign.</p> \n<p>In her endorsement, Warren sought notes of unity, assuring liberal supporters that Biden is listening.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you disagree, he\u2019ll listen \u2013 not just listen, but really hear you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd treat you with respect, no matter where you\u2019re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come with new facts or a good argument, he\u2019s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a email to her supporters, Biden said bluntly: \u201cYou\u2019re needed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former vice president assured them that he, too, intended to fight for the \u201cbig, structural change\u201d that Warren championed and insisted that he is looking forward and \u201cnot trying to take us back to a country that never existed.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI know, for some of you, that you might be skeptical of me or my campaign. I understand that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I intend to earn your votes. And I intend to earn your trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an early overture to progressive voters, Biden adopted Warren\u2019s plan to overhaul the bankruptcy system, an issue over which they had clashed more than a decade ago, when she was a Harvard law professor and he was a senator from Delaware. The plan would roll back key provisions of a 2005 bankruptcy law Biden supported and Warren vocally opposed, even testifying against it before his committee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec64ff6d-a5cb-4878-828d-bd6da8ce367e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4yCY232AZ_8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the email to donors, Warren recalled being sworn in to the Senate in 2013. As vice-president, he presided over the swearing in ceremony.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe Biden was there the very moment I became a senator \u2013 he swore me in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd when he did, he said, \u201cYou gave me hell! And you\u2019re gonna do a great job.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden, 77, said he would create a committee to help him vet possible running mates by the end of the month. The selection process, which is typically shrouded in secrecy, will include between six and a dozen candidates, all women, and he will make his choice before the Democratic convention in Milwaukee, which was postponed to August because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>If elected, Biden\u2019s running mate would be the first female vice-president in history. Only two women have ever been chosen as running mates: the Alaska governor Sarah Palin in 2008 and the New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.</p> \n<p>Biden has spoken on several occasions about the partnership that he shared with Obama as his vice-president and has told donors and voters that he is seeking a similar dynamic with his future running mate, who he believes should complement his experience.</p> \n<p>At a virtual fundraising event earlier this month, Biden said: \u201cI\u2019m going to need a woman vice-president who has capacities, has strengths where I have weaknesses.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What is the World Health Organi</strong><strong>zation\u2019s remit?</strong></h2> \n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded as the UN global health body in 1948 in the aftermath of the second world war with a mandate to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do\">promote global health,</a> protect against infectious disease and to serve the vulnerable. It was inspired by the international sanitary conferences of the 19th century set up to combat communicable diseases such as cholera, yellow fever and plague.</p> \n<p>Its current programme envisages expanding universal healthcare to a billion more people, protecting another billion from health emergencies and providing a further billion people with better health and wellbeing. </p> \n<h2><strong>What does that involve?</strong></h2> \n<p>In practical terms, the badly underfunded WHO acts as a clearing house for investigation, data and technical recommendations on emerging disease threats such as the coronavirus and Ebola. It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p> \n<p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world with its more resilient healthcare systems, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes. Its 2018-9 budget was $4.8bn, which became $5.7bn when emergencies were included.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump has presented the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">freezing of US funding to the WHO</a> as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. But the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution,</a> about $400m annually, by half as part of $3bn cuts to US global health funding across the board.</p> \n<p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b547ab04-9a4f-4f6c-8c17-c8f14a632205\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6JIA8iBw1-w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The allegation by Trump and his supporters that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. WHO technical guidance issued in early January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">was warning of the risk of human-to-human transmission</a> and the organisation declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern a day before Trump announced his partial ban on flights from China.</p> \n<p>Instead, it appears Trump is following a familiar playbook: finding others to blame amid his own handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has included calling it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d, blaming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/donald-trump-obama-administration-coronavirus\">the previous Obama administration</a> and taking aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/trump-states-governors-clashes\">at state governors</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How does the WHO\u2019s performance in the coronavirus crisis compare </strong><strong>with the </strong><strong>2014</strong><strong>-15 Ebola outbreak?</strong></h2> \n<p>The WHO, under the then-director general, Margaret Chan, was savaged from all sides for responding so slowly to an Ebola outbreak that began in a remote forested part of Guinea where the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia were virtually non-existent. By the time the WHO acted, six months late, it had reached the dense cities.</p> \n<p>The fallout for the WHO was serious and undermined its credibility. US critics suggested scrapping it and setting up a new global public health body, although the idea did not take off and President Obama did not support it. An independent report commissioned by Chan said the WHO\u2019s funding was inadequate and governments had not increased their contributions in years. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the current director general, and all other candidates for the role after Chan stood down pledged to reform its governance and funding.</p> \n<p>Most health experts agree the organisation under Tedros has performed much better over the coronavirus.</p> \n<h2><br><strong>How big an impact will the US funding cuts have?</strong></h2> \n<p>While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 the potential for a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p> \n<p>Even before the Trump announcement, the organisation was looking at potential cuts to already underfunded programming. Such impacts could be felt in programmes already complicated by the coronavirus, such as vaccination for communicable diseases and in building up early warning systems and resilience to deal with diseases such as Ebola in African countries.</p> \n<p>Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, called Trump\u2019s decision extremely problematic, noting that the WHO was leading efforts to help developing countries fight the spread of Covid-19. \u201cThis is the agency that\u2019s looking out for other countries and leading efforts to stop the pandemic. This is exactly the time when they need more funding, not less,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2><strong>What other impacts will there be?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump\u2019s assault on the reliability of WHO data and early warning systems, in pursuit of his own agenda against China, threatens its leadership role. While global health diplomacy is a balancing act when dealing with countries like China, which have a poor record on freedom of speech, transparency and human rights, the information provided to health officials by the WHO is designed to be scientifically and clinically useful in the control of the spread of disease.</p>",

  "<p>The Israeli opposition leader, Benny Gantz, is due to resume coalition talks with Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday evening, amid domestic speculation that the prime minister might prefer to fight a fourth election.</p> <p>In the past year, the two rivals have battled through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">three inconclusive national votes</a> that gave neither a clear majority. In that time, they have also made multiple failed attempts to join together in a unity government.</p> <p>Facing the coronavirus pandemic, both have expressed a desire to come to a final understanding.</p> <p>While negotiations have remained difficult, President Reuven Rivlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/israeli-president-extends-deadline-for-gantz-to-form-government\">extended a Monday deadline</a> to agree a deal until midnight on Wednesday after it looked as if late progress had been made.</p> <p>Gantz had that day made an 11th-hour plea on national television for Netanyahu to return to the table. \u201cIsraelis are expecting us to put aside our differences and work together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Having imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/israel-to-track-mobile-phones-of-suspected-coronavirus-cases\">strict measures</a> to reduce coronavirus infections, Israel has a relatively slow rise of new cases. However, there have been concerning outbreaks, especially in poorer and densely populated areas. The country of 9 million people has about 12,000 people confirmed to have Covid-19, with 126 deaths reported as of Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Hours before the Monday deadline, Netanyahu responded to Gantz by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1249767721912459265?s=20\">tweeting</a>: \u201cBenny, I\u2019m waiting for you in the prime minister\u2019s residence in Jerusalem.\u201d</p> <p>The two met and talked late into the night and again the next morning, breaking for the Passover holiday. Talks will continue on Wednesday evening, hours before the deadline.</p> <p>Hopes of a power-sharing pact remain weak. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party said last week that after an \u201call-around agreement\u201d had been reached, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party suddenly resurrected old demands around judicial appointments. Likud argued that it was Gantz who had backed away.</p> <p>Israeli media have speculated that Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving leader, may have decided that he would prefer to see the stalemate continue, which would eventually trigger a fourth election.</p> <p>A poll published on Channel 12 News showed Likud could gain seats in a future election. This was in part because Gantz lost more than half his lawmakers when he decided \u2013 against their will \u2013 to continue negotiating with Netanyahu.</p> <p>In the poll, Gantz was predicted to take 19 seats, much fewer than the 33 he won in March.</p> <p>Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving leader, has said publicly that he is working hard for a unity government.</p> <p>Nahum Barnea, a well-known columnist for the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, said this week that Netanyahu might now be \u201ctrying to buy time so he is assured caretaker status as prime minister until the next election or the next century\u201d.</p>",

Three days later, disillusioned following his second 20-minute cameo during another home defeat, this time against Chelmsford, he checked into a Maidstone services hotel on the advice of Brian Tinnion, City\u2019s loans manager who was concerned about Morrell driving the five-hour journey home late at night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the worst hotel after the worst game you could ever imagine and I\u2019d probably go as far to say it was the lowest point in my life,\u201d Morrell says. \u201cI just wanted to give up.

I looked around Liverpool\u2019s academy, I had sorted out where I was going to live, go to school and was prepared to leave.</p> <p>\u201cBut after conversations with the then first-team manager [Derek McInnes] I decided Bristol City was the best place for me and signed a professional contract at 15, which is unheard of really, and made my debut at 16.

Earlier that year, with the blessing of the club, he explored moving on and spent a fortnight on trial with the Tampa Bay Rowdies in Florida. As Morrell got older, a common theme amid those stories of rejection was his height but in some ways that proved to be the making of the 5ft 6in midfielder.</p> <p>\u201cMy agent had put the word out there to say: \u2018He is available, do you want to have a look at him?\u2019 And no one came back. At the time I was gutted but looking back I can understand it because I had never played any senior football and people were looking at it thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t take a risk on a 20-year-old centre-midfielder who has never played a game and is physically not the most imposing.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cEver since then I\u2019ve overcompensated and made sure I\u2019m the most horrible person on the pitch, the most aggressive on the pitch, the person on the pitch with the most personality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/world-cup-questions-why-didnt-the-great-dutch-teams-of-the-1990s-win-it\">World Cup questions: Why didn\u2019t the great Dutch teams of the 1990s win it? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lee Johnson, the Bristol City manager , once described Morrell as \u201cthe unluckiest footballer in the world\u201d but, the season after returning from Margate, someone else\u2019s misfortune proved his gain.

Not just in football but in life you need opportunities and when you get them you have to take them and luckily I did.\u201d</p> <p>Since then Morrell has mixed it with Luka Modric and hopes to come up against another idol when Wales play Italy in Group A next summer. \u201cI have probably watched every [Marco] Verratti video on YouTube. I will watch PSG just to watch him; he is one of the best three midfielders in the world.</p> <p>\u201cEven before a game, I just think: \u2018What can I do that he does so well and how can he improve my game?\u2019 I\u2019ve always taken bits from other people and I\u2019ll try and learn little things off him, even if it\u2019s just the smallest thing, how many times he checks his shoulder before he receives the ball or how he manoeuvres his body to play a longer pass.

To see their faces after the Hungary game [when Wales secured qualification for Euro 2020] was pretty special.

  "<p>There are parts of Mrs America, a nine-episode mini-series for FX on Hulu, in which it flexes its full-budget cable bona fides: good bouffant wigs, expensive 70s-styled sets, a megawatt cast. It has not one, but two character-cementing power walks for its star, Cate Blanchett, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/obituaries/phyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html\">Phyllis Schlafly</a>, the anti-feminist conservative activist <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12817756/phyllis-schlafly-dies-started-war-on-women\">justifiably loathed</a> by many Americans. In the first, she silently saunters down a pageant runway in a patriotic swimsuit, game to put looks ahead of intellect. In the second, halfway through the first episode, she marches into the Capitol soundtracked by Steppenwolf\u2019s Magic Carpet Ride, a pink tweed dress walking against feminist protesters outside and blue-suited men within. It\u2019s a bold proposal, to ride through the 1970s\u2019 women\u2019s movement and counter-revolution with an icon of the religious right, and in Blanchett\u2019s hands, it\u2019s electric.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/05/devs-tv-review-alex-garland\">Devs review \u2013 Alex Garland's elegant but flawed big tech thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s also a splashy contrast to the show\u2019s strength: thorny conversations and the personal moments which form movements, for better or for worse. Though it can at times wade into wonky thickets (primary delegates, how do those work?), Mrs America is a punchy disco-ball of a show, a full portrait of Schlafly\u2019s root in the women\u2019s campaign against women and such second-wave feminist icons as Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba) and Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman).</p> <p>It\u2019s a tricky move to base a show around the fight over the Equal Rights Amendment, a piece of legislation first introduced in 1923 to enshrine protection from discrimination by sex in the constitution. Trickier still to make the linchpin Schlafly, the anti-feminist, anti-gay \u201cfamily values\u201d crusader whose coalition of conservatives tanked the ERA, once a bipartisan surefire, in the course of a decade. But Mrs America, created by Mad Men writer Dahvi Waller, mines the past for conflicts and contradictions with contemporary relevance, splicing warm-hued archival footage with deeply researched scripts with a roving structure. Each episode focuses on one woman (as go the titles \u2013 Gloria, Shirley, Betty etc) as she navigates the public fight for equal rights amid the personal struggles for opportunity, unity and political coherence in one\u2019s private life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIpTIPKTOkU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OIpTIPKTOkU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a common and familiar theme of principles versus practicality in these stories. Byrne, in particular, is excellent as Steinem, the media darling of independent womanhood grappling with her role as a leader who instinctively attracts publicity. Aduba\u2019s Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president in 1972, is a deep well of unfathomable confidence and frustration at the compromises made for progress. Margo Martindale takes no prisoners as Representative Bella Abzug, an organizer of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, and Elizabeth Banks pinch-hits as Jill Ruckelshaus, a Republican feminist alarmed by the rise of Schlafly\u2019s far-right strain in her party. Feminist-focusing moments speak to contemporary struggles at coalition building, such as how a space like Steinem\u2019s Ms Magazine is less amenable to black feminists like editor Margaret Sloan (Bria Henderson) than its utopian vision admits.</p> <p>And punch for punch there\u2019s Schlafly, the focus of the first episode and, for lack of a better term, humanized anti-hero of the show\u2019s feminist vision. Mrs America takes pains to color in the black-and-white dichotomy \u2013 Schlafly and her Eagle Forum bad, feminists good \u2013 with which most viewers will probably enter. In Washington, Schlafly is cut off from her missile strategy spiel by a congressman who wants her to take notes; the men continue without her as she fetches a pen. She comes home to her husband Fred (John Slattery) weary; he wants to have sex, she doesn\u2019t. Guess who wins out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbea22ef4779bbd215cb1ac18f85df27bdf55a97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbea22ef4779bbd215cb1ac18f85df27bdf55a97/0_422_3865_2319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Blanchett, masterful as ever and an executive producer on the show, you can\u2019t help but step into Schlafly\u2019s shoes, and there will be those who argue, fairly, that <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pdominguez/mrs-america-cate-blanchett-fx-conservative-women\">Mrs America gives too much latitude</a> to Schlafly\u2019s gender crusade over her racist, homophobic fight to preserve her upper-class white status. Elements of this work into series subplots: Schlafly\u2019s anti-gay agenda traps her beloved eldest son in the closet, and her home is run by black women on staff and her spinster sister. But I\u2019d argue that like The Americans, another prestige FX project set in late cold-war America, Mrs America burrows into the loyalties, betrayals and motivations of \u201cthem\u201d without condoning the implications of their actions; Schlafly\u2019s abetting of the Klan in her coalition, though presented here as a tactical move for numbers, says volumes about her politics.</p> <p>Schlafly ultimately won the battle \u2013 the ERA died in 1982 three states short of ratification, and the election of her dream candidate, Ronald Reagan, ends the series. But the war continues. Waller <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tvs-top-5-inside-star-studded-world-mrs-america-1289706\">has said</a> she began the project before the 2016 election, before the #MeToo movement, before a widespread state-level crackdown on abortion access, before select states <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805647054/house-votes-to-revive-equal-rights-amendment-removing-ratification-deadline\">revived the fight</a> to ratify the ERA by rescinding the deadline. Whether or not you see prestige anti-hero treatment as illuminating or obfuscating the connections between Schlafly\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d values and Make America Great Again is, I suppose, a matter of how you fill the void behind Schlafly\u2019s steely composure in a flawlessly executed series. But there\u2019s no doubt an intoxicating thrill in tracing how, exactly, we got here.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mrs America begins on Hulu on 15 April with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

Much of the focus of the criticism has been on a 14 January tweet from the WHO that said \u201cpreliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d. But WHO officials also told their counterparts in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\"> technical briefings on 10 and 11 January</a>, and briefed the press on 14 January, that human-to-human transmission was a strong possibility given the experience of past coronavirus epidemics and urged suitable precautions.</p> \n<p>The WHO has also been attacked over its continuing exclusion of Taiwan from membership because Beijing considers it to be Chinese territory. Trump\u2019s decision to cut funding was welcomed in some quarters, including by the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who called the WHO an \u201carm of Chinese diplomacy\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1250205442640314368\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The WHO is an arm of Chinese diplomacy under the guise of liberal internationalism or global governance.

On 9 January the <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/69650/timeline-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-and-u-s-response/\">WHO distributed guidance</a> to member states for their own risk assessment and planning.</p> \n<p>Trump and his supporters have focused on a 14 January WHO tweet reporting the findings of preliminary Chinese studies suggesting \u201cno clear evidence\u201d of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>While the WHO was obliged to report on the latest findings of a member state at the source of the outbreak, its officials told their counterparts in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\"> technical briefings on 10 and 11 January</a>, and briefed the press on 14 January, that human-to-human transmission was still a strong possibility given the experience of past coronavirus epidemics and urged suitable precautions.</p> \n<p>Yamey said it was ridiculous to point to a single tweet early in the pandemic as the fixed position of the WHO. \u201cThe whole point of science is that we have initial hypotheses and initial ideas, and we update those ideas as more and more data emerges,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On 23 January the WHO updated its account of the coronavirus threat, confirming human-to-human transmission and warning that the global risk was high. One week later it formally declared a global emergency.</p> \n<p>Announcing the cut in funding on Tuesday, Trump accused the WHO of failing to send its experts to the source of the outbreak to gather samples. That failure decisively set back the effect to contain the pandemic, he claimed.</p> \n<p>In fact Beijing blocked a WHO delegation from visiting Wuhan in the first weeks of the outbreak. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had to <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1737014.shtml\">fly to Beijing</a> to meet Xi Jinping on 29 January to negotiate entry and information sharing. A WHO team was allowed to visit Wuhan on 22 February. Tedros has been criticised for his flattery of Xi and the Chinese response, in the face of Beijing\u2019s obstructionism and cover-up attempts. His defenders said that such diplomacy was the price for entry.</p> \n<p>Trump did more than his own fair share of Xi flattery. On 24 January, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1220818115354923009?lang=en\">president tweeted</a> \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus \u2026 The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The claim that the delay in the WHO acquiring samples crippled the international response is also false. Chinese scientists publicly released the genetic sequence of Covid-19 on 11 January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By early February the WHO was in a position to distribute a Covid-19 test worldwide, but the US government opted not to have it fast-tracked through approval. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) instead produced its own test at about the same time, but it was flawed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">had to be recalled</a>. US testing would be set back more than six weeks compared to the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>While virtually no testing was under way in the US throughout February, Trump assumed the consequently low number of confirmed US cases meant that his country had somehow escaped. \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1232058127740174339?lang=en\">boasted on 24 February</a>, nearly a month after the WHO declaration of emergency. \u201cWe are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health [Organisation] have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s turn against the WHO only gathered pace over the past week, as more and more reports emerged of the administration\u2019s own complacent and dysfunctional response.</p> \n<p>The impact of a block on US funds is likely to mitigated by other countries, who have almost unanimously expressed confidence in the WHO, stepping up their own financial backing. The UK, for example, has announced \u00a3200m in new funding for international efforts to contain and combat the pandemic, of which \u00a365m is earmarked for the WHO.</p> \n<p>How well Trump\u2019s scapegoating of the WHO will play in the US election is impossible to predict, but on the world stage it will undoubtedly be seen as yet another step in an accelerating US abdication of global leadership.</p>",

Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt.

In the meantime, here\u2019s what we know about ventilator shortages in the US:</strong></p> \n  <p>It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said.</p> \n  <p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\">31 times that number</a> to treat coronavirus patients. <br></p> \n  <p>An article in the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMp2006141\">New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March </a>categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.<br></p> \n  <p>The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T22:49:16.774Z\">at 11.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9638e18f08213494be6c1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T22:29:05.181Z\">11.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Trump also based the WHO for praising China\u2019s \u201ctransparency\u201d.</strong></p> \n  <p>But the president himself praised China\u2019s transparency \u2014 on January 24. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1220818115354923009\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus.

More on Donald Trump\u2019s unhinged White House briefing last night in a minute. First, the figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-map-us-latest-covid-19-cases-state-by-state\"><strong>according to Johns Hopkins University</strong></a>:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>US cases: <strong>582,431</strong></li> \n   <li>US deaths: <strong>23,647</strong></li> \n   <li>New York deaths: <strong>10,058</strong></li> \n   <li>New Jersey deaths: <strong>2,443</strong></li> \n   <li>Michigan deaths: <strong>1,602</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Yesterday, Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, told reporters \u201c<strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-reopen-plan.html\">the worst is over</a></strong>\u201d, if social distancing and other restrictions remain in place, and announced a partnership with six other north-eastern governors to work on reopening the regional economy.</p> \n  <p>Of course, Trump\u2019s public utterances clashed somewhat with such a cautious approach. </p> \n  <p>On Twitter, the president claimed <strong>authority over the states</strong> about reopening plans. The experts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1249731213566324740\">dismissed</a> that claim.</p> \n  <p>Then at a White House briefing marked by attacks on reporters and the playing of a propaganda film half-ripped from Fox News, <strong>Trump made a claim for the ages</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Constitutional lawyers: Nope.</p> \n  <p>CNN, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/1249829406719143937\"><strong>CBS reporter Paula Reid</strong></a> and most of the rest of the press corps: Incredulous.</p> \n  <p>Fox News?</p> \n  <p>Laura Ingraham: \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing. That was great. It was a tour de force!\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sean Hannity, from whose show much of Trump\u2019s propaganda film seemed to come, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-greg-abbott-states-reopen-before-may\"><strong>spoke to Texas governor Greg Abbott</strong></a>, who said: \u201cI think most states can reopen even sooner than later. We don\u2019t have to wait until 1 May.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s the date by which Trump, the panjandrum of the White House podium, has said he would like to start reopening the shuttered US economy.</p> \n  <p>White House experts including the notably not-yet-fired Dr Anthony Fauci have cast doubt on that goal and said moving too swiftly to lift social restrictions <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/trump-fauci-hahn-reopening-who-virus-stalk-human-race\">could cause a resurgence in Covid-19 cases</a></strong>. Trump says the decision is his alone and he will listen to his advisers \u2013 and also rely a lot on \u201cinstinct\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Let that sink in. While you do, here\u2019s some reading:</p> \n  <p>Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-coronavirus-meltdown-media-authority\"><strong>take on that briefing</strong></a>, with an intro for the ages:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A toddler threw a self-pitying tantrum on live television on Monday night. Unfortunately he was 73 years old, wearing a long red tie and running the world\u2019s most powerful country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here\u2019s Tom McCarthy\u2019s timeline of Trump\u2019s coronavirus misinformation campaign:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/trump-coronavirus-alerts-disinformation-timeline\">'It will disappear': the disinformation Trump spread about the coronavirus \u2013 timeline</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div>"
