The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

The company pays only for hours they have actually worked and the government makes up the difference.

And when faced with a pandemic, the government sprung into action earlier than anywhere else in India.</p> \n  <p>Health minister, KK Shailaja, who swiftly earned the nickname \u201cCoronavirus Slayer\u201d, was the first in the country to assemble a taskforce in mid-February to begin aggressively contact tracing, testing and quarantining any possible cases. The state also closed all schools, restaurants and banned gatherings before any other and began setting up public sinks and hand sanitiser dispensers in public places, even at bus stops. The state has one of the highest testing rates in India, though it has also faced a shortage of testing kits.</p> \n  <p>And when prime minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 with four hours notice, causing havoc for the millions of migrant workers stuck thousands of miles from home. The Kerala authorities set up camps and provided provisions for their three million \u201cguest workers\u201d, preventing the dangerous exodus of people trying to get back home. A total of almost 19,000 relief camps have since been set up in Kerala, providing three meals a day. In comparison, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state which has one of the highest numbers of migrant workers, just 2,000 camps have been set up.</p> \n  <p>Those in the camps are being given regular health checks and they even made arrangements to charge migrant workers phones, set up a helpline call centre which speaks five Indian languages. They also established a counselling service and when protests broke out in the camps by the migrant workers from northern states that they were only being fed rice, their diet was adapted to suit northern India tastes, including chapati, dal and pickle. In one camp, a Bengali kitchen was established. Across the state, mobile health workers are visiting the elderly and vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, experts are warning against celebrating the state\u2019s success too early, especially as cases nationwide continue to steeply increase, and Kerala reported two new cases on Monday. On Sunday the Ministry of Home affairs also issued a rebuke to the Kerala state government for easing restrictions, with Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla issuing a thinly veiled warning against states that were \u201cdiluting\u201d the lockdown.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d8a9a8f08b7689b031b05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:52:17.138Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> health authority called for a stronger and more rigorous testing regime to ensure that the new coronavirus does not escape detection, whether in travellers arriving from abroad or from other parts of the country. </p> \n  <p>All localities must improve their testing capabilities, including those at border crossings, and report any epidemic information in a timely manner, the National Health Commission cited its director Ma Xiaowei as saying.

It is the first known case in Borno, the epicentre of jihadist conflict that ravaged the region for over a decade. <br><br>According to a statement by MSF this morning, the aid worker, whose identity has not been revealed, tested positive in a post-mortem test. MSF said its teams \u201chave strengthened infection prevention measures, hygiene facilities, infection control and isolation spaces.\u201d<br><br>Authorities are now working to trace the worker\u2019s contacts and abate a spread of the virus within one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. <br><br>Almost two million people are displaced in northeast Nigeria, with almost 3 million in urgent need of food aid according to the World Food Programme. Several humanitarian organisations operate in the region, providing essential help. The insurgency has decimated the key services millions in the region rely on, including its health system.<br><br>On Sunday night, the UN said a major priority is to decongest refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their homes. Yet it is a huge challenge as many areas across Borno and the north-east remain unsafe, exacerbated by a recent withdrawal of soldiers into so called super-camps. After relentless attacks by jihadists, soldiers have redeployed to better defend their positions but NGOs in the region say it has left many towns more vulnerable to insurgents.<br><br>There are 627 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country of 200 million people. Yet the daily rise in cases is gradually accelerating, with 86 new cases confirmed yesterday. Nigerian authorities have only tested about 7,000 people, and whilst countries around the world are struggling to boost testing capacity, many West African countries have tested more per million people. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d80ef8f08b7689b031aba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:01:19.677Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US hostility to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics.</p> \n  <p>The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who\">Read more here.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:28:11.285Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d71c78f08b7689b031a0e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:00:48.220Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest developments around the world on the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported</strong>.

He said Japan\u2019s initial approach \u2013 to identify and contain infection clusters \u2013 had worked well until major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka started reporting significant rises in cases from the second half of March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s government should have changed strategy earlier,\u201d Iwata said, referring to the shift to wider testing combined with social distancing. \u201cThere was a tremendous delay and that has caused huge problems,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Hospitals initially designated to treat patients with the illness had become unable to deal with the growing number of cases, leaving other hospitals unprepared to fill the treatment gap. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t prepared and your staff aren\u2019t trained, you can\u2019t just admit Covid-19 patients,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cMany hospitals are not ready to fight against Covid-19. That\u2019s why [there have been reports] of ambulances going from one hospital to another\u201d in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and other cities.</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cWe needed to change strategy immediately, but traditionally, Japan isn\u2019t good at doing that. When we have a plan A we are poor at converting it into a plan B.

Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance. In Tokyo, many places have closed their doors, but some bars, restaurants and cafes remain open, with many of the city\u2019s streets far from empty.<br><br>Iwata said the lack of urgency implicit in the measures meant people still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/clash-looms-in-japan-as-tokyo-governor-says-abes-covid-19-measures-not-enough\">hadn\u2019t understood the importance of staying home and social distancing</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government didn\u2019t send the right message to people \u2013 that you need to distance yourself from others to block the route of transmission.

  "<p>Kosovo\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Albin Kurti, has launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump\u2019s acting national intelligence director, accusing him of meddling in the country\u2019s politics and helping to bring down his former government with the goal of delivering a quick diplomatic victory for Trump.</p> <p>Kurti is staying on as PM in an acting capacity after his coalition partners turned against him in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/kosovo-government-falls-in-vote-of-no-confidence\">parliamentary vote last month</a> that was egged on by US diplomats. The upheaval was met with disbelief among many Kosovans, who wanted the government to focus on fighting coronavirus.</p> <p>Kurti acknowledged the crisis had a local dimension, but accused Richard Grenell, who has been working on a potential deal for Serbia to recognise Kosovo, of being \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in pushing for the vote.</p> <p>\u201cMy government was not overthrown for anything else but simply because Ambassador Grenell was in a hurry to sign an agreement with Serbia,\u201d said Kurti in a press conference held via video link from Pristina.</p> <p>A Trump loyalist, Grenell is the US ambassador to Germany and was also recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/19/trump-richard-grenell-director-national-intelligence\">appointed</a> as the acting director for national intelligence, coordinating the work of 17 US intelligence agencies. He previously caused controversy in Berlin by saying he wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/german-politicians-call-for-expulsion-of-trumps-berlin-envoy\">\u201cempower\u201d rightwing forces in Europe</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he [Grenell] needs is a quick deal to show they can fix crises in the world, perhaps in contrast to the Clintons, Bushes and Obamas, without any military intervention, and this can be presented as a success in this electoral year,\u201d said Kurti.</p> <p>He accused Grenell of being disinterested in the substance of any deal and of being focused only on getting \u201cthe signature on the bottom of the paper\u201d as soon as possible.</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s failure to make progress on a deal with North Korea or in the Middle East, it is possible that the White House now sees that Balkans as the best bet for a diplomatic breakthrough, but time is running out before the November election.</p> <p>Belgrade refuses to recognise the independence of its former province, which split off from Serbia after a bloody crackdown by Belgrade triggered a Nato bombing campaign in 1999.</p> <p>A deal would ideally pave the way for Kosovo to take up a seat at the UN and for both countries to become EU members in future. The most controversial aspect of discussions has been talk of a possible land swap. Parallel talks between the two countries have been held under EU auspices.</p> <p>Kosovo\u2019s president, Hashim Tha\u00e7i, has proved more receptive than Kurti to US overtures, and on Sunday Grenell <a href=\"I\u2019ve%20spoken%20with%20leaders%20in%20Serbia%20and%20Kosovo%20to%20make%20clear%20they%20must%20start%20building%20confidence%20today%20in%20preparation%20-%20and%20they\u2019ve%20committed%20to%20do%20so.\">wrote on Twitter</a> that he had spoken to Tha\u00e7i and to Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, \u201cto make clear they must start building confidence today in preparation\u201d for dialogue. He denied that he or anyone else in the discussions had mentioned a land swap.</p> <p>Tha\u00e7i <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HashimThaciRKS/status/1251871256254783489\">wrote</a> on Twitter on Sunday that he would form a new government this week, though it is unclear whether he can do so constitutionally without new elections. The Covid-19 crisis would appear to make elections and any major protests against the situation impossible for now.</p> <p>\u201cThey are hoping that coronavirus will last and people will have to stay indoors,\u201d said Kurti. As of Monday, Kosovo had 561 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 12 deaths.</p>",
  "<p>Unlike some high-ranking elected officials in America, John Oliver has long taken coronavirus seriously. Since the beginning of March, the Last Week Tonight host has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/02/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-coronavirus\">traced the virus\u2019s spread in China</a>, exhorted viewers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/16/john-oliver-coronavirus-were-going-to-need-to-look-out-for-one-another\">to take care of each other</a> as daily life in America evaporated, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/30/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-coronavirus-trump\">blasted Trump\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d handling</a> of the crisis and discussed how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/john-oliver-coronavirus-things-need-to-change-and-not-go-back-to-normal\">pandemic revealed and exploited longstanding inequalities in America</a>. And on Sunday, Oliver turned to one of the main threats to recovery in this pandemic: misinformation, particularly from within the feedback loop between America\u2019s rightwing media ecosystem and Donald Trump.</p> <p>America\u2019s rightwing media is \u201cdominated by some enormously powerful individuals\u201d, explained Oliver, such as the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, a \u201cman with millions of listeners, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and almost certainly a room in his basement that his housekeeper isn\u2019t allowed to go into.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRFbwjwQ4VE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRFbwjwQ4VE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Limbaugh exemplifies how, as Oliver said, \u201cMany in conservative media have found it easy to fold this virus into narratives that they\u2019ve been carefully building up for decades\u201d. For over a decade, Limbaugh has pushed his \u201cfour corners of deceit: government, academia, science and the media,\u201d which, \u201cunfortunately, happen to be the four most important groups to listen to during a public health crisis,\u201d said Oliver, though it makes sense as a business strategy: \u201cIf you establish your show as the sole outlet worth trusting, that gives you a lot of power.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the same technique \u2013 we\u2019ll give you the \u201ctrue\u201d story elites are trying to hide \u2013 used by Fox News, as evidenced by the narrative the network pushed early in the pandemic: that coronavirus was hysteria drummed up by the liberal media to derail the president. Oliver pointed to such Fox News segments as \u201ccoronavirus hysteria\u201d (Sean Hannity), \u201cliberal media hoax backfires!\u201d (Trish Reagan), and \u201cTrump confronts the panic pushers\u201d (Laura Ingraham).</p> <p>\u201cAnd when people started dying \u2013 and their arguments became harder to sell \u2013 the network seemed to pivot from trying to downplay the warnings to downplaying the deaths,\u201d Oliver continued, pointing to numerous examples of Fox News hosts favorably comparing US coronavirus deaths with a whole season of the flu. And while yes, Oliver acknowledged, many people and companies underestimated Covid-19, Fox News was still doing it publicly while behind the scenes the company suspended all non-essential business travel and encouraged staff to move all in-person meetings to Skype, \u201cbecause, and this is true, they only pretend to believe these things on television for money\u201d, Oliver said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/john-oliver-coronavirus-things-need-to-change-and-not-go-back-to-normal\">John Oliver: 'Things need to change and not go back to normal'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s also, he continued, the compounding problem that President Trump is not only the subject of much Fox News misinformation, but also its target, as he\u2019s known to pull talking points directly from its hosts. For example, Trump latched on to the \u201cmiracle cure\u201d hydroxychloroquine after viewing Tucker Carlson tout a questionable study on its efficacy as a coronavirus treatment (there is no widespread medical evidence to support this, and side effects can be fatal). \u201cThat is not to say that this drug shouldn\u2019t be studied. It should, and it is,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cBut the feedback loop between Fox and Trump has run way ahead of the science here.\u201d It\u2019s a textbook demonstration of this news ecosystem at work: Fox News promoted the hydroxychloroquine \u201csolution\u201d over 300 times in two weeks, according to Media Matters. Trump encouraged Americans to \u201cjust try it \u2013 what do you have to lose?\u201d (your life), Limbaugh picked up the charge on his show, which still attracts 15 million listeners a week, and now lupus patients and others who depend on hydroxychloroquine are facing shortages.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say,\u201d whether the drug could be used as a treatment for the virus,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe problem is, \u2018might\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 aren\u2019t really words that grab an audience,\u201d and simple solutions make for good television, which is Trump\u2019s underlying logic. Thus, \u201cwe have a network, and a president, who thrive on division, feeding on one another, at a time when we desperately need a unified response to a public health crisis.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/30/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-coronavirus-trump\">John Oliver blasts Trump's 'irresponsible' handling of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This alternate facts ecosystem was on full display this weekend, as groups of protesters at capitols in Michigan, Minnesota and other states violated physical distancing orders to demand the economy reopen immediately. Said protesters repeated misinformation fostered on rightwing media; Fox News gleefully covered the protests and attributed their claim that \u201cthe cure can\u2019t be worse than the disease\u201d to Trump, though it actually originated on Fox News. And after the segment on a group called \u201cLiberate Minnesota\u201d aired, Trump tweeted \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d in support.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this is legitimately dangerous,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cbecause watching something like that might convince Trump that there\u2019s a sizable portion of the population that wants to go back to work no matter the cost,\u201d which is not the case. According to a Pew Research poll released on 16 April, 66% of Americans are more concerned with restrictions being lifted too quickly than too slowly.</p> <p>To be clear, Oliver said, he understood where protesters were coming from \u2013 he, too, wants this over. \u201cBut for what it\u2019s worth, I know people who have died from this. I also know people who are taking hydroxychloroquine because they think it will give them immunity, and I know people with lupus who are down to their last few weeks of pills, and it makes me fucking furious.</p> <p>\u201cBecause the fact is, the fastest way for this to be over is for all of us to remain united in this very difficult task,\u201d Oliver concluded. \u201cBut the only way that happens is if we have trusted, well-informed leadership \u2013 which, unfortunately, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p>",

Our culture was already long in its grip \u2013 the coronavirus lockdown has only solidified its hold on us. Now very little new art or entertainment can be made. We can barely go outside. We can barely create new memories. Fear and anxiety stalk the land. Friends and family may already have fallen seriously ill. The economic outlook is bleak.</p> <p>But we have our sofas and our laptops, our televisions and our streaming services. When times are tough, the desire to escape to a place of perceived peace becomes ever harder to deny \u2013 the warm bath of nostalgia is ready and waiting. The country is giving up, slipping into it, dozing in those waters for hours on end before climbing out to put on a soft, enveloping robe, also made of nostalgia. The fear of missing out has morphed into the remembrance of things past.</p> <p>On Netflix, Friends<em> </em>has been doing a brisk trade in nostalgia for a while now. Rachel still has <em>that </em>haircut. Joey remains enamoured with sex and eating. Ross\u2019s love of dinosaurs and divorce (and Rachel) endures. The Office<em> </em>is one of the streaming site\u2019s most watched shows at the moment, now combining nostalgia for a time with nostalgia for a place (even if you once thought you hated it): the office, that thing you used to go to, before all this happened.</p> <p>With fortuitous timing, earlier this year Channel 4 put all of Seinfeld on its website, so you can watch the 90s\u2019 foremost show about nothing, in a world where you do nothing. The British broadcaster also has Frasier and Cheers<em> </em>at its disposal, with the latter\u2019s theme tune already a masterpiece in nostalgia, evoking a warm glow in millions of people who\u2019ve never set foot in the city of Boston, let alone a basement bar there. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and right now, that place is the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just a bit of fun \ud83d\ude02 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coys?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coys</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C2Vy3jHotM\">pic.twitter.com/C2Vy3jHotM</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Swannell (@Tswannell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>With no sport being played, classic games are replayed on television, radio, podcasts and even, somehow, in the form of live blogs.

Far happier, then, to return to seemingly more innocent times, with jumpers for goalposts and a vintage game crackling on the wireless.</p> <p>Much of this nostalgia exists and is driven by social media. With more of us in front of our screens and on our devices, but with nothing much in the way of new content to share, Instagram and Facebook draw us further back, with reminders of where we were and what we were doing in previous years.

In the US, Donald Trump has been harnessing the past for years, most notably with his \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan.

  "<p>Donald Trump has been accused of using another White House coronavirus task force briefing to broadcast a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise.</p> \n<p>The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo, whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat the federal government did, working with states ... was a phenomenal accomplishment,\u201d the governor said in the first clip. \u201cThese were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilisation, and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner, and I\u2019m the first to say it. We needed help and they were there.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the films were played just two days after Cuomo, who has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats during the crisis, eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. \u201cFirst of all, if he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cSecond, let\u2019s keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can because this is about the people and our job and let\u2019s try to focus on that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/bill-de-blasio-donald-trump-coronavirus-covid-19-budget\">New York mayor De Blasio asks if Trump is telling city to 'drop dead' over Covid-19</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cuomo acknowledged that Trump had moved quickly to increase hospital capacity, but said he was wrong to claim the city\u2019s Javits Center, a convention facility converted to a hospital, had not been used, pointing out that 800 people had gone through. The projected number of patients \u201cwere the president\u2019s projections\u201d, he added.</p> \n<p>Exasperated, Cuomo went on: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to help on testing. I said 11 times, I said the one issue we need help with is testing. He said 11 times: \u2018I don\u2019t want to get involved in testing, it\u2019s too complicated, it\u2019s too hard.\u2019 I know it\u2019s too complicated and too hard. That\u2019s why we need help. I can\u2019t do an international supply chain.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe wants to say: \u2018Well I did enough.\u2019 Yeah, none of us have done enough. We haven\u2019t, because it\u2019s not over ... We have a lot more to do and no one can do the posture of \u2018Just say thank you for what I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m now out, I\u2019m not doing anything else. I\u2019ve done my part.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The pair of New Yorkers exchanged barbs on Twitter but, at Sunday\u2019s briefing, Trump was only eager to bask in Cuomo\u2019s praise. After the first video was shown, he chided his staff: \u201cThey left out the good part. Good job, fellas ... You want to put the rest of it up, or do you not have it?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI just think it\u2019s so good for people because it\u2019s bipartisan. This is not about Democrats, Republicans. This is about a thing that hit our country, the likes of which has never happened to us before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The second clip was duly played later in the briefing. And earlier Trump had read aloud from a Wall Street Journal column praising him. A CNN reporter asked, with more than 22 million Americans unemployed and the death toll now above 40,000, \u201cis this really the time for self-congratulations?\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump retorted: \u201cYou\u2019re CNN, you\u2019re fake news ... You don\u2019t have the brains you were born with.\u201d</p> \n<p>Media reports suggest Trump is ready to transition from crisis mode to a new phase focused on economic recovery and his re-election.</p> \n<p>For his part, Cuomo issued two pointed tweets on Sunday evening. One said: \u201c\u2018Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\u2019 \u2014 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\u201d The other thanked health care, hospital and nursing home workers, and said: \u201cYou are heroes. #NewYorkTough.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s publicity stunt also drew direct criticism. Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, tweeted: \u201cBeyond being another taxpayer-funded campaign ad, this video clip also makes Trump look exceedingly weak. The video casts Cuomo as Trump\u2019s boss giving him a performance appraisal. (If only!).\u201d</p> \n<p>The president also sought to downplay the national testing shortage, despite governors\u2019 complaints that they lack sufficient capacity to safely reopen their economies. And he became visibly angry when questioned why he had still been holding campaign rallies in February rather than warning Americans about the virus.</p> \n<p>Challenged repeatedly by Weijia Jiang of CBS News, he demanded: \u201cWho are you with? ... nice and easy, nice and easy, just relax ... Keep your voice down, please. Keep your voice down.\u201d Touting his partial travel restrictions on China, he insisted: \u201cYou should say, \u2018Thank you very much for good judgment.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"692bb87d-6cd0-463a-8750-ab2075324a14\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5c3wWNsmLA0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Away from the virus, Trump was questioned on whether he would consider pardoning allies Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, who were caught in the justice department\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cThe top of the FBI was scum,\u201d he complained bitterly. \u201cThey\u2019re human scum.\u201d</p>",

No event in the coming days would generate a gathering to compare. The game would draw people from across the Puget Sound area, and maybe beyond.</p> \n   <p>In the end, the match went on. Two days after the public health department wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe are making a recommendation to postpone or cancel events greater than 10-50 people,\u201d officials in King County allowed a soccer match to be held with 33,000 fans, squeezed together.</p> \n   <p>How that happened is captured in hundreds of pages of emails exchanged among federal, state and local officials, as well as executives from the Sounders, Seahawks, Mariners and XFL Dragons. Those records, obtained by ProPublica and The Seattle Times, show how one meeting would beget another, one email would beget a dozen more, all while the virus was taking rapid hold.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The most recent count of Covid-19 cases in Washington totals 11,802 infections and 624 deaths, according to the state\u2019s Department of Health.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T21:27:42.288Z\">at 10.27pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9cb6f08f080ee110447e2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T20:44:23.460Z\">9.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In a letter <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2010025\">published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> as part of its ongoing Covid-19 Notes series, the chief executive of a Massachusetts hospital accuses the federal government of running an effective PPE blockade that\u2019s prevented the delivery of critical equipment to states in need. Emphasis ours:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. <strong>Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government.</strong> Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy.</p> \n   <p>A lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2013 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2013 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. <strong>I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.</strong></p> \n   <p>Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. <strong>But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE.</strong> Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9caef48f080ee110447e18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T20:11:37.245Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A number of US governors from both sides of the aisle, including Virginia Democrat Ralph Northam and Maryland Republican Larry Hogan, have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. </p> \n  <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe and Edward Helmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-governors-trump-making-delusional-comments\">report</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\">three-phrase programme</a> to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place.</p> \n   <p>Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">New York Times reported</a>.</p> \n   <p>Democratic Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not.

Some of the money went to <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/coronavirus-relief-ruth-chris-steak-house\">successful large companies</a>, while many small businesses received nothing.</p> \n  <p>Mnuchin concurs with Pelosi that a new funding deal is close, and tells Tapper it could be signed off by the middle of this week.
