  "<p>The US navy has dismissed the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, who had raised the alarm about an outbreak of coronavirus on his ship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-us-live-updates-news-unemployment-democratic-convention-trump-biden\">Coronavirus US live: Trump again tests negative for illness, White House says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thomas Modly, the acting secretary of the navy, said that Captain Brett Crozier had been relieved of his command of the nuclear-powered carrier because he had copied in too many people on an internal memo on Monday, in which he urgently appealed for members of his crew who had fallen ill to be allowed to disembark for medical care in Guam.</p> <p>By Thursday, 114 of the more than 4,000 crew had tested positive for Covid-19. Modly did not accuse Crozier of leaking the memo, but suggested he made it more likely that the letter would be leaked. He also accused Crozier of raising unnecessary alarm among the sailors\u2019 families, and exaggerating the threat to their lives.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,\u201d Crozier wrote in his four-page 30 March memo to senior officers, which was reported by the<a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Exclusive-Captain-of-aircraft-carrier-with-15167883.php\"> San Francisco Chronicle</a>. \u201cIf we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2013 our sailors.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to remove the commander showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d.</p> <p>In his letter, Crozier said it was impossible to achieve social distancing and quarantine conditions on board the Roosevelt, and therefore the majority of the sailors on board should be disembarked for quarantine and treatment.</p> <p>Briefing the press on his decision on Thursday, Modly said accused Crozier of \u201cnot being careful\u201d about who would receive his note.</p> <p>\u201cIt was copied to 20 or 30 other people. That\u2019s just not acceptable. He did not take care and what that did is it created a little bit of a panic on the ship,\u201d Modly said. He stressed that he was not accusing Crozier of leaking the memo himself.</p> <p>Modly said that the navy had already begun mobilizing resources to help the crew in response to Crozier\u2019s earlier requests for assistance.</p> <p>\u201cHe was fully aware of the navy\u2019s response, only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster,\u201d the acting secretary said. He pointed out that so far, none of the infected crew was so ill to need hospitalization, and contrasted that with Crozier\u2019s warning that sailors could die.</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows that to be true. It does not comport with the data we have right now on the ship,\u201d Modly said.</p> <p>He argued he was forced to act \u201cwhen I have a commanding officer who\u2019s responsible for a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, with all that lethality and all that responsibility, who exercises that poor judgment in a situation in a crisis like this.\u201d</p> <p>Modly and other officials had initially said that Crozier was right to air his concerns. On Thursday the acting secretary denied he had been under pressure from the White House to fire the commander.</p> <p>The Democratic leadership of the House armed services committee issued a statement saying that Crozier had not behaved \u201cappropriately\u201d but argued the dismissal was \u201can overreaction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet\u2019s readiness,\u201d the statement read.</p>",

Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we\u2019re not allowed to hug.

  "<p>For many years Michigan was divided evenly along party lines \u2013 a checkerboard of red and blue every election. Then, in 2011, Michigan\u2019s Republican party legally rigged the system. Charged with drawing new district lines, the lawmakers did so with unprecedented precision \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/gerrymandering-michigan-among-nations-worst-new-test-claims\">carving</a> unnatural boundaries to keep their favored voters and locales in hand \u2013 to guarantee a majority for their party.</p> <p>It worked perfectly. The process of creating these doctored maps, known as gerrymandering, resulted in widespread victories for the Republicans. The party controlled almost every level of government, from the state supreme court to municipal workers. And with tangible impact on Michigan\u2019s people: the <a href=\"https://psmag.com/magazine/among-the-gerrymandered\">Flint water crisis</a>, which killed 12 people, happened because party legislators appointed emergency managers whom voters opposed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/gerrymandering-michigan-citizens-voters-not-politicians\">Republicans tried to rig the vote in Michigan \u2013 but \u2018political novices\u2019 just defeated them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in 2016, a then 26-year-old with no political experience uprooted the system.</p> <p>Katie Fahey hates politics. She can\u2019t stand cable news punditry. She has little confidence in any of the 2020 presidential candidates. And she refuses to identify with a political party. But she dedicated two years of her life to launching and leading a grassroots campaign that started with a Facebook post and, against the odds, ended gerrymandering in Michigan.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the problem we have right now is everybody\u2019s looking for a savior, whether it\u2019s an individual politician or a political party,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cWe as a whole aren\u2019t working as hard to make sure that our voice is staying at the table and that we are watching what\u2019s being done.\u201d</p> <p>In hindsight, it\u2019s easy to see why thousands flocked to her passionate message in Michigan \u2013 and why film-makers found Fahey the perfect anchor for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/01/slay-the-dragon-film-gerrymandering\">gerrymandering documentary Slay the Dragon</a>, named for the oddly shaped district in Massachusetts created by the man who gerrymandering its name, former vice-president <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbridge_Gerry\">Elbridge Gerry</a>. The film arrives on demand on 3 April.</p> <p>But for Fahey, being a young woman and a political outsider meant she faced an uphill battle to reform the redistricting process every step of the way.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Fahey\u2019s political frustration reached a boiling point after the 2016 presidential election. She had flown from Michigan to New York in a red pantsuit on 8 November, expecting to celebrate the first female president at Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s watch party. Instead, she was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/238a424cb76c44cf93b4ef616dea5a26/clinton-casts-her-ballot-it-most-humbling-feeling\">left stunned</a> by Donald Trump\u2019s victory. And she dreaded spending Thanksgiving with her extended, politically divided family in their home town just outside Detroit.</p> <p>Born Katie Rogala, her family mostly steered clear of politics during her childhood in Livonia, Michigan, though her dad\u2019s veteran status meant patriotism surrounded them. Fahey considered herself an independent, and worked at a recycling coalition after college, doing improvisational comedy \u2013 even starting an improv festival from scratch. (She married her improv co-star Sean Fahey in 2013, but the pair recently divorced.)</p> <p>That year, eager to find a unifying topic to focus on over turkey and stuffing, Fahey turned her attention to gerrymandering. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about who we voted for because that was always leading back to literally people being like, \u2018You\u2019re evil for thinking that way,\u2019\u201d Fahey said. \u201cSo I thought, man, I wonder if systemic reform, getting back to one person, one vote would be something that appeals to everybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77bec749050bbee19f5591ec0f208e006fbb2d50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77bec749050bbee19f5591ec0f208e006fbb2d50/237_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Fahey in Slay the Dragon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Fahey in Slay the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Participant Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the practice of politicians redrawing district lines in their favor dates to the early 1800s in Massachusetts, recent technology has taken gerrymandering in America to the extreme. Now, following each decennial census count, it\u2019s legal for state politicians to hire mapmakers to use software that precisely manipulates bizarrely squiggled districts \u2013 resembling everything from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/\">a praying mantis</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/us/pennsylvania-gerrymander-goofy-district.html\">Goofy kicking Donald Duck</a> \u2013 to cram their opponents into a limited area or otherwise guarantee votes.</p> <p>Michigan is one of the most gerrymandered states in the US. Leaked emails have even revealed a Republican aide <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/michigan-gerrymandering.html\">boasted about packing \u201cDem garbage\u201d into select districts</a> during the 2011 GOP legislative redrawing.</p> <p>On 11 November 2016, Fahey posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/katie.rogala.3/posts/10153917724442633\">Facebook status</a>: \u201cI\u2019d like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan, if you\u2019re interested in doing this as well, please let me know :).\u201d Within hours, she\u2019d created a new Facebook group and soon, the non-partisan <a href=\"https://votersnotpoliticians.com/\">Voters Not Politicians</a> (VNP) was born. Fahey was the face of a movement. Well, almost.</p> <p>For the next few months, Fahey never met her supporters. They strategized and bonded online, something Fahey said helped build her confidence because \u201cit\u2019s easier to be vulnerable behind a screen\u201d. But by March 2017, she and her fellow volunteers were ready to hold meetings across the state asking residents how they would like to see a new redistricting system work.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody just thought that was absolutely absurd that you would talk to people before changing the constitution,\u201d she said of the skepticism her plan received from political insiders. \u201c[I thought] isn\u2019t this how democracy works?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s in those meetings that Fahey\u2019s improv experience came in handy. She had an ease onstage, and in front of crowds \u2013 rumors even circulated that she was a paid actor, a plant supplied by the Democrats and that her whole Facebook-origin story was an elaborate hoax. \u201cA lot of people were more skeptical and more dismissive of us being able to be the \u2018real deal\u2019 because of my age and gender,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people were more skeptical and more dismissive of us being able to be the \u2018real deal\u2019 because of my age and gender</p> <footer> <cite>Katie Fahey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Voters Not Politicians\u2019 final proposal emerged after 33 days: take the power out of the politicians\u2019 hands, starting with the 2021 redistricting, by creating a 13-person citizens\u2019 committee, composed of four Republicans, four Democrats and five unaffiliated people.</p> <p>But that was just the beginning. To get it on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment in the November 2018 midterm election, they would need 315,000 signatures in the next 180 days and, with limited funds and virtually no experience, they were starting at a huge disadvantage. \u201cNormally, before you\u2019d announce, you\u2019d have your constitutional language written and you would have raised millions of dollars,\u201d Fahey says. \u201cLiterally, we had just opened our bank account the day before because we couldn\u2019t figure out how.\u201d</p> <p>An undeterred and perpetually smiling Fahey led 4,000 volunteers, many of whom had also never been politically active, to contribute their skills, down to the woodcarver who helped make their clipboards. <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/movies/julie-hinds/2018/10/18/jennifer-lawrence-michigan-proposal-2-election-2016/1681511002/\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href=\"https://fox17online.com/2018/10/20/schwarzenegger-in-east-lansing-terminate-gerrymandering-with-prop-2/?fbclid=IwAR15809_D_cME9bBgidfdPVDfz1hmHBizbJEkeObGd3oL0AJ3X8bnD45cc0\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> chimed in with support. Even Republican voters and legislators were eager to sign and \u201cthe only people who would ever say no were usually people who were involved in the redistricting process before or somehow really, really involved in partisan politics\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWithout Katie, I believe, we would not have been successful,\u201d said Hal Gurian, a Republican from Traverse City who volunteered for the campaign. \u201cShe was a hands-on leader who worked diligently with as many volunteers as she had time to meet personally or talk with on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Defying predictions, Voters Not Politicians managed to get more than 425,000 signatures two months before the deadline. On election day, the proposal, Prop 2, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/gerrymandering-michigan-citizens-voters-not-politicians\">passed with a sweeping 61% </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/gerrymandering-michigan-citizens-voters-not-politicians\"> of the vote</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize their own power. A lot of people, especially women, in the campaign, were so reluctant to go into leadership positions,\u201d Fahey says, noting that after the campaign ended \u201cwe had, like, 17 people who ended up running for local office\u201d.</p> <p>Next year, Michigan\u2019s district lines will be redrawn by voters, not politicians for the first time.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Slay the Dragon will be released this week during a census year \u2013 when the US population will be carefully counted in order to determine the size of electoral districts next year.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that Fahey\u2019s hard-won movement is a threat to Republicans across the country during that process. Michigan\u2019s Republican party and activists continue to try and block the change with <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/judge-rejects-gop-bid-delay-michigan-redistricting-commission\">multiple lawsuits</a>, claiming it is unconstitutional and discriminatory.</p> <p>But Fahey is hoping the momentum from VNP can be replicated in the 35 other states that <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/State-by-state_redistricting_procedures\">still use congressional redistricting</a>. She self-identifies as a \u201cdemocracy entrepreneur\u201d. (That label worn by anyone else could seem insufferable, but on Fahey, who radiates an infectious earnestness, it works.) And she founded a national not-for-profit last year called <a href=\"https://thepeople.org/\">the People</a>, which hopes to create Katie 2.0s across the country by giving frustrated citizens the tools to tackle systemic issues they care about, such as the partisan primary process and election security.</p> <p>To be successful, those initiatives might need people like Katie at the forefront. \u201cShe is an inspiring, motivating and tireless leader,\u201d Gurian said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d be more excited about governing than I would about running or feeling like I have to follow the party line because that\u2019s just not me</p> <footer> <cite>Katie Fahey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the impact of her work can\u2019t be measured quite yet, the ripple effects are clear. In early March, the Democrat-majority Virginia senate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/virginia-legislature-redistricting.html\">voted to relinquish their power</a> in favor of a committee.

Though her platform started with a Facebook post, she has no public Instagram and a modest Twitter presence. Even the fact that she\u2019s the face of Slay the Dragon doesn\u2019t sit well with her. And don\u2019t expect her to run for office anytime soon. \u201cI\u2019d be more excited about governing than I would about running or feeling like I have to follow the party line because that\u2019s just not me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For now, she spends what little free time she has taking her dogs to the park or escaping from \u201creal-world problems\u201d with video games. Role-playing fantasies are her favorite, including, of course, Dragon Quest.</p> <p>\u201cI think what I like about them is \u2013 this is so dumb \u2013 you have these different characters who all play their role and even if there is a main character, your team is only stronger because everybody\u2019s bringing their strengths to the table,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThat is just so how I live my life.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to correct the city in Michigan where Fahey grew up.</p></li> </ul>",

In a prediction that contradicted his previous claim that the disease would be beaten within a fortnight, he warned the disease may survive for months or even a further year.</p>",

The impact Covid-19 is having on the service-led economy is devastating, with estimates of GDP contraction in Q2 as high as 34%. What\u2019s more, the unemployment figures are inevitably going to rise, as local labour offices process the backlog following a surge of new claims. The private nonfarm payrolls for March are expected to shrink for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>\u201cTo soften the impact, fiscal and monetary levers will need to be used in tandem, and speed is of the essence. The $2.2 trillion rescue package will help, but huge numbers of small and mid-size businesses will be looking to the treasury for further support. Similarly, consumers will benefit from the helicopter payments but are lacking the income support that we\u2019ve seen in the UK. Further questions arise over Federal independence; constitutional authority for public-health interventions lie primarily with the states, but any social or economic response needs to be co-ordinated or they risk failing.</p> <p>Now more than ever the Fed needs to be ready to take drastic measures in response to the data.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e85dee48f0866297e9f5aa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T12:49:06.522Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some snap reaction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1245690214070263808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.6M jobless claims.

  "<p>Green campaigners and climate leaders have vowed to keep up the pressure on governments around the world to make stringent new commitments on the climate crisis, as a vital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">UN climate summit</a> was delayed until next year because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The Cop26 talks were scheduled to take place this November in Glasgow, but the UK hosts won a delay on Wednesday night from the UN and other nations, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/02/vital-cop26-climate-talks-could-be-derailed-by-coronavirus\">weeks of speculation</a> the talks would be cancelled.</p> <p>Moving the 26th conference of the parties to an as yet unspecified new date next year gives countries time to work out their responses to the Covid-19 emergency, which experts hope will include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">commitments on shifting to a low-carbon economy</a> rather than propping up the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an opportunity in the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis to create a new approach to [economic] growth that is a sustainable and resilient economy in closer harmony with the natural world,\u201d said Nicholas Stern, one of the world\u2019s leading climate economists. \u201cThat will be the challenge and opportunity of Cop26 next year. We must use this time well.\u201d</p> <p>Current commitments under the Paris agreement are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">insufficient to meet its aims</a> of holding the world to no more than 2C \u2013 and preferably no more than 1.5C \u2013 of heating, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. The UK, as host of the Cop26 talks, is still aiming for all countries to come forward with fresh targets on their greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The EU pledged it would sustain its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/eu-aims-to-stir-global-action-with-pledge-on-climate-crisis\">push for a bloc-wide \u201cgreen deal\u201d</a> that would involve stiffer cuts in emissions and a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said: \u201cWe will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious Cop26.\u201d</p> <p>A clear benefit of moving the talks is that their original start date of 9 November was days after the US presidential election. That timing posed problems for negotiators, because Donald Trump has begun the process of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">withdrawing the US from the Paris accord</a>, a decision that will take legal effect on 4 November.</p> <p>Some observers are hoping that a new president could change the course of the world\u2019s most powerful economy and second biggest emitter. \u201cAmerican voters are increasingly likely to reject Trump\u2019s science denial on both coronavirus and climate change and instead elect Joe Biden president,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. \u201cDelaying Cop26 until 2021 means that Biden might have the chance to re-establish US climate leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not there is a change of administration, the delay has an advantage for countries negotiating with the US, said Nathaniel Keohane, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the original schedule, the Cop was going to be overshadowed by the US elections regardless of the outcome,\u201d explained Keohane. \u201cThe shift in schedule will allow countries to react and respond. If a Democrat wins in November, then by the time of the Cop, the US will have re-entered Paris and will be able to send a high-level political delegation, giving an important and positive boost to the talks. And if Trump is re-elected, other countries will have had time to absorb that information by the time of the Cop and know definitively that they have to move on without the US.\u201d</p> <p>This will be the first year in nearly three decades of annual climate negotiations under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that no talks are held.</p> <p>However, given the scale of the coronavirus crisis, by the end of a nearly four-hour meeting on Wednesday it was clear a decision had to be made quickly. Questions were raised over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/cop26-boris-johnson-urged-resist-calls-postpone-climate-talks-coronavirus\">potential problems with a postponement</a>, in delaying vital work by countries on their emissions plans, but none of the parties objected to the final decision.</p> <p>It may take months for a new date for Cop26 to be decided, with hopes that it could take place in early spring at the soonest. The UK is still committed to holding the summit in Glasgow, and is working with the Scottish government on logistics, and with its scientific advisers on when might be safe to hold a summit in which it is hoped civil society and activists will play a key role.</p> <p>For now, the immediate goal of green campaigners is to ensure that recovery plans from the coronavirus crisis do not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">entrench investment in high emissions</a>. There is a danger that some countries are using the pandemic to roll back environmental protections and commitments \u2013 in the US, for instance, the Trump administration has revoked clean car standards and in the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/carmakers-accused-of-using-covid-19-weaken-environmental-laws\">carmakers have lobbied for a watering down</a> of their emissions obligations.</p> <p>\u201cCop26 being put on hold should make governments double down on their efforts to ensure a green and just way forward in handling this health crisis and the climate emergency,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. \u201cGoing back to business as usual is completely unacceptable: this pandemic shows there are huge lessons to be learned about the importance of listening to science and the need for urgent collective global action.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Even before the pandemic there were postponements. Before that, there were protests. From a large armchair positioned beneath his own portrait, the 82-year-old president of Guinea is not answering the key question preoccupying his country whether or not he wants to remain in situ until he is 94.</p> <p>In the Sekhoutoureah presidential palace in Conakry, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and trousers, Alpha Cond\u00e9 is flanked on one side by a large photograph of himself alongside Barack Obama in the White House. On the other, framed photographs on a table show him shaking hands with the Turkish leader, Recep Erdo\u011fan, and with China\u2019s Xi Jinping. There\u2019s also a golden bust of Chairman Mao and a hefty book about the Beninese politician Robert Dossou.</p> <p>On 22 March, Guinea <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-guinea-election/guinea-referendum-backs-constitutional-changes-that-may-extend-presidents-rule-idUKKBN21E387?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews\">voted in a referendum</a> on allowing Cond\u00e9 to change the constitution. The electoral commission said almost 92% voted in favour of the changes. At least 42 people died in violent protests that preceded the vote.</p> <p>The new constitution will enshrine gender parity and wealth distribution in law, ban child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), and provide a \u201cspecific fund\u201d for young people, women and people with disabilities, Cond\u00e9 says.

But with two days to go it was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51689308\">unexpectedly postponed</a>. \u201cGuinea, homeland of pan-Africanism, cannot isolate itself from its fellow countries,\u201d the president told the nation in a sober television address.</p> <p>The vote finally went ahead on 22 March, but has been mired in controversy. The opposition, who reject the result, have boycotted the electoral register and removed 37 deputies from legislative elections that took place on the same day.

Will he now run for president again? And how could Cond\u00e9 \u2013 a former law professor at the Sorbonne who was opposition leader for more than four decades who was exiled and imprisoned by dictators, and welcomed as a champion of change by international leaders \u2013 consider undermining the still fragile system of democracy that he helped implement?</p> <p>Before Cond\u00e9\u2019s arrival, Guinea had a history of leaders outstaying their welcome. Sekou Tour\u00e9 ruled a one-party state modelled on Maoist China from independence in 1958 till he died in office in 1984. His successor, Lansana Cont\u00e9, was just as tenacious, hanging on, with increasing senility, until 2008. Moussa Dadis Camara, a military captain, then ruled for barely a year, orchestrating elaborate show trials on television before he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/16/guinea-aide-shoot-camara\">shot in the head</a> by an exasperated bodyguard in 2009.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 seemed like an improvement. Once condemned to death by Tour\u00e9 and imprisoned for two and a half years by Cont\u00e9, he was elected with 52.52% of the vote and re-elected in 2015 with almost 58%. But many Guineans are not so much against him as against a third mandate.</p> <p>Guinea is a country of great natural resources. The coastal area is lush with mangroves and fertile farmland for pineapples, mangoes, rice and potatoes. Inland there are generous deposits of iron ore and Guinea is the biggest exporter of bauxite to China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d6617cfb1884e4895189da4d4e4010091b9b62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d6617cfb1884e4895189da4d4e4010091b9b62/0_184_5520_3312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A broken ballot box on the ground outside a polling station in Conakry on the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A broken ballot box on the ground outside a polling station in Conakry on the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cellou Binani/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But poverty levels are extremely high. Even in the capital, Conakry, the electricity supply is capricious, with frequent power outages. Sometimes there is running water; more often, a trip to the local well. Less than two-thirds of the population can read, and the average income is less than $900 (\u00a3727) a year. Guinea also has one of the highest rates of economic migration in Africa. Young people are often unemployed, while 90% of women undergo FGM in some form.</p> <p>On assuming power, Cond\u00e9 famously remarked that he had inherited a country, not a state. Now he defends his record with reminders of the situation in 2010. \u201cWhen I arrived, Guinea was on its knees. Completely on its knees,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had never completed a programme with the IMF. They called us the \u2018basket case\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Reforms included an overhaul of the army. There was an attempted coup in 2011. Then there was Ebola. The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/\">first case identified </a>was in Guinea in 2013. Three years later, and after more than 2,500 deaths, Guinea was declared Ebola-free.</p> <p>\u201cI did not have the time to draw up a new constitution,\u201d says Cond\u00e9.</p> <p>Under his rule, Guinea has seen undeniable improvements. In 2016 and 2017 the mining industry grew by 50%. The 240- megawatt Kaleta hydroelectric facility should provide Conakry\u2019s residents with stable power. The 450-megawatt Souapiti dam is due to open next year and could provide the energy required for factories.</p> <p>Refining bauxite into aluminium rather than simply exporting the raw material would add far more to the state\u2019s coffers and in theory trickle down to the population: <a href=\"https://www.anafic-gn.org/#\">Anafic</a>, one of the president\u2019s landmark policies, implemented last year, guarantees that 15% of mining revenues will go towards local infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0212a034c824f0d18dbbb5432fa6c233c5fa14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0212a034c824f0d18dbbb5432fa6c233c5fa14b/0_900_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alpha Cond\u00e9 pictured at the People\u2019s Hall in Conakry in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alpha Cond\u00e9 pictured at the People\u2019s Hall in Conakry in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked if his time in power has changed him, Cond\u00e9 says circumstances remain the same as when he was in opposition. \u201cSince my youth I have wanted to serve my country, and serve Africa,\u201d says the president, who believes he doesn\u2019t get the recognition he deserves. \u201cPeople in Guinea have a short memory.\u201d</p> <p>Since October more than 40 people have died in protests organised by the Front National pour la D\u00e9fense de la Constitution (FNDC), an organisation consisting of civil society, politicians and activists. These have mainly taken place in the district of Ratoma in Conakry, the fiefdom of Cellou Dalein Diallo, one of Conde\u2019s main political rivals. Many of the inhabitants are Peuhl, an ethnic group related to the Fulani. On the day of the vote, 10 people died according to the FNDC (the government <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2020/03/31/des-milliers-de-guineens-sont-alles-voter-on-ne-les-a-pas-forces_6035037_3212.html\">says it was six</a>).</p> <p>\u201cInvestigations are happening,\u201d says Cond\u00e9. He blames tensions on the opposition: \u201cWhen one doesn\u2019t have a credible political programme, one can lower oneself to the subjective: race or ethnicity.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the tears in the social fabric can be repaired. \u201cIt will disappear with the next generation. The more young people have work, the less they will be manipulated.\u201d</p> <p>Four decades in opposition gave Cond\u00e9 time to nurture a grandiose vision for his legacy. \u201cMy mission is to make Guinea one of the most developed countries in Africa. I want the person who comes after me to no longer have to resolve the problems of electricity, nor the problem of water, nor the problem of roads,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In elections in Guinea, when you put in \u2018yes\u2019, it comes out \u2018no\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Restaurant owner, Conakry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe countries that develop the fastest \u2013 how long have their leaders been in power?

They confirmed the OIF\u2019s findings that approximately 2.5 million votes are in doubt, cast by people who are either dead, too young or have been counted twice. The coronavirus pandemic meant elections went ahead on 22 Marchwithout international observers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the voters have been removed,\u201d says Dram\u00e9. \u201cThere is no guarantee that the recommendations of Ecowas have been respected.\u201d</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 believes the ballot box is the best way to solve the impasse. Should he stand again for president, his main rivals will likewise be familiar faces. Diallo, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea party, and Sidya Tour\u00e9, head of the Union of Republican Forces, were prime ministers under Lansana Cont\u00e9. They do not symbolise a fresh start. \u201cThey aren\u2019t a new generation of politicians but former civil servants,\u201d says Cond\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019ve won elections; none of them have.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cond\u00e9 announced a curfew because of coronavirus. So far, the number of cases in Guinea remains low, with fewer than 40 cases.</p> <p>As the president talks of infrastructure, there is little mention of leaving Guinea with the democratic infrastructure that term limits established.</p> <p>Forty years fighting in opposition do not seem to have trained Cond\u00e9 in the art of letting go.

On Wednesday Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said the White House was \u201cjust not [in] the position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China.\u201d.</p> <p>Deborah Birx, a member of Trump\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, said on Tuesday that the US medical community saw the outbreak as \u201cserious but smaller than anyone expected because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data\u201d.</p> <p>Republican lawmakers this week called for an investigation into a possible cover-up by China, as well as the disappearance of three citizen journalists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/dissent-becomes-another-victim-of-coronavirus-as-china-cracks-down\">Fang Bin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-journalist-missing-in-wuhan-as-anger-towards-chinese-authorities-grows\">Chen Qiushi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/li-zehuajournalist-wouldnt-stay-quiet-covid-19-coronavirus\">Li Zehua</a>, who went missing after reporting from Wuhan.</p> <p>Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, said in a statement: \u201cThey lied to the world about the human-to-human transmission of the virus, silenced doctors and journalists who tried to report the truth, and are now apparently hiding the accurate number of people impacted by this disease.\u201d</p> <p>The Nebraska senator Ben Sasse described Beijing\u2019s reporting as \u201cgarbage propaganda\u201d, adding in a statement: \u201cWithout commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist party has lied, is lying and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday the official People\u2019s Daily published an editorial on its front page accusing the US of blaming outsiders and encouraging xenophobia while \u201cshirking responsibility\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn the history of the United States, public health crises have often been accompanied by the stigmatisation of certain ethnic groups and countries,\u201d the article said. \u201cFighting together is the only option now \u2026 The US and China have a lot to learn from each other.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Security for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, the 79-year-old infectious disease expert who has become a calm, reassuring foil to Donald Trump at coronavirus briefings, has been expanded, according to multiple reports.</p> <p>While Fauci\u2019s straight talk and willingness to gently correct the president\u2019s outrageous exaggerations have drawn admiration from late-night <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3jiM2FNR8\">talkshow hosts</a>, professional <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/video/2020/03/27/20200327-gametime-curry/fauci\">basketball players</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-new-york-dr-anthony-fauci\">doughnut shop owners</a> alike, the doctor has received threats and unwelcome communications from both critics and fervent admirers. The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anthony-faucis-security-is-stepped-up-as-doctor-and-face-of-us-coronavirus-response-receives-threats/2020/04/01/ff861a16-744d-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_faucithreats-815pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans&amp;itid=hp_hp-banner-main_faucithreats-815pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans\">first reported</a> the news.</p> <p>At a coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House on Wednesday, Fauci declined to comment on whether he was receiving security protection, deferring to the health department\u2019s inspector general.</p> <p>Trump interjected, saying that Fauci \u201cdoesn\u2019t need security, everybody loves him\u201d. If anyone were to attack Fauci, Trump added, \u201cthey\u2019d be in big trouble\u201d, touting the disease expert\u2019s high school athletic career.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a great basketball player, did anybody know that?\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was a little on the short side for the NBA but he was talented.\u201d As basketball captain at Regis high school in 1958, Fauci had helped lead the team to an unlikely victory.</p> <p>Asked to comment on any increase in Fauci\u2019s security detail, Tesia Williams, a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokeswoman, said: \u201cFor more than two decades, the office of inspector general has provided professional protective services for the HHS secretary and, as needed, to departmental leadership. In each case, OIG assesses and recommends the appropriate level of protection. I cannot confirm, at this time, that we are providing such services for Dr Fauci.\u201d</p> <p>The immunologist has become an unlikely celebrity, representing the US scientific community facing off against the coronavirus pandemic. The NBA star Stephen Curry has called him \u201cthe Goat\u201d \u2013 greatest of all time. Fans have plastered his likeness on cupcakes, doughnuts, socks and prayer candles.</p> <p>But Fauci has also become a public target for rightwing pundits and bloggers who believe he is undermining the president. An article in the rightwing outlet American Thinker called Fauci a \u201cDeep-State \u00adHillary Clinton-loving stooge\u201d, and referred to a seven-year-old email in which he praised Clinton for her stamina through the Benghazi hearings. Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, a conservative group; and Bill Mitchell, host of the far-right online talkshow YourVoice America, have also reinforced Fauci criticisms and conspiracy theories.</p>",

But on Wednesday, DeSantis, who previously dismissed passengers as \u201cforeigners\u201d, has now offered National Guard support after speaking with the US president.

They\u2019re going to bring them back home. The same thing with the UK. But we have to help the people. They are in big trouble no matter where they are from.

Around 10 guests will require immediate critical care once at shore and 45 guests with mild illness will be required to stay on board until they have recovered with the crew.</p> <p>Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis, who also initially opposed the docking, said he had a long phone meeting with Holland America President Orlando Ashford. While Trantalis had earlier feared that people from the ship would add to the burden his city was already facing from Covid-19, he later said he was satisfied with the company\u2019s new plan for safely disembarking people from the ship.</p> <p>\u201cTheir tone has completely changed to address the concerns we had,\u201d Trantalis told the Guardian. \u201cI was concerned that they were just going to let these people off to mingle with the people of my city. That would have been a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut based on the conversation I had with the (Holland America) president, we are much further along in resolving this situation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/florida-governor-ron-desantis-cruise-ship-coronavirus-zaandam\">Florida governor: sick passengers on cruise ship cannot be 'dumped' here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday, the Guardian was contacted by the families of two of the four people that had died on the ship.

She said his death appeared to be unrelated to the coronavirus. He suffered a heart attack in the cabin he shared with his wife while they were quarantine in their room on 26 March.</p> <p>\u201cHe got up in the morning to go to the bathroom and fell on the floor,\u201d said Pliske, who said both her aunt and uncle were healthy and had no symptoms. \u201cThe ship sent their CPR team and worked on him, but he was gone.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the rejections the ship has faced at port after port have made things much harder for her aunt, she said.</p> <p>\u201cImagine that the person who you\u2019ve been married to and had children with, dies in front of you and you have to sit in the same room all day for days. It\u2019s really hard.

  "<p>Donald Trump has admitted the US government\u2019s emergency stockpile of protective equipment is nearly exhausted because of the extraordinary demands of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>The shortage was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-protective-gear-stockpile-depleted/2020/04/01/44d6592a-741f-11ea-ae50-7148009252e3_story.html\">Washington Post</a>, which said the supply of respirator masks, gloves and other medical supplies was running low.</p> \n<p>Trump, who has been criticised for a lack of central planning, confirmed on Wednesday: \u201cIt is, because we\u2019re sending it directly to hospitals. We don\u2019t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it, after it arrives, and bring it to various states and hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president had urged states to \u201cmake a deal\u201d and buy personal protective equipment (PPE) directly from manufacturers, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked states where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump continued: \u201cWe\u2019re shipping things right in. We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators which we need for flexibility. It\u2019s sounds like a lot but it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> \n<p>The national guard had been authorised to move equipment into hospitals when necessary, he added.</p> \n<p>Citing officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Post reported that the depletion of the national stockpile left the White House and states competing for PPE in a \u201cfreewheeling global marketplace rife with profiteering and price-gouging\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had shipped or delivered 11.6m N95 respirators, 26m surgical masks, 5.2m face shields, 4.3m surgical gowns, 22m gloves, and 8,100 ventilators, the White House said on 28 March.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-ventilators\">New York's Andrew Cuomo decries 'eBay'-style bidding war for ventilators</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, has complained that Fema contributes to a bidding war between states for ventilators, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-ventilators\">likening the situation to eBay</a>.

We must not let that happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Esper added: \u201cThe Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro and his criminal control over the country, and drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness.\u201d</p> \n<p>The link to the coronavirus seemed tenuous at best. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told reporters: \u201cWe came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels as a result of Covid-19 were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs we know, 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs. That\u2019s unacceptable. We\u2019re at war with Covid-19, we\u2019re at war with terrorists, and we are at war with the drug cartels, as well. This is the United States military. You will not penetrate this country. You will not get past Jump Street. You are not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president was asked about reports that China had undercounted its coronavirus cases. He said: \u201cTheir numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side, and I\u2019m being nice when I say that \u2026 As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I\u2019m not an accountant from China.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-coronavirus-outbreak-donald-trump-media-latest\">\u2018That's a nasty, snarky question\u2019: Trump\u2019s media assault rages on in midst of coronavirus crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some viewers dismissed the Venezuela announcement as another Trump stunt. Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cTurning this off now. This is just completely ridiculous and dishonest.

The president against defended his preparations for the pandemic and denied he was at fault for a slow start in testing, claiming he \u201cinherited a very broken system\u201d. He praised healthcare workers as \u201cwarriors\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump predicted a fast recovery for the economy once the virus had passed and expressed hope that Congress\u2019s next emergency relief bill will including spending on infrastructure.</p> \n<p>And the president, who had sought on Tuesday to prepare the nation for unfathomable loss of life, nevertheless could not resist some levity. He said of Fauci: \u201cHe was a great basketball player,\u201d and mused: \u201cI have hundreds of millions of people. Number one on Facebook \u2026 Did you know? I just found out.\u201d When a Fox News reporter asked him a tough question, the president snapped: \u201cWhat are you, working for CNN?\u201d</p>",

He insisted these powers were time-limited but justified. </p> \n  <p>Russell said the extension to 60 days had been accepted by Daren Fitzhenry, the Scottish information commissioner, because of the exceptional impact the crisis was having on public bodies, many of whom had sent all their staff home, making it very hard to search files or collate responses.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84d6358f0866297e9f537c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T17:59:27.964Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, health workers are making improvised masks out of snorkels, buying kit from hardware stores and using school science goggles to protect themselves in anticipation of a rise in coronavirus cases, it has emerged.</p> \n  <p>An NHS consultant anaesthetist working in south-east England reported buying 60 snorkels to adapt into respirator masks. \u201cVarious other places are doing the same,\u201d the doctor told the Guardian. \u201cOne trust has ordered 500 and teamed up with companies who are (3D) printing the adapters.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ciAtVg-JS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

At the end of the war in Spain he crossed the border into France where he was briefly interned before travelling to north Africa where he joined La Nueve.</p> \n  <p>La Nueve, the 9th Regiment de Marche du Tchad, part of the 2nd Armoured Division (Division Leclerc), was overwhelmingly made up of Spanish republican fighters who were among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/picasso-exhibition-franco-spanish-civil-war\">500,000 Spaniards who fled across the border into France in 1939</a> as Franco\u2019s forces closed in on victory. One hundred and forty-six of the company\u2019s 160 men were Spanish and, despite serving in the French army, they were permitted to stitch the red-yellow-and-purple flag of Spain\u2019s second republic on to their uniforms. They were also allowed to paint the flag on their vehicles, which rolled into Paris emblazoned with names such as Guernica and Don Quichotte (Don Quixote). Spanish was the common language within the company. All had fought during the liberation of French north Africa. </p> \n  <p>The company, also known as La Espa\u00f1ola because of the number of Spanish soldiers, was the first to enter Paris on 24 August 1944. While awaiting the surrender of the German governor of occupied Paris, La Nueve troops were sent to occupy public buildings and those taken over by the German military command as well as Place de la Concorde. </p> \n  <p>Allied troops led by GenCharles de Gaulle entered Paris the following day. More than 50 members of La Nueve received the Croix de Guerre for bravery.</p> \n  <p>La Nueve\u2019s contribution to the liberation of Paris has only recently been recognised.
