  "<p>Mark Zuckerberg is standing by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us\">decision</a> to allow Donald Trump to threaten violence against George Floyd protesters on the platform despite harsh criticism from civil rights leaders and public dissent from his own employees, including a public resignation.</p> <p>In a video conference with staff on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said that his decision to not remove Trump\u2019s warning on social media on Friday that \u201cwhen the looting starts the shooting start\u201d was \u201ctough\u201d but \u201cpretty thorough\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/technology/zuckerberg-defends-facebook-trump-posts.html?smid=tw-share\">New York Times</a> reported.

Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1266272863222292480\">deemed</a> a tweet with the same language dangerous and chose to hide it behind a warning label \u201cin the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts\u201d. But though Zuckerberg acknowledged the statement\u2019s racist historical antecedent, he said that the company has a policy of allowing state actors to warn the public about the use of force.</p> <p>This reasoning has garnered scorn from US civil rights leaders, three of whom spoke with Zuckerberg and his top lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg on Monday evening. \u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robinson \u2013 heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Color of Change \u2013 in a joint statement.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters,\u201d the added. \u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg has also faced continued public criticism from employees \u2013 a highly unusual occurrence for the company.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,\u201d the engineer Brandon Dail <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aweary/status/1267561154349371392\">tweeted</a> on Tuesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8142b3453d8a27c816bfaed7c6d8cfd760eb97cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8142b3453d8a27c816bfaed7c6d8cfd760eb97cb/0_4_386_636/303.jpg\" alt=\"A Facebook ad by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign running amid widespread civil unrest.\" width=\"303\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Facebook ad by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign running amid widespread civil unrest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Timothy J Aveni, a Facebook software engineer,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>announced his resignation on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/posts/3006224359465567\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timothy-j-aveni_blacklivesmatter-activity-6673316720993824768-q_dU\">LinkedIn</a>.<br><br>\u201cMark always told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that this was a lie.\u201d<br><br>Aveni connected Facebook\u2019s accommodation of Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric to the company\u2019s track record in Asia, where Facebook has been implicated in ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, mob violence in Sri Lanka and the rise of a demagogue in the Philippines. <br><br>\u201cFacebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is providing a platform that enables politicians to radicalize individuals and glorify violence, and we are watching the United States succumb to the same kind of social media-fueled division that has gotten people killed in the Philippines, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. I\u2019m scared for my country and I\u2019m done trying to justify this.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook has been central to Trump\u2019s political rise. While Trump himself prefers to use Twitter to fire off his thoughts, his brand of divisive, xenophobic and emotive rhetoric has proved extraordinarily successful on Facebook\u2019s algorithmic timelines.</p> <p>In an internal <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-andrew-bosworth-memo.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\">memo</a> leaked to the New York Times in January, the longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth wrote: \u201cSo was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn\u2019t get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I\u2019ve ever seen from any advertiser. Period.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, among the thousands of Facebook ads being run by Trump\u2019s re-election campaign were dozens that referred to \u201cthe chaos going on around the world\u201d.

A Bible was procured for Trump from inside the church for him to hold aloft. Journalists asked if it was his Bible. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bible,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>The rate of fresh affronts has often outpaced the capacity to digest \u2013 or even describe \u2013 them.&nbsp;Peaceful protesters, journalists, a young African American man pleading for mutual understanding, shop owners, residents are being targeted for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/police-criticized-heavy-handed-response-peaceful-protests-across-us\">arbitrary arrest or police beatings</a> or both \u2013 especially if they are black.</p> <p>Overnight the very language of governance has changed.

Simply trying to take stock is exhausting.</p> <p>One reason it is so hard to keep track of the descent is the near instant normalisation of every bizarre new turn, administered like a fast-acting anaesthetic. Trump is surrounded by more coherent people insisting nothing out of the ordinary is happening. Anyone unable to restrain themselves from yelling \u201cthis is crazy\u201d left the administration some time ago.&nbsp;In William Barr, Trump has an attorney general ready to draft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-violence-overnight-donald-trump-threat-army-live-updates?page=with:block-5ed696f78f087122eca54510#block-5ed696f78f087122eca54510\">executive orders</a> at will, together with legal-sounding justifications.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a47234a615b759ea6273f081d488b3e931bc6ae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a47234a615b759ea6273f081d488b3e931bc6ae5/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds up a Bible during a photo opportunity in front of St John\u2019s Episcopal church on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump holds up a Bible during a photo opportunity in front of St John\u2019s Episcopal church on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the gang of officials walking behind Trump for his Bible photo op was the defence secretary, Mark Esper, and the country\u2019s top general, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, wearing combat fatigues.&nbsp;Their presence on Lafayette Square, walking amid the detritus left by fleeing protesters, stepped over the line that is supposed to separate the US military from domestic politics and added ballast to Trump\u2019s imagery of a righteous war against a pernicious enemy within.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Pentagon later said the two men had no idea where they were being led when they fell in line behind the president in the grounds of the White House, and had no clue about the means used to clear Lafayette Square before their arrival. But the washing of hands was performed by an unnamed defence official. Neither Esper nor Milley renounced their actions on camera.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not just the public officials. The constitutional constraints have also shown themselves more elastic than previously thought. Congress can demand to see officials and documents it needs to perform its duty of oversight but the administration now feels empowered to ignore such calls whenever it wants and suffer no consequences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-can-trump-deploy-federal-troops-onto-the-streets-in-the-us\">George Floyd protests: can Trump deploy federal troops on to the streets in the US?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 1807 Insurrection Act, which Trump is dangling over the nation, seems amorphous enough to allow the president to deploy the armed forces against the wishes of the states, if he deems circumstances to have made it \u201cimpracticable to enforce\u201d the law.</p> <p>Fear is easing the way for each new step towards militarisation. The looting and destruction on the fringes of the protests are terrifying, but partly a consequence of law enforcement tactics. The police have focused on dispersing the protests rather on arresting the looters.&nbsp;And it is the violence that plays on a loop on the news.&nbsp;</p> <p>The other reason it is so hard to keep track of the downward slide is the daily farce of the Donald Trump show. On Tuesday, at a Catholic shrine (day two of a brief detour into Christianity), it was the president telling his wife out of the side of his mouth to smile and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1267848296481128448\">her half-hearted attempt to obey</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The day before, it was the long amble from the White House to St John\u2019s, with the president walking 20 yards in front of his cabinet and relatives \u2013 with his odd straight-armed, chest-out gait and his trousers, a couple of inches short, flapping around his ankles \u2013 past the \u201cFuck Trump\u201d graffiti on the public toilets.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">A photo op as protests swirled: how Trump came to walk to the church</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then, on reaching the church, holding the Bible at various angles, including upside down, like an unfamiliar device pulled at random from a toolbox, which it was. He had once claimed it was his favourite book but when asked which was his favourite verse, he became flustered and dodged, insisting \u201cthe whole Bible is incredible\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the lessons of history is beware the buffoon, but when every day is so bizarre and distracting those lessons are hard to remember.

  "<p>Civil rights leaders have criticised Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to take no action against a Facebook post from Donald Trump appearing to threaten to start shooting \u201clooters\u201d, after a Monday night meeting with the company\u2019s executives ended in acrimony.</p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,\u201d Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robison said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters.</p> <p>\u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>The three activist leaders \u2013 the heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Color of Change \u2013 met Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, on Monday night. They discussed Trump\u2019s Thursday night post, which urged the military to intervene in Minneapolis with the words \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The message, originally sent by Trump as a tweet before being cross-posted to Facebook, was restricted on Twitter after the platform decided it broke rules about glorifying violence. On Facebook, Zuckerberg&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personally intervened to leave the message up</a>, arguing that the company has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s decision led to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump\">virtual walkout</a>\u201c of Facebook staff on Monday, with hundreds of employees downing tools in protest. A number of Facebook employees publicly expressed their dissent on rival social networks such as Twitter, and were quickly supported by senior managers at the company.</p> <p>At least one employee has quit over the decision. Timothy J Aveni, a software engineer who worked on misinformation, said on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/posts/3006224359465567\">Facebook</a> that he had resigned on Monday. \u201cMark told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that was a lie ... Facebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history.\u201d</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe recognise the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.\u201d </p> <p>The company would not require walkout participants to take paid time off, Facebook said.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday night, fresh detail about those internal discussions emerged, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/1/21276969/facebook-walkout-mark-zuckerberg-audio-trump-disgust-twitter\">the Verge obtained recordings</a>&nbsp;of Zuckerberg speaking at an internal meeting on Friday night.</p> <p>\u201cHow to handle this post from the president has been very tough,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve been struggling with basically all day, ever since I woke up \u2026 This has been personally pretty wrenching for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy first reaction [to Trump\u2019s post] was just disgust,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time. This is a moment that calls for unity and calmness and empathy for people who are struggling.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg also told employees Facebook would review the policies that allowed Trump\u2019s post to stay up. \u201cThere is a real question coming out of this, which is whether we want to evolve our policy around the discussion of state use of force. Over the coming days, as the National Guard is now deployed, probably the largest one that I would worry about would be excessive use of police or military force. I think there\u2019s a good argument that there should be more bounds around the discussion around that.\u201d</p> <p>The Facebook walkout was followed by sanctioned events at other technology companies. A number of YouTube executives, including the company\u2019s chief business officer and its global head of music, told their teams they could take Tuesday off to participate in the protests,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">the Information</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-06-01/spotify-stands-with-the-black-community-in-the-fight-against-racism-and-injustice/\">Spotify followed suit</a>, encouraging employees to join the day of action \u201cby taking time to reflect and educate themselves\u201d.</p> <p>The decision on whether to allow Trump\u2019s posts to remain on Facebook could be one of the final major calls made solely by Zuckerberg. The company recently confirmed the creation of an independent Oversight Board of academics, politicians and former journalists from around the world who will act as as a \u201csupreme court\u201d deciding what content should be allowed on Facebook, while providing guidance on policy.</p> <p>Members of the Oversight Board met on Tuesday afternoon and discussed the issue but the organisation is reluctant to start wading in to debates before it is up-and-running. It is due to be fully functional by the autumn - towards the end of the current US presidential election campaign.</p> <p>Members declined to give any detail what was discussed on&nbsp;Tuesday, although a spokesperson for the Oversight Board suggested Trump\u2019s posts are the sort of issue they will rule on in the future: \u201cThere are many significant issues relating to online content that we recognise people want the board to consider. We\u2019re working hard to set the board up to begin operating later this year so it can start considering cases referred by users and Facebook. We will make decisions without regard to Facebook\u2019s economic, political or reputational interests, in a fair, transparent and politically neutral manner.\u201d</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s decision to restrict the Trump tweet \u2013 which was followed by a Trump executive order aimed at reducing the platform\u2019s protections against civil claims \u2013 won the backing of the European commission.</p> <p>The EU executive branch\u2019s vice-president, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said in her response to the dispute that politicians should answer \u201ccriticism with facts, not with threats and attacks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI support Twitter in their efforts to develop and implement a transparent, clear and consistent moderation policy,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said. \u201cThis is not about censorship. This is about flagging verifiably false or misleading information that may cause public harm, linking to reliable information, or flagging content violating their policies.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels</em></p>",

The Conservatives made a clear commitment to address this in their election manifesto, he said. And he said that work on this issue had continued during the coronavirus crisis. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the positive things amid the terrible things that have happened during this crisis is that people have recognised social care and just how important it is.</p> <p>We need to follow that up with reforms to the way social care is supported and make sure more people get that dignity in their older age, and that people of working age get the support they need \u2026<br></p> <p>I am determined to push forward the social care reforms that I know so many [people] are interested in.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when pressed as to when the plans would appear, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the timeframe has been clear, which is that we have got to get these reforms done in this parliament and the prime minister has previously said we will get them set out this year.</p> <p>That was before coronavirus. We will still try to do that but it is not straightforward.</p> </blockquote> <p>A delay until 2021 would be hugely embarrassing for Boris Johnson. On the day he became prime minister in July last year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019\">in his speech in Downing Street,</a> he implied he had a policy that was all set to be implemented (\u201coven-ready\u201d, to use the phrase he applied in a different context). He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock declared that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as he stressed the importance of addressing why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus - while failing to announce any concrete proposals.</strong> Earlier, the government published the Public Health England report into why BAME people and other demographic groups are more at risk from coronavirus. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033#block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033\">12.56pm.)</a> Referring to the report, Hancock used the slogan championed by the eponymous US-based human rights group. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice. And I get that. Black lives matter. And I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care: I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the report, which does not say much more about why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus than earlier reports (like<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronavirusrelateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to10april2020\"> this ONS one)</a>, has disappointed people hoping for firm policy recommendations. Hancock has responded by promising \u2026 a further review, headed by the junior equalities minister Kemi Badenoch. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is much more work to do to understand what\u2019s driving these disparities and how the different risk factors interact, and we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing that gap.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7947bb79f7eceeca22f5b06ced40049195e542d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7947bb79f7eceeca22f5b06ced40049195e542d/0_0_4191_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock at the press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/DOWNING STREET HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T18:25:20.710Z\">at 7.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed6882a8f084df971c8e6df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T17:14:12.298Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs have been told it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that children in <strong>young offenders institutions</strong> are still being locked up for more than 22 hours a day, 10 weeks after lockdown.</p> <p>Many of them have had no access to face-to-face education during that time, the justice select committee hearing on the impact of Covid-19 on the youth justice system was told.</p> <p>The custody estate should have moved more swiftly, and there were real concerns that young offenders, who had initially accepted the restrictions placed on them, would lose patience if they saw changes to lockdown in the community, but no relaxation of regimes in YOIs. </p> <p>Very few children had been released under the early release scheme, the committee heard.

the most draconian introduced by any British government in peacetime. It may not feel like that, but that is because the lockdown has widespread public support. On paper the powers taken by the state have been extraordinary (as<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11752310/sex-illegal-coronavirus-lockdown-another-household-police/\"> even the Sun newspaper has twigged)</a>.</p> <p>Yet ministers have managed to introduce these rules without putting a bill through parliament. The lockdown has been imposed under the Public Health Act 1984 using secondary legislation. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2#block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2\">2.04pm.)</a> The actual regulations have only received minimal parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpO7XzpNa8DyxZsWNgckexHeezN1PYR1/view\">a letter (pdf)</a> to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, the <strong>Good Law Project </strong>claims this is illegal. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the emergency procedure under section 45R of the 1984 act to be used, a minister must declare that s/he \u201cof the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved\u201d. This provision must be interpreted in the light of the authorities referred to above which confirm parliamentary accountability as a fundamental constitutional principle ...</p> <p>We simply do not understand how the amendment regulations were so urgent that it was not possible to put them to votes in both houses. There was no justification for parliamentary accountability to be jettisoned. It is inconceivable that parliament, when passing the 1984 act, would have conceived that the emergency procedure would be used repeatedly in order to avoid parliamentary accountability over the course of months.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is not unusual to hear lawyers make arguments like this, but Hancock might be advised to take it seriously. It is run by <strong>Jolyon Maugham</strong> QC and it was one of the parties involved in the successful attempt to get the supreme court last year to rule Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation illegal.</p> <p>Maugham is not taking Hancock to court - yet. But <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/news/it-is-not-good-enough/\">he reserves the right to do so.</a> In its letter the Good Law Project says it supports the aim of the lockdown. But it says that restrictions as sweeping as this should not be introduced via a mechanism that does not allow full parliamentary scrutiny, and it says it might launch a legal challenge using judicial review if Hancock tries to amend the lockdown again using the 1984 act.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T16:15:17.168Z\">at 5.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed671728f08f5e3730132b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:39:46.079Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Further 324 Covid-19 deaths in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 324 people have died after contracting Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed, taking the UK\u2019s official coronavirus death toll across all settings to 39,369.</p> <p>Another 1,653 people have tested positive for the virus, with 277,985 people having now tested positive since the start of the outbreak. </p> <p>A total of 135,643 tests were carried out yesterday, 7,000 more than the previous day.

She said the government had pledged to test all Scotland\u2019s care home staff regardless of whether they showed symptoms or not, after substantial outbreaks and mounting fatalities in care homes; those testing figures showed that promise had not been met.</p> <p> Johnstone, a list MSP for the Lothians, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures simply don\u2019t add up. Scotland is testing an average of 4,600 people a day, and that is across all sectors. </p> <p>If regular testing of care home staff had begun, as she claims, then that alone would use up to 7,570 tests per day, and that\u2019s before any residents, patients or NHS workers are tested.</p> <p>There is no point in increasing Scotland\u2019s capacity to test for Covid-19 if we are not going to use it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jackie Baillie</strong>, Scottish Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said the latest figures suggested only 2.1% of Scotland\u2019s population had been tested, when the WHO had urged governments to test as many people as possible.</p> <p>Baillie said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having to change the testing eligibility guidance seven times in three months clearly shows that the Scottish government got this badly wrong at the start of this pandemic and have been too slow to rectify the situation.</p> <p>Without a rapid expansion in testing we cannot move to the \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d stage and so cannot safely continue to ease the lockdown. </p> <p>It is time for the SNP government to swallow its pride and get to work to expand testing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:52:29.941Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed66b9d8f087122eca542bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:09:38.158Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least MPs can queue in the shade, Labour\u2019s <strong>Ian Murray</strong> points out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanMurrayMP/status/1267835220939677696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We now appear to have entered the foliage in this voting fiasco <a href=\"https://t.co/6X1dyWYOU9\">pic.twitter.com/6X1dyWYOU9</a></p>&mdash; Ian Murray MP (@IanMurrayMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanMurrayMP/status/1267835220939677696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed66ad58f08f5e37301325c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:08:22.319Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has announced that <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, a former whip, has been made a junior minister in the Scotland Office following the resignation of Douglas Ross.

Sileri told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I spoke with Conte to tell President Conte that I\u2019d tested positive [for coronavirus]. And he told me that he\u2019d spoken with Boris Johnson and that they\u2019d also talked about the situation in Italy. I remember he said, \u2018He told me that he wants herd immunity\u2019.</p> <p>I remember that after hanging up, I said to myself that I hope Boris Johnson goes for a lockdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>In late February and early March the government\u2019s scientific adviser were relatively open about saying that they thought it would be impossible to entirely suppress coronavirus and that there were advantages from allowing \u201cherd immunity\u201d to build up. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said this publicly, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">in a Today programme interview on 13 March</a> (the day the Johnson/Conte conversation took place). But very soon afterwards the government abruptly changed policy, in response to modelling saying that anything other than a policy aimed at full suppression of coronavirus would led to the NHS being overwhelmed.</p> <p>Subsequently ministers became averse to being associated with the \u201cherd immunity\u201d concept, because that implied toleration or even support for people dying from coronavirus in manageable numbers, and now they insist it was never part of their policy.</p> <p>According to PA Media, the Dispatches programme also quotes <strong>Prof Graham Medley</strong>, who sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), saying he was dismayed by government complacency at the early stages of the outbreak. Medley told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We already knew that this virus was going to cause an awful lot of death and disability and would require an awful lot of NHS resource ... so it was with some dismay that we were watching senior politicians behaving in a way that suggested that this was not something that was too serious.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a7b0582e276f8eb144b9d744e2e5b86cb12bc07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7b0582e276f8eb144b9d744e2e5b86cb12bc07/0_49_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson with his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte (left) in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson with his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte (left) in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed641dc8f08f5e373013072\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:25:01.009Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is what <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, told MPs about the Public Health England report (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033#block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033\"> 12.56pm)</a> and the new review being led by the equalities minister.

This is because BAME people are more likely to live in urban areas, in overcrowded households, in deprived areas, and have jobs that expose them to higher risk. People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences.</p> <p>Secondly, people of BAME communities are also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection. For example, some comorbidities which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from White British ethnicity, and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups. Data from the National Diabetes Audit suggests that type II diabetes prevalence is higher in people from BAME communities.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:10:28.610Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63e498f084df971c8e304\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/haroonsiddique\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:56:57.797Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The delayed report into into why black, Asian and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">has just been published.</a></p> <p>It says, after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region: \u201cPeople of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death when compared to people of white British ethnicity.

Death rates from Covid-19 were highest among people of black and Asian ethnic groups.

Therefore, the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups is the opposite of that seen in previous years. </p> <p>An analysis of survival among confirmed Covid-19 cases and using more detailed ethnic groups, shows that after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black ethnicity had between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British. </p> <p>These analyses did not account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity.

This finding is consistent with other studies that have reported a higher risk of death from Covid-19 among patients with diabetes.

Ferguson was appearing with three other academics. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05#block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05\">10.10am.)</a> At no point was he asked, or did he allude to, the circumstances that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">his resignation from Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a>, although at one point in his evidence, when speaking about care homes, he did sound like someone holding back strong views about government ministers. (When Ferguson resigned from Sage, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/government-scientists-lockdown-breach-a-matter-for-the-police-says-speechless-matt-hancock\">seemed to relish denouncing him.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Ferguson said that he expected coronavirus levels to remain \u201crelatively flat\u201d as the lockdown was gradually eased over the summer but that it was \u201cvery unclear\u201d what would happen in September, when a fuller relaxation is expected.</strong> He implied a second spike was a real possibility. Asked what would happen, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the key issues is how much will relaxation of current controls lead to potential increases in transmission. I should say that it is not clear that it automatically will do so. But most of the modelling would suggest that we might get a small increase, but it\u2019s very unclear whether that will lead to the reproduction number being [above 1] ....</p> <p>I suspect, though, under any scenario that levels of transmission, and numbers of cases, will remain relatively flat between now and September - short of very big policy changes, or behavioural changes in the community.</p> <p>The real uncertainty is if there are larger policy changes in September, as we move into the time of year when respiratory viruses tend to transmit slightly better, what will happen then? And that remains very unclear. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that experts underestimated the extent of coronavirus in the UK in February, and that helped to explain why the death rate was higher than hoped</strong>. He said the experts had not realised how much infection was coming from Spain. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing the genetic data is showing us now is most chains of transmission still existing in the UK originated from Spain, to some extent Italy. We have been worrying about importations, infections from China - we\u2019re a very well connected country in the world, other Asian countries, the US - but it is clear that before we were even in a position to measure it, before surveillance systems were even set up, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals coming into the country in late February and early March from that area. And that meant that the epidemic was further ahead than we had anticipated.</p> <p>That explains some of the acceleration of policy then. It also explains, to some extent, why mortality figures ended up being higher than we had hoped.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at how bad countries around the world had been at protecting people in care homes.</strong> He was not talking specifically about the UK, but he was not omitting it either. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I, like many people, am shocked about how badly European - or countries around the world - have protected care home populations.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Matt Keeling</strong> from Warwick University also said that more could have been done to protect people in care homes. He suggested that the academic modellers were partly at fault. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the lockdown had been very strict, if we\u2019d have thought more about what was happening in care homes and hospitals, as you\u2019ve heard, early on maybe that was one of the areas where modellers did drop the ball.</p> <p>With hindsight, it\u2019s very easy to say we know care homes and hospitals are these huge collections of very vulnerable individuals, so maybe with hindsight we could have modelled those early on and thought about the impacts there.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

MPs who are able to go in and vote will be able to show off to their constituents, like Giant Haystacks in the wrestling ring, yet those MPs who genuinely cannot come back to Westminster, will face questions from local residents why they are not voting, have to explain their personal circumstances, which may be uncomfortable for them to do, and, see their voting record trashed in the internet league tables.

Recent research based upon the latest WHO data and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/index.htm\" title=\"\">US National Vital Statistics</a> found some remarkable facts. The US has the highest rate of child mortality across 21 western countries, and for every white child dying, 2.1 African American children die. Across all age groups African American death rates are 20% higher than average US mortality. Moreover, the US has the widest income inequality between the top and bottom 10% of its population, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>The starkest statistic is for \u201clegal intervention\u201d deaths \u2013 state executions or police killings. Nationally the rate is two per million, but for African American men it\u2019s five per million.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1258/shorts.2011.011076\" title=\"\">study</a> in a major British journal, we showed that the US health system, based upon mortality and money spent on health, is the most ineffective and inefficient health service in the west, but it was turned down by two US journals as being \u201ctoo political\u201d.

Certainly governments have sought to restrict the right to protest, as they invariably do.

Contrary to Hancox\u2019s perspective, I\u2019d suggest that this is on the increase. People\u2019s expectations that elected representatives will do things for them has diminished considerably since the watershed year of 1968.

  "<p>Carl Worswick\u2019s article provides some interesting new angles on this complicated story (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/bobby-moore-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-bogota-bracelet\" title=\"\">Bobby Moore and the mystery of the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet</a>, 28 May). As I was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Bogot\u00e1 on 18 May 1970 when the incident took place \u2013 the new ambassador, Tom Rogers, arrived on 22 May \u2013 I\u2019d like to clarify a few things.</p> <p>The questioning of Bobby Moore before the team\u2019s departure for Quito on 21 May was not part of the investigation by the National Police, but was done by a detective from DAS, a rival police force, at my suggestion. It aimed to show the complete confidence of the England party in his innocence.</p> <p>The return of the team to Bogot\u00e1 on 25 May was more dramatic than described. At the airport, our information officer, Julio Tobon, was tipped off that National Police detectives were there to arrest Moore. This would have meant humiliation for Moore and the risk of unhelpful headlines. I managed to persuade the detectives not to arrest him on the understanding that I would take him to make a voluntary statement to the magistrate. We were joined by Vicente Laverde, an excellent lawyer who defended Moore throughout for free.</p> <p>The hearing did not last until late at night as Worswick describes. The magistrate decided that Moore should be detained, but then agreed that he could be held at the house of Alfonso Senior, president of the Colombian FA. He stipulated two policemen to guard him but could not, as the article implies, provide them. That fell to me. I turned to the DAS again. Moore was with us at the embassy until 1am, when the DAS men finally arrived.</p> <p>On 26 May, Tom Rogers and I lobbied the foreign ministry vigorously to secure Moore\u2019s release. There were no instructions from Harold Wilson himself, as Worswick implies, but we knew it was politically charged, with a general election under way.

  "<p>Did Donald Trump just declare war on the US? Because that is certainly what it sounded like.</p> <p>After spending the weekend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">hiding in a bunker</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">firing off&nbsp;incendiary tweets</a>, Trump finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">addressed the country</a> on Monday evening. In his first official speech since the killing of George Floyd by police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world\">sparked global protests</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BunkerBoy\">#BunkerBoy</a>&nbsp;stood in the White House Rose Garden and threatened to mobilise the American military against the American people. Branding himself the \u201cpresident of law and order\u201d, Trump vowed that, if violence and looting continued, and mayors and governors did not take action, he would&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/02/trump-threatens-to-deploy-military-against-protesters-video\">\u201cdeploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem\u201d</a>. It is no exaggeration to say that the president of the US, the country that likes to declare itself the world\u2019s greatest democracy, threatened to implement martial law.</p> <p>It feels as if the US is at a turning point. The unrest sweeping the country could be the undoing of Trump \u2013 or it could dramatically increase his power. Which will it be? Toss a coin. Heads means this is the beginning of the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, tails means we can expect another term.</p> <p>I am not being flippant; I am trying to be realistic. There has been a lot of speculation about how the protests will affect Trump\u2019s chance of re-election, but the truth is that none of us, not even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/jan/06/trump-tweets-i-am-a-stable-genius-video\">a very stable genius</a> such as me, know how this will play out. By rights, a million different crises \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">the Russia investigation</a> to the disputed accusation that he raped the journalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/e-jean-carroll-trump-rape-accuser-dna-sample\">E Jean Carroll</a>&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">his handling of the pandemic</a> \u2013 should have sunk Trump by now. But when it comes to this president, the normal rules do not seem to apply. One week, Trump is suggesting that we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">inject bleach to ward off the coronavirus</a>, the next he is threatening martial law. Everyone is shocked for a second, then we move on to his next drama.</p> <p>There is a school of thought that argues the urban uprisings in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/opinions/carnage-trump-right-and-wrong-answers-avlon/index.html\">will help Trump</a>. There have been numerous <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-06-01/trump-riots-protests-military\">comparisons to&nbsp;1968</a>, when Richard Nixon exploited an anti-riot backlash and rode a law-and-order platform to electoral victory. Trump seems to be trying his best to pull a Nixon. Before his extraordinary speech on Monday, he held an equally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">extraordinary&nbsp;video conference</a>&nbsp;with governors and law enforcement officials. On the call, Trump told participants that they were \u201cweak\u201d and needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you\u2019ll never see this stuff again,\u201d&nbsp;Trump said. In other words: lock up a lot of people who might not vote for him. That is one way to win an election.</p> <p>There is another school of thought, however, that reckons this moment will harm Trump more than it helps him. He may be trying to ape Nixon, but there are enormous differences between 1968 and 2020 \u2013 not least the fact that Nixon was not trying to win a second term. Trump is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-retweets-account-slamming-democrats-as-floyd-protests-erupt-2020-5\">doing his best to blame Democrats</a>&nbsp;for the unrest, but he can\u2019t get around the fact that he is the president. He is the one who is supposed to be in charge.</p> <p>Again, it is too early to say how the situation will play out for Trump. It is, however, fair to say that Trump is in trouble \u2013 and he knows it. The protests don\u2019t exist in a vacuum:&nbsp;the coronavirus&nbsp;crisis means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html\">one in four American workers</a>&nbsp;has filed for unemployment benefits and some of the country\u2019s swing states are expected to see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-01/trump-faces-drag-of-job-losses-topping-16-in-vital-2020-states\">prolonged job losses</a>. Trump is also doing very badly in the polls: Joe Biden has a 10-point lead over him in an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/01/poll-biden-lead-over-trump-general-election-293550\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a>&nbsp;from Sunday and the president\u2019s approval rating has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?cid=rrpromo\">dipped </a><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?cid=rrpromo\">below 43%</a>. Trump is in trouble, which means trouble for the US. As the president made clear in his speech on Monday, he will not disappear without a fight \u2013 no matter how much collateral damage that causes.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist </p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>When Mexican news anchor Carmen Aristegui was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/mexican-journalist-carmen-aristegui-mvs-radio-president-enrique-pena-nieto\">fired from a popular radio show </a>after revealing a presidential scandal on air, it sparked an outpouring of anger and protests.</p> <p>For millions of listeners Aristegui is a trusted voice cutting through government spin and corruption, and her absence left a void.</p> <p>Now a <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London\">new documentary</a> charts the journey she made to overcome censorship and form a <a href=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/\">new independent news platform</a> with a group of colleagues.</p> <p>In Radio Silence, filmmaker Juliana Fanjul follows Aristegui over the 22 months it took her to get back on air while continuing her investigative work amid a slew of lawsuits, death threats and the murder of another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/crusading-mexican-journalist-javier-valdez-shot-dead-in-sinaloa\">prominent journalist</a>.</p> <p>Aristegui\u2019s sacking in 2015 occurred against a backdrop of violence gripping Mexico and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/mexico-43-killed-students-\">disappearance of 43 students from the state of Guerrero</a>, explains Fanjul.</p> <p>\u201cWe were really concerned as a society to try and understand what was going on and her voice was very important. She was the first one to bring the families of those students on to the air and give them a voice.\u201d</p> <p>Aristegui was fired by her employer, the privately owned MVS Radio, over her demands that the company reinstate two colleagues who had been independently reporting on a scandal involving the then president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/enrique-pena-nieto\">Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a>, and his wife, and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/10/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-mansion-explain\">opulent villa to be built by a Mexican consortium</a> in exchange for a railway contract.</p> <p>The project involved Chinese capital and, in the face of what was called the Casa Blanca or White House scandal, Pe\u00f1a Nieto was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">cancel the contract and apologise to the Chinese government</a>. When Aristegui was sacked, thousands of people gathered outside the radio station to protest.</p> <p>Fanjul used to listen to Aristegui\u2019s programme to keep abreast of developments in her native Mexico from her home in Switzerland. \u201cWhen the mic was cut I was filled with rage,\u201d she says. \u201cJournalists were being killed and I thought if they are doing this to Carmen who is so well-known, things are really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought instead of being anguished I should make a film and I went to Mexico to find her.\u201d</p> <p>Fanjul spent four years filming Aristegui, providing a rare insight into the woman whose name has become synonymous with press freedom in Mexico.</p> <p>Her news programme had been a ratings hit. Yet no radio station offered her a job following her dismissal, such was the extent of government censorship. Instead, she set up on her own, and with the help of social media, continued to expose corruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Coeytaux/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her investigations continued to make headlines around the world including her report headlined \u201cFrom Plagiarist to President\u201d, which alleged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto had plagiarised almost a third of his law degree thesis</a>. Only one Mexican newspaper ran the story.</p> <p>It led to an increasingly hostile climate for Aristegui and her colleagues. One explains: \u201cWorking with Carmen Aristegui entails being constantly under surveillance \u2026 under fire \u2026 by journalists who are pro-government or close to power.\u201d Another reveals: \u201cI imagined they were going to make me disappear.\u201d</p> <p>Through behind-the-scenes footage at her office, Aristegui is portrayed as a passionate workaholic, fiercely determined, but with a warmth and generosity towards her colleagues. She has an impressive 8.6 million Twitter followers but Fanjul says her private life is strictly guarded.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of who she is, it is hard for her to trust people,\u201d explains Fanjul. \u201cIt took a long time for her to let me in.\u201d</p> <p>When the filmmaker got rare access to her home, Aristegui described how her teenage son had become a target of government surveillance.</p> <p>\u201cThe repression and scheming that took place to kick us off air, and later the constant legal attacks, led me to believe that it was much better for Emilio to leave Mexico, in a context in which his mum was publicly exposed to a scandal, where you never really know how it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p> <p>She says they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists\">targeted by Pegasus spyware</a>. \u201cWhoever was behind the Pegasus attacks on a young teen\u2019s iPhone, who was studying in the United States, displays a great degree of perversity,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was clearly his mum they wanted to hurt.\u201d</p> <p>After a break-in at her office, chilling CCTV footage shows men opening drawers and stealing a computer. It contained sensitive information about a powerful politician that Aristegui had previously implicated in a prostitution ring.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the office was broken into, more than one journalist resigned. Paradoxically, each obstacle that appeared in Carmen\u2019s way only strengthened her determination,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>By 16 January 2017, Aristegui was back on air \u2013 on the internet from a sound-proofed booth in her small office.</p> <p>The 2018 election saw the formation of a new government, and Aristegui received an offer from media company Grupo Radio Centro.</p> <p>\u201cIt confirms the pressure was coming from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a </a>administration to keep her off air,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>Her newscast is now broadcast across several radio stations but she retains editorial autonomy. Her investigations continue to make waves, including allegations of corruption in the government\u2019s national news agency.</p> <p>\u201cWe wished things would change with the new government but now it is attacking her and there are smear campaigns,\u201d Fanjul tells the Guardian. \u201cOnce more she has become the enemy.\u201d</p> <p><em>Radio Silence is streaming as part of the digital edition of the <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/london-digital-edition\">Human Rights Watch Film Festival</a>, and is <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London%20Digital%20Edition\">available to watch</a> in the UK and Ireland until 5 June.</em></p>",

The call was about an invitation to attend the G7, but the PM later contacted the <strong>Australian embassy in Washington </strong>to ask how the country should lodge concern about a <strong>Channel 7 </strong>reporter and a cameraman who were attacked by police during protests in the US capital. </li> \n   <li> The<strong> NSW government </strong>will further ease lockdown restrictions to allow gyms to reopen from<strong> 13 June</strong>. Fitness centres, dance studios, indoor swimming and barre will also be allowed.</li> \n   <li>Hundreds of people have marched through Sydney in a <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protest against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and against the killing of George Floyd in the US. The event happened hours after a <strong>NSW police officer</strong> was placed on \u201crestricted duties\u201d and an investigation launched into footage that showed him slamming a 16-year-old Indigenous boy face-first onto pavement in Sydney on Monday. </li> \n   <li>The <strong>NSW upper house</strong> has reversed the state government\u2019s controversial 12-month <strong>pay freeze for public servants</strong>. MPs voted to disallow the pay pause for 400,000 workers in the state, which was introduced last week in response to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19.</li> \n   <li>The final two bidders for stricken airline <strong>Virgin Australia</strong> are <strong>Bain Capital </strong>and <strong>Cyrus Capital Partners</strong>, administrators Deloitte say. The two remaining contenders now face a race against time to secure a binding deal \u2013 and potentially a government bailout \u2013 before the end of the month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>From me,<strong> Elias Visontay</strong>, have a great evening.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:49:30.695Z\">at 10.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed612f88f084df971c8e0a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T08:52:13.637Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For more on today\u2019s developments surrounding Virgin Australia, my colleague<strong> Ben Butler </strong>has written this report:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/two-remaining-bidders-for-virgin-australia-face-race-against-time-to-complete-deal\">Two remaining bidders for Virgin Australia face race against time to complete deal</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed60d898f087122eca53e0a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T08:28:44.840Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW public servant pay freeze blocked</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The NSW upper house has reversed the state government\u2019s controversial 12-month pay freeze for public servants, AAP reports. </p> \n  <p>MPs voted on Tuesday to disallow the pay pause, which was introduced last week in response to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The <strong>Berejiklian government</strong> had argued the freeze would guarantee jobs for public servants and free up funds for job-creating projects to support others who have lost work.</p> \n  <p>But the wages policy has been opposed by unions and frontline workers including paramedics, nurses, police officers and teachers.</p> \n  <p>Labor MP <strong>Adam Searle</strong>, who successfully introduced the motion to disallow the pay freeze regulation, said it was an \u201cact of economic vandalism\u201d that would cut the purchasing power of 400,000 workers in the state.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T08:49:42.998Z\">at 9.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed60a278f08f5e373012dc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T08:15:22.631Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p> From my colleague <strong>Justine Landis-Hanley:</strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong><br></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-nsw-restrictions-why-can-pubs-host-50-people-when-im-only-allowed-to-have-five-in-my-house\">Coronavirus NSW restrictions: why can pubs host 50 people when I'm only allowed to have five in my house?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed606138f087122eca53dd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T07:57:54.129Z\">8.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some more footage from my colleague <strong>Naaman Zhou</strong>, who is at the Black Lives Matter solidarity protest in Sydney this evening:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/naamanzhou/status/1267721663707148289\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Protesters now taking a knee during the march.

In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances.</p> \n   <p>The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period. It is likely that this fiscal and monetary support will be required for some time.</p> \n   <p>The board is committed to do what it can to support jobs, incomes and businesses and to make sure that Australia is well placed for the recovery.

Baskin, a self-styled conservationist and owner of the Big Cat Rescue facility in Hillsborough County, Florida, has been given control of the Wynnewood, Oklahoma premises by courts, after Exotic failed to pay her $1m in copyright and trademark suits.</p> <p>Exotic \u2013 real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage \u2013 is currently in prison, having been found guilty of 17 counts of animal abuse and a murder-for-hire plot against Baskin, and sentenced to 22 years.</p> <p>Until <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carole-baskin-awarded-joe-exotics-zoo-court-ruling-1296769\">the judg</a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carole-baskin-awarded-joe-exotics-zoo-court-ruling-1296769\">ment</a>, the zoo was owned by Jeff Lowe, a rival turned business associate, and Maldonado-Passage\u2019s mother, Shirley Schreibvogel. Baskin sued, claiming that the zoo had been fraudulently transferred to the pair to avoid it being seized by Maldonado-Passage\u2019s creditors, herself included, a claim upheld in court. Baskin had also previously sued Maldonado-Passage for trademark and copyright infringement for use of her company\u2019s logo and images.</p> <p>According to court documents, Lowe has 120 days to vacate the zoo, which he had renamed Tiger King Park, and to remove all animals.</p> <p>Subtitled Murder, Mayhem and Madness, Tiger King has been a huge hit for Netflix since its release in March, with the notoriously cagey streaming giant revealing in April that the show had been watched by 64m households. The stranger-than-fiction series also made cult figures of Maldonado-Passage and Baskin, who has been subject to an array of unsubstantiated claims that she murdered her husband Jack \u201cDon\u201d Lewis, and fed him to her beloved big cats \u2013 accusations Baskin denied in the show. Such is the cultural impact of the series, Nicolas Cage has been signed up to portray Maldonado-Passage in an upcoming TV miniseries.</p> <p>While Maldonado-Passage is unlikely to be happy with the decision, Lowe remains nonplussed, with he and his wife Lauren telling <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/06/01/carole-baskin-taking-control-oklahoma-zoo-joe-exotic-lawsuit-jeff-lowe/\">US gossip site TMZ</a> that they had \u201clong anticipated that the judge would eventually undo the 2016 land transfer.

  "<p>Plenty of shows have landed glancing blows on the Trump administration, but TV has yet to crown its one true culture-representing Trump show. That\u2019s a designation that Space Force, Netflix\u2019s new 10-episode collaboration with The Office creator Greg Daniels, appears keen to claim for itself. The title and general countour of the premise originated with a March 2018 speech from the current commander-in-chief, in which his watery brain emitted the decree that America would achieve supremacy in the hotly contested region of outer space with the establishment of a brand new branch of the armed forces. So it had been declared, and so it was; by December 2019, space force was an independent entity and beginning our Starship Troopers-style conquest of the stars.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/29/space-force-review-steve-carell-john-malkovich\">Space Force review \u2013 Steve Carell parody fails to reach orbit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Daniels\u2019 series would ostensibly train its satirical crosshairs on the abundant, self-evident stupidity of this enterprise, and through it, the antagonistic senselessness of Trumpism as a political philosophy. In the debut season, a handful of references to an unnamed \u201cPotus\u201d (what could possibly be the point of playing coy?) always signal the sort of casually issued orders from on high that would generally come from a clueless blowhard executive, which is what Trump is. But the show on the whole doesn\u2019t just fail in an attempt to reckon with the zeitgeist, the literal \u201cspirit of the times\u201d; Daniels hasn\u2019t even made the effort to dissect his subject. It\u2019s a show about Trump\u2019s military-industrial complex without a single trace of complexity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4mY2asIjWk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l4mY2asIjWk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Daniels turns the sixth department of the armed forces into an unusually high-budget instance of the wacky workplace sitcom, with his old leading man Steve Carell in tow once again as star and co-creator. But Mark Naird, the eternally frazzled four-star general running the show, bears only the faintest resemblance to irritating-yet-endearing boob Michael Scott. Naird\u2019s a competent, dedicated company man who only comes undone due to the zany incompetence all around him. The series begins with him discussing his dream of being a great military leader, just before he\u2019s assigned his new detail and made the mockery of his peers in the Marines, navy, air force and army. (In one of the better jokes, everyone dumps on the coast guard, even those clowns at space force.) The moment raises an early red flag, in that this scene\u2019s writing ask us to take the nobility of military service seriously.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our intention to go all-out and poke fun at the military,\u201d Daniels said in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/28/21238252/upload-space-force-greg-daniels-interview-streaming-netflix-amazon\">a recent interview with Vox</a>. \u201cSteve and I both have relatives in the military. We have a lot of respect for all the positives that our relatives have.\u201d Respect and deference, historically, have not been the most successful starting points for satire. But Daniels sees the politicians behind the scenes as the target of his jabs, per that same interview. \u201c[Mark]&nbsp;is being squeezed between politicians who are really anxious to get on the moon as fast as possible in a kind of neocolonialist scramble, and scientists who don\u2019t necessarily agree with the aims of the program and are hard to understand.\u201d</p> <p>The terms of the comedy come into focus in light of that soundbite, with Mark and his science adviser Dr Mallory (an ever wonderful John Malkovich) the odd couple forced to work together if they want to transcend the inept management in the White House. But the nature of the friction and gridlock generated by mystery Potus scans as utterly disconnected from the furious, incoherent brand of chaos reigning over the Trump administration. The functionaries at space force receive the occasional eccentric missive from the top; the first lady wants to redefine their uniforms with Star Trek-ish capes in one episode, and the order to ramp up space force comes from a tweet calling for \u201cboobs on the moon\u201d. (That\u2019s a hopefully misspelled \u201cboots\u201d.) It all makes the president sound like any other clueless boss, only with more power and a boyish taste for the fantastical and impressive. It is, in this respect, much closer to a toothless would-be takedown of the Bush administration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87e8f3bf216952402ab0a211ac4ff1f39b7125a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87e8f3bf216952402ab0a211ac4ff1f39b7125a2/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If a viewer reads the series as a commentary angled instead toward the high-ranking officials trapped in the Trump orbit, it still doesn\u2019t hold together. Daniels reproduces the popular liberal myth of the well-intending Trump flunky, a cabinet member or top adviser covertly working to better the administration. These fantasies are just as unproductive in fiction as they are in real life, promoting the mistaken idea that someone can be a collaborator and a patriot at the same time, instead of simply complicit. To return to the Vox interview once more, Daniels comes right out and describes Mark as \u201ctrying his best\u201d, a phrase unbefitting any member of Trump\u2019s circle.</p> <p>The other, more pedestrian issues with the show \u2013 multi-episode subplots that go nowhere, overwrought family drama, an egregious deployment of the Beach Boys\u2019 accursed Kokomo \u2013 seem like lighter offenses in comparison to Daniels\u2019 garbled ambitions. He\u2019s at something of a disadvantage, in that his show arrives while Americans divide their attentions between the stifling pandemic and the nationwide eruption of state-sponsored violence against protesters. Even in a kinder climate, however, Daniels\u2019 broadsides against Trump would be pitifully inadequate. For his gentle prodding to succeed, it would require a climate so kind that somebody else would be in the Oval Office.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last half-century the world has been transformed by huge flows of trade and investment. The source of our food and the manufacture of everything from trainers to mobile phones has been revolutionised. Bank inquiries in Newcastle are handled in Bangalore. Secure industrial jobs have evaporated in Europe and North America and reappeared on the other side of the world. Exports, which amounted to less than 10% of global GDP in the 1970s, now stand at 25%.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a massive social and economic transformation. It has, by the same token, been hotly contentious, creating losers as well as winners. And this raised the question: would it be brought to an end by eruption of opposition? Again and again \u2013&nbsp;after the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-globalization-why-seattles-1999-protesters-were-right/282831/\">1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>, September 11, the financial crisis of 2008 and the election of Donald Trump \u2013 there have been predictions of globalisation\u2019s terminal crisis.&nbsp;In the background lurks the memory of the 1930s and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/04/2010s-like-1930s-look-facts-unemployment-healthcare\">Great Depression</a>, when trade and capital flows contracted, not to recover for the best part of half a century.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 shock has raised globalisation angst to a new pitch. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres20_e/pr855_e.htm\">predicting</a> that trade may fall by a record 32%. The lockdowns were disruptive enough. But as the economic crisis deepens, 2020 is beginning to look like something worse: a perfect disruptive storm.</p> <p>To see why, consider the range of factors that shape the international division of labour.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Start with politics.</p> <p>The pursuit of profit extends across national borders and lines of political conflict. But if you are going to set aside politics and diplomacy, you need to agree to differ. It helps if you have an arbiter, a global hegemon. It is no coincidence that the surge in global trade and investment coincided with what seemed like decisive American victory in the cold war.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to politics, the flow of goods is driven by technology. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century centred on cotton. A quarter of a millennium later the garment supply chain still spans the world, from the cotton farms of Australia to sweatshops in Bangladesh and big box malls in American suburbs, now empty of customers. Twenty-first century smartphones are produced by a hyper-sophisticated network linking labs and software coders in the west with chip foundries in South Korea and Vietnam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract\">assembly lines</a> in China and Vietnam. The greatest single driver of globalisation in recent years has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/maersk-shipping-revolution-sustainability\">containeri</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/maersk-shipping-revolution-sustainability\">sation</a>, which slashed the cost of shipping.</p> <p>Apart from politics and technology, who makes what, and where, is decided by the terms of trade, which depend on the balance of costs and prices and the matrix of exchange rates. Sudden movements in currencies shift costs, disrupting existing patterns of demand and supply.</p> <p>Finally, whether we have the appetite to buy goods \u2013 made at home or abroad \u2013 depends on the overall state of the economy, on what economists call \u201caggregate demand\u201d, the sum of consumption, investment and government spending.</p> <p>Add together technology, price effects, macroeconomics and geopolitics and it becomes clear why, in 2020, we face a perfect storm.</p> <p>On the technological front, containerisation and the revolution in outsourcing have run their course. The car industry, which operates the most complex supply chains, is undergoing a technological revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/25/2020-set-to-be-year-of-the-electric-car-say-industry-analysts\">advent of electric cars</a> (or what the industry calls \u201ce-mobility\u201d) will simplify and shrink production, cutting millions of jobs. Consultants like McKinsey\u2019s reckon that it will only be a matter of time before the armies of female <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/garment-workers-face-destitution-as-covid-19-closes-factories\">factory workers</a> currently employed in cutting and sewing clothes will be replaced by robots.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Covid-19 recession has slashed consumption and investment. The US is by far the largest importer, and its demand has been hammered. The current strength of the dollar will go some way towards offsetting the fall in American consumption. A more valuable dollar makes it more attractive to export to the US. But it may also trigger new trade wars.</p> <p>Particularly aggravating to the White House will be the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-forex/brazils-real-falls-to-a-record-low-of-5-3750-per-dollar-idUSS0N2BG02B\">fall in the Brazilian currency</a>, the real. Trump may regard the Brazilian president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/brazils-left-and-right-unite-to-back-pro-democracy-manifesto-bolsonaro\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> as a kindred spirit, but he will not like the huge surge in Brazilian exports as China\u2019s pig farmers opt for the cheapest source of animal feed.</p> <p>The promise of increased agricultural exports from the US to China was key to the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/13/china-confirms-phase-one-trade-deal-us-tariffs\">phase one trade deal</a>, solemnised in January. At least for a few weeks early this year Trump stuck to the phase one script. But that restraint has not lasted. Since April there has been a truly spectacular escalation in rhetoric between Washington and Beijing.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s nationalist bluster plays to his gallery. China makes a good stick with which to beat Joe Biden, who is reputed to favour a more cooperative line. Altogether more serious is the systematic reorientation in US strategy towards China that had already begun under Barack Obama, with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/obama-foreign-policy-pivots-asia\">pivot to Asia</a>\u201d in 2011, and culminated in May 2020 with the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/U.S.-Strategic-Approach-to-The-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Report-5.20.20.pdf\">release</a> by the Trump administration of a comprehensive new strategy document.</p> <p>The document ends any further discussion in Washington of the possible convergence of China with the western model. Instead, all branches of American government are sworn in on a posture of great power competition. Nor is this merely rhetoric. It goes hand in hand with a further round of sanctions against China\u2019s telecoms champion, Huawei. By refusing to allow <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-help-taiwan-firm-build-chip-plant-iarizona/\">chips for Huawei</a>, even chips of Huawei\u2019s own design, to be manufactured on ultra hi-tech equipment that Taiwanese chip foundries source from the US, the Trump administration has effectively declared a technological war.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK has announced its decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/22/boris-johnson-forced-to-reduce-huaweis-role-in-uks-5g-networks\">exclude Huawei</a> from its 5G network within three years. Australia and China are embroiled in a mini-trade war over barley and beef. Huawei executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">Meng Wanzhou</a> awaits her fate under house arrest in Canada. If she is extradited to the US, expect a storm to break loose.</p> <p>Of course, there are countervailing forces. Business, including American business, remains deeply committed to foreign investment and trade. Europe is reluctant to choose between the US and China. Angela Merkel has announced that she will make <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-china/news/china-one-of-germanys-eu-presidency-priorities/\">relations with China</a> one of the priorities of Germany\u2019s presidency of the European council.</p> <p>But, deal-making apart, the broader vision of the flat world of globalisation is dead. The institution that most clearly embodied that \u201cend of history\u201d vision, the WTO, was launched in January 1995. Today, the WTO is in tatters. Its dispute-processing procedures have been paralysed by deliberate American obstruction and its head, Brazilian Roberto Azev\u00eado, has announced that he is resigning a year ahead of time, which leaves the WTO leaderless in the face of the greatest shock to world trade since 1945.</p> <p>Comparisons with the 1930s should not be taken too far. We don\u2019t live under the shadow of total war, and there are good reasons to welcome the end of 1990s-style hyper-globalisation. But we should not underestimate the break with the recent past or kid ourselves that there is any obvious alternative on offer.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University</p>",
