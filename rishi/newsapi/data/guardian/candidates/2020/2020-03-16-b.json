We must not kid ourselves, these are the first steps in a temporary, but long fight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But the ministers are facing calls to go much further, such as developing an EU-wide stimulus package and making available an EU credit line to indebted countries.</strong></p> <p>In an open letter, Socialist and Democrat MEPs, the second-largest group in the European parliament, call for \u201ca proper stimulus package agreed at the European level\u201d, financed by the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We call for a European-wide COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan, with a consolidated and coherent strategy for the rapid mobilisation of the different available EU instruments to support people, SMEs and businesses. </p> <p>This must include the European Central Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism and other banking union tools. The sooner this is done the better, so we can limit the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. </p> </blockquote> <p>Green MEPs have delivered a similar message, but put emphasis on accelerating the European Green Deal, a sweeping plan to transform Europe\u2019s economy to drastically reduce emissions. </p> <p>They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic challenge that represents the Coronavirus outbreak has also to be seen as an opportunity to undertake in the context of the EU Green deal an urgent reorientation of the EU economy as the current crisis reveals the fragility of a carbon-intensive system built on highly interconnected and specialised global supply chains.</p> </blockquote> <p>Both groups want an EU-backed credit line for indebted countries, intended to prevent markets betting against countries such as Italy will be forced to borrow more to deal with the crisis.</p> <p><strong>But not everyone is convinced now is the time for a general stimulus package.</strong></p> <p>Clemens Fuest, president of the ifo institut and adviser to the German government, told the Observer that encouraging social consumption makes \u201cno sense\u201d when people are being discouraged from going to bars and restaurants.</p> <p>He said eurozone ministers should issue \u201ca general signal of solidarity\u201d i.e a statement of support to indebted countries, rather than a precautionary credit line. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f8ed58f088d757559447a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T14:54:32.160Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow now at its lowest since 2017</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Dow Jones industrial average has now slumped to its lowest since spring 2017.</strong></p> <p>Having almost hit 30,000 points in February, it has now shed roughly 30% of its value in the last month -- down to around 21,000.</p> <p>This means that much of the gains racked up under Donald Trump (and boasted about by the president) have been wiped out by Covid-19:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ac0f449a4211b808cd741cb22be8a7c563e3c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ac0f449a4211b808cd741cb22be8a7c563e3c37/0_0_1379_587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dow over the last five years\" width=\"1000\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dow over the last five years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f8f5b8f088d7575594482\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T14:42:41.903Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The markets have completely lost faith in the idea that the global economy could bounce back from the shock of Covid-19.</strong></p> <p>Instead, they seem to be pricing in a slump - followed by stagnation.

Since then, a growing number of firms and individuals have changed their travel behaviour, with greater numbers of people working from home. This has led to an acceleration in the reduction in passenger numbers to around 19% on London Underground and 10% on buses compared to the same week the previous year, with days later in the week showing reductions larger than that average.</p> <p>This is an evolving situation and the financial impact is difficult to predict.

In July, 2019, Disney announced that R&amp;B singer and actor Halle Bailey would play Ariel in the live action remake of their hugely successful 1989 film,<em> </em>The Little Mermaid. The backlash was predictable with petitions claiming that a black mermaid was \u201ca betrayal of Ariel\u2019s original creator\u201d. Roffey points out that one of the first folkloric instances of a mermaid was black. Atargatis was an Assyrian goddess, who had a human lover called Hadad, a shepherd, whom she killed by accident.

What people may feel tonight may have changed in a week\u2019s time, and in a month\u2019s time. Johnson made a reasonably good fist of explaining what his proposals were, and why he thought they were necessary, but there was an enormous gap in the statement that a more experienced or strategic prime minister would have addressed. Johnson announced measures that could close down parts of the economy, particularly in the hospitality sector, and pitch hundreds of thousands of people into worklessness, but he had almost nothing to say about what the government might to to help.

This is allowed under the withdrawal agreement, provided a decision is taken before July.</p> \n  <p>It seems inevitable that the transition will have to be extended, although ministers are not saying that at this point. Only last Thursday Michael Gove was telling MPs that an extension was being ruled out.

They should have more family contact, not less, he said.</p> \n  <p>And, even though this has been characterised as people being asked to stay at home, he said that people would not have to stay at home all the time: He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will almost certainly, as a four-country UK, we will move to a position in the next few weeks where we will ask those groups [the over-70s and those with pre-existing conditions] to not stay at home in the social isolation way that we are telling the symptomatic to do so, but to reduce their social contact.</p> \n   <p>It might be mosques, it might be churches, it might be bingo ... and pubs [that people have to avoid].

Only 11 days ago Boris Johnson was saying that as far as possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. </a>Only five days ago Rishi Sunak delivered a budget that featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-pmqs-boris-johnson-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-rishi-sunak-unveiling-his-first-budget-live-newsrish?page=with:block-5e68f9068f087df56e4c6829#block-5e68f9068f087df56e4c6829\">a total coronavirus rescue package worth \u00a330bn. </a>Less than a week later, with sections of the economy grinding to a halt, that is starting to look well short of what\u2019s needed. <strong>Mel Stride,</strong> the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said as much on the Westminster Hour last night. He told the programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The forecast upon which the budget rests is already well out of date, it doesn\u2019t show booming growth over the following years anyway. If this continues and there is a fundamental and deep and longer term impact, there will be some very difficult decisions to take around borrowing, taxing and spending.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It must be serious because No 10 let <strong>Grant Shapps</strong>, the transport secretary, give an interview to the Today programme this morning. Here are the main points he made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps suggested rail companies could soon be allowed to run reduced services. </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896169\">Rail companies have been asking for their franchise obligations to be reduced because passenger numbers have been plummeting</a>.<strong> </strong>Asked about this, Shapps said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are working with [the rail companies] to see what it is that we need to do to sustain them. People still need to be be able to travel. Some of that is about how many trains are put on the line at any one time. I\u2019m meeting with the train companies this week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if that meant companies being freed from some of their current obligations, he went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is quite clearly an exceptional international moment in time, international crisis. And we need to be flexible as a country to react to that. And I\u2019ll be driven by, amongst other things, the demand. There is no point running ghost trains any more than there\u2019s any point in running ghost planes. But those are conversations which are ongoing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>By \u201cghost planes\u201d Shapps was referring to rules that require airlines to fly planes, even if they were empty, just to preserve their landing slots. He claimed that he had been successful in obtaining a dispensation from these rules from the EU. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government would be considering measures to help the airline industry.</strong> He said that he had been speaking to the aviation industry over recent days, and that he would be taking their proposals to an economic business and response committee being chaired by the chancellor to discuss what the government could do to help. Asked what the government would do, he said the industry had \u201ca variety of different asks\u201d.

  "<p>World leaders at a G7 video summit told Donald Trump that medical firms must share and coordinate research on coronavirus vaccines rather than provide products exclusively to one country.</p> \n<p>The US president has been accused by German political leaders of trying to buy exclusive US access to vaccines being prepared by a German firm, CureVac laboratory.</p> \n<p>The German firm and the US have denied the move, but the episode, first reported in the German press at the weekend, has symbolised fears that Trump does not have an instinct to cooperate with other world leaders to fight the virus.</p> \n<p>There had not been any sign of a coordinated international response to the pandemic until Monday\u2019s G7 call, in contrast to the 2008 financial crash. Many countries have opted for unilateral monetary and health initiatives, sometimes in competition with each other.</p> \n<p>After the one-hour call, members of the G7 issued a joint statement of solidarity, saying: \u201cBy acting together, we will work to resolve the health and economic risks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and set the stage for a strong recovery of strong, sustainable economic growth and prosperity.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU council president Charles Michel implicitly criticised any go-it-alone move on vaccines, saying: \u201cWe expressed a very strong political will that we considered it very important to work together to develop vaccines and therapies.\u201d</p> \n<p>The EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, added that the G7 had learned lessons from the previous Ebola epidemic on the need to set up a platform of renowned scientists, known as CEPI \u2013 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation \u2013 to share research.</p> \n<p>She also said it was \u201cof the utmost importance that neighbouring countries harmonise their measures so that there is the same strong message to the people that the member states are conveying, because that then increases the certainty of the people\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK has until now largely been out of line with mainland European states on its response to the crisis, making fewer announcements \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">until Monday\u2019s dramatic moves</a> \u2013 on social distancing.</p> \n<p>Some countries, notably Singapore, have even accused the UK of abandoning any effort to combat the virus. Boris Johnson spent some part of the video conference explaining the rationale behind the UK approach.</p> \n<p>No major new economic measures were announced at the end of the meeting, but White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said \u201cthey all want to do whatever it takes\u201d. Ahead of the call, the US Federal Reserve on Sunday had already cut interest rates to near zero and announced plans for $700bn (\u00a3570bn) in bond purchases.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson implied further demand-side measures may be in the pipeline, saying: \u201cThere is a widespread agreement among colleagues in the G7 that we are going to need to make sure everybody has access to liquidity and that if we do things jointly, then I think that the global markets will understand that we\u2019re all operating in the same sort of fiscal framework and I think we\u2019ll be much more successful that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The difficulty is that economic activity is collapsing with every move to curtail movement and social contact.</p> \n<p>The idea of a summit at leader level, bringing together the main western economies and Japan, was proposed last week by Emmanuel Macron, the French president.</p> \n<p>Since then, the crisis has spiralled and the major economic interventions by the US Federal Reserve, coupled with steps by the Japanese central bank, had failed to reassure markets, leaving world leaders to hold their talks against the backdrop pf another round of crashing stock markets and figures showing the spread of virus in Europe is now worse than in China.</p> \n<p>The EU largely used the summit to inform the other states it was closing its external borders for a month to all countries outside the Schengen visa area. EU finance ministers met separately.</p> \n<p>The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The US is the current chair of the G7, but Trump\u2019s leadership on coronavirus has been haphazard and the US president, who has an inherent dislike of multilateral solutions, had to be coaxed into holding the summit.</p> \n<p>Robin Niblett, the director of the Chatham House thinktank, had warned the epidemic represented a make-or-break moment for international cooperation.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe disjointed global economic response to Covid-19, with its enormous ramifications for global prosperity and economic stability, has blown into the open the urgent need for an immediate reaffirmation of international political and economic cooperation.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Kudlow insisted the call had been worthwhile, and said the summit had expressed solidarity with Japanese hopes that the Olympics will still be able to go ahead this summer.</p> \n<p>Trump did not consult with European leaders before he imposed the US travel ban last week and the weekend revelation that the US sought to secure exclusive access to a potential vaccine by offering a lucrative contract to CureVac laboratory in south-west Germany has infuriated public opinion. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

The hard criterion is that the pick will be a woman who both works well with Biden and balances the ticket.</p> <p>\u201cHe has to balance out who he is,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a top party donor and the founder of Democracy in Color. \u201cHe\u2019s an old white man so logically he should have a young woman of color to balance the ticket out.</p> <p>\u201cHe will have some strength with some of the white suburban voters but he\u2019s going to need turnout with young people, that was the cornerstone of the Obama-Biden ticket. So if there\u2019s one thing people are not about Joe Biden, it\u2019s enthusiastic. But if he has someone like a Stacey Abrams on his ticket, the level of enthusiasm there would just be dramatically different.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips said his organization and a number of others had been discussing sending a letter to Biden and Sanders, urging them to commit to a person of color.</p> <p>Biden advisers, as any advisers would with the nomination still to be won, are loth to go into more detail about their candidate\u2019s thinking. But in the post-debate call, Symone Sanders, a senior adviser, said: \u201cHe has said that the qualification for vice-president for him would be someone that is simpatico with him, as he would like to say.\u201d</p> <p>She added, unequivocally: \u201cIt will be a woman.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6a1acabee78983509400b629b564dedf125623c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a1acabee78983509400b629b564dedf125623c/0_101_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Abrams, pictured with Joe Biden, in Selma, Alabama, on 1 March, indicated she would be honoured to join the ticket.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Abrams, pictured with Joe Biden, in Selma, Alabama, on 1 March, indicated she would be honoured to join the ticket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curtis Compton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abrams has arguably been the most open about her willingness to join Biden on the ticket. She met with the former vice-president in the early days of the campaign, as his advisers floated the idea of naming a running mate early.</p> <p>\u201cLeader Abrams would be honored to be asked to join the ticket,\u201d Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight, Abrams\u2019 voting rights group, said in a statement after Sunday\u2019s debate, referring to her former position in the Georgia state house.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, she is focused on leading national efforts to stop voter suppression and ensure an accurate census.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s comments ignited a new level of speculation. On Monday, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who is seen as a rising star in the Democratic party, said she did not expect to join Biden in the general election.</p> <p>Biden endorsed Whitmer during her 2018 campaign and on Monday she said she would \u201chelp him vet and make sure he\u2019s got a great running mate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not going to be me but I\u2019m going to have a hand in helping him make sure that he has got a roundabout ticket that can win,\u201d Whitmer said.</p> <p>Picking a woman cuts out contenders including Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey, and the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom mounted their own presidential campaigns.</p> <p>During Sunday\u2019s debate, Sanders was also asked about his thinking. The Vermont senator\u2019s path to the nomination is increasingly narrow but it has not closed entirely. After digressing, he said he was moving in the direction of picking a woman.</p> <p>\u201cIn all likelihood, I will,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not just nominating a woman, it is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Democratic debates in times of coronavirus make for even less interesting television than during normal times, whatever that means in the Trump era. In Sunday night\u2019s debate, Bernie Sanders had a double task. For the believers, to make a last pitch that he is the better candidate (which, in terms of the presidency, he clearly is). For the realists, his task was to push the inevitable nominee, Joe Biden, more to the left. He probably achieved neither, as Biden stole the show, by announcing (cleverly) that he will pick a female vice-presidential candidate, a progressive weak point of Sanders (who has remained unclear on this point).</p> <p>Of course, the announcement should come as little surprise, given how important women have been in the anti-Trump mobilization \u2013 the 2017 Women\u2019s March was likely the largest single-day demonstration in US history, while black and suburban women were crucial to the \u201cblue wave\u201d that brought the Democratic party the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. And there has been broad and loud disappointment that the most diverse candidate field in any US primary has ended up with just two old white men standing.</p> <p>Social media was quick to speculate and two names came up most often: Kamala Harris and Stacey Abrams. Both women would cater to not just women but also African Americans, two crucial demographics for the Democrats in November, with African American women being proclaimed the saviors of the Democratic party in the midterm elections.</p> <p>Although Harris has many merits, she also has at least two important weaknesses. First of all, she is from California, a rather unique and ultimately safe Democratic state, and her campaign does not necessarily indicate that her appeal reaches much broader. Second, she has a problematic past in terms of social justice, which also haunted her during her campaign, and could strengthen the \u201cauthoritarian\u201d image of Biden, who has a long track record of being on the wrong side of social justice issues.</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, has strengths that can help Biden in the campaign, being an African American woman from the south-east (which has several potential swing states), but could also give his presidency a crucial secondary agenda \u2013 the primary agenda being the return to relatively mainstream liberal Democratic politics.</p> <p>Abrams came to fame for her campaign for Georgia governor in 2018, which she lost against the man who oversaw the elections, Brian Kemp. While she was often described as an \u201cidentity politics candidate\u201d outside of the Peach State, this was more a reflection of the ignorance, and prejudice of the journalists than of the politics of the candidate. She actually ran on a rather moderate agenda, knowing that while Georgia was in play, it is still the south, and southerners like their Democrats moderate to conservative, if they like them at all.</p> <p>But after being defeated in a race that saw more direct and indirect voter suppression than most developing democracies, Abrams did not simply roll over and concede, Al Gore-style, but instead defiantly stated: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. This is not a speech of concession because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. But my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, Abrams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/stacey-abrams-georgia-suppression-voting-rights-campaign-democracy\">has founded an NGO</a> committed to fight voter suppression, called Fair Fight, and built a national network and profile, among others through her widely praised Democratic response to Donald Trump\u2019s 2019 State of the Nation. Within her network is a certain Mike Bloomberg, who has given $5m to her organization.</p> <p>Imagine what Abrams and Bloomberg could do for African American turnout in November, not so much by convincing them to vote, but by simply enabling them to vote, despite almost nationwide Republican attempts to suppress in particular minority votes. Together they have the expertise and resources to, first, organize a massive registration drive and, later, mobilization and transportation operation. If the Democrats want to defeat Trump in November, mobilization of the disenfranchised will be crucial.</p> <p>And imagine a vice-president devoted to making the US a real democracy \u2013 not <em>again</em>, no, for the first time in its long history. Abrams could use her office to be the driving force behind a nationwide fight against voter suppression, providing crucial coordination and resources to embattled local and state activists. Even if a Biden-Abrams administration would not do much more than that, this would be a massive step forward to a more progressive future.</p>",
  "<p>A stark contrast was on display on Sunday night, and both candidates on the Democratic debate stage knew it. Though Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were united in their criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus, they clashed repeatedly on policy issues, and even their core messages on the virus were very different.</p> <p>For Biden, coronavirus is an isolated \u201cnational emergency\u201d that needs to be dealt with before moving on to issues like poverty, minimum wages and the reform of the health insurance system. For Sanders, these issues are inextricably tied to the coronavirus emergency, because they exacerbate the suffering that comes during an epidemic. Sanders believes the spread of the virus is exposing deep systemic problems in the United States: the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/fears-mount-about-impact-coronavirus-homeless/\">homelessness crisis</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-americans-cant-afford-coronavirus-treatment-costs-2020-3\">need for single payer free-at-point-of-use healthcare</a>, the precariousness of employment and the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/15/opinion/coronavirus-bill-includes-sick-leave-not-gig-workers/\">lack of paid sick leave</a>.</p> <p>Sanders believes that coronavirus shows exactly why Medicare for All is so necessary: if Americans are having to worry about whether they have enough money to afford treatment, they won\u2019t get the care they need, and more people will be put at risk. Biden rejected the argument entirely, saying: \u201cYou have a single payer system in Italy. It doesn\u2019t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That would not solve the problem at all.\u201d Now Biden was missing the point here: single-payer does not eliminate pandemics or give the medical system infinite treatment capacity, it reduces financial hardship and makes sure people aren\u2019t going untreated who could be treated, and one <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/12/italy-coronavirus-united-states-preparedness/\">might well prefer to be in Italy than the U</a><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/12/italy-coronavirus-united-states-preparedness/\">S</a> during a large-scale medical crisis.</p> <p>But while correct on the issue, Sanders did not make a sufficiently cogent case linking the present crisis to broader systemic problems, sometimes sounding as if he was trying to shoehorn in progressive politics to an \u201capolitical\u201d crisis. That\u2019s a shame, because Sanders\u2019 policies <em>are </em>exactly what we need in an urgent moment.</p> <p>On the whole, Sanders delivered the kind of performance that he needed to at this stage, with Biden now the favorite to win the nomination. He had to deal Biden a knockout blow \u2013 to do unto Biden as Elizabeth Warren did unto Michael Bloomberg. He didn\u2019t. The exchanges between the two were often contentious. But while Sanders raised some concerns about whether Biden could inspire young voters to come to the polls in November, and had harsh words about Biden\u2019s legislative record and climate change plans, there was no \u201cgame-changing\u201d moment that exposed or humiliated Biden.</p> <p>Sanders did, however, land some punches. When Biden claimed Sanders was supported by \u201cSuper Pacs,\u201d Sanders challenged Biden to \u201cname\u201d them. Biden couldn\u2019t, probably because Sanders isn\u2019t supported by Super Pacs. In the night\u2019s most memorable exchange, Sanders went after Biden mercilessly for having long signaled his openness to cutting social security benefits. Biden was evasive, refusing to admit something <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/1239372826001408000\">that is very well-documented</a>, and Sanders wouldn\u2019t let the issue go, telling viewers to go and look up the video clips of Biden saying precisely what he claims he never said.</p> <p>But Biden, it has to be said, put in a solid performance. In order to come out ahead, he simply had to avoid losing, and he did that. Biden has had a number of embarrassing gaffes and slip-ups over the course of the campaign, that have even raised questions about <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/09/it-was-democrats-and-their-media-allies-who-impugned-bidens-cognitive-fitness-yet-now-feign-outrage/\">whether he is fit to take on Donald Trump</a>. There was none of that on Sunday night. He was prepared for most of what came at him. Whatever slip-ups there may have been were minor and were shared in equal measure by both candidates. (Biden accidentally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/1239357337531490304\">called</a> coronavirus \u201cSars\u201d while Sanders called it \u201cEbola\u201d.)</p> <p>It didn\u2019t hurt that Biden was willing to shamelessly mislead people about his own record. This is not an exaggeration: Biden claimed to have opposed the infamous bankruptcy bill he was an enthusiastic supporter of and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshorton/status/1239353989931687936\">even helped write</a>. He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1239366671732785152\">falsely claimed</a> to have been duped by George Bush into supporting the Iraq war, and fudged his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katewillett/status/1239359117757734912\">decidedly mixed record</a> on abortion rights. After the debate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was scathing about Biden\u2019s falsehoods on Twitter, saying \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1239368153496510465\">the truth matters</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But just how much it matters remains to be seen. Biden has <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/03/democrats-you-really-do-not-want-to-nominate-joe-biden\">long been slippery with the truth</a>, and pretended to have long been a progressive when he once bragged about being one of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1239359090716901376\">most conservative senators</a>. The moderators at this debate didn\u2019t seem to care, and Democratic voters don\u2019t really seem to either: current polls show Biden with a significant lead in almost all of the remaining contests. The Biden pitch is that he is the safe choice to take on Donald Trump, and all other considerations should be set aside in favor of \u201celectability\u201d. Tonight\u2019s debate reinforced that idea.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/a-biden-nomination-means-a-second-trump-term\">not clear</a> that Biden <em>is </em>the more effective candidate to take on Trump, and Democrats might be walking into another disaster like 2016 by nominating a weak establishment politician with a long record of blunders Trump can seize on. When Biden suggests that Sanders supports authoritarian regimes, and when a Biden adviser compares Sanders to the \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/natashakorecki/status/1239387880902008832\">kind of protester</a> who often shows up at campaign events\u201d, it becomes more difficult to see how Biden will convince Sanders supporters that he <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-millennials-dont-have-it-tough-780348\">empathizes</a> with them enough to be worth voting for. It is likely that with tonight\u2019s debate, Sanders lost his last shot to take Biden down. But Biden did show the many vulnerabilities that will inevitably become Trump-fodder in a general election. Democrats should take note and be warned.</p>",
  "<p>In Franz Kafka\u2019s short story <a href=\"https://www.kafka-online.info/before-the-law.html\">Before the Law</a>, a man turns up at the gates of the law. He thinks that since the law is for everyone, he has a right to gain entrance, but meets a powerful gatekeeper who tells the man he must fight him in order to get in. The man prefers not to challenge the gatekeeper. He sits patiently outside the law, spending everything he has to win him over, making polite requests to be accepted but always failing to obtain permission.</p> <p>Kafka\u2019s story is a good metaphor for thinking about the relation between law and politics. The gates to the law are in theory always open. To be inside the law means to be recognised, represented and protected by the authorities that support and enforce it. Inclusion in the law, however, also requires fighting its gatekeepers, and doing so in the awareness that there are no guarantees of success. Law, in other words, depends on politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/home-office-chief-sir-philip-rutnam-quits-over-priti-patel-bullying\">Home Office chief Sir Philip Rutnam quits over Priti Patel 'bullying'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically, the progressive left\u2019s position before the law has taken many forms including fighting its guardians, persuading them to compromise and identifying with them. But regardless of the differences of strategy, there was a shared awareness among both socialist and social-democratic movements and parties that gaining access to rights required an active struggle to challenge the status quo with a positive vision for social change. Democracy was not allegiance to a body of settled norms; it was the name of a process. With the help of that process, previously excluded groups of people - workers, women, people of colour - became subjects with rights. There was little inherently desirable or despicable about the rule of law, it was all down to whom the laws represented, and how.</p> <p>The struggle is not over, but progressives are in retreat. In the ongoing crisis of liberal democracy, only the new right seems to understand the relation between law and politics, often interpreting it in sinister ways. The right, ever more coherent in its ideology and disciplined in its organisation, is increasingly willing to challenge the guardians of the law through a relentless assault on the institutions on which the law relies to be enforced: the courts, the civil service, the press, multilateral institutions. Witness the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/home-office-chief-sir-philip-rutnam-quits-over-priti-patel-bullying\" title=\"\">resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam</a>, citing the involvement of the home secretary, Priti Patel, in a \u201cvicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d against him and his colleagues. Or the revelations of Dominic Cummings\u2019s former plans for restructuring the BBC to turn it into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/dominic-cummings-thinktank-called-for-end-of-bbc-in-current-form\">British equivalent of Fox News</a>. Or the tirade of the recently appointed attorney general Suella Braverman against the Human Rights Act, and her remarks about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/new-attorney-general-wanted-to-take-back-control-from-courts\" title=\"\">taking power back</a> from the courts.</p> <p>This is not only happening in Britain. If anything, the advance of the rightwing executive in Britain is still in its baby steps. All around the world, from Poland and Hungary to the US, from Brazil to India, the right\u2019s assault on the rule of law, the related undermining of civil servants, judges and civil society activists, its censoring of the press, are all part of a campaign to exert the executive over all other branches of the state. Its ultimate aim is to turn the law into an instrument of rightwing politics, to disempower those who would still see it as a vehicle of social emancipation. What seemed a few years ago like isolated cases of attacks on minority rights, as with Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/hungary-passes-anti-immigrant-stop-soros-laws\" title=\"\">restrict</a> NGOs\u2019 ability to assist with asylum claims or the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-roma/hungarians-march-to-protest-pm-orbans-anti-roma-campaign-idUSKCN20H0GB\" title=\"\">ongoing segregation</a> of Roma people, are now going mainstream. Think about the dramatic rise in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-first-year-voices\" title=\"\">assassinations</a> of social activists \u2013 particularly black and indigenous people \u2013 in the months following the election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil\u2019s president. Or the brutal violence to which members of Muslim communities have been subjected in India, following Narendra Modi\u2019s divisive amendments of citizenship laws.</p> <p>The right\u2019s offensive on the rule of law is not surprising. Attacking the constitution, mocking abstract human rights, discrediting universal citizenship as little more than a dangerous illusion, are familiar tropes of traditional conservative thinking: from Edmund Burke\u2019s critique of the French revolution, to Joseph De Maistre\u2019s hostility to constitutionalism, to Carl Schmitt\u2019s celebration of the power of the executive to suspend legal norms. The conservative answer to the contradictions of modern societies has always been to invoke a mythical past of cultural homogeneity, and unflinching respect for the authority of tradition.</p> <p>In contrast, the left is failing. It is failing because the mainstream left has either forgotten or failed to communicate the lessons the new right has learned from it: it has abandoned the critique of capitalism, the language of class, the need for political education. It has also abandoned all efforts at international coordination with regard to strategy, means and goals. It has turned liberal parliamentary democracy into an end in itself, while losing all nuance of what the state is for, and why we need the law.</p> <p>This is not surprising. The left is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/labour-leadership-contest-new-factions\" title=\"\">plural and divided</a>, not just on whom to fight, but also over what, and how. On the face of these divisions, it is natural to find common ground in the protection from assault of existing laws and institutions. It is even more understandable when one has helped to shape these institutions, attempting to make them more inclusive over the decades. It is easier to celebrate individual paladins of the law, such as Lady Hale or Gina Miller, than to create the collective political force required to challenge the liberal consensus.</p> <p>The right has managed to both reappropriate its tradition and renew itself by displacing its own crumbling centre. Reluctant to do the same, the left is losing. It is losing because it has divorced politics from law. Righteous outrage is no substitute for political action. If people think all politicians are corrupt, they are not going to miss them on the Today programme. If laws are widely seen as a tool in the hands of self-serving elites, nobody is going to feel sorry when judges are called traitors, or sympathise with bullied civil servants. The assault on legality will continue to have legitimacy.</p> <p>To win, we must not passively defend the rule of law, but actively change how we do politics. The challenge lies in connecting the law \u2013 an abstract, seemingly eternal body of rules \u2013 to the realm of politics, to show which rules are worth changing and which are worth fighting for.</p> <p>By the end of Kafka\u2019s story, the man who seeks entrance to the law has become a friend of the gatekeeper. As his death nears, he wonders what would have happened if he had tried to fight. When he is drawing his last breath, the guardian leaves, and the gates of the law are permanently shut. Will the left escape his fate? There is hope, but only just.</p> <p>\u2022 Lea Ypi is a professor in political theory at the London School of Economics</p>",

  "<p>The readiness is all. Ever since president John Adams rewrote a passage from <em>Henry V</em> to demonstrate how a foreign power might conspire to place a more pliable president in the White House, Shakespeare\u2019s plays have been at the heart of America\u2019s debate about itself.</p> <p>Today, with the United States more disrupted than ever, and with a make-or-break election looming, Prof Shapiro, the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/05/biography.shakespeare\" title=\"\"><em>1599: A Year in the life of William Shakespeare</em></a>, is once again right on the money. He has plunged fearlessly into the enthralling afterlife of the <em>Complete Works</em> to examine the strange and potent dialogue between Shakespeare\u2019s 400-year-old theatre and the drama of contemporary American politics.</p> <p>We think of Shakespeare as our national poet, but the truth is that, in the words of <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em>, \u201cthe bard of Stratford-on-Avon\u201d has for centuries played a pivotal role in the cultural and political life of the US \u2013 more pivotal, in fact, than we might realise.</p> <p><em>Shakespeare in a Divided America</em>, Shapiro\u2019s timely and resonant new study of this phenomenon, describes how all kinds of Americans \u2013 assassins, soldiers, hustlers, demagogues and even a few literati \u2013 have turned to Shakespeare \u201cto give voice to what could not readily or otherwise be said\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a typically American paradox that a nation that staked everything to throw off the hateful yoke of British imperial power should, within a generation of 1776, turn to an Elizabethan English playwright for wisdom and consolation, a secure narrative-line amid the confusion of nation-building.</p> <p>Shapiro concedes that this is a mystery, possibly connected to the propinquity of Shakespeare\u2019s prose to the colonists\u2019 founding obsession, the Bible. Whatever the explanation, by the mid-19th century, Shakespeare\u2019s plays had become braided into American popular consciousness, in some senses more so than in Britain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Othello was taken up as a commentary on the intractable race question, widely performed in the antebellum South</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thus it was that <em>Othello</em> was taken up as a commentary on the intractable race question, widely performed in the antebellum south, and even staged by servicemen on garrison duty in the newly annexed state of Texas in 1845. On that occasion, the part of Desdemona was played by a young and gender-fluid Ulysses S Grant, eventually the 18th president of the union.</p> <p>It was, however, president Abraham Lincoln whose fate would signal the apex of the dialogue between Shakespeare and the states\u2019 divisions. Both Lincoln and his nemesis, John Wilkes Booth, were obsessed with Shakespeare. For the president, it was all about <em>Macbeth</em>; for his assassin, <em>Julius Caesar</em>. In perhaps the finest chapter of this prescient book, Shapiro explores the enthralling backstory to 14 April 1865. This was the night at Ford\u2019s theatre in Washington DC, during a performance of a farce, <em>Our American Cousin</em>, on which the actor Booth fired the fatal shot and fled across the stage quoting Brutus, \u201cSic semper tyrannis\u201d (\u201cThus always to tyrants\u201d), which also happens to be Virginia\u2019s state motto.</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s lifelong hunger for Shakespeare had been extraordinary, and the nation\u2019s grief at his death was expressed in the official slogan of national bereavement, Shakespeare\u2019s epitaph on the murdered Duncan, who:</p> <p>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</p> <p>So clear in his great office, that his virtues</p> <p>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</p> <p>The deep damnation of his taking-off.</p> <p>Shapiro\u2019s message, which reverberates through some sparkling chapters on class, immigration and manifest destiny, is that such Shakespeare lines offered a collective catharsis \u2013 the story of an assassination refashioned as a national tragedy of Shakespearean dimensions \u2013 that allowed the US to defer, once again, its reckoning with the issue that had inspired Booth: the conviction that America, as he put it, \u201cwas formed for the white not the black man\u201d.</p> <p>History, says Marx, repeats itself as tragedy then farce. After Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017, it was not long before New York\u2019s Public Theater launched its Shakespeare-in-the-Park season with a provocative and highly transgressive production of <em>Julius Caesar</em>, giving the Roman dictator a white shirt, long red tie, and MAGA baseball cap. Equally vivid was the tyrant\u2019s bloody assassination. New Yorkers grew agog at the nightly enactment of their deepest wish. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/12/donald-trump-shakespeare-play-julius-caesar-new-york\" title=\"\">The media went mad</a>. <a href=\"https://insider.foxnews.com/2017/06/11/donald-trump-julius-caesar-stabbed-death-women-minorities-shakespeare-central-park\" title=\"\">Fox News denounced the play, at first not recognising</a> that it was a 400-year-old classic by a well-known Elizabethan playwright. And Shapiro was inspired to write this book.</p> <p>Not all of it is political, however. Shapiro\u2019s chapter on same-sex marriage is cleverly framed around a fascinating description of the making of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shakespeare-in-love\" title=\"\"><em>Shakespeare in Love</em></a>.</p> <p>The professor\u2019s final words on the contemporary American disruption offers some bleak cultural pessimism. Having noted that 91% of US high schools teach Shakespeare\u2019s plays, he declares that, nonetheless, \u201chis future seems as precarious as it has ever been. When one side no longer sees value in staging his plays, only a threat, things can unravel quickly.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve been here before. In 1642, after the outbreak of the civil war, parliament decided that \u201cpublic stage-plays shall cease\u201d. The Globe and all London\u2019s playhouses were closed, then demolished. More than 100 years would pass before Shakespeare began to attract his lasting American audience.

  "<p>Daira Garc\u00eda wakes up at 5.50am. She takes out her dog, then tries to eat some breakfast before boarding the bus that gets her to school by 7.26 in the morning.</p> <p>After class, she heads back home, where her parents, Silvia and Jorge, watch Noticiero and sip <em>mate</em> (she sometimes tries the drink as well but admits she\u2019s never quite gotten used to it). They eat something, talk. When Daira goes off to finish her homework, she forgoes the desk in her room to curl up in her parents\u2019 bed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more comfy,\u201d she quips.</p> <p>Daira, 17, has a fairly standard routine for an American teenager: school, homework, family time. But unlike most kids, the schedule she\u2019s come to rely on each day could easily be disrupted at any point.</p> <p>Silvia and Jorge traveled from Argentina to the United States as 2001 became 2002, and with a new year came their new life in an unknown country. Daira\u2019s big brother was just an infant then; now a college student, he doesn\u2019t even really remember the place where he was born. And yet he\u2019s only shielded from deportation because of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), an Obama-era program the Trump administration has been trying to end for years. <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-finally-allowed-to-drive-20191215-odow3uzmpfa5rhslnhjz2pfcjm-story.html\">Silvia and Jorge</a>, meanwhile, have no protection and could be picked up by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) at any time.</p> <p>Daira begins to cry just thinking about it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a plan for it if it happened,\u201d Silvia says in Spanish. \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t give much thought to that because we think it\u2019s healthier.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e3765fd4955ad8efe36937e4e8bd1f1a62def93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e3765fd4955ad8efe36937e4e8bd1f1a62def93/0_0_9360_3900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daira Garc\u00eda, an aspiring artist, depicts family separation.

She is a US citizen, but both her parents are undocumented.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Daira Garc\u00eda/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An estimated 4.1 million US-citizen children lived with at least one undocumented parent in recent years, according to <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/profile-us-children-unauthorized-immigrant-parents\">the Migration Policy Institute.</a> They\u2019re kids who anti-immigrant groups disparage as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lexico.com/definition/anchor_baby\">anchor babies</a>\u201d, a derogatory term that insinuates these children are little more than pawns used by their immigrant parents to get a foothold in the US and eventually become citizens themselves.</p> <p>It\u2019s a narrative trope that completely misrepresents the harsh realities of America\u2019s current immigration laws, as well as just the natural progression of life, experts suggest.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have this notion that you have a child in the United States, now you\u2019re a citizen. It\u2019s what people think because it\u2019s the easy way to explain it. So it\u2019s an easy way to make up a myth,\u201d said<a href=\"https://www.ulmer.com/attorneys/david-w-leopold/\"> David Leopold</a>, an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that children born on US soil <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/immigration-lawyer-birthright-citizenship\">have been granted citizenship</a> through the 14th amendment to the US constitution, and that a landmark supreme court decision<a href=\"https://www.scpr.org/blogs/multiamerican/2011/01/19/7987/who-was-wong-kim-ark/\"> set the precedent</a> for that right to be extended to almost all children of foreigners. But Americans can\u2019t just immediately safeguard their family members from deportation. In fact, a US citizen<a href=\"https://my.uscis.gov/exploremyoptions/us_petition_for_immediate_relative\"> must be 21 years old</a> before they can sponsor their parents for a green card. <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/i-864\">They also</a> must be able to financially support their parents.</p> <p>Now the Trump administration\u2019s new public charge rule targeting low-income immigrants is adding yet another burden.</p> <p>Parents who were not inspected and admitted into the US face even more obstacles to changing their immigration status: <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/Section245ProvisionLIFEAct_032301.pdf\">with limited exceptions</a>, they have to go abroad as part of the legalization process and then often <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/unlawful-presence-and-bars-admissibility\">aren\u2019t allowed back into the US for </a><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/unlawful-presence-and-bars-admissibility\">10 years</a>.</p> <p>Even if parents do get a green card, they have a five-year holding period before they can finally apply for naturalization.</p> <p>In the end, the so-called \u201canchor baby\u201d pathway to citizenship is at least a 26-year endeavor, even for those who entered the US legally.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to think that that\u2019s some sort of a tactic that people use to come here, get citizenship, \u2019cause it just isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Leopold. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth, and it\u2019s a specious talking point.\u201d</p> <p>A talking point that\u2019s popular among anti-immigrant groups, pundits and the Republican party.</p> <p>The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called birthright citizenship \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2010/07/graham-eyes-birthright-citizenship-040395#ixzz0v5pFRNr4\">a mistake</a>\u201d and argued that immigrants come to the US to \u201cdrop a child\u201d. Graham\u2019s former colleague the California<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-may-26-la-oe-rutten-20100526-story.html\"> congressman Duncan Hunter</a> even advocated for deporting the US-citizen children of undocumented immigrants. Congressman <a href=\"https://steveking.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/king-s-effort-to-end-birthright-citizenship-for-illegals-advanced-by\">Steve King</a> has continually introduced legislation challenging these kids\u2019 right to citizenship.</p> <p>When Donald Trump launched his campaign for the 2016 presidential election, his signature policy agenda around immigration often leaned into the \u201canchor baby\u201d fallacy. Part of his platform included<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/17/432605103/whats-in-donald-trumps-immigration-plan\"> ending birthright citizenship</a> for the children of undocumented immigrants, and Trump called for deporting such families.</p> <p>Since becoming commander-in-chief, Trump<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-trump.html\"> has continued to hint</a> at an impending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-14th-amendment\">crackdown on birthright citizenship</a>, and in January,<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/22/21077547/state-department-pregnant-women-birth-tourism-policy\"> the administration made it more difficult</a> for pregnant people to get short-term visas. Meanwhile, officials at the border aren\u2019t allowing pregnant asylum seekers to attend their court hearings, and an attorney said it was so they wouldn\u2019t give birth to a US citizen, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/23/808536155/pregnant-asylum-seekers-barred-from-u-s-entry-for-court-hearings\">KPBS</a> reported.</p> <p>As the 2020 presidential election heats up, Trump will probably use birthright citizenship to rile his supporters, Leopold suggested.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s red meat for the Trump base,\u201d he said.</p> <p>During the last election, Trump repeated the words \u201canchor baby\u201d gratuitously on the campaign trail, giving the phrase even more air. When a reporter pointed out that the term was hurtful and offensive, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-ill-word-anchor-baby-33201519\">Trump rebuffed</a> him: \u201cYou mean it\u2019s not politically correct? And yet everybody uses it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/trump-family-separations-children-torture-psychology\">Trump's separation of families constitutes torture, doctors find</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just two decades ago, no one used it \u2013 at least not publicly. In the book <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=28631\">Anchor Babies and the Challenge of Birthright Citizenship</a>, the anthropologist Leo Chavez tracked the term\u2019s appearance in both coasts\u2019 papers of record, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnchor babies\u201d never cropped up until the early 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cThat practice of targeting people who really are members of your society historically and legally and marking them as different allows you to do incredibly awful things to them,\u201d Chavez said. They suffered psychological terror caused by the same fears that their families experienced, he said.</p> <p>For 17 years, Daira hasn\u2019t been able to keep Silvia and Jorge safe just by being a US citizen. Nor did they ever expect that she would.</p> <p>\u201cIt was never the idea to come to the US to have a child,\u201d Silvia said. After she, Jorge, and their one-year-old son arrived in Long Island, she tried to get birth control, but the complicated US medical system delayed that process. In the meantime, life happened.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I became pregnant with her,\u201d Silvia said, \u201cat first the world fell apart for me, because we were in another country where the situation wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d</p> <p>The family can laugh about it now, maybe because they\u2019ve hustled and come out on the other side. It wasn\u2019t easy. In a corner of the country known for abnormally high rents, they\u2019ve spent practically all their lives in other people\u2019s basements. Silvia worked night shifts at odd jobs. When Jorge finally found work that wasn\u2019t just temporary, he tended to hold on to the role for years.</p> <p>These days, Daira takes art classes and wants to study illustration. Silvia is \u201cretired to march\u201d, she jokes; <a href=\"https://time.com/5670018/daca-rescinded-dreamers/\">after Trump rescinded</a> Daca and the courts took up the issue, she became an activist fighting to protect young people like her son. Jorge just got his driver\u2019s license after successfully advocating on the frontlines for all New Yorkers\u2019 rights to drive legally regardless of their immigration status. Daira\u2019s happy about that; it\u2019s \u201cmore secure\u201d, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing all the positive things that we think are strong American values that we would really like to have here, but we don\u2019t give them the opportunity to put that into practice,\u201d said Chavez. \u201cWhat we do is take their kids and call them names.\u201d</p>",

Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus dominated the debate, with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders offering different visions for how to combat the crisis. </strong>After the pair bumped elbows to greet each other, Biden described the coronavirus crisis as an \u201call hands on deck\u201d situation that required immediate steps to protect vulnerable communities, while Sanders said the pandemic underscored the need for an overhaul of the US healthcare system to protect all Americans. The contrast reflected one of the key questions in the primary race: should the country focus on immediate, short-term results or broad, structural change?</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden pledged to choose a woman as his running mate. </strong>Sanders would not explicitly commit to selecting a woman running mate but said, \u201cIn all likelihood, I will.\u201d Biden\u2019s pledge could help to reassure Democrats who are disappointed that the party\u2019s historically diverse field has narrowed down to two white men in their late 70\u2019s.</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden avoided a complete debacle, which Sanders needed to change the direction of the race. </strong>Biden did stumble at times, but considering his significant delegate lead, Sanders needed his opponent to have a terrible night if he wanted any chance at turning the tide of the race. Biden managed to avoid that catastrophe.</li> \n   <li><strong>The debate was surprisingly combative considering the current crisis. </strong>Many commentators had predicted the night would be relatively tame as the candidates focused on the health crisis gripping the country. However, Sanders went after Biden for his refusal to disavow super PACs and his past comments on Social Security, and Biden returned the favor by criticizing Sanders for his record on gun control and his recent praise of <strong>Fidel Castro.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Tonight made the case for holding debates without live audiences. </strong>The debate was conducted without a live audience or a media spinroom because of coronavirus, and a number of commentators said it was a welcome change from past debates. It\u2019s possible the practice could be replicated with general election debates.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks for following our live debate coverage tonight, and our US politics live blog will return tomorrow morning.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">Biden and Sanders confront coronavirus crisis in first one-on-one debate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6eeee88f088d7575593f95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T03:16:07.689Z\">3.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anita Dunn, </strong>a senior adviser to <strong>Joe Biden, </strong>compared <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>to the average protester who shows up at Biden\u2019s events in a post-debate call with reporters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KThomasDC/status/1239386937741508610\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Biden sr. adv.

  "<h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018Sanders was too gentle on Biden\u2019</h2> <p>Throughout this primary, I\u2019ve heard supporters of other candidates complain about Bernie Sanders\u2019 tendency to raise his voice. Where the hell was that yelling Bernie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">on Sunday night</a>? His tendency to try to keep an undignified process dignified and his discomfort with going for Joe Biden\u2019s throat were on clear display. If Biden wins the nomination, he\u2019s going to have to debate the least classy man ever to appear in World Wrestling Entertainment. Bernie would have been doing us \u2013 and frankly, Joe as well \u2013 a favor by channeling <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/stone-cold-steve-austin-gives-a-nsfw-defense-of-gay-m-1566573678\">gay rights king</a> Stone Cold Steve Austin and pinning Biden on issues like how the 2008 bank bailout was disastrous for homeowners, or how his warmongering has stuck us in an endless war, or how the Violence Against Women Act that he loves to brag about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-violence-against-women-act-is-unlikely-to-reduce-intimate-partner-violence-heres-why-103734\">did basically nothing</a> to prevent violence in relationships.</p> <p>For a while, I felt like I was watching a Beckett play, with two old men on stage talking about totally different realities, talking past one another as if they did not even exist within the same space and time. Here was Bernie Sanders, acknowledging how our flawed and deteriorated health system could enable coronavirus to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. And here was Biden, convinced he was in Independence Day, saying the coronavirus \u201cis like we\u2019re being attacked from abroad\u201d \u2013 although a bunch of people getting sick because the government is too timid to ask people not to go to <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus\">a goddamn St Patrick\u2019s Day bar crawl</a> is not exactly an alien invasion. He talked about sending the military in to deal with it, as if it were a foreign country of brown people, with oil reserves.</p> <p>Once again the moderators may as well not have existed. Jake Tapper, looking weirdly waxy and like his makeup person had dumped a bottle of 1985 Cover Girl foundation on his face and smeared it around a little, couldn\u2019t even be bothered to step in when a squabble arose about whether or not Biden had made statements about cutting social security on the floor of the Senate. He was just sitting there! Couldn\u2019t he have pulled out his phone and gone \u201cto the YouTube\u201d, as Sanders implored, to factcheck that one?</p> <p>The division between Sanders and Biden is clearer than ever. Sanders wants lasting change, Biden wants to respond to everything as if it were a \u201ccrisis\u201d and keep things pretty much the same. But Sanders wasted the opportunity tonight to take his opponent out, and Biden managed to get through an entire conversation without glitching and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/13/media_attempts_to_spin_bidens_tirade_into_a_triumph.html\">threatening to punch someone</a> in the face.

Unless the government immediately begins providing a universal basic income and places a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, vehicle repossessions and utility disconnects, we will not be able to flatten the pandemic curve and save potentially millions of lives.

We are facing down a pandemic that could kill more than a million Americans. A great many of us are self-isolating at home, made even more anxious by the fact that our current government has totally botched the coronavirus response, putting us all at tremendous and unnecessary risk. We don\u2019t have the most basic faith that, despite living in one of the most prosperous societies in the history of the world, our leaders will keep us safe.

Biden could have acted like the gracious and venerable leader he tells us he would be.

  "<p>This is no time for presidential debates and wild promises from the candidates. It\u2019s also no time for presidential tweets and wild promises from the incumbent.</p> <p>The split screen of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">Sunday\u2019s debate</a> was not between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders; it was between the cold hard reality of a global pandemic and the cold dead arguments about negative TV ads.</p> <p>There is only one issue in front of American voters, and it is the reason they are emptying supermarket shelves and wondering how they will pay their bills this month and next.</p> <p>That issue is not about past votes in the Senate, who supported the war in Iraq, or how to unite the Democratic party. It\u2019s about how to survive the health and financial disaster that lies ahead.</p> <p>On that issue, Biden and Sanders were even further apart than their socially distanced podiums on CNN\u2019s debate set.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to the pandemic was a glimpse into what Obama\u2019s staffers called the shit sandwich they were handed by their predecessors: notably the financial collapse and great recession of 2009. Not to mention the swine flu pandemic and the Ebola crisis.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 reaction was a critique of the system, a big picture view of the structural reforms needed for long-term change: from campaign finance reform to a nationalized healthcare system.</p> <p>Biden spoke like a man who had worked in the Situation Room to marshal the forces of the federal government. Sanders spoke like a man who wanted to build a new federal government.</p> <p>\u201cThis is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people,\u201d said the former vice-president. That meant widespread testing, deploying the military to set up hundreds of temporary hospital beds, and rapid economic support for the whole country.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders sounded less interested in waging war on the coronavirus, and more determined to wage war on the political system.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear this crisis is only making a bad situation worse,\u201d said the Vermont senator. \u201cIn a good year, without the epidemic, we\u2019re losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don\u2019t get to a doctor on time.\u201d</p> <p>This was a strangely obtuse debate between two disputatious old men. Quite apart from the urgent need to talk about the pandemic, their own argument has already been resolved by the voters who gave Joe Biden a wide delegate lead over the last few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cAs much as we can, we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you,\u201d said CNN\u2019s moderator, Jake Tapper, as he kicked off the debate.</p> <p>If they were genuine, CNN\u2019s hopes were dashed within minutes.</p> <p>Biden knew that Sanders would turn the coronavirus conversation towards his favorite topic of a socialized healthcare system known as Medicare for All. So Biden pointed out early and often that Italy\u2019s socialized system had not stopped the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWith all due respect to Medicare for All, you have a single-payer system in Italy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That would not solve the problem at all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/who-won-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-debate\">Who won the Biden-Sanders debate?

And it counts for even less when Biden has all but won the nomination already.</p> <p>Sanders tried to make the case that Biden was propped up by big money and the party establishment. \u201cYou need to take on Wall Street. You need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t take campaign contributions from them. You take them on and create an economy that works for all.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s response amounted to turning his pockets inside out. \u201cBernie\u2019s implication is somehow I am being funded by millionaires,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last Super Tuesday and before that, Bernie outspent me two, three, four, five, six-to-one. I didn\u2019t have any money, and I still won.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear: both the surviving Democratic candidates sounded more pandemically plausible than a president who was still tweeting yesterday about Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239204333851488266\">emails</a>, his former national security adviser (who pleaded <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239242219019735042\">guilty</a> to lying to the FBI), and the Senate Democratic leader\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239237382458806277\">comments</a> about the US supreme court.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if Donald Trump spends his days trying to distract the nation from the fact that he is fundamentally useless at his job.</p> <p>In the meantime, both the septuagenarian candidates face a more pressing challenge: keeping clear of the virus that appears to be most life-threatening to people of their own age group.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very careful about the people I\u2019m interacting with,\u201d Sanders said, ignoring the question about his recent heart attack. \u201cI\u2019m using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell fortunately I don\u2019t have any of the underlying conditions you talked about and have to worry about,\u201d observed Biden, swiping at his slightly older rival, while also saying he was washing his hands all day.</p> <p>It was that kind of night: a desperately personal debate about all the small stuff we used to care about, and a desperately small debate about all the personal stuff we currently obsess about.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders auditioned in real time for the job of president on Sunday night during the first one-on-one debate of the Democratic primary, as the world confronts the growing threat of the coronavirus pandemic and American public health officials warned the worst is yet to come.</p> \n<p>The fast-escalating national emergency dominated the prime-time encounter between two candidates with starkly different visions for the country. Yet Biden and Sanders vigorously agreed on the need for a much more aggressive government response to the virus, which had already <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">resulted in</a> 3,244 confirmed cases in the US, with 62 reported deaths, as of Sunday night.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is bigger than any one of us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis calls for a national rallying for one another.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden, who has presented himself as a pragmatic standard-bearer, compared the battle against the disease to a war, calling for a whole-of-government strategy that includes deploying the the military and enacting a \u201cmulti-multi-billion-dollar program<em>\u201d </em>to address the public health and economic crises.</p> \n<p>Sanders, a democratic socialist, urged sweeping economic reforms and the creation of a single-payer healthcare system. He said the pandemic had revealed \u201cthe dysfunctionality\u201d of the country\u2019s patchwork healthcare system, arguing that the adoption of a Medicare for All-style system like the one he has championed would help mitigate the toll of future pandemics.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the reasons that we are unprepared, and have been unprepared, is we don\u2019t have a system,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people in a good year, without the epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Biden said a single-payer healthcare system was not the solution, pointing to Italy, where the outbreak has overwhelmed the country\u2019s national health services.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are looking for results, not a revolution,\u201d Biden said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a381fa53-24c1-46a8-a648-7710acb74a3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K30TgRppDzg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Where there was consensus was in their denunciation of Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak and his ability to lead the nation through a time of crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, the first thing we have got to do, whether or not I\u2019m president, is to shut this president up right now,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the debate, which Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239383648018804739\">deemed</a> \u201cVERY boring\u201d, his campaign operation accused the candidates of \u201cplagiarizing\u201d the president\u2019s response to coronavirus, which it described as \u201ca model for all future pandemics\u201d.</p> \n<p>At a press conference from the White House on Sunday afternoon, Trump urged Americans to \u201crelax\u201d and refrain from hoarding food.

In a statement, Sanders said the plan did not go far enough.</p> \n<p>The candidates sought to strike a delicate balance between debating the issues and addressing the urgent health crisis.

On Twitter, the theatre announced \u201cwe do not believe that it is practical or responsible for us to stage shows while people\u2019s lives are at risk\u201d. The Arcola explained that the majority of its income comes from theatregoers and called for donations to ensure that it \u201cstays thriving, long after this crisis is past\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The Turbine theatre, which opened at Battersea Power Station last summer, has cancelled all performances until 18 April. The Bunker, which is housed in a former underground car park in London Bridge, has cancelled a week of performances which featured almost 100 artists and was due to start on Monday. \u201cThis is not a decision taken lightly,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have spent months organising this week; at the last count we had 94 people involved in our week and to have to cancel the day before we begin is soul destroying. But we have to put our artists\u2019 safety first.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Saturday, the Young Vic cancelled two performances of Nora: A Doll\u2019s House due to a member of the company self-isolating as a precaution.

There could also be a shift to household isolation rather than individual self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, a new-born baby in England who has tested positive for coronavirus is likely to be one of the world\u2019s youngest patients with the disease. The infant and its mother both tested positive at a north London hospital and staff who had contact with them have been advised to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>The developments come as the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19 has been called into question.</p> \n  <p>But Hancock denied that achieving herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s policy.
