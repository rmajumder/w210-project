  "<p>The Trump administration continued to weaken core environmental protections in the US by announcing a pair of policies to cut reviews for large infrastructure projects and downplay the health benefits of rules to curb pollution.</p> <p>Both changes could disproportionately hurt communities of color, which are far more likely to live with pollution because of decades of environmental racism. They come after a week of nationwide protests over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">police killings</a> of black Americans.&nbsp;</p> <p>The proposals could also make it easier for the government to ignore the climate crisis in making decisions.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the policies came as an executive order from Donald Trump instructing agencies to use emergency authorities to bypass bedrock environmental laws and speed federal approvals for highways and oil and gas pipelines. The order said it is meant to accelerate the recovery from the \u201cdramatic downturn\u201d in the economy and high unemployment from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of this and other developments, I have determined that, without intervention, the United States faces the likelihood of a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistent high unemployment,\u201d the order said.</p> <p>\u201cA public health crisis is not an excuse to drill, mine and pave our public lands, and the American people won\u2019t fall for it,\u201d said Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director of the Center for Western Priorities. \u201cThis order will almost certainly increase environmental injustice across America..\u201d</p> <p>Research and history clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/our-unequal-earth\">demonstrate</a> that pollution, ecological hazards and climate disasters have the worst impacts on people of color, indigenous Americans and the poor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Critics immediately questioned Trump\u2019s authority to implement the executive order, which aims to override the normal procedures under laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act.</p> <p>Joel Mintz, a former EPA enforcement and supervisory attorney, said: \u201cIt is far from clear that the president has the legal authority to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, on Thursday also proposed new guidelines for how the agency weighs the costs that a regulation places on an industry and its customers versus the health benefits it provides to the public.</p> <p>The proposal applies to rules under the Clean Air Act. Wheeler said the agency intends to complete similar proposals for water, land and chemical rules within the next three years.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agency typically takes into account all the benefits of a regulation, even if they are unintentional. For example, a rule targeting mercury from coal plants also reduced particle pollution, as well as carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. In deciding whether the rule was necessary, the agency tallied all the benefits of each reduction and stacked them up against the costs the industry would incur.</p> <p>Wheeler said the agency will still calculate and consider those co-benefits but will not use them to justify future regulations.</p> <p>Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies \u2013 which represents state and local air regulators \u2013 said that as described by Wheeler, \u201cthe rule cuts out the most important factor to consider when the agency is trying to decide whether an action protecting public health is worth it, which is public health.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to decide whether to quit smoking based only on the price of a pack of cigarettes.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>American military force shaped the modern era. Sometimes it overthrew tyrannies and made the world safe, as in 1940s Europe. At other times it has made the world more dangerous, as in Vietnam and Iraq. In the civil war of the 1860s, the military preserved the Union at terrible but necessary cost. Since then, with a handful of exceptions and then mostly only at the request of state governors, the US military has been kept well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-can-trump-deploy-federal-troops-onto-the-streets-in-the-us\" title=\"\">out of domestic politics</a>. America fiercely celebrates its military, but its laws place firm restrictions on military action within the United States itself.</p> \n<p>There is an overwhelmingly good reason for this caution. Military force, whether embodied in martial law or through the lethal power of arms and force, is incompatible with constitutional democracy, rights and justice. Poland discovered that in 1981. So did the democracy activists of China at Tiananmen Square in 1989. The people of countries like Egypt, Turkey, Thailand and Pakistan, where martial law has been common, know better than most what military rule entails. Lest there be any British smugness, remember also Northern Ireland, where the arrival of British troops in 1969 became as much the source of the nearly 40-year Troubles as their solution, especially after the Bloody Sunday shootings of civilians.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump is now actively agitating to dispatch American armed forces to crush protests on American soil. Whether he goes through with that threat depends on whether the protests, triggered by the police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis, continue at the level experienced in dozens of US cities during the past week. There are significant signs that the peak of the worldwide protests may have passed for now. But Mr Trump is in the provocation business. He thinks America\u2019s racial divisions may help his re-election campaign, badly damaged by his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nothing can be ruled out with this president.</p> \n<p>In Washington this week, Mr Trump gave Americans a taste of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/donald-trump-coronavirus-george-floyd-normalized\" title=\"\">what he may do</a>. Because he has more powers in the District of Columbia than in the states, Mr Trump mobilised military police, the 82nd Airborne Division, an army Black Hawk helicopter, and perhaps more shadowy groups, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\" title=\"\">shows of force</a> in the capital city. Having described the unrest, the majority of which has been peaceful, as domestic terror and promised to use \u201cthousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers\u201d, his forces used teargas to clear peaceful protesters from outside the White House. Then, accompanied by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, dressed in battle fatigues, Mr Trump staged a bible-waving photo opportunity.</p> \n<p>These posturings were so shocking that they sparked a rare political backlash within the military and beyond. The defence secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\" title=\"\">Mark Esper</a>, who had earlier called US cities a \u201cbattlespace\u201d, backed away from using force. His predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\" title=\"\">James Mattis</a> said Mr Trump was the first president in his lifetime who was a divider, not a uniter. Gen Milley, who three years ago expressed support for \u201cdisciplined disobedience\u201d for the sake of a \u201chigher purpose\u201d, issued an order to uphold equality, freedom of speech and the right to dignity. In the past, Trump aides have stayed shamefully silent. This may mark an overdue change.</p> \n<p>Mr Trump is infatuated with military and political <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/world/americas/trump-strongman-george-floyd.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">strongmen</a>. He sides with authoritarians like Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and Rodrigo Duterte. He supported the Tiananmen repression. He goes out of his way to praise violent military officers. Though he evaded military service himself, he has a fetish about the forces. Early in the pandemic he egged on armed movements that protested against social distancing. It may seem incredible that a president might seek the killing of his own people for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/the-us-would-condemn-other-countries-who-acted-this-way-what-a-sad-state-of-affairs\" title=\"\">political advantage</a>. But as he battles to retain power, military officials and Republican candidates, as well as voters and foreign governments, will all have to decide which side they are on.</p>",

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has not yet received the results of his coronavirus test, the PM\u2019s spokesman said.</strong> Sharma was tested after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/business-secretary-alok-sharma-coronavirus-test-speech-commons\">falling ill while delivering a speech to MPs from the dispatch box in the Commons yesterday.</a> The spokesman said that, if Sharma did test positive, he would work with the government\u2019s new test and trace system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman played down the likelihood of Boris Johnson being asked to self-isolate if Sharma does test positive - even though the two men attended a meeting together yesterday - but did not rule it out</strong>. The 45-minute meeting, which was also attended by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, took place in the cabinet room at No 10. The spokesman said that the meeting, like all meetings at No 10, was \u201cproperly socially distanced\u201d and that the participants stayed more than 2 metres apart. The spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus\">the test and trace guidance </a>was \u201cnot as simple as saying if you have been in a room with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you are required to self-isolate\u201d. People have to self-isolate if they have had face-to-face contact, at a distance of less than 1 metre, with someone who tests positive, or if they have spent more than 15 minutes within two metres of that person. But the spokesman did not go as far as saying that he was confident that Johnson would not be asked to self-isolate if Sharma tested positive. Asked if Johnson would comply if he were asked to self-isolate, the spokesman said: \u201cWe would follow the advice given by the medical experts.\u201d The spokesman also said that the cabinet room was \u201cvigorously cleaned\u201d yesterday, but that that was usual practice and happened every day.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street is not reconsidering the government\u2019s move to abandon virtual sittings of the House of Commons in the light of Sharma\u2019s illness, the spokesman said.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to deny a report on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last night saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac#block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac\">Johnson told his Italian counterpart on 13 March that he wanted \u201cherd immunity\u201d.</a></strong> Asked about the report, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that herd immunity has never been its policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman did not deny that Johnson had said the words attributed to him in the programme and, when asked if he was willing to clarify this directly with the PM, he suggested there was no need because he had made the position clear.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said 171,829 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.</strong> But the government had the capacity to carry out 220,213, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-tens-thousands-covid-19-tests-voided-decision-send/\">the Telegraph story (paywall)</a> saying that tens of thousands of coronavirus tests were returned void after being sent to a US laboratory for analysis.</strong> He said 67,000 tests had been sent to the US, and 29,500 were returned void.

He said in total 4.2m tests had been carried out.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/exclusive-hairdressers-could-reopen-month-plans-barbers-stylists/\"> a Telegraph report (paywall) </a>claiming hairdressers in England could be allowed to open as early as 15 June.</strong> He said the ambition was to reopen them from July at the earliest.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman did not challenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/03/two-in-five-schools-in-england-yet-to-reopen-to-any-more-pupils\">a Guardian report</a> saying that in some areas up to 90% of primary schools remained closed this week, even though schools in England are meant to be reopening for some year groups.</strong> One survey suggests 44% of English primaries remained closed. The spokesman said that what happened this week was \u201cbroadly ... in line with expectations\u201d and that \u201cwe expect that attendance will grow over time\u201d. He said official attendance figures would be published next week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government has ruled out running the school meal voucher system in England over the summer holidays.</strong> But there will be a \u00a39m programme offering some pupils activities and meals, said the spokesman, who also hinted it might be expanded.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government did not agree with the suggestion from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, that the Covid-19 virus was man-made.</strong> Dearlove made the claim <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/\">in an interview with the Telegraph.</a> \u201cWe have seen no evidence that the virus is man-made,\u201d the spokesman said.

In an email to constituents sent out on Thursday 28 May, after Durham police gave their view, he adopted a tone that was very different from the one taken by Braverman a few days earlier.

That may be because some politicians are calculating that what the public really wants most at the end of all this is not change, but something approximating to what life was like before. Boris Johnson has said nothing at all about how the crisis could be a catalyst for progressive change.

The question today is whether it will be expanded or whether the central bank will hold fire until July.<br></p> <p>Many analysts expect the ECB to up buying by \u20ac500bn, as purchases at their current rate are expected to run out by October. <br></p> <p> <strong>Derek Halpenny</strong>, head of research at <strong>MUFG</strong>, an investment bank, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We think today is the day in which the ECB needs to reinforce the perception of European authorities finally getting to grips with the scale of the Covid-19 hit with further QE action.</p> <p> A failure to act today would imply consideration is being given to only running the program until September which would result in considerable anxiety amongst investorsthat would result in an immediatetightening of financial market conditions. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Seema Shah, </strong>chief strategist at <strong>Principal Global Investors</strong>, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the ECB only having spent a third of the \u20ac750bn [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme], anything less than a \u20ac500bn expansion will be a disappointment and could undo the recent weeks of market strength. Although equity markets seem to believe a V-shaped economic recovery is underway, the reality is that the euro area economy continues to struggle under the weight of the coronavirus crisis and the ECB cannot afford to delay additional stimulus. </p> </blockquote> <p>Focus is also on whether the bank will expand purchases to include \u201cfallen angels\u201d - companies that have lost their investment-grade ratings during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>That would give the ECB more room for manoeuvre and help parts of the economy that might need it more.<br></p> <h2>Thoughts on the eurozone\u2019s fiscal stimulus<br></h2> <p>The EU is wending its way towards a recovery fund to pull together governments across the bloc into a massive fiscal stimulus. But with sensitivities around the politics of risk sharing (opposed by some northern European countries), Lagarde has a delicate balance to strike.<br></p> <p><strong>Commerzbank </strong>told clients that the desire to keep pressure up on governments could lead to the ECB delaying its QE announcement:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will be a very close call with the hawks potentially swaying a consensus-minded President Lagarde to defer the announcement, also to keep pressure on the politicians to deliver on the EU Commission\u2019s \u20ac750bn Next Generation EU Fund. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Donovan</strong>, an analyst at investment bank <strong>UBS</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB President Lagarde will be happy that someone is doing fiscal stimulus (as the pandemic is a problem for fiscal policy, not central bank policy). Today\u2019s meeting should continue to emphasise the need for quantitative policy to support financial markets and ensure sufficient liquidity in the economy. <br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Updated economic forecasts</h2> <p>Everyone and their dog knows that the eurozone economy is in recession, but the question is how deep is it. </p> <p>Lagarde has already dismissed the \u201cmild\u201d scenario of a 5% fall in output this year. That leaves a decline of between 8% and 12% in GDP - twice as deep as after the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>If inflation forecasts are also weak that would support the case for more stimulus from the ECB.<br></p> <h2>The German court ruling</h2> <p>Looming over the ECB\u2019s bond purchases is the German constitutional court ruling that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\">may have exceeded its mandate</a> by directly financing government spending. The Karlsruhe court said the ECB must carry out a \u201cproportionality assessment\u201d within three months in its 5 May ruling.<br></p> <p>Lagarde has insisted the ruling will leave the bank \u201cundeterred\u201d in battling the crisis. Acting now could make it less likely that any support is withdrawn at a later date.<br></p> <p>Principal\u2019s Shah said:<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Close attention will also be paid to any hints that that last month\u2019s German Constitutional Court ruling will tie the ECB\u2019s hands in future, with the euro\u2019s longest winning streak in six years at risk.

Most have been released after several hours, though many have been badly beaten, stripped, threatened or otherwise mistreated.</p> <p>Authorities in&nbsp;Zimbabwe&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;suggest such incidents&nbsp;have been staged&nbsp;to discredit the government,&nbsp;often with the alleged involvement of some outside power.</p> <p>Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power as president after the fall of Robert Mugabe in 2017, was last year accused by Amnesty International of a ruthless systematic crackdown on human rights.</p> <p>Allegations that unidentified third parties were undermining authorities were a staple under Mugabe, who ruled for 37 years and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-obituary\">died last year</a>&nbsp;in a clinic in Singapore.</p> <p>The Zimbabwe human rights commission <a href=\"https://news.pindula.co.zw/2020/05/19/full-text-zimbabwe-hualeman-rights-commission-statement-on-the-abduction-of-mdc-alliance-officials/shortly\">said </a><a href=\"https://news.pindula.co.zw/2020/05/19/full-text-zimbabwe-hualeman-rights-commission-statement-on-the-abduction-of-mdc-alliance-officials/shortly\">its preliminary investigation</a> had established serious abuses of the women. One of the three, Cecilia Chimbiri, 33, told the Guardian they had been taken to a remote, wooded area where they were beaten, stripped naked, sexually assaulted with firearms and forced to drink each other\u2019s urine.</p> <p>\u201cThey beat me on my back, all over the body using sticks. They used a gun to beat us, then molested me,\u201d Chimbiri said.</p> <p>\u201cThey pushed us out of the truck on to the road. They left us there. They said \u2018we will be watching you \u2026 What is so special about you that you want to turn against the government?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another of the women, Joana Mamombe, one of Zimbabwe\u2019s youngest MPs, described being forced to march and sing protest songs.</p> <p>\u201cThey were pouring water on us. They beat us if we stopped. They made us drink each other\u2019s urine. They were fondling Cecilia,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/daddyhope/status/1261315319001423873\">Mamombe, </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/daddyhope/status/1261315319001423873\">26, told reporters</a>&nbsp;at a private Harare hospital&nbsp;</p> <p>Public discontent has grown with Mnangagwa, who has struggled to fulfil promises of economic prosperity and greater political freedom.

  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On Wednesday\u2019s Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened with news that Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">elevated charges against police officer Derek Chauvin</a>, who is charged with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">kill</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">ing George Floyd</a> last week by kneeling on his neck for over eight minutes. Ellison elevated Chauvin\u2019s charges to second-degree murder and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">added charges of aiding and abetting murder</a> to the other three officers on the scene. \u201cSo, activism works. Justice is possible \u2013 easy, peasy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/04/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-live-news-updates-donald-trump\">hold protests for nine days straight</a> in 80 American cities squeezy,\u201d said Colbert.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHMRej5YjwA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KHMRej5YjwA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s recent conduct recalled for Colbert the night he was elected, when the host was \u201csomewhat emotional\u201d because \u201cwhat I was worried about deep down is that Trump is a dictator fanboy. He is a lifetime subscriber to \u2018Tiger Beat down the protesters\u2019. And now we\u2019re teetering dangerously close to Trump making his dreams our nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert referred to Trump\u2019s \u201cfascist photo op\u201d on Monday, when he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-st-johns-church-bible.html\">ordered non-violent protesters removed</a> from the area in front of St John\u2019s church in DC with flash grenades and teargas so Trump could take a picture holding a Bible. \u201cIt was like a little Tiananmen Square, or in Trump\u2019s case, Tiny Man Square,\u201d said Colbert. Trump reportedly \u201cwent medieval on the protesters in part because he was upset \u2013 humiliated, really \u2013 about the TV people revealing that he hid in a bunker over the weekend\u201d, reports which Trump attempted to dismiss of Fox News radio as \u201cfalse\u201d because he was there for a \u201ctiny, little, short period of time \u2026 for an inspection\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/03/seth-meyers-on-trump-the-worst-case-scenario-is-here\">Seth Meyers on Trump: 'The worst-case scenario is here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is an all-time great excuse,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cSo he was just checking to make sure the bunker was OK \u2013 \u2018I didn\u2019t poop my pants, I just ran diagnostics on my boxers to see if they were load-bearing. They are.\u201d</p> <p>Even worse, Trump\u2019s pap walk to the photo op was accompanied by the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milly. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of American democracy is the US armed forces\u2019 proud tradition of remaining out of politics to emphasize civilian control of the military, yet on the way to the photo-op \u2013 that was, yet again, preceded by attacking peaceful protesters \u2013 Esper and Milly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/esper-insurrection-act-protests/index.html\">walked with Trump</a> across the street,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cIt reminds me of the old joke: why did the defense secretary and the chairman of the joint chiefs cross the road? Because the president is a chicken.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Esper defended the farcical promenade by telling reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was going.\u201d Colbert would have none of it: \u201cYou\u2019re the secretary of defense, and your defense is that you didn\u2019t know where you were going? The rest of us could see exactly where you were going.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert also lamented displays of unnecessary force by police across the country, such as those dressed in riot gear on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and large, armored military vehicles driven down the streets of the capital. \u201cSecretary Esper, do you see where we\u2019re going now?\u201d Colbert said of the vehicles. \u201cIt\u2019s so close you don\u2019t need a ride \u2013 you could walk. Although, really, more of a goosestep.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPuN0h_bDUI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DPuN0h_bDUI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe whole world has been watching and weighing in,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel of the nine days of nationwide protests against anti-black racism and police brutality in America. Even China\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/world/asia/china-george-floyd.html\">released a statement</a> saying it hoped America would \u201ctake concrete measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination\u201d. \u201cAnd when China is giving you a lecture on human rights \u2013 not a great sign,\u201d said Kimmel.</p> <p>Kimmel also lambasted Trump\u2019s Bible photo op from Monday, which White House press secretary and \u201cbusiness suit Barbie\u201d Kayleigh McEnany insisted on Wednesday was not a photo op despite basically telling reporters it was a photo op. \u201cLet\u2019s review the facts here,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cHe walked to the church. He stood in front of the church. He never went in the church. Never spoke to anyone from the church, didn\u2019t examine the damage to the church, held a Bible upside down, didn\u2019t read from the Bible, didn\u2019t give a speech, posed for photos and left.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that sounds like a pretty textbook definition of a photo op to me.

  "<p>Donald Trump wants to be nominated by a Republican national convention with all the trappings of a normal, packed event: the thronging crowds, the balloon drop, the scores of sideshow events. Meanwhile, former vice-president Joe Biden and senior Democratic officials are strongly considering a partially or completely virtual convention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/joe-biden-george-floyd-protests\">Can Joe Biden convince protesters he would be a 'transformational' president?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a stark illustration of how the two men \u2013 and their parties \u2013 are reacting to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the 2020 race. Trump wants to get back to business as usual in the physical world while Biden and his staff are navigating a new world mostly online.</p> <p>Even as America cautiously reopens from its most quarantined pandemic days, Trump has traveled across the country and been plotting campaign events and an upcoming in-person fundraiser.</p> <p>Biden has been far more cautious, continuing to host online fundraisers while his team have said they are listening to health experts on how quickly to revert back to pre-coronavirus campaigning.</p> <p>When he has delivered speeches or made public appearances, Trump has refused to wear a mask. Biden has made a point of appearing masked in public, a deliberate contrast to Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Biden\u2019s interest that the campaign is a referendum on the president and not a choice,\u201d said Republican David Kochel, who was a top adviser for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cSo if I was Team Biden I would probably be doing the same thing, which is being as low-key as possible, sending a more calm and reassuring message. But I don\u2019t think that Biden needs to get out and try and hold a 10,000-person rally. It\u2019s not his forte anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Kochel added that Trump\u2019s approach made sense for him as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump strategy really makes sense as well because he really does feed off of those rallies \u2013 the energy that he gets from them,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting platform for him to launch into his detractors and his rivals and without that platform I think it\u2019s not as easy for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd/0_206_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump wants this year\u2019s Republican convention to replicate the crowded, in-person atmosphere of the 2016 version.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump wants this year\u2019s Republican convention to replicate the crowded, in-person atmosphere of the 2016 version.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Biden and Trump have made appearances in public since the protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death have rocked the nation with scenes of unrest. Both have delivered remarks addressing those protests. But where Biden\u2019s public appearances and comments have largely been about calling for reform, Trump has pushed a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda \u2013 although he has publicly acknowledged Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Biden is reportedly expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. On Friday Trump is slated to travel to Maine to tour where he will tour a nasal swab facility.</p> <p>The differing approaches extend to fundraisers as well. According to a list obtained by the Guardian, all of Biden\u2019s upcoming fundraising events are virtual. By contrast, Trump and his team are plotting in-person fundraisers, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/trump-schedules-in-person-fundraisers-as-shackles-come-off-289798\">Politico</a>.</p> <p>Ignoring the pandemic is also handy for a president whose response to a disaster that has killed 100,000 Americans and seen 40 million people lose their jobs has been widely slammed as chaotic and ineffective. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s caution emphasizes the reality that the coronavirus remains an ongoing challenge for the government.</p> <p>\u201cProtesting aside, it\u2019s a tricky time because as we\u2019re seeing, yes some states are starting to open back up but, as we\u2019re seeing, the number of cases is going back up in those places. Just from a campaign perspective, trying to assess what you can do without putting people in danger [is important],\u201d said the Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who served as a senior communications adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Finney added that she doubted voters would rally around Trump\u2019s approach to campaigning like the pandemic never happened. Americans are having to accept that this entire election cycle will be unlike other ones, Finney said.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is also part of us accepting that it\u2019s all going to be very different, voting is going to be different,\u201d Finney added. \u201cWe may have to settle in and be prepared that we may not have a set answer on election night. It may be a two- or three-day process.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump team and the president himself have wanted to turn Biden\u2019s social distancing and virtual campaigning into a liability. Trump has dinged his likely rival as dotty and out of touch. Trump allies hope that if the president is confidently crisscrossing the country without a mask, doing campaign events, that will also offer a stark contrast with Biden. They hope he will appear weak to voters.</p> <p>Finney, though, said the reason Trump has been attacking Biden on the Democrat\u2019s caution is because so far it has helped Biden develop a healthy lead in the polls.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason Trump is attacking [Biden] is because the basement strategy has been very successful and effective,\u201d Finney said. Biden, Finney said, has been able to create virtual events that have been effective. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to deliver a clear, consistent message that actually is resonating with what people hear in this time of crisis and speaking to our fears and our concerns but also trying to put forward a positive message.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

And in Seattle, demonstrations continued as the mayor announced that the curfew would be lifted.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former defense secretary, James Mattis, who quit over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria, condemned the president\u2019s handling of protests in DC and around the country. </strong>Mattis, like other former military and defense officials, excoriated Trump for having peaceful protestors gassed so he could pose for a photo. </li> \n   <li><strong>Additional charges were filed against the former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. </strong>The<strong> </strong>Minnesota attorney general, <strong>Keith Ellison, </strong>said that the murder charge against <strong>Derek Chauvin </strong>had been elevated to second-degree murder, and three other officers had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.</li> \n   <li><strong>Kayleigh McEnany signaled defense secretary Mark Esper\u2019s job may be in trouble. </strong>Asked during her White House briefing about whether the president still has faith in Esper, the press secretary said, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d The comment came after Esper said he would not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests, as <strong>Trump </strong>has suggested.</li> \n   <li><strong>A prominent US police chief called for a nationwide ban on chokeholds </strong>in response to Floyd\u2019s death.<strong> </strong><strong>Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis</strong>, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, said on Good Morning America, \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated.

Instead, he tries to divide us. \u201d</p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/@HolocaustMuseum/the-nazi-plan-to-divide-and-conquer-the-us-army-296a3c97fb54\">a Medium post from 2017</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> elaborated on the Nazis\u2019 strategy and propaganda efforts. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007679\">Nazis were virulent racists</a>,\u201d the post says, \u201c\u2026 they identified black people as an inferior, alien race that threatened the future existence of western society. But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

He is heartened, he says, by seeing police and other officers who have engaged with the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n  <p>Obama discusses his <strong>task force on 21st-century policing</strong>, which was formed after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014. </p> \n  <p>Its report, he says, \u201cshowcased a range of proven strategies and aims\u201d meant to be used for reforms. Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change.

There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified.

On Sunday, he made an unannounced visit to a protest site in Wilmington. He hosted a virtual roundtable with mayors to discuss the upheaval. On Tuesday, he traveled to Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, to confront the \u201cracial wounds that have long plagued our country\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cook, now a senior fellow at the Democratic thinktank Third Way, is encouraged but challenged Biden to do more to address deep-rooted racial and economic disparities.</p> \n<p>\u201cBiden has the latitude to be a transformational president and to have a transformational presidency,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biden won the Democratic primary on the strength of his support among black voters, particularly older, more moderate black voters who helped turn around his struggling presidential campaign starting in South Carolina.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet this coalition alone will probably not be enough to beat Trump. Biden\u2019s campaign has acknowledged he must also motivate younger and disaffected black voters who have lost faith in electoral politics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Many of them are in the streets protesting police killings and institutionalized racism at this moment, said Cliff Albright, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter. He fears Democrats are charting a path that is vulnerable to low turnout.</p> \n<p>\u201cCome November, Democrats are going to be trying to figure out what it takes to get them out to vote,\u201d Albright said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you what it will take. Does he listen? That will be the real test.\u201d</p> \n<p>The support of African American voters is critical to the success of any Democratic nominee. In 2016, black voter turnout <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">fell</a> for the first time in two decades, the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/this-was-the-election-of-disillusionment\">disillusionment</a>, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers\">voter disenfranchisement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">Russia interference</a> targeting African Americans online.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump has made a show of his efforts to peel away black support for the Democratic party, despite his long history of racist remarks and behavior. His campaign hosts online gatherings featuring African American surrogates and seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden\u2019s comment</a> last month that African American voters torn between him and the president \u201cain\u2019t black\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the protests began, Biden has sought to emphasize unity and solidarity, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump who characterized those demonstrating as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d and threatened to deploy the military if governors failed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protests.

Entering the race for president in 2019, Biden said he was motivated by the president\u2019s failure to unequivocally condemn white supremacists in the wake of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Biden\u2019s record on matters of race is complicated. His treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 supreme court nomination hearings for Clarence Thomas, and his authorship of a 1994 crime bill that many activists and researchers say led to an era of mass incarceration, are still points of contention.</p> \n<p>During the primary, his more liberal rivals attacked him over his past stances on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">mandatory school busing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\">abortion</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1197364395204059136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197364395204059136&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fbooker-biden-marijuana-legalization-915725%2F\">marijuana legalization</a>.

Progressives have singled out Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, a former top prosecutor in Minnesota, as particularly problematic, though Harris, a former state attorney general, and Demings, a former Orlando police chief, have also come under renewed scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more important than who is on his ticket is who Biden mobilizes behind him, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice organization.

  "<p>Britain must give away some sovereignty to secure free trade with the EU but Europe\u2019s leaders will intervene in the negotiations in the autumn with the aim of sealing a compromise deal at a summit on 15 October, Germany\u2019s ambassador in Brussels has said.</p> <p>Michael Clauss, whose country will take over the rolling presidency of the EU for the second half of the year, said there had been \u201cno real progress\u201d in the talks so far but predicted they would become the EU\u2019s main political focus in September and October.</p> <p>\u201cIs a deal possible? Yes, definitely. But I think it also means that UK needs to have a more realistic approach,\u201d Clauss said at an event hosted by the European Policy Centre thinktank. \u201cTo put in short, I think you cannot have a full sovereignty and, at the same time, full access to the internal market. So this Brexit issue is going to absorb a lot of political or most of the political attention we expect in September and October.\u201d</p> <p>The signal that the EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government are prepared to turn their focus to the stalling talks will be a boost to Downing Street, where officials have emphasised the need for a resetting of Michel Barnier\u2019s negotiating position.</p> <p>The two sides are in a stalemate on access for European fishing fleets to UK waters and whether in return for a zero-tariff trade deal Britain needs to tie itself to the EU\u2019s developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards.</p> <p>British negotiators have voiced fears that the talks have fallen down the EU agenda, with UK officials repeatedly calling for political involvement to break the stalemate.</p> <p>Clauss said that the last few months of 2020 would be \u201cdominated\u201d by the talks, and Berlin regarded securing a deal as a top priority alongside agreeing on the EU\u2019s pandemic recovery fund.</p> <p>A greater cause of concern will be the German ambassador\u2019s insistence that a trade deal will require the abandonment of the UK\u2019s sovereign right to set its own domestic laws without recourse to Brussels.</p> <p>In contrast, Barnier has repeatedly rejected British claims that the trading away of sovereignty is implicit in the EU\u2019s stance on standards and rules on subsidies to business.</p> <p>Clauss, who as Angela Merkel\u2019s key representative in Brussels is key figure in communicating Berlin\u2019s position on the negotiations to Barnier, said Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, Charles Michel, the president of the European council, and Boris Johnson would meet this month to take stock.</p> <p>\u201cSo far as all of you are aware, no real progress has been made in the negotiation. It\u2019s more like both sides, highlighting and stating their positions,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know, the issues are the future access of the United Kingdom and its companies to the internal market, which are connected to the issue of level playing field: do they have to apply ... state aid, and environmental standards and so on and so on, or not?</p> <p>\u201cAnother issue that is very important for some member states is the issue of fish quotas \u2013 in these countries it has a high visibility. This means whether EU member states keep their fish quotas \u2013 fish in the UK waters after Brexit has been done \u2013 and then another issue of governance. So, what if there is a disagreement on how to read the treaty and what can be done?</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that we will have a deal by the European council [summit of leaders] in October, and confirm,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cThat means we envisage to be there around the second half of October. We cannot be much later because [the deal] would need to be ratified at least by the European parliament, which needs some time.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Labour has said it will be holding the government\u2019s feet to the fire on its Brexit promises insisting it will not let it away with a deal that will wreck the economy further just because of its hard Brexit line.</p> <p>\u201cThat commitment to an \u201cambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership\u201d is what the country expects&nbsp;and deserves,\u201d said Rachel Reeves the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Michael Gove\u2019s opposite, she is now the key figure in the party, on the Brexit portfolio, previously&nbsp;held by Keir Starmer.</p> <p>\u201cWe have left the EU, but need a future relationship with our European neighbours that safeguards jobs and businesses, maintains&nbsp;environmental and employment standards and provides a close security partnership to keep people safe,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>She said this weeks talks were a \u201ckey step&nbsp;in the government delivering what it promised at the general election in December with the Prime Minister\u2019s \u2018oven-ready deal\u2019\u201d.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>It doesn\u2019t take long to blow up a reputation. In the case of the New York police department, an institution with an already troubled history, the clip lasted all of 27 seconds.</p> \n<p>It showed an NYPD vehicle in Brooklyn lined up against a metal barricade behind which protesters were chanting during Saturday\u2019s demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd.

The largest police force in the US, with its $5.6bn annual budget and 36,000 uniformed officers under the leadership of one of the most progressive mayors in the country, has responded to demonstrations about police brutality with more police brutality.</p> \n<p>The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the city council, which makes up more than half of the legislative body, was swift and devastating in its criticism. In a <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/31/mad-as-hell-mayor-selectively-quotes-council-minority-leadership-silencing-their-narrative/\">statement</a>, it said that the NYPD had acted \u201cwith aggression towards New Yorkers who vigorously and vociferously but nonetheless peacefully advocated for justice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the caucus, told the Guardian the NYPD had tried to suppress legitimate anger felt by African American and other minority communities following years of police abuse. \u201cWe cannot allow people who have kept people of color down for decades to say now that we don\u2019t have the right to display our outrage,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Though that sentiment applies nationwide, Adams believes New York stands out as having a \u201chorrible history of police brutality\u201d. It was the NYPD that set the tone, she said, when Daniel Pantaleo, the officer implicated in the 2014 death by chokehold of Eric Garner in Staten Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">avoided prosecution</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen nothing happened to the police officers who were responsible for the death of Eric Garner, New York set the blueprint for what happened to George Floyd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty, no consequence, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adams\u2019s framing of the Garner killing could equally be applied to a long string of notorious episodes of police misconduct that preceded it. In 1997, Haitian immigrant <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/twenty-years-later-look-back-nypd-assault-abner-louima-and-what-it-means-today/\">Abner Louima</a> was handcuffed by an NYPD officer and sexually assaulted with a broken broomstick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f/0_0_3000_1755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police clash with demonstrators protesting the Staten Island, New York grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police clash with demonstrators protesting against the decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Two years later, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/justice/2019/2/1/21211182/20-years-after-the-nypd-killing-of-amadou-diallo-his-mom-asks-what-s-changed\">Amadou Diallo</a> was shot near his home in a hail of 41 bullets after officers mistook his wallet for a gun. In an echo of that event, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/nyregion/in-sean-bell-killing-4-officers-to-be-forced-out.html\">unarmed Sean Bell</a> was shot 50 times in Queens on the morning of his wedding in 2006 \u2013 it took six years for the NYPD detective who opened the fusillade to be chucked off the force while nobody has ever been convicted of any crime.</p> \n<p>In the policing of protest, the NYPD also has a contentious track record. In 2004 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/new-york-agrees-settlement-2004-republican-convention\">rounded up</a> more than 1,800 peaceful protesters rallying outside the Republican National Convention during the re-election bid of George W Bush and herded them into overcrowded pens on Pier 57 in Manhattan. In 2011 it was similarly criticized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics\">heavy-handed tactics</a> during the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Cutting across all this, the force has consistently targeted its efforts on neighborhoods of the city with majority black or Latino populations, straying at times into overt racial profiling. Though stop and frisk has been reined back in recent years, the NYPD continues to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/tale-two-new-york-cities-when-it-comes-policing\">heavily and disproportionately police</a> those communities despite a historically low <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-murder-rate-hit-new-low-in-2018-11546559793\">homicide rate</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite this long legacy of overreach, the force continues to be systemically resistant to public oversight. Under <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/law-makes-it-nearly-impossible-police-police-new-york\">Section 50-A</a> of New York state law, the disciplinary files of police officers are largely held in secret, making the task of holding them accountable almost impossible.</p> \n<p>Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney at the Cop Accountability Project (CAP) within the Legal Aid Society, told the Guardian that there were currently more than 200 police officers still being employed by the NYPD on full pay who should have been considered for termination following reports of misconduct.</p> \n<p>Data collected by CAP shows that where cases of misconduct arise they often involve escalation of low-level encounters into aggressive confrontations \u2013 something officers are supposed to be trained not to do. The project is currently litigating the case of <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Medina-Complaint-and-Exhibits_Combined.pdf\">Tomas Medina</a> who was put in a chokehold and Tasered in 2018 after police were called to a complaint about loud music being played.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad5e94ae6ba3d300ef412234e410aafd73ae4d53\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad5e94ae6ba3d300ef412234e410aafd73ae4d53/90_65_2895_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest the shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against the shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Sygma/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Eric Garner\u2019s fatal arrest was triggered by him allegedly selling single cigarettes.</p> \n<p>Although the use of chokeholds has been banned in New York, the project has found that between 2015 and 2018 the city settled 30 lawsuits involving NYPD use of the potentially lethal maneuver.</p> \n<p>Wong believes such endemic deployment of excessive force has spilled over into the NYPD\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests.
