study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.<br></p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/spain-path-out-of-covid-lockdown-complicated-by-polarised-politics\">growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency</a> that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, the health ministry was due to decide whether the Madrid region would be granted permission to follow other areas into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-spain-and-italy-grapple-with-how-to-end-covid-19-lockdown\">next stage of the de-escalation</a>, which allows up to 10 people to meet and permits the reopening of cafe and restaurant terraces at 50% capacity.</p> \n  <p>Pedro Duque, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/new-spanish-pm-appoints-astronaut-pedro-duque-science-minister\">former astronaut who serves as Spain\u2019s science minister</a>, told the Guardian that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government\u2019s response.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html\">study, which involved more than 60,000 people</a>, revealed that around 5% of the population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 had had the coronavirus. It also showed that 33% of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe think that the seroprevalence test we\u2019ve carried out is the best that\u2019s been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we\u2019ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness \u2013 there are still a lot of people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Duque said the pronounced geographical variations underscored the need for a region-by-region loosening of restrictions: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha.</p> \n  <p>\u201cRight now, the only way to act is by making small changes when it comes to relaxing the conditions, by maintaining the distances between people, and by keeping up with the infection precautions,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only 5% of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that 95% don\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Duque also dismissed talk of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow more freedom of movement to those who had recovered from the disease.

Details on the precise implementation of the rules is to follow, but the western state of North Rhine Westphalia already applied them on the stroke of midnight on Friday.</p> \n  <p>Germans are closely watching the gradual easing of travel restrictions wanting to know to what extent they can hope to go on a foreign holiday this year. From May, 25 flights between Germany and Greece will resume. But officially the advice remains that Germans should not travel anywhere abroad, until at least 14 June.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, will hold a video conference with his counterparts from European countries where Germans typically go on holiday, including Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Bulgaria. The aim is to facilitate a coordinated reopening of borders including mutual agreements on being able to swiftly close them again in case of a rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced that an opening of the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria was on the cards from 15 June. On Wednesday, border traffic between Germany and Luxembourg is due to normalise again. Discussions with Denmark are still ongoing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:31:26.329Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe895b8f0849a584fe11e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:30:58.134Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:32:36.324Z\">at 2.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe88bf8f08898ae689136b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:20:07.127Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Denmark has reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March, Reuters reports.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:33:01.701Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe87d98f08898ae6891364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/david-agren\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:15:50.238Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100 Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states.

Whether there is a maximum number of people allowed for each household has not been specified. For those from a single household the distancing rules do not apply. </p> \n  <p>Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings.

If restaurants submit applications specific to the streets they would like to occupy, officials will move to close the roads to traffic on Fridays and at weekends, between 11am and 10pm.</p> \n  <p>Some concerns have been expressed that that arrangement may put the safety of diners under threat \u2013 with some sceptics making reference to the Berlin Christmas market attack of 2016 when an Islamist terrorist drove a lorry into the crowd, killing 12.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T11:13:13.631Z\">at 12.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe70258f08898ae689124f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:36:25.650Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the liveblog from my colleague Matt. </p> \n  <p>If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or reach me on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin\">@aamnamohdin</a>).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe6bb88f08898ae689122b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:33:52.799Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments so far on Friday: </p> \n  <p><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong><br></p> \n  <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the north-eastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> \n  <p><strong>Virus pushes Germany into recession</strong><br></p> \n  <p>German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to new official data. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak</strong></p> \n  <p>Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures.</p> \n  <p><strong>Spain announces lowest daily death toll since Monday</strong></p> \n  <p>Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540.</p> \n  <p><strong>Italy and Germany to ease more restrictions</strong></p> \n  <p>Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. The draft, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. Germany will loosen quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union and the UK, according to the interior ministry. </p> \n  <p><strong>China responds diplomatically to Trump threat of cutting off ties</strong></p> \n  <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>Baltic states restore free movement </strong></p> \n  <p>The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a mini-Schengen area. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></p> \n  <p> Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> \n  <p><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></p> \n  <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> \n  <p><strong>South Korea, China and Japan\u2019s health ministers to hold video conference</strong></p> \n  <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the east Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</strong></p> \n  <p>Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about 1 million Rohingya refugees.

This is a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure after Spain imposed 14 days\u2019 quarantine for anyone arriving from the EU/Schengen area.</p> \n  <p> The French border is currently closed to any visitors other than essential travellers who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or personal reason to enter the country and are carrying a sworn declaration to that effect. June 15 has been set for a possible reopening of French borders to European visitors.</p> \n  <p>Deaths on French roads dropped by just under 56% during April compared with the same month last year. This is hardly surprising as everyone was locked down, but police records suggested those who were on the empty roads drove faster.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference. </strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh. </strong>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed. </strong>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:05:58.460Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2d908f08d99d46a174b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:50:18.490Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2c038f08d99d46a174a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alison-rourke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:45:17.107Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global report: Trump threat to cut trade ties over Covid-19 branded \u2018lunacy\u2019 by Chinese media</h2> \n  <p>An escalation of rhetoric between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations with Beijing.</p> \n  <p>The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says he could cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over the novel coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will gather by video conference </strong>to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:07:10.737Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1d1b8f080c727453b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:41:08.002Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1c578f080c727453b508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:37:51.856Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kjalee/status/1260918708458991616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh my god, this is amazing.

The true number is likely to be higher. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global death toll passes 300,000. </strong>The global toll from Covid-19 has just passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected.According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 301,370 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,426,937 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. </strong>Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officials in Bangladesh have announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the country\u2019s Rohingya refugee camps</strong>. Health experts and NGOs have issued warnings that the virus could race through the camps that house almost a million people forced to flee a military offensive in Myanmar almost two years ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greece will open 515 organised beaches to the public this weekend</strong>, but alcohol and music will be banned, along with sports and games.

  "<p>The Liberal Democrat election campaign last year was \u201ca high-speed car crash\u201d worsened by structural failures, poor tactics, and an inexperienced inner circle around Jo Swinson, an internal party review has concluded.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.libdems.org.uk/2019-election-review\">61-page report</a>, led by the Lib Dem peer Dorothy Thornhill, says an already hugely difficult campaign was further hampered by errors including hubris over the number of seats the party could win.</p> <p>Despite pre-election predictions from some Lib Dems of gains of 80 or 100 MPs, the 12 December election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastated-jo-swinson-apologises-lib-dems-election-failure\">saw the party slump</a> from its defection-fuelled tally of 21 MPs to just 11, with Swinson among those losing their seats.</p> <p>The report notes that while Swinson was hampered by having less than five months between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/jo-swinson-elected-new-lib-dem-leader\">winning the party leadership</a> and the election, her decision to immediately seek a new party chief executive undermined decision-making structures.</p> <p>\u201cThis had the unintended consequence creating an \u2018inner circle\u2019 of advisers at arm\u2019s length from the resources of the party machine, and put decision-making in the hands of an unaccountable group around the leader,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt also severed some people from the roles and responsibilities they were employed to do, and led to the overpromotion of others.\u201d</p> <p>The report, based in part on almost 21,000 survey responses from Lib Dem members and officials, said Swinson\u2019s tactic of promising to revoke Brexit if the party won a parliamentary majority meant the party \u201ceffectively ignored\u201d the biggest group of voters: those who were neither fervently remain or leave.</p> <p>While painting a picture of a party almost drunk on the euphoria of initially high poll ratings and unable to detect that the picture had shifted, the report stresses the role of both a dysfunctional internal structure and what was always going to be a difficult election.</p> <p>\u201cThe overarching conclusion of the review is that had we made much better decisions in 2019, we might have gained a few more seats, but not many more,\u201d it says.</p> <p>The Lib Dems\u2019 current interim leader, Ed Davey, praised the report as brave and powerful, saying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdwardJDavey/status/1261312541449498624\">in a series of tweets</a> that in future the party should be \u201crooted in our communities, putting the interest of our communities first, and we need to speak with a clear voice\u201d.</p> <p>The report identifies as one key moment the release of a poll before Swinson took over as leader, amid the peak of the Brexit chaos under Theresa May, which put the Lib Dems on 73 seats and within a 5% swing of 219 more.</p> <p>This prompted the abandonment of plans to fight 32 potential new seats as serious targets in favour of a list that rose to 40 and then 80, despite worries from activists about a lack of resources to battle on so many fronts.</p> <p>The expectations swelled towards the party\u2019s hugely buoyant autumn conference, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/i-can-be-next-pm-says-jo-swinson-as-she-launches-election-campaign\">an election launch at which</a> Swinson was presented as a potential prime minister. This happened, the report noted, despite worrying signs, such as Labour backing a second Brexit referendum.</p> <p>The party, concluded the report, suffered from \u201can optimism that was to maintain itself even when the evidence started to turn against it\u201d.</p> <p>Before the election was called, the report says, the party faced two unpalatable choices: ally with Labour to stop Brexit, but risk a collapse in tactical voting from Tory voters alarmed by Jeremy Corbyn; or delay an election for as long as possible, even if Brexit took place.</p> <p>\u201cInstead we chose to claim to believe we could win outright ourselves, thus obviating the need to choose,\u201d it says. \u201cIt is this lack of clarity which led to an election campaign that can only be described as a high-stakes gamble for a once-in-a-lifetime election, to stop Brexit by winning outright. It was a gamble which did not pay off.\u201d</p> <p>The election, which the report summarised as \u201ca high-speed car crash\u201d, was marked by poor on-the-ground campaigning, as exemplified by the loss of Swinson\u2019s East Dunbartonshire seat, and a central message that Swinson could be PM which \u201cappeared unrealistic to the wider public, especially given that we were already falling in the polls\u201d.</p>",

Senior political analyst Brit Hume led the charge, suggesting fatalities in New York City \u2013 the worst-hit area in the country \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brithume/status/1245465723591364616\">were \u201cinflated\u201d</a> because the city did not \u201cdistinguish between those who die with the disease and those who die from it\u201d. Hume retweeted a chart showing that many people who died had pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>Hume repeated the claim on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show. He appeared to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/fox-news-hosts-coronavirus-death-toll-inflated\">convince Carlson</a>, who suggested \u201cthere may be reasons that people seek an inaccurate death count\u201d and added: \u201cWhen journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda, unfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is said to be questioning whether the death toll is lower than officially stated. He has stopped short of saying so in public, but in April he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncardillo/status/1254481206936326145\">retweeted a man who mused of Democrats</a>: \u201cDo you really think these lunatics wouldn\u2019t inflate the mortality rates by underreporting the infection rates in an attempt to steal the election?\u201d</p> <p>Trump has consistently under-predicted how many people will die from the virus. In February he said there <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-cases-will-go-down-to-zero-ultimately.html\">would soon be \u201cclose to zero\u201d</a> cases. <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-in-us-deaths-cases/6139672/\">On 20 April</a>, he suggested \u201c50 to 60,000\u201d could die. The US passed that figure nine days later. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus&amp;variant=show&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;context=storylines_menu\">More than 85,000 have now died</a>.</p> <p>In fact, epidemiologists including Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert, say <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html\">more people have died</a> from coronavirus than has been reported.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a struggle to find similar perspectives in the rightwing media upon which many Americans rely.</p> <p>At the start of May, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized the addition of presumptive coronavirus deaths to the official tolls. \u201cAhh, retrospectively adding deaths to the Covid count,\u201d she said. \u201cNo issues there, I\u2019m sure.

Scott Jensen, a Minnesota state senator and family physician, began hawking this theory in early April, leading to an appearance on Ingraham\u2019s show.</p> <p>\u201cRight now Medicare has determined that if you have a Covid-19 admission to the hospital, you\u2019ll get paid $13,000,\u201d Jensen said.</p> <p>\u201cIf that Covid-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much.

President <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/meese-edwin-iii\">Reagan\u2019s second attorney general, Edwin Meese</a>, was a longtime friend of, and political operative for, Reagan.</p> <p>But throughout American history, when presidents have appointed political cronies to be attorney general, they were looking for people only to help them pursue a policy agenda.</p> <p>Nixon\u2019s efforts to enlist John Mitchell in the Watergate cover-up and get one of Mitchell\u2019s successors, Elliot Richardson, to fire the Watergate special prosecutor stand out as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/08/25/trump-is-acting-like-richard-nixon-now-we-need-others-to-channel-the-heroes-of-watergate/?utm_term=.53713fd83d52\">important, but rare, exceptions</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-calls-manafort-prosecution-a-hoax-says-sessions-should-stop-mueller-investigation/2018/08/01/8deb579e-958e-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.989d9753c406\">Other presidents have neither expected</a> nor asked their attorneys general to use the vast investigatory and prosecutorial power of the justice department itself to intervene in criminal cases to help cronies, to buy the silence of those who might threaten him, or to discredit political adversaries. That is a new and dangerous ballgame.</p> <p>Using the justice department in this way undermines the integrity and professionalism of the lawyers and prosecutors who work there. It turns law into an arena for gaining partisan advantage and settling political grudges.</p> <p>Having gotten away with doing the same in his dealings with Ukraine, the president has an attorney general who is only too happy to go beyond merely politicizing the DoJ. He seems determined to turn it into a full-fledged arm of the Trump campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden has had a hard time capturing the hearts of progressive Democrats. Like the media, progressive Democrats tend to see him as a centrist \u2013 a status quo candidate who just wants to return the US and the world to the pre-Trump era. Even Biden\u2019s collaborations with Bernie Sanders, including the recently announced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">unity </a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">task</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">forces</a>, are often dismissed as pure window-dressing. But this kind of blithe dismissal of the presumptive Democratic nominee misreads both the politician and the times.</p> <p>It is true that Biden was never a very progressive Democrat, but neither was he a particularly conservative one. He has been a classic \u201ccentrist Democrat\u201d. But it\u2019s important to note that this places him not in the political center of the US electorate, but in the center of the Democratic party \u2013 a party that has shifted left significantly since 2016, as has Biden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-supporters-leftwing-voters\">Joe Biden needs to do a lot more if he wants to win over Sanders voters | Nathan Robinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden is a realist. He knows when the times are a-changin\u2019. That\u2019s why he joined Barack Obama in 2008 and why he has moved to reconcile with Sanders in 2020. After two powerful primary campaigns, Biden is smart enough to acknowledge that Sanders represents the direction the party\u2019s base is moving to, and that he could shape that transformation.</p> <p>As Gabriel Debenedetti <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/joe-biden-presidential-plans.html\">argues</a> in his excellent New York magazine article on the Biden campaign, the Covid-19 pandemic has opened Biden\u2019s eyes to the need for a more radical approach to policy and governance. As Biden told a group of donors: \u201cThe blinders have been taken off because of this Covid crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Crises can lead to fundamental changes. While we mainly focus on the darkest consequences, such as Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power in the wake of the Great Depression, that same crisis also gave rise to the <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/remembering-made-fdr-great/\">greatest progressive project</a> in US history: Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. While heralded as a \u201cradical\u201d by many today, FDR was in many ways a realpolitiker, politically expedient and adjustable to the mood of the times.</p> <p>But perhaps the best comparison would be FDR\u2019s protege <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/joe-biden-progressive.html\">Lyndon B Johnson</a>, the southerner who, in an atmosphere of intense polarization over civil rights and in the wake of the national trauma of the assassination of John F Kennedy, introduced some of the most important civil rights legislation in US history. As with Johnson, the current crisis provides Biden with an opportunity to step out of the shadow of his charismatic and inspiring Democratic predecessor, Obama, and become a much more transformative president.</p> <p>To be clear, this is not a foregone conclusion. Moderates, both Democrats and Republicans, also see Biden as a great opportunity, in their case to re-establish the status quo. Many of them have been around Biden for years, if not decades, and play important roles in his campaign \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-economy/biden-campaigns-outside-economic-advisers-include-larry-summers-idUSKCN2253QX\">Larry Summers</a>.</p> <p>But the recently announced unity taskforces \u2013 on the climate crisis, criminal justice reform, economy, education, healthcare and immigration \u2013 show a more mixed picture. First, they much better reflect the ethnic and gender diversity of the contemporary Democratic party and its electorate \u2013 with many prominent African American and Hispanic members as well as twice as many female than male co-chairs. Second, they include many prominent progressives, including Sanders surrogates such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal \u2013 hardly politicians who will accept a token role.</p> <p>While some \u201cBernie or bust\u201d keyboard warriors will invariably denounce these progressives as sellouts, and some jaded progressives as naive, they are actually realists who should be supported and strengthened. Few politicians understand the signs of the times better than Ocasio-Cortez. She knows that the country and the party are changing, and she understands that the Covid-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity to accelerate that change.</p> <p>Moreover, these progressives realize that Biden does not have a set ideology, but is in many ways an empty vessel whose domestic policies and priorities are still very much in flux and in play. In other words, progressives have two fights to fight: one for a President Biden, against the Republicans, and one for a progressive Biden presidency, against the moderate Democrats.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia.

  "<p>Donald Trump had planned to run on a pledge to \u201cKeep America great\u201d.

As the president visited Pennsylvania on Thursday, the Republican National Committee went after Biden over the Green New Deal, whose framework the Democratic candidate has endorsed.</p> <p>The president\u2019s campaign was also eager to pounce on Biden\u2019s verbal slip during a March primary debate when he appeared to endorse a ban on all fracking, a comment that the former vice-president\u2019s team was forced to quickly clarify.</p> <p>Local strategists say the president attacking Biden over fracking could prove effective in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by less than one point in 2016, because the state economy is propped up by fossil fuels.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton lost in 2016 largely because she was unpopular, but if there was a single issue that worked against her in Pennsylvania, it was her war on fossil fuels,\u201d said Charlie Gerow, a veteran Republican strategist based in Harrisburg, the state capital. </p> <p>But several <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-biden-sanders-michigan-pennsylvania-wisconsin-polls-6fa3e5ad-9044-45af-987f-397dc2b66cbb.html\">recent polls </a>show Trump losing ground in key battleground states that were critical to his 2016 victory, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"147266381c7b054c9f22e9eb5cdc86507a4c40bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147266381c7b054c9f22e9eb5cdc86507a4c40bd/0_258_3876_2326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden in Philadelphia in March.

  "<p>Good morning.

  "<p>Even now, I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t bring herself to say: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election \u2026 \u201d Because, to me, she <em>did </em>win. She received nearly 2.9m more votes than Donald Trump, but of course Trump received more electoral votes. So instead I say: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had become president\u201d or \u201cIf the outcome of the 2016 election had been different \u2026 \u201d Finishing the sentence requires less finessing on my part; it is perfectly clear: \u201c\u2026 I would not have written a Hillary novel.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary had become president, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to. Instead of watching in real time as our country becomes a more racist, sexist, xenophobic and homophobic place, Americans would have had a leader committed not just to equality among people but also to addressing climate change, gun law reform and healthcare. And it seems equally unprovable and indisputable that her response to a global pandemic would have been vastly different \u2013 science-based, measured, compassionate.</p> <p>But instead we live in this world, not that one, and, for my own sake, I did need to write a novel in which the 2016 US presidential election unfolded differently. I\u2019m 44, and it was only a few years ago, after well over three decades of writing fiction, that I realised I have devoted much of my life to this creative act for two reasons above all: to entertain myself and to soothe myself. Writing <em>Rodham</em> was definitely an example of the latter. Plus, it tapped into my fascination with politics, fame, and the discrepancy between our public and private selves \u2013 all themes I first explored in my 2008 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, which was a fictionalised retelling of the life of Laura Bush.</p> <p>But where <em>American Wife</em> mostly embellishes the real or historical timeline, <em>Rodham</em> creates a parallel universe. What I didn\u2019t know when I embarked on writing in March 2017 was how much I\u2019d teach myself \u2013 or perhaps I should say how much Hillary would teach me. These are some of the lessons I learned:</p> <p><strong>Multi-decade rumour mill notwithstanding, it\u2019s hard to find examples of things Hillary has done wrong.<br></strong>The false accusations levelled at her range from murky acts of financial malfeasance, to bonkers conspiracy theories about paedophilia, to persistent suggestions that she mishandled email when she was secretary of state. On close examination, what\u2019s striking about these supposed scandals is that they either have no relationship to reality or she\u2019s being accused of something that I (and admittedly I\u2019m not a lawyer) would not at first glance understand to be inappropriate, let alone illegal. After reading multiple accounts of the controversy around \u201cWhitewater\u201d, Bill and Hillary\u2019s late 1970s real estate investment, I still would struggle to cogently summarise the sequence of events to another human. This murkiness contrasts with the events that currently unfold on a weekly basis in the White House \u2013 consider the New York Times headline on 21 April \u201cTrump (the Company) Asks Trump (the Administration) for Hotel Relief<em>\u201d </em>\u2013 that prompt me to sincerely wonder, how can this <em>possibly</em> be legal?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94d359c32312a5da17c7812f63f0a30f612bb1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94d359c32312a5da17c7812f63f0a30f612bb1cc/0_61_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Clintons campaigning with Al and Tipper Gore, in Michigan, 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clintons campaigning with Al and Tipper Gore, in Michigan, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dirck Halstead/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t see Hillary as saintly, but the two damning titbits that emerged about her in my research that have stayed with me are actually absurdly insignificant. The first is that, according to biographer Carl Bernstein, in 1993 the Clintons travelled together to St Louis, Missouri. Hillary told an aide to leave Bill\u2019s briefcase aboard Air Force One, but when Bill later asked for it, Hillary supposedly told him: \u201cYour staff always does that ... They don\u2019t serve you well.\u201d This is not, I\u2019d venture to say, grounds for locking her up. Nor is the other scrap of scandal: New York Times reporter Amy Chozick, who covered the 2016 campaign, describes in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/chasing-hillary-by-amy-chozick-review\">Chasing Hillary</a></em> how, at events, members of Hillary\u2019s staff sometimes confiscated supporters\u2019 homemade signs and instructed them to hold up mass-produced campaign signs instead. Then again, given the ease with which one can find photos that show supporters holding homemade placards and flags, this practice doesn\u2019t seem to have been widespread \u2013 and in any event, it\u2019s safe to assume it wasn\u2019t Hillary herself doing the confiscating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many see Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic \u2013 little attention is given to the possibility she\u2019s neither</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The disparity between the vitriolic criticism Hillary has faced and who she actually is seems to be so great that it reminds me of that optical illusion \u2013 itself a sexist binary \u2013 where from one angle the image looks like a beautiful young woman and from another angle like a hag. Many Americans perceive Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic, with little apparent attention given to the possibility that she\u2019s neither. Sometimes while writing, I thought that if, in a parallel universe, I ended up sitting next to her at a dinner party and she were exactly the same person but instead of going into politics was a university president or corporate executive, I would be dazzled by her. \u201cThat woman is so smart<em>,\u201d</em> I\u2019d think. \u201cShe\u2019s so tough and interesting and impressive<em>.\u201d</em><br><br><strong>If Bill Clinton had wanted to marry me in 1975, I\u2019d have accepted.<br></strong>When I decided that the premise of my novel would be \u201cWhat if Hillary hadn\u2019t married Bill?\u201d, it wasn\u2019t because I find Bill loathsome. I do find him very flawed \u2013 some of his behaviour has been disturbing at best \u2013 but my main goal was to examine chance, fate, free will and the notion of parallel universes or other, unlived lives. As Hillary has mentioned publicly more than once, in the early 1970s, she was initially reluctant to accept Bill\u2019s marriage proposals. Indeed, as an epigraph for <em>Rodham</em>, I chose these lines from her 2017 memoir <em>What Happened</em>: \u201cMy marriage to Bill Clinton was the most consequential decision of my life. I said no the first two times he asked me. But the third time, I said yes. And I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if Hillary hadn\u2019t married Bill she\u2019d be president today</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if only she hadn\u2019t married him, she\u2019d be president today. On the one hand, if almost anything in 2016 had happened differently, that seems a likely outcome, but on the other hand, who knows? And while I used this particular marital departure from reality for fiction, Bill\u2019s charms aren\u2019t lost on me. In fact, in June 2017, I tweeted a picture of his almost thousand-page memoir along with the comment: \u201cVERY unexpected outcome of writing my Hillary novel \u2013 I myself am now in grave danger of falling in love with Bill<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>In his autobiography <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/27/biography.politicalbooks1\">My Life</a></em>, Bill is a funny, self-deprecating raconteur with an excellent eye for colourful details (especially of the southern fried variety) and an apparent fondness for almost everyone he has ever met. Plus, the photos of him and Hillary from back then, along with the ones in her memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">Living History</a></em>, are downright swoony. Though the couple are far less polished-looking than now, she\u2019s pretty and he\u2019s dashing, and in pictures from their wedding, they gaze at each other with adoring intensity. In the present day, it\u2019s never a foregone conclusion that an ambitious man will be smitten with an ambitious woman; 50 years ago, it was all the more notable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c09e9b17bdce2df03c23ebed141607ed43d80d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c09e9b17bdce2df03c23ebed141607ed43d80d48/0_10_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adoring intensity \u2026 Hillary and Bill Clinton on their wedding day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downright swoony \u2026 Hillary and Bill Clinton on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And though I\u2019ve never met either Clinton, his in-person charisma is legendary. In fact, in response to my tweet about Bill, one of my Twitter followers shared that someone she knew had seen him in a London department store shortly after the news of his affair with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky\">Monica Lewinsky</a> had emerged. The woman approached, planning to tell him he was a national embarrassment. Instead, as they shook hands, she exclaimed, \u201cI love you!\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Clintons just might have a good marriage.</strong><br>In late January 1992, when Bill\u2019s first presidential campaign hung in the balance due to the cabaret singer Gennifer Flowers\u2019s recent allegation that she\u2019d had a 12-year affair with him, he and Hillary sat for a joint interview with the news show <em>60 Minutes</em>. \u201cI think most Americans would agree that it\u2019s very admirable that you\u2019ve stayed together,\u201d said the journalist Steve Kroft. \u201cThat you\u2019ve worked your problems out and that you\u2019ve seemed to reach some sort of understanding and arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Kroft and the Clintons were in a hotel suite in New Hampshire, the Clintons on a loveseat across from their interlocutor, and Bill quickly responded: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You\u2019re looking at two people who love each other. This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage. That\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think Hillary will read the book, and if she does, she won't like it \u2013 it\u2019s not a straightforward love letter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When this interview aired, I watched it in my boarding school dorm; I was 16 and had never had a boyfriend. I\u2019ve now been married for 12 years, and the pertinent question doesn\u2019t seem to be, is the Clintons\u2019 marriage an arrangement? The question is, what marriage isn\u2019t?</p> <p>Yes, I understand that Kroft was essentially saying: \u201cDo you not love each other but stay together anyway because of your shared ambition?\u201d But this question itself seems simplistic, a pretence that the default mode of marriage is happily ever after. I don\u2019t know any couple for whom it\u2019s this easy.</p> <p>I believe that the Clintons genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company, are genuinely interested in each other\u2019s opinions, have considered divorce and made the choice not to pursue it. At the risk of sounding cynical, it\u2019s possible such a dynamic is about the best any of us can hope for. I sometimes think about how their marriage outlasted that of Bill\u2019s vice-president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/al-tipper-gore\">Al Gore</a>, and his former wife Tipper. Little information was public about the Gores\u2019 marriage, whereas I know as much about the Clintons\u2019 marriage as I do about my own. Or maybe \u2013 bear with me here \u2013 I don\u2019t. Maybe <em>every</em> marriage is unknowable except to the people inside it.<br><br><strong>In the United States, it\u2019s rare to hear the unfiltered voices of female politicians.<br></strong>More than a year after it had aired, I learned about the existence of a 2016 campaign podcast created by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/clinton-foundation-bill-hillary-us-election-state-department\">Clinton Foundation</a>. Called <em>With Her</em>, it was hosted by a quintessentially podcasty guy named Max Linsky \u2013 a smart, casual Brooklyn-based white man \u2013 and featured interviews with Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine, and assorted campaign staff members.</p> <p>From the first seconds of listening to it, I was aware of something weird and unfamiliar in its tone, though it took a few minutes to pinpoint what: Hillary was not being addressed with reflexive scepticism and cynicism, and she therefore did not need to respond defensively. The assumption was not that she was a power-hungry Machiavellian. The assumption was that she was a likable hard worker who cares about the American people. Even more disorienting: the person giving her the benefit of the doubt was male.</p> <p>As research, I read many articles and watched many news segments from the autumn of 2016, before the election, and there is a weary undertone to almost all of them, a kind of irritation that Hillary will be the first female president when she\u2019s so, you know, polarising and baggage-laden. Her victory is both foregone and irksome. This undertone would seem laughably wide of the mark were it not for the fact that so many Americans have paid such a high price for the ignorance.</p> <p>Also as research, I listened to audiobooks by all the female senators running for president in 2020: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kirsten-gillibrand\">Kirsten Gillibrand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>. They narrate their own books, and, once again, to listen to their literal voices was to feel a heartening disorientation. They got to speak for as long as they wanted without interruption, tell their own stories, and present themselves, instead of being presented through the lens of America\u2019s profound ambivalence about, or outright aversion to, women in power. Of course I understand that these kinds of books are a form of campaigning, but I\u2019m not convinced that being in charge of the way you are portrayed makes your portrayal inherently false.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18c33a9dd1aa3a591f7b32853b2f0f4ac38fa650\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c33a9dd1aa3a591f7b32853b2f0f4ac38fa650/66_437_1222_733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curtis Sittenfeld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Sittenfeld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Sittenfeld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based on my remarks here, a person could be forgiven for thinking I wrote <em>Rodham</em> because I\u2019m such an ardent fan of Hillary. This isn\u2019t quite right. I am a fan of Hillary, but, to answer a question I\u2019ve already been asked many times, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll read the book, and if she does, I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s not a straightforward love letter. The character I\u2019ve created makes personal and professional tradeoffs. She\u2019s not perfect, and the character of Bill is (spoiler alert) even less so. Also, the sex scenes are way too detailed.</p> <p>I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s less that my novel grew out of my admiration for Hillary and more that my admiration grew out of my research about her. For my entire adulthood, she has been not merely a public figure but a cultural touchstone. Many Americans still say they don\u2019t know her, yet she\u2019s shown us over and over who she is: how strong and capable, how caring and complicated. We just have to choose to see her.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Rodham is published by Doubleday in July and as an audiobook on 19 May.

These successes are often put down to press bias, or our deference towards posh rulers, the power of Brexit, or a rapport with the English working class \u2013 a rapport that the left supposedly doesn\u2019t understand. In other words, his ascent and seemingly impregnable position since are explained in largely British terms.</p> <p>That\u2019s justifiable: everywhere in the world, a lot of politics is local. But another way of looking at the great balloon of his popularity \u2013 how it\u2019s kept inflated, and why attempts to puncture it so often fail \u2013 is to remember the leader he perhaps most resembles.</p> <p>In 2011, he told the Sunday Telegraph that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/8901683/Boris-Johnson-Ive-a-healthy-dose-of-sheer-egomania.html\">Ronald Reagan</a> was his favourite politician. Like Johnson, Reagan was a telegenic celebrity who became a high-profile regional and then national politician; first as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorship_of_Ronald_Reagan\">governor of California</a> from 1967 to 1975, and then as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/ronald-reagan/\">US president from 1981 to 1989</a>.</p> <p>As with Johnson, Reagan\u2019s periods in office were frequently marked by broken promises and scandals, by evasiveness and incompetence. Having <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-10-8902240061-story.html\">pledged to eliminate</a> the federal government\u2019s debt \u201cby 1983, if not earlier\u201d, he trebled it during his presidency. In the mid-80s, when some of his senior officials were found to have illegally aided rightwing rebels in Nicaragua, he professed ignorance.</p> <p>Like his counterpart, Reagan sometimes came across in public as vague, not in control of events, out of his depth. Many commentators, and even some close colleagues, thought he was lazy and often disengaged. Yet many Americans weren\u2019t bothered by his shortcomings. Exasperated critics called him the \u201cTeflon president\u201d \u2013 responsibility for anything bad rarely stuck to him. Johnson\u2019s enemies know the feeling.</p> <p>Reagan expressed a hazy but potent sense of optimism instead. \u201cUnfailingly he sent forth the message that people wanted to hear: better days were ahead,\u201d wrote the historian Haynes Johnson in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/20/books/books-of-the-times-recounting-the-lowlights-of-the-reagan-years.html\">Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years</a>. Our prime minister does the same.</p> <p>And while Reagan smiled and chuckled for the cameras, out of sight the ideologues and hard men of his circle \u2013 the Dominic Cummings and Lynton Crosbys of their day \u2013 further militarised the American state and inserted coded racial messages into his election campaigns. A likeable premier, as Johnson remains to many Britons, is a great decoy for a government with confrontational aims.</p> <p>How can opponents trap such slippery leaders? When Reagan stood for re-election in 1984, the Democrats tried soberly pointing out his flaws and warning about their consequences. Their candidate, Walter Mondale, a lawyer by profession, accused Reagan of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/us/mondale-attacks-reagan-s-policies.html\">\u201cirresponsibility and deception\u201d</a> in office, and said that taxes would have to rise as a consequence. He <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/organization/?10663/Walter-Mondale\">lost to Reagan</a> in 49 of the 50 states.</p> <p>This may be a warning to Keir Starmer, even as he exposes Johnson\u2019s bluffing and recklessness with almost embarrassing ease in parliament. Sometimes, voters prefer irresponsible leaders to realistic ones \u2013 partly because voters can be political fantasists themselves.</p> <p>Previously a successful but hammy actor, as president Reagan maintained a persona that was so obviously mannered, delivering patriotic one-liners like a movie cowboy, that when he bent the truth many people weren\u2019t shocked or necessarily disapproving. Instead, they judged the quality of his act. The similarly cartoonish public Johnson often gets the same indulgent treatment, with his half-truths tolerated as just him \u201cbeing Boris\u201d. Boris isn\u2019t even his real first name.</p> <p>He does lack one of Reagan\u2019s advantages, though. In the 80s, with Silicon Valley burgeoning and the Soviet bloc in terminal decline, America\u2019s position in the world really was improving. The famous claim of Reagan\u2019s re-election campaign, that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/every-winning-slogan-from-us-presidential-campaigns-1948-2016-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u201cit\u2019s morning again in America\u201d</a>, was a blend of truth and fantasy \u2013 which is often the most effective propaganda of all.</p> <p>But in today\u2019s Britain, it\u2019s much harder to promise, as Johnson did yet again this week, that under him the country <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1260500656760279042\">\u201ccan be stronger and better than ever before\u201d</a>. Divided by Brexit and devolution, struggling economically even before the lockdown, the UK is an increasingly risky place for politicians to be bullish about. There is a danger of them sounding deluded and absurd. Johnson\u2019s cheery nationalism may backfire in ways that Reagan\u2019s never did.</p> <p>We\u2019re not there yet. But during crises voters can turn on governments suddenly. It\u2019s usually forgotten that for the first two months of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/winter-of-discontent\">1978-9 winter of discontent</a>, Britain\u2019s last experience of protracted national disruption, Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour government continued to lead the Conservatives in some polls. But as the crisis dragged on, and seemed increasingly beyond Callaghan\u2019s control, the government\u2019s ratings collapsed and never fully recovered.</p> <p>If that happens to Johnson, the disconnect between his popularity and his political abilities will stop being a mystery that columns like this try to solve. His long hold over voters and the media, ever since he won the mayoralty in usually Labour-supporting London 12 years ago, will be seen as a bit of a con \u2013 like an enticing but dodgy company that eventually went bust.</p> <p>The Reagan presidency, for all its breezy airs, is actually an exacting model for other politicians to follow. It shows that charming half-truths can only sustain a government if you can keep voters half-believing in them, right to the end.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>An escalation of rhetoric between Donald Trump and <strong>China </strong>over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations\u201d with Beijing.</p> \n<p>The<strong> US</strong> president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.
