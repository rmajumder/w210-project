  "<p>Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/june-brexit-summit-on-cards-talks-heading-for-deadlock\">deadlock in talks </a>about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week.</p> <p>However, an impact assessment of ending the transition period found that manufacturing, banking, finance and insurance sectors would be \u201cseverely exposed\u201d to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a> analysis divided the country into areas and then placed each in a category between 1 and 5, with 5 representing those most exposed to a double hit. Half of those in the north-west are in category 5 and a further 40% in category 4. It said that the West Midlands, where the Tories made major gains in last year\u2019s election, was also exposed.</p> <p>There have already been warnings that new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/johnsons-promised-brexit-border-in-irish-sea-will-not-be-ready-in-time\">border arrangements in the Irish Sea</a> will not be ready by Johnson\u2019s end-of-year deadline, but Downing Street is adamant that the transition period, which gives Britain access to the EU\u2019s single market, will not be extended.</p> <p>James Kirkup, the SMF director, said: \u201cIn some cases and some places, that double impact will be severe. At base, this report demonstrates the simple fact that leaving a developed free-trade agreement with our nearest and largest trading partners at the same time as facing a pandemic will expose many local areas of the UK to a painful double economic impact.\u201d</p> <p>The study was funded by Best for Britain, which is campaigning for a comprehensive EU trade deal. Naomi Smith, its chief executive, said: \u201cThis report, which maps the impact of both shocks, definitively rebuts any speculation that the impact of leaving the transition period could be masked by the coronavirus recession. The data is clear: when you scratch beneath the surface, so many key sectors will be exposed to a dangerous double whammy of economic hits.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

Earlier this month, Barr said the justice department would drop the case, although a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/mike-flynn-case-justice-department-republicans\">put that decision on hold</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, the same day Boente was forced out of the FBI, Trump\u2019s new director of intelligence and Senate Republicans released transcripts of the calls in question, between Flynn and the then Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>Opponents of the president said the transcripts proved that Flynn had been treated fairly.

Hurley and Bob Behnken, veterans of space shuttle missions, will join their Nasa colleague Chris Cassidy, already resident with two Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS.</p> \n<p>As a test mission paving the way for regular flights of Dragon later this year, every aspect of the spacecraft\u2019s performance will be analyzed by SpaceX engineers. Behnken and Hurley will remain in orbit for up to 120 days.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long,\u201d Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, said of the launch. \u201cIt was just an amazing day.

One of two contractors under Nasa\u2019s $6.2bn commercial crew program, SpaceX stole a march on Boeing by completing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/19/spacex-crew-capsule-escape-test-rocket-explodes-nasa-space-station\">uncrewed abort test</a> in January.

Whether Nasa is going to save a lot of money by paying SpaceX rather than paying the Russians, that\u2019s not clear. But the money is staying in the US. And for strategic and geopolitical reasons it\u2019s good to have our own human launch capability.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since 2011, Nasa has been forced to rely on the Russian space agency, purchasing seats aboard ageing Soyuz spacecraft for up to $85m apiece.

He re-established the National Space Council, which had been abolished by President Bill Clinton.</p> <p>The president has also created the sixth branch of the armed forces, the Space Force. Receiving its flag earlier this month, he boasted of new military equipment including a \u201csuper-duper missile\u201d.

I don\u2019t think you can bottle that lightning again, especially with the country in the mood and circumstances it\u2019s now in.\u201d</p> <p>Even Trump\u2019s evocation of a lost golden age is less innocent than it seems.

But Trump is a believer in American exceptionalism and that\u2019s been a theme since at least the end of World War Two.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s politically attractive. Whatever one thinks about Mr Trump, he knows about symbols, he knows about advertising and he knows the kind of themes that are attractive to a broad segment of the population. I think he has concluded that a successful space program is one of the things that has those attributes.\u201d</p> <p>Thus the Trump re-election campaign claimed this week that the Obama-Biden administration neglected Nasa for years and cut its budget, forcing America\u2019s space program to rely on Russia.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to President Trump, space exploration is once again a top priority,\u201d <a href=\"https://donaldtrumpcampaign.cmail20.com/t/ViewEmail/r/E963510076CE9E4F2540EF23F30FEDED/AD067654DE1C73DFD57E886DBB2F7C8E\">it said.</a> \u201cJoe Biden, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t said much about the issue, indicating that in a Biden presidency, space exploration would take a back seat to Biden\u2019s radical, expensive climate change agenda.\u201d</p> <p>But whether such attack ads will convince voters that Trump has the right stuff remains questionable as the coronavirus focuses attention closer to home. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bob Shrum,</a> a Democratic strategist and director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cThe country would like steady, experienced leadership that listens to science and doesn\u2019t grandstand and actually cares when 100,000 people are killed.

People stumbled away gasping for breath, futilely rubbing their eyes.</p> \n<p>For a few minutes, it looked as if Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had delivered on his pledge to take back control of the streets of Minneapolis. He had said there would be no repeat on Friday of the previous night\u2019s destruction, after thousands of people stormed and burned the third precinct police station at the centre of the outrage over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">But then the crowd regrouped</a> and the test of strength began to go its way. The police couldn\u2019t fire teargas fast enough, and retreated block by block. Soon the demonstrators were back in control of the looted police station. It was a symbolic victory that only encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Waltz had threatened to send in the national guard but it was nowhere to be seen and the police suddenly seemed to evaporate.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun went down, the protesters were in control of a two-mile stretch of a busy shopping street, and much of the area around it, in the south of the city. The curfew had collapsed.</p> \n<p>Plunder and arson escalated. So did partying and drag racing after a large crowd helped themselves to the contents of a sprawling liquor store. One group set fire to a Shell petrol station. Businesses were looted wholesale except where the owners were on guard in the mostly Latino neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun rose on Saturday, a visibly furious Walz called a full mobilisation of the national guard for the first time since the second world war. He denounced the destruction as making a mockery of claims the protests were about Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walz said there were \u201celements present\u201d in the rioting of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation. He denounced \u201canarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were built up by indigenous owners\u201d and said it was overshadowing the death of Floyd.</p> \n<p>But it was also true that large numbers of people on the streets on Friday night were from Minneapolis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The city authorities had hoped the homicide charges against the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, would go some way to defuse anger on the streets. But there were immediate demands for the arrest of three other officers involved, and questions about why Chauvin was facing only third-degree murder and manslaughter charges when the common view was that he is guilty of a much more serious crime.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">Protests flared across the US</a>, from New York to Denver and Los Angeles. Seven people were shot during demonstrations in Louisville, Kentucky. Another person was killed in Detroit.</p> \n<p>Outside the White House in Washington, protesters hurled bits of brick and bottles at US Secret Service agents and police officers in riot gear. Some attempted to break through barriers and wrestled with the police.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/trump-secret-service-george-floyd-protesters-white-house\">On Saturday morning</a>, Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence.

That\u2019s what class will buy a black man in America. You don\u2019t get it quite as bad as your lower-income brethren.&nbsp;Jeff Zucker, the CNN president, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_4285f79616fbc4a7966ab7239b388bf6\">talked</a> to Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and the crew was quickly released.&nbsp;With an apology&nbsp;from the governor, not the cops. Cops rarely apologize, especially to black men.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most interesting is what happened to Josh Campbell, a white CNN journalist who was in the same area as Jimenez and not arrested. Campbell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_9023ffd063def0b1af22cb3ecdc72a06\">said</a> his experience was the \u201copposite\u201d of Jimenez\u2019s.&nbsp;The cops asked him \u201cpolitely to move here and there\u201d.&nbsp;\u201cA couple times I\u2019ve moved closer&nbsp;than they would, like,&nbsp;they asked politely to move&nbsp;back.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t pull out the&nbsp;handcuffs.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a cliche that the US has two systems of justice, separate and unequal, but I prefer the word Campbell

<p>White progressives love to focus on class subordination (I see you, Bernie Sanders!) but there is something sticky about race.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s professional status and calm demeanor did not stop the police from treating him like a regular black dude \u2013 the subject of their vast authority to detain and humiliate.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t have an actual reason and they didn\u2019t need one.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s dark skin was the offense.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is how powerful a drug white privilege is.&nbsp;Here we have the cops policing a rally protesting police brutality against a black man.&nbsp;Even in that context, when the whole world is watching figuratively, and CNN\u2019s audience is watching literally, the cops can\u2019t help themselves.&nbsp;They go all brutal lite.&nbsp;They play \u201cwho\u2019s the man\u201d even when the black man, like Jimenez, goes out of his way to show he already knows who the man is.&nbsp;\u201cYou are, officer, Sir.\u201d&nbsp;What the cops round up are the usual suspects and the usual suspects are always black and brown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole world has seen the sordid violent recording where George Floyd narrates, over 10 minutes, his own demise.&nbsp;Actually, there is not 10 minutes of narration because Floyd goes limp and silent after several minutes, but that does not cause former officer Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd\u2019s neck.&nbsp;The officers had received a radio run to go to a local store, where Floyd had allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill.&nbsp;Floyd is across the street from the store, chilling in his car with a couple of friends, when the officers approach like they are apprehending violent offenders.&nbsp;They order Floyd and his friends out of the car, put Floyd in handcuffs, order him to lie face down on the ground, and pin him down with their knees and hands.&nbsp;Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;A cop responds: \u201cWell, get up and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>&nbsp;I guess that is what you call police humor.</p> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can.&nbsp;There are rarely consequences.&nbsp;US police officers kill about 1,000 people a year &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/m62-huddersfield-us-police-shooting-chicago-uk-charts-compare-difference-killings-officers-a7507051.html\">compared</a> with the UK, where in 10 years, law enforcement took a total of 23 lives) and there are rarely consequences.&nbsp;Since 2005, when roughly 15,000 people have been killed by US law enforcement officers, fewer than 150 have been charged with murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>True,&nbsp;the officers in George Floyd\u2019s case lost their jobs, and now face or will face criminal prosecution.&nbsp;This is only because of the video evidence and the high-profile protests.&nbsp;The reality is that, statistically, even these officers are likely to escape conviction.&nbsp;Of the 150 officers charged with homicide in the line of duty, the majority have been found not guilty or had charges dropped.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the moment, we who believe in justice are supposed to be satisfied that one cop, four days after the fact, has been taken into custody, when there are multiple videos of that officer with his knee on the victim\u2019s back as the man complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a black man, and as a former prosecutor, I had no idea it was so difficult to get arrested.&nbsp;US cops arrest about 12,000,000 people a year, but not usually each other.&nbsp;For the rest of us \u2013 I mean the rest of us black and brown people \u2013 we usually get arrested and charged the same day the cops decide we are guilty.&nbsp;The talk our parents give us about how to act around armed agents of the state is designed not so much to prevent arrests as to preserve life.&nbsp;It worked for Omar Jimenez.&nbsp;</p> <p>But not for George Floyd.&nbsp;On the ground, dying, George Floyd pleads for his life, respectful as a person can be when he is asking for mercy from the people who are literally crushing the life out of him. He says \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cofficer\u201d,&nbsp;and calls out to his dead mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the police do not remove their knees and feet and hands from Mr Floyd\u2019s body.&nbsp;They don\u2019t even stop restraining him when his body is limp and silent.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s to be done?&nbsp;Tinkering with the system makes a difference here and there but it is not enough.&nbsp;If a white woman was thought to have tried to use a fake $20 bill, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the police storming her vehicle, ordering her and her friends out, placing her in handcuffs and ultimately her winding up dead.&nbsp;But as long as cops have that kind of power, people of color will bear the brunt.&nbsp;So one simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime. It\u2019s a power they can\u2019t be trusted with, because they will abuse it.</p> <p>In the end, this is not about law enforcement.&nbsp;It\u2019s about enforcing white supremacy.&nbsp;There\u2019s no tinkering with that, what with white supremacy being the foundation on which the country was built.&nbsp;The consistent big question in the quest for racial justice has been how much white supremacy is central to the identity of the US.&nbsp;This is what Barack Obama and Ta-Nehisi Coates argued about.&nbsp;If we had something approaching equal justice, would we still even be the United States?&nbsp;In order to accomplish that we\u2019d have to change the constitution, which authorizes much of the police violence that communities of color complain about, and the politics which exploits white anxiety about black and brown men.&nbsp;</p> <p>What does it mean for people of color to live in a country where, for them to have a fair shot, law and government have to be transformed?&nbsp;It means that we should expect more cases like Omar Jimenez and George Floyd, regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>The real problem, ultimately, is not bad apple cops, even though these four officers are rotten to the core.&nbsp;The real problem is demonstrated in what a bystander <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzggb/a-cop-kneeled-on-a-black-mans-neck-until-he-said-he-couldnt-breathe-he-died-at-the-hospital\">told</a> the officers as they restrained him to death.&nbsp;\u201cHe\u2019s human, bro.\u201d&nbsp;But Floyd was not human to these officers.&nbsp;Enforcing the dehumanization&nbsp;of people of color has become, in the United States, what you call police work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Butler is the Albert Brick professor in law at Georgetown University.

I\u2019m simply saying we must interrogate what we call \u201cviolence\u201d and what we call \u201cpolicy.\u201d Many of the people yelling \u201cviolence is not the answer\u201d about the riots in Minneapolis are the same people who wholeheartedly support America\u2019s endless wars. Many of the people condemning the looters in Minneapolis are the same people who venerate billionaires.

Which raises the question: if violence is never the answer, then why does America spend so much money on it?</p> <h2>Pakistani actor Uzma Khan assaulted in viral video</h2> <p>This story reads like a terrifying soap opera: three women and an entourage of 12 gunmen reportedly entered Khan\u2019s house in Lahore,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52842720\">smashed her stuff, and assaulted her and her sister</a>.

The crowd swelled to about 200 throughout the afternoon, where a steady stream of speakers gave talks and led chants. </p> \n  <p>Kenney Daniels, 57, is African American and has lived in Minneapolis for most of his life, including 22 years in the city\u2019s southern neighborhoods. He expressed concern over the destruction and violence that took place during the last few nights of protests. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201c he said, \u201cbut people are just fed up with it .. It just gets more intense every 20, 30 years.\u201d Aside from the general danger of destroying properties, he said he worried how the resulting increased presence of law enforcement would affect the conflict. \u201cI hope these officers can be held accountable so that this can stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could go a whole another ugly way, for everybody.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Aggie Heart, 59, has lived in south Minneapolis for 40 years. She came Friday with her 29-year-old daughter, Celia Thomas, and Thomas\u2019 four and 12-year-old daughters. Thomas said she hadn\u2019t attended the week\u2019s previous protests because of danger, but wanted to bring her children to the safe environment of the intersection. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the charges were a little bit lenient,\u201d said Thomas, who is a person of color, \u201cand I just hope they stick.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She expressed dismay at the destruction over the past few days. \u201cI cried for the last few nights, just looking at this place I grew up in \u2013 it\u2019s ruined,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe if something is actually happening, maybe it\u2019s for good.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Brett Davis, 60, is African American and grew up in south Minneapolis, where he has lived for most of his life. He said he thought that the protests, including ones that became destructive, provided necessary pressure for a relatively swift charging decision compared to previous police misconduct cases. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat they did made this happen,\u201d he said, adding that some of the destruction was done by people simply taking a \u201cbadge of opportunity\u201d rather than for the cause. He knows young men involved with some of the destruction well, he said. A history of feeling discriminated against for jobs by area businesses, combined with anger over the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on people of color, contributed to their decisions, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey say, we\u2019re not going to do it your old way. We\u2019re not doing the peaceful marches. We\u2019re not going to do all that ...

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

  "<p>Donald Trump has gifted a record proportion of ambassadorial posts to political appointees, rewarding wealthy supporters with minimal experience at the expense of career diplomats, according to the latest figures.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://www.afsa.org/appointments-donald-j-trump\">44% of US ambassadors</a> nominated by Trump have been political appointees, compared with a historical average of about 30%, according to the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). That percentage is getting higher. Out of the ambassador nominations so far this year, 57% have gone to political appointees.</p> <p>The dramatic increase of top posts being given to wealthy entrepreneurs like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/02/lana-marks-trump-us-ambassador-south-africa\">Lana Marks</a> \u2013 a handbag designer made US ambassador to South Africa last year \u2013 could violate the law, which requires most ambassadorial posts to go to state department diplomats, and for ambassadors to have relevant experience.</p> <p>Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat and former head of global engagement in the White House, said the number of ambassadorial openings for career diplomats was even smaller in the list of job openings being circulated this summer.</p> <p>The Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, covering the Americas, has only one ambassadorship on the list, Nicaragua, open to foreign service officers, Bruen said. Citing state department sources, he said that though there were 20 vacancies in Africa this year, the number of ambassador posts in Europe and Asia open to career diplomats was \u201cdramatically down\u201d.</p> <p>The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires that most ambassadors should be career foreign service officers, that political appointments should be a rarity, and that all appointees should be fully qualified for their positions.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that the percentage of political appointees is higher than at any time in recent history, and also with the number of nominees who do not appear to be qualified for their positions,\u201d Eric Rubin, the AFSA president, said.</p> <p>He urged the US Senate to scrutinise the qualifications of nominees with the aim of returning to the historic norm of between 25% and 35% of posts being reserved for political appointees.</p> <p>\u201cThe current percentage of about 45% is way above historical norms and has a negative impact on our diplomacy and overseas operations,\u201d Rubin said. The Senate has so far overwhelmingly backed Trump\u2019s ambassadorial nominations.</p> <p>A state department spokesperson said: \u201cThis year, like every year, career employees have a number of posts for which they can indicate interest and compete,\u201d adding the number \u201cvaries from year to year\u201d.</p> <p>The practice of giving top diplomatic posts to rich backers came under particular scrutiny during the impeachment crisis, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/20/gordon-sondland-trump-impeachment-ukraine-quid-pro-quo\">Gordon Sondland</a>, a hotelier appointed by Trump as ambassador to the European Union, played a central role in establishing a parallel policy towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> run by Trump and his lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/28/us-ambassador-appointments-are-destination-tourism-mega-rich/\">Washington Post</a> has described US ambassadorships as \u201cdestination tourism for the mega-rich\u201d. Ryan Scoville, an associate law professor at University of Marquette, published a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333988\">study of political appointee ambassadors</a> last year. Comparing the Trump administration with the Ronald Reagan era, Scoville found the new appointees were \u201cinferior in terms of language abilities, prior experience in the receiving state and region, prior experience in foreign policy and prior experience in organizational leadership\u201d.</p> <p>On the other hand, Trump appointees paid 15 times more than their Reagan counterparts in campaign contributions.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an element of being in an election year, when political favours go a long way,\u201d Bruen said.</p> <p>He argued the steady rise in the political appointees getting top jobs \u201cdemonstrates a deep distrust on the seventh floor [the leadership] of the state department and at the White House, of career foreign service officers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been systematically shut out of the policy process, they\u2019ve been sidelined when issues arose and they had concerns, and they have also been forced to bear the brunt of the president\u2019s direct wrath,\u201d Bruen added.</p>",

And it\u2019s insulting because it\u2019s actually the work of non-black people to uproot anti-blackness, and it is the work of white people to dismantle white supremacy, because it directly benefits them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd, 46, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">died under the knee of a white police officer</a> as he struggled to echo Garner\u2019s words: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> \n<p>The killing came even as the country struggled to come to grips with the cold-blooded shootings of a young jogger, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, in Georgia, and a medical technician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, by police inside her home in Kentucky.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in 2020 in America,\u201d former president Barack Obama said in a statement on Friday, alluding to another recent incident, in which a white woman in Central Park in New York <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">threatened to call police</a> on an African American birdwatcher.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to remember that for millions of Americans,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbeing treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly \u2018normal\u2019 \u2013 whether it\u2019s while dealing with the healthcare system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in the park.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe9dcc20626729d3d6d0f4dfaca5c4acdbb8807\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe9dcc20626729d3d6d0f4dfaca5c4acdbb8807/0_0_4893_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Brown, who was killed in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Brown, who was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Goldman/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Waves of activism in the wake of the Ferguson protests created reform in some cities and some police operations. Major departments in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Oakland and Los Angeles have adopted more restrictive policies governing the use of force,&nbsp;a step research indicates is effective at reducing police violence, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1180655701271732224\">Samuel Sinyangwe</a>, a data scientist and activist.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been some changes, in particularly the largest cities in America,\u201d Sinyangwe said. \u201cIn the departments that have begun to implement these changes, we\u2019ve seen reductions in police violence. It doesn\u2019t mean that is a magic solution or enough to fix this whole problem, but it is something that can make a difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is less evidence to indicate that measures such as implicit bias training or body cameras have correlated with a reduction in police violence, Sinyangwe said, although body cameras seem to have contributed to an increase in accountability for officers involved in incidents of excessive use of force.</p> \n<p>Public awareness of police violence against people of color has grown thanks to the advocacy of high-profile figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/27/lebron-james-george-floyd-death-police-colin-kaepernick\">the former football star Colin Kaepernick</a>, who was rejected by the NFL \u2013 and suffered attacks by Donald Trump \u2013 for kneeling during the national anthem.</p> \n<p>The conversation around racial justice has marginally improved in the six years since Ferguson, Packnett Cunningham said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is an improved public conversation and increased action on the part of some white people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number of people who are taking responsibility for their own actions&nbsp;has yet to reach critical mass by a long shot. But six years ago, we were simply trying to make America aware of what we suffer.</p> \n<p>\u201cSix years later many more people \u2013 not enough, but many more people \u2013 are further along in their awareness, and they\u2019re able to step much more immediately into action. And all of that is due to the painstaking work, and sometimes lethal work, of black people.\u201d</p> \n<p>DeRay Mckesson, a key organizer of the Ferguson protests and voice in the Black Lives Matter movement, reflected on the legacy of the movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/30/deray-mckesson-black-lives-matter-interview\">in an interview</a> with the Guardian last year.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt changed the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt opened up a wave of activism across a host of areas and focused citizens in a way that is truly special.\u201d</p> \n<p>But each step forward can seem to be met with two steps back. The election of Obama, for all its promise of racial unity, was followed by the election of Donald Trump, who in a tweet on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis \u201cthugs\u201d and threatened to have them shot.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>\u2018An experience of overwhelm\u2019</h2> \n<p>Even amid the coronavirus pandemic, as crime and arrests have fallen, the number of people shot and killed by on-duty police officers has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/1265295806661382156\">kept pace with recent years</a>. Unarmed black Americans are shot and killed by police at a rate <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/?arc404=true\">triple their share</a> of the population.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"354ad215-a5c0-4831-badc-b53706e17b05\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tq3tli6TJOo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes, as with the killing of Floyd, video emerges that galvanizes the public.

  "<p>In April 1936, three years before his death, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/irish-poet-wb-yeats-150th-birthday-celebrations\">WB Yeats</a> received a letter from the writer and activist Ethel Mannin. The 70-year-old Yeats was a Nobel prize-winning poet of immense stature and influence, not to mention Mannin\u2019s former lover, and she asked him to join a campaign to free a German pacifist incarcerated by the Nazis. Yeats responded instead with a reading recommendation: \u201cIf you have my poems by you, look up a poem called \u2018The Second Coming\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was written some sixteen or seventeen years ago &amp; foretold what is happening. I have written of the same thing again &amp; again since. This will seem little to you with your strong practical sense for it takes fifty years for a poet\u2019s weapons to influence the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Yeats was justified in taking the long view. Written in 1919 and published in 1920, \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d has become perhaps the most plundered poem in the English language. At 164 words, it is short and memorable enough to be famous <em>in toto</em> but it has also been disassembled into its constituent parts by books, albums, movies, TV shows, comic books, computer games, political speeches and newspaper editorials. While many poems in Yeats\u2019s corpus have contributed indelible lines to the storehouse of the cultural imagination (\u201cno country for old men\u201d; \u201cthe foul rag and bone shop of the heart\u201d), \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d consists of almost nothing <em>but</em> such lines. Someone reading it for the first time in 2020 might resemble the apocryphal theatregoer who complained that <em>Hamlet</em> was nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together. Whether or not it is Yeats\u2019s greatest poem, it is by far his most useful.

Hardly are those words out<br>When a vast image out of<em> Spiritus Mundi</em><br>Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert<br>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br>The darkness drops again; but now I know<br>That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p> </blockquote> <p>The first stanza is a series of punchy declarations about a crisis of authority, almost as if Yeats were an op-ed writer in full thunder. The oracular second stanza asks why this is happening and imagines what might follow the phase of anarchy: the second coming will be a reversal of the first. </p> <p>Yeats began \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d during the tense, eventful month of January 1919. The first world war was barely over and the Russian Revolution, which dismayed him, still unfolding, while another war was brewing on his doorstep. On 21 January, the revolutionary Irish parliament met in Dublin to declare independence while, in a quarry in Tipperary, members of the IRA killed two officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The birth of Yeats\u2019s daughter, Anne, in February was also freighted with danger. During her pregnancy, his young wife Georgie Hyde-Lees had been stricken by the Spanish flu that was burning through Europe. Events conspired to put Yeats in an apocalyptic frame of mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a3cbd890c54aa8ca775d562c80f4cc544a2eb57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a3cbd890c54aa8ca775d562c80f4cc544a2eb57/15_0_3570_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inspired by Yeats \u2026 Joni Mitchell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inspired by Yeats \u2026 Joni Mitchell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He found the metaphors to express it via hundreds of automatic writing sessions, during which Georgie convinced her husband that she was channelling the wisdom of \u201cControls\u201d and \u201cInstructors\u201d from the spirit realm. From these sessions, Yeats constructed an elaborate, world-explaining \u201cSystem\u201d, which he eventually laid out in bewildering detail in <em>A Vision</em> (1925). Crucial to \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d was the symbol of the gyre (a cone or spiral) and Yeats\u2019s conviction that history moved in 2,000-year cycles. The age of Christ (\u201ctwenty centuries of stony sleep\u201d) was coming to an end and a new era \u2013\u2013 antithetical to progress and reason \u2013\u2013 would begin with the birth of the rough beast in Bethlehem.</p> <p>Early drafts of the poem illustrate Yeats\u2019s dedication to universalising his message, as he deletes specific references to the French Revolution and the first world war and replaces terrestrial images of judges and tyrants with figures from dreams and myths. This \u201cproductive vagueness\u201d, says David Dwan, an associate professor of English at Oxford University, is what makes the poem ever-relevant.<strong> </strong>Evident, too, in the drafts is Yeats\u2019s painstaking refinement of each line. \u201cAll things have begun to break and fall apart\u201d is distilled into \u201cThings fall apart\u201d; \u201cThe centre has lost\u201d becomes \u201cThe centre cannot hold\u201d. The beast that has blandly \u201cset out\u201d for Bethlehem \u201cslouches\u201d instead. In the final version, every phrase has vigour and weight. The poem is built to last.</p> <p>\u201cThe Second Coming\u201d was published in both The Nation and The Dial in November 1920 and then in Yeats\u2019s collection <em>Michael Robartes and the Dancer</em> (1921). Yet it did not attain what Dwan calls its \u201cproblematic ubiquity\u201d until some time after the second world war. By 1963, the aphoristic couplet about the best and the worst was enough of a cliche to irritate the critic Raymond Williams. \u201cThe lines are regularly used as rhetorical tactics in the defence of anybody\u2019s sanity against anybody else\u2019s enthusiasm,\u201d he complained. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7068b38cf766877ab2c4f18de421ac52d773692b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7068b38cf766877ab2c4f18de421ac52d773692b/0_42_2164_1298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinua Achebe enshrined Things Fall Apart in the vocabulary of African independence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinua Achebe enshrined Things Fall Apart in the vocabulary of African independence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Cohea/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One reason for the poem\u2019s booming popularity was its supporting role in two influential masterpieces. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/dec/13/chinua-achebe-life-in-writing\">Chinua Achebe</a>\u2019s <em>Things Fall Apart</em> (1958) enshrined it in the vocabulary of African independence. By 1971, the Guardian observed, the title had become \u201can African catchphrase\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/21/usnationalbookawards.society\">Joan Didion</a>\u2019s essay collection <em>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</em> (1968) had a similar effect in the US at a time of stomach-churning flux. Didion opened her book with the poem because its lines had \u201creverberated in my inner ear as if they were surgically implanted there \u2026 the only images against which much of what I was seeing and hearing and thinking seemed to make any pattern.\u201d </p> <p>After Achebe and Didion, lines from the poem popped up with growing frequency in coverage of China, India, Africa, Indonesia, Northern Ireland and Britain. There was apparently no geopolitical drama to which it could not be applied.<strong> </strong>In 2007, after the Brookings Institute called its report on Iraq \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d, the New York Times claimed: \u201cThe Second Coming is fast becoming the official poem of the Iraq war.\u201d You could find similar claims being made regarding the financial crisis, the Arab spring and, now, the age of rightwing populism. In August 2016, as Trump slouched towards Washington, the Wall Street Journal declared: \u201cTerror, Brexit and US Election Have Made 2016 the Year of Yeats\u201d, after the research company Factiva found that phrases from the poem had already notched up more appearances in the press than in any other year in the previous three decades. Since then, the poem has been invoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\">Jordan Peterson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/slavojzizek\">Slavoj \u017di\u017eek</a>, ransacked for anti-Trump song titles by Moby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/31/sleater-kinney-where-to-start-in-their-back-catalogue\">Sleater-Kinney</a>, recited in the season finale of Alex Garland\u2019s <em>Devs</em>, and quoted six times in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/quiz/2015/jun/12/william-butler-yeats-life-poetry-quiz\">The life and poetry of William Butler Yeats \u2013 quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The post-2016 turn to Yeats is no surprise, because the image of the centre not holding has long made the poem a touchstone for anxious centrists. Shortly before running for president in 1968, Robert F Kennedy warned: \u201cIndeed, we seem to fulfil the vision of Yeats.\u201d In 1979, Labour grandee<strong> </strong>Roy Jenkins quoted it at the climax of his celebrated Dimbleby lecture about \u201cthe radical centre\u201d, a speech that paved the way for the launch of the SDP.</p> <p>Yeats himself was not exactly SDP material. With his taste for autocracy, contempt for the masses and fascination with fascism (at least in its first decade), he<strong> </strong>would have been surprised to find his poem deployed as a spur for the defence of liberal democracy. As late as 1934, he privately admitted in reference to Irish politics: \u201cI find myself constantly urging the despotic rule of the educated classes as the only end to our troubles.\u201d The following year, he recalled that when he was a young contrarian in the age of Victorian optimism, \u201ceverybody talked about progress, and rebellion against my elders took the form of aversion to that myth. I took satisfaction in certain public disasters, felt a sort of ecstasy at the contemplation of ruin.\u201d</p> <p>Enough of that youthful appetite for destruction survives in \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d for readers to be divided over whether Yeats fears the rough beast or welcomes it. But surely the two emotions are entangled. Just as dystopian authors get a kick out of dramatising their worst fears, great apocalyptic art has a dreadful vitality, its pulse quickening in proximity to catastrophe. The dynamic ambivalence of \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d, mingling horror with excitement, explains its embrace by popular culture. Offering the reader mayhem, terror, suspense and a mysterious nemesis,<strong> </strong>it is a kind of disaster movie for modern civilisation. A lot of money has been made from inspiring ecstasy at the contemplation of ruin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"465cee25443982a74f412e345fdb11f9a423dce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/465cee25443982a74f412e345fdb11f9a423dce0/0_59_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas in Wall Street (1987).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas in Wall Street (1987).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th-Century Fox/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In pop music, artists as diverse as the Roots, Zomby and Cristina have released records called <em>Things Fall Apart</em>.

In the final season of <em>The Sopranos</em>, reading the poem leads an anguished AJ Soprano to attempt suicide, prompting his mother to ask: \u201cWhat kind of poem is that to teach college students?!\u201d </p> <p>So many allusions in mainstream entertainment cannot be intended solely for the amusement of their writers. When Gordon Gekko quipped, \u201cSo the falcon\u2019s heard the falconer, huh?\u201d, in the film <em>Wall Street</em> (1987), it must have been assumed that more than a few viewers would clock the reference. In Stephen King\u2019s colossal bestseller <em>The Stand</em> (1978), in which a weaponised \u201csuperflu\u201d wipes out most of humanity, one character says: \u201cThe beast is on its way. It\u2019s on its way, and it\u2019s a good deal rougher than that fellow Yeets [sic] ever could have imagined. Things are falling apart.\u201d Some knowledge is also required to appreciate the parodic final line of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\u2019s <em>Good Omens</em> (1990), in which the Anti-Christ is seen \u201cslouching hopefully towards Tadfield\u201d. </p> <p>It would be unwise to claim that \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d is more relevant than ever because that has been said so many times before. If it feels especially potent now, perhaps it is because we have become painfully accustomed to the idea that progress is fragile and it is all too easy to fall back. In an age of shocking reversals, Yeats\u2019s theory of historical cycles \u2013 \u201cday &amp; night, night &amp; day for ever,\u201d as he once put it \u2013 rings true. The only consolation the poem offers is the knowledge that, for one reason or another, every generation has felt the same apocalyptic shudder that Yeats did 100 years ago. That\u2019s why it is a poem for 1919 and 1939 and 1968 and 1979 and 2001 and 2016 and today and tomorrow. Things fall apart, over and over again, yet the beast never quite reaches Bethlehem.</p>",

But since then that narrative has shifted dramatically. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black Democratic member of Congress, said Friday that the riots damaged the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s chances of being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate due to her record as a prosecutor in the city.</p> \n<p>Clyburn has argued that Biden should pick an African American woman, which would certainly draw a sharp contrast with Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think right now what you\u2019re seeing is black voters get to see how Donald Trump reacts to things like this. It\u2019s a reminder of his history, his history of calling on law enforcement to be more aggressive, to be more brutal in their enforcement of the law,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Brandon Davis. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Davis added: \u201cI think in the next several months this is going to continue to be front and center in the conversation.

He is abusing the past to distort the present, in order to control the future. But the past is not as malleable as Fox News.</p> <p>The symmetries between the past Kushner seeks to exploit and the discreditable present are striking. If there is any resemblance of the Trump mutation of the Republican party to any actual party in the election of 1856 it is not to the Republicans. Nor is it to the Democrats. Rather, it is to the third party in that campaign, the American party, also known as the Know Nothings, who also had a concise platform.&nbsp;</p> <p>The original American party sought to protect the purity of white native-born Protestants from the first great wave of immigration to the United States, which consisted mostly of the Irish and Germans, and to stigmatize a subversive religion.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans must rule America,\u201d its platform proclaimed. Only native-born citizens should be allowed to hold any public office, federal, state or municipal. Catholics, described in the category of those pledging \u201callegiance or obligation of any description to any foreign prince, potentate or power\u201d, were to be proscribed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Know Nothings emerged from the crack-up of the Whig party over the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories. Most regarded themselves as Old Whigs, \u201cconservatives in principle\u201d in the words of their party platform. Their standard-bearer was Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president, a decorous figurehead. The Democrats nominated James Buchanan, a northern man of southern sympathy, a distinguished former senator from Pennsylvania, the crucial swing state.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln, a lifelong Whig, forged the Illinois Republican party in 1856 out of a cacophony of contending factions, including radical abolitionists, Whigs, dissident antislavery Democrats and liberal German immigrants. Lincoln despised Know Nothingism.</p> <p>In 1855, he wrote that if the movement ever won power it would rewrite the Declaration of Independence: \u201cWhen the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Lincoln worked to undermine the Know Nothings, break up their party and bring some of its former Whig adherents to his new cause. In order to hold together their fragile coalition, Lincoln in Illinois and Republicans nationally advanced the singular goal of prohibiting slavery in the territories.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate in 1856, John C Fremont, was a famous western explorer and senator from California. Both the \u201cAmericans\u201d and the Democrats mounted vicious smear campaigns against him: that he was not native-born but of foreign birth, illegitimate and a secret Catholic. \u201cTrial by mud,\u201d his wife Jessie Benton Fremont called it.</p> <p>Two years later, running for the Senate, Lincoln declared that immigrants who believe in the Declaration of Independence\u2019s precept that \u201call men are created equal\u201d are \u201cour equals in all things \u2026 as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are.

  "<p>As Twitter for the second time in a single week took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">unprecedented action</a>&nbsp;against a tweet by Donald Trump, Facebook declined to take any enforcement action against the president\u2019s statements.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threatening statement on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Thursday night, \u201cAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/looting-starts-shooting-starts.html\">echoed</a>&nbsp;a racist 1960s police chief known for ordering patrols of black neighborhoods with shotguns and dogs. It was widely interpreted as a threat and potential incitement to violence against residents of the Twin Cities who have erupted in protest against the alleged police killing of George Floyd, a black man who begged for his life as a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">Trump signs executive order to narrow protections for social media platforms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twitter responded by invoking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/27/twitter-warning-labels-tweets-violate-site-rules\">policy it enacted in June 2019</a>&nbsp;to address the then-hypothetical situation of a major world leader violating its rules in a way that could cause real-world harm. The policy allows the company to maintain the tweet for the purpose of accountability and the public record, but hide it behind a warning label.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance,\u201d the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1266272863222292480\">explained</a>.</p> <p>Facebook, on the other hand, left the Trump post on the platform. The company has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence\">explicit rules</a>&nbsp;against speech that could inspire or incite violence, but it has taken no action against Trump\u2019s statement. As of Friday evening, the Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10164767134275725?__xts__[0]=68.ARD2X076najMYm_pwm0iMhcYKoJY3mmAo1ICS2DteP5riQcwIH0PoMdQeuzbRbOlN1ZoSizGRHzhUMU2PDODI6V2fgEkBjWL-KNHj6Lh_qvCrJHP3_0UsoxLA2RIo_aw4Y9RKZHF1Zk3ALeKy-kkwBfF3EtNJUU6mHVGmmDhauCcbr6V6Pblv-faEYSX_3wXECHQlbBWnfPaC0kViMqxV-uOP9BDYJ_96xTuTFC-B9xV8u16M05WYUsnh-iDibxMLFr1nZyKkFz8oOKiTxmD2phkceYwbfMGR2TWOf8_eaqWfUqtV6zTr2hWwENQAFGukoyCVKvOT0lwdn6g&amp;__tn__=-R\">post</a>&nbsp;had been shared more than 65,000 times and received 196,000 likes, 32,000 heart emojis, and 6,600 laughing emojis.</p> <p>The text was also overlaid on a photo of Trump for the president\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwoli1hbcP/\">Instagram account</a>, where it has received more than 433,000 likes.</p> <p>And while Facebook has made a controversial decision to exempt politicians from its third-party factchecking process, there is no such exception for incitement to violence.</p> <p>On Friday evening, Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, defended Facebook\u2019s decision to allow the post by arguing that Facebook has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear if that policy had ever been articulated by Facebook before. In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111961824369871\">post</a> on his personal Facebook page, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cPersonally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric \u2026 I disagree strongly with how the president spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d</p> <p>Threats of violence by state actors on its platforms have long been a tricky topic for the company. Facebook was used by Buddhist extremists and military officials in Myanmar to incite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis\">hatred and violence</a> against that country\u2019s Muslim minority, the Rohingya, in 2017 \u2013 a campaign of ethnic cleansing that culminated in the killing of 25,000 Rohingya and the forced displacement of 700,000 more. </p> <p>Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/06/facebook-admits-it-has-not-done-enough-to-quell-hate-in-myanmar\">admitted to failings</a>&nbsp;in Myanmar in 2018 and eventually banned many of the hate preachers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-removes-accounts-myanmar-military-un-report-genocide-rohingya\">military leaders</a> who had used the platform to inspire genocide.</p>"
