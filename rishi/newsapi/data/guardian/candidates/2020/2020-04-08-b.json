Stories of confusion have accompanied the sharp rise in deaths, from cases of mistaken identity to days-long searches for the bodies of loved ones who have passed away. </p> \n  <p>For Mercedes Maroto, the saga began when her mother, Teodora, was admitted to a hospital in central Spain last month. Days later, after a full day had passed without any news, Maroto and her siblings began calling the hospital.</p> \n  <p>It took four attempts before they got a doctor on the line. He informed them that their mother had passed away, Maroto told Spanish newspaper El Mundo.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a8dff8c6b79a0ae2d2781e97305b61a7e1d932f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a8dff8c6b79a0ae2d2781e97305b61a7e1d932f/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman rests in front a shop in Pamplona, northern Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman rests in front a shop in Pamplona, northern Spain.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c1lvaro Barrientos/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The news left the family reeling, particularly Maroto\u2019s father. \u201cHe kept repeating, between sobs: \u2018Now what do I do without you?\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>After a sleepless night punctuated with questions \u2013 How did she die?

She rushed over to the hospital where a doctor helped her speak to her mother on the phone.</p> \n  <p>While she described it as the \u201cworst experience of her life\u201d, Maroto shied away from casting blame, pointing to the chaos that has taken hold at Spanish hospitals as they scramble to treat the sudden influx of thousands of thousands of Covid-19 patients.</p> \n  <p>Her mother is now home and slowly regaining her strength.

What has been widely reported as the end of Wuhan\u2019s lockdown is somewhat different from his lived experience, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>What you\u2019ve seen happen today is the \u2018exit door\u2019 open to allow thousands of people who have been trapped in Wuhan for 76 days to finally go home.<br></p> \n   <p>Life for residents of Wuhan is still more restricted than UK\u2019s so-called lockdown. Each district is controlled by its own local authority so it\u2019s not entirely uniform but the basics are the same.</p> \n   <p>To leave the community residence you need a green health code via an app on your phone. This is tied to your Chinese ID card and logs who you are and where you are. Your temperature is also taken.</p> \n   <p>To use the limited public transport you also need to log in and out using the app. Foreigners don\u2019t have an ID card so they can\u2019t use it.</p> \n   <p>Anyone returning to work also needs a special certificate verifying that the business has been given permission to restart. Otherwise you\u2019re expected to return to your home within two hours.</p> \n   <p>Restaurants, cafes, stores, anywhere that people might gather are still closed.

Drafted into the US army, but fortunate enough to escape a tour of duty in Vietnam, he spent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/21/golden-daze-50-years-on-from-summer-of-love-san-francisco-festivals\">Summer of Love</a> stationed in Germany. Prine arrived back in the US at the end of 1967, just as rock music began to leave psychedelic experiments behind and head earthbound again, which suited him just fine.</p> \n  <p>He was born in 1946 and learned to write songs during the early 60s folk revival by imitating the Carter Family. Eighteen months after he returned to civilian life in Chicago, he saw Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash performing together on the latter\u2019s TV show. \u201cI thought the music I was playing and writing, it\u2019d fit straight in-between the two of \u2019em,\u201d he recalled in 2019. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost uniquely among the glut of early 70s singer-songwriters, Prine \u2013 who has died aged 73 \u2013 seemed untouched by the countercultural events of the preceding years: he seemed to tap into an earlier musical tradition, \u201can authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia\u201d, as critic Robert Christgau noted of Prine\u2019s eponymous 1971 debut album. </p> \n  <p>He was not given to writing starry-eyed paeans to the denizens of the Woodstock festival. His albums never sounded as if they had emerged from the stoned, eucalyptus-scented idyll of Laurel Canyon. There was something tough and austere about them, perhaps because of Prine\u2019s voice \u2013 a rough, artless, nasal rasp that Dylan suggested sounded as if Prine had swallowed a jew\u2019s harp. It got more gravelly as the years progressed and he recovered first from neck, then from lung cancer.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-songwriter-bob-dylan-johnny-cash-bruce-springsteen\">John Prine: this extraordinarily gifted songwriter was the envy of all</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8d31338f08ec70cecec8b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T02:12:40.183Z\">3.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rosanne Cash, Johnny Cash\u2019s daughter has tweeted about John Prine\u2019s death: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rosannecash/status/1247706520596463616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just give me one thing I can hold on to.

The declaration was criticised by some as coming several days too late, but others say the organisation\u2019s awareness of the dangers was held back by China\u2019s government, which initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">suppressed information about the initial outbreak in Wuhan</a>, and refused entry to WHO experts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"480638f95d9ca11ed814ab08d3878eb9b70b1328\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/480638f95d9ca11ed814ab08d3878eb9b70b1328/0_125_3760_2256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump rails against the WHO at a White House coronavirus briefing on 5 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump rails against the WHO at a White House coronavirus briefing on 5 April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On the same day Trump was confidently predicting the coronavirus did not present a serious threat to the US, assuring Americans: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a very good ending.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gavin Yamey, the director of Duke University\u2019s center for policy impact in global health, said: \u201cIf the United States had followed the WHO\u2019s very clear advice on identifying cases, isolating cases and conducting contact tracing, then it wouldn\u2019t be in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/us-coronavirus-death-toll-latest-one-day-high\">the appalling situation that it is in today</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite its declaration, the WHO did not advocate travel restrictions of the sort imposed by Trump a day later on non-American travellers arriving from China. The president has pointed to this as an example of bad advice.

She became national spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, then for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.</p> <p>A survey of past remarks and tweets suggests she is perfectly qualified for the job of being his master\u2019s voice \u2013 and attacking his nemesis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>. For instance, she embraced the original sin of Trumpian politics: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">birtherism</a>. It is the conspiracy theory that Obama, America\u2019s first black president, was not born in the US but rather in Kenya.</p> <p>On 29 August 2012, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/240993516443037698?s=20\">McEnany tweeted:</a> \u201cHow I Met Your Brother -- Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/stephanie-grisham-out-as-trumps-press-secretary-after-never-briefing-the-press\">Kayleigh McEnany replaces Stephanie Grisham as Trump press secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with the spurious dig at Obama, who was born in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hawaii\">Hawaii</a>, the tweet also traded on stereotypes of Africans living in huts. Highlighting the tweet on Tuesday, Richard Painter, a former White House chief ethics lawyer, wrote: \u201cWhat is this? A KKK rally in the White House?\u201d</p> <p>As president, Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/donald-trump-shithole-countries-tweet-denies-immigration-talks\">called</a> African nations \u201cshithole countries\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">said</a> of a deadly white supremacist protest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/16/why-is-the-us-still-fighting-the-civil-war\">Charlottesville</a>, Virginia: \u201cYou also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\u201d But McEnany told the Fox Business Network in May 2018: \u201cThe president has come out multiple times saying he denounces all racism. We all denounce racism, that would include the president.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2017, she tried to defend Trump\u2019s frequent golfing by turning the tables on Obama over the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/daniel-pearl\">Daniel Pearl</a>, a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan.</p> <p>\u201cYou had President Obama, who after the \u2013 I believe it was the beheading of Daniel Pearl \u2013 spoke to how upset he was about that, then rushed off to a golf game,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/28/pro-trump-pundit-accuses-obama-of-golfing-after-daniel-pearls-slaying-in-2002/\">she claimed on CNN.</a> \u201cI think when we\u2019re in a state of war, when we\u2019re in a state of mourning, you should take time off from the golf course.\u201d</p> <p>But when Pearl died in 2002, Obama was still a state senator. McEnany subsequently apologised, explaining she meant to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/james-foley\">James Foley</a>, a photojournalist kidnapped in Syria and beheaded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in 2014.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/20/president-trump-made-16241-false-or-misleading-claims-his-first-three-years/\">According to a Washington Post count,</a> Trump made 16,241 false or misleading claims in his first three years in office. But on 28 August 2019, McEnany told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe the president has lied.\u201d</p> <p>And taking her cue from the president, McEnany played down the threat of the coronavirus. On Trish Regan\u2019s Fox Business Network show in late February, she praised Trump\u2019s partial Chinese travel ban <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1247543589833527297?s=20\">and asserted:</a> \u201cWe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. And isn\u2019t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d</p> <p>Regan later parted ways with the network after calling the coronavirus an \u201cimpeachment scam\u201d. McEnany has been rewarded with a senior job at the White House.</p> <p>On 28 February, McEnany appeared on Fox News. \u201cWhat is bad for America is good for Democrats. It\u2019s incredible that they think this way. They root against the stock market. They root for this [coronavirus] to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking down President Trump. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, with the Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">presidential</a> candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> and then candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> having cancelled campaign rallies, she was asked on the Fox Business Network whether Trump would follow suit. She wasn\u2019t worried, she insisted. \u201cLook, we have the commander-in-chief, we have the best health experts, we are taking it day by day, we are currently proceeding as normal,\u201d McEnany said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look, Joe Biden, he\u2019s suspending his rallies. He\u2019s been dying to get off the campaign trail. The man can only speak for seven minutes \u2026 The media\u2019s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies \u2026 they know it\u2019s his avenue to speak directly to the American people.\u201d</p> <p>Later that day, the Trump campaign did cancel rallies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate crisis</a>, McEnany has a history of denying the scientific consensus that humans are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/climate-emergency-global-action-way-off-track-says-un-head-coronavirus\">heating the planet</a>, primarily by burning fossil fuels.</p> <p>In 2014, when climate protesters marched during a cold winter in Washington DC, McEnany told Fox News: \u201cThe science is not settled, so let\u2019s stop the liberal hysteria, take a break from the protesting, go get some hot cocoa, sit inside.\u201d</p> <p>The Fox host Neil Cavuto and McEnany laughed as an Occidental College professor explained that the vast majority of qualified climatologists agreed on the climate threat.</p> <p>McEnany countered that \u201cin the 1970s it was global cooling\u201d and \u201cthey always change the verbiage. It\u2019s the verbiage to justify the liberal mechanisms that they would like to put in place.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany also claimed corruption of the scientific process, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s be real. Who\u2019s getting the grants? Who are the liberal universities giving the grants to? Of course it\u2019s going to be people who buy into the fact that global warming does exist.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, McEnany has shifted to focusing on the costs of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>In February, McEnany <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1225979282574454784?s=20\">tweeted</a> that the Democratic plan for climate change was \u201cto eliminate more than 1 million jobs in America by eliminating the fossil fuel industry. Kill the economy!\u201d</p> <p>Last July, she mocked the former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a> candidates <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1156359752714194944?s=20\">Pete Buttigieg</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1156580949104218115?s=20\">Beto O\u2019Rourke</a> for emphasizing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">narrowing window</a> for addressing the crisis.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s first two press secretaries were caught in lies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sean-spicer\">Sean Spicer</a> began by claiming about Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period \u2013 both in person and around the globe.\u201d Sarah Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-lying-comey\">admitted</a> that her claims that she personally communicated with \u201ccountless\u201d FBI officials about Trump\u2019s decision to fire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\">James Comey</a> was a \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d.</p> <p>Then came Stephanie Grisham, who became the press secretary and White House communications director last June but never gave a formal press briefing. Grisham will rejoin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump\">Melania Trump</a>\u2019s office in a new role as chief of staff.</p> <p>McEnany is a rising star in Trumpworld despite \u2013 or because of \u2013 her misstatements. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\">Brad Parscale</a>, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, said: \u201cKayleigh McEnany is a first-class professional who will serve President Trump and the American people well. She has been one of the strongest assets to the president\u2019s re-election campaign with her keen mind, positive attitude, strong faith, and tireless work ethic.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Senior officials at the World Health Organization have pushed back at calls by Donald Trump to withhold funding from the organisation, and by Trump\u2019s supporters for the resignation of its head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are still in the acute phase of a pandemic, so now is not the time to cut back on funding,\u201d Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, told a virtual briefing in response to a question about Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> \n<p>Asked about Trump\u2019s remarks at the WHO daily briefing in Geneva, Tedros declined to address the issue directly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t waste time pointing fingers. We need time to unite \u2026 Let\u2019s unite \u2026 The worst is yet to come if we don\u2019t rush to ensure unity.\u201d</p> \n<p>The row came as the US recorded its highest toll from the virus in a single day, with more than 1,800 coronavirus deaths.<strong> </strong>Trump and key Republican supporters and sympathetic media outlets have recently escalated a months-long campaign accusing the WHO of being biased towards China, and demanding a congressional investigation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The latest flare-up, which appears designed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/trump-coronavirus-who-funding-deaths-briefing\">distract attention</a> from Trump\u2019s record during the outbreak, has fuelled concerns among WHO insiders that the campaign could dangerously undermine confidence in the organisation\u2019s advice at a crucial time.</p> \n<p>Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, has begun to return to normal life, raising fears among some US rightwingers that China\u2019s economic recovery could steal a march while the US is in the midst of its own outbreak.</p> \n<p>Trump said the WHO had been \u201cwrong about a lot of things\u201d and threatened to put a hold on WHO funding.

The criticism brings together a series of rightwing preoccupations including a distrust of UN bodies, pro-Taiwan activism, and a fear that China\u2019s economy could recover before that of the US.</p> \n<p>Trump and his supporters suggest the WHO did not raise the alarm in time about coronavirus, but as early as 7 January senior US health officials reporting to the Trump administration were brought into key conversations at the WHO.</p> \n<p>As a major investigation by the Washington Post last week made clear, it was not only through these channels that the Trump administration was being warned early of the risk of a global outbreak.</p> \n<p>Throughout the early weeks, from January and into February, senior officials including health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, struggled to command Trump\u2019s attention over the disease.</p> \n<p>In late January the president opened himself to criticism for the same thing that his supporters now accuse the WHO and its head of: publicly praising China\u2019s approach, arguing that if he put more pressure on the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, Beijing would be less likely to share data.</p> \n<p>Trump has also claimed that the WHO was suggesting the virus was \u201cno big deal\u201d before the US president announced his travel restrictions on China \u2013 restrictions opposed by the organisation as ineffective.</p> \n<p>But far from suggesting the outbreak was \u201cno big deal\u201d, the organisation had declared coronavirus a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d on 30 January \u2013 defined as an \u201can extraordinary event\u201d that may \u201crequire a coordinated international response\u201d to stop its spread across borders.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a>, the 78-year-old senator from Vermont who reshaped American politics with his youth-led movement for sweeping social change, on Wednesday ended his presidential campaign for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a> Democratic nomination.</p> \n<p>His withdrawal from the race all but ensures the former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> will be the Democratic presidential nominee in an election against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> as the coronavirus pandemic thrusts the US deeper into an economic and public health crisis.</p> \n<p>In a livestream from his home in Vermont, Sanders formally announced that he was suspending his second bid for the presidency, capping what has been an extraordinary rise from relative obscurity to standard-bearer of the American left as an unabashed democratic socialist who championed the working class and called for political revolution.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>\u201cI cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,\u201d Sanders said in a defiant yet gracious remarks.</p> \n<p>The Vermont senator said he had reached the conclusion that there was no \u201cfeasible path\u201d for his candidacy after weeks of consultation with his wife, Jane, and top campaign advisers. Sanders informed staff of the decision, which he called \u201cdifficult and painful\u201d, during conference call on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>Though Sanders made clear that Biden would be the party\u2019s next nominee \u2013 and that he would actively support the former vice-president \u2013 he said his name would remain on the ballot and he would continue to amass delegates in an effort to \u201cexert significant influence\u201d over the Democratic platform.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/we-cant-rely-on-trump-in-this-unprecedented-crisis-congress-must-lead-the-way\">We can't rely on Trump in this unprecedented crisis.

The state was also the beginning of the end for Sanders in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>, during his first campaign for the Democratic nomination when he challenged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>. Though he fell short of the nomination, his insurgent candidacy reinvigorated the American left.</p> \n<p>For weeks, Sanders resisted calls to leave the race despite falling almost hopelessly behind his rival as the pandemic forced the candidates to retreat from the campaign trail and governors to delay several key primary elections. </p> \n<p>In the final weeks before his exit, Sanders effectively turned his campaign into a coronavirus response effort.</p> \n<p>He said the unprecedented public health crisis exposed the \u201ccruelty and absurdity\u201d of the American healthcare system, which he would like to see replaced by a Medicare for All program. But his efforts did not shift the political reality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"be6a792d-6ae8-4a41-a528-61f0c78a12d3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nLM9bm11sVI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though the early days of the primary were shaped by a robust contest of ideas, Democrats\u2019 overriding priority was not ideology but electability. In March the race abruptly narrowed from a historically diverse field of candidates to two white men in their 70s. Suddenly fearful that a democratic socialist would jeopardize their chances against Trump in November, Democrats in states from Florida to Washington, Michigan to Texas aligned behind Biden, ultimately denying Sanders a path forward.</p> \n<p>Sanders called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Biden</a> a \u201cvery decent man\u201d and said he would work together with the former vice-president to ensure Trump is defeated in November.</p> \n<p>In a lengthy statement, Biden said Sanders \u201chasn\u2019t just run a political campaign, he\u2019s created a movement\u201d and thanked him for being a \u201cpowerful voice for a fairer and more just America\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou will be heard by me,\u201d Biden said, addressing the senator directly. \u201cAs you say: \u2018Not me, us\u2019\u201d \u2013 which was the Sanders campaign motto.</p> \n<p>Trump also weighed in, ever eager to fan the flames of discord among Democrats. On Twitter, he blamed the Massachusetts senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> for Sanders\u2019 string of Super Tuesday defeats and suggested the party had conspired against Sanders.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Bernie people should come to the Republican Party,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>Sanders, ever strongest in the role of underdog, fought his way back into contention after suffering a heart attack in October and was all but written out of the race. As Warren, an ideological ally turned rival,<strong> </strong>fell behind, Sanders consolidated support on the left and, for a time, was the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.</p> \n<p>But he only found success when his opponents were divided.

The only thing that mattered was column inches. We used Trump and he used us. It was a shameless, but, it seemed, harmless, relationship.</p> <p>All the time, however, Trump was learning the media world \u2013 developing a cunning understanding of how a quote or sound bite can be picked up across America, rebroadcast on TV and radio and make its way around the world; understanding how fame and a complete lack of self-censorship were a powerful combination.</p> <p>In those days, much of the backwards and forwards was fun.

In fact, Trump was more comfortable and coherent discussing gossip items as he is trying to inspire a frightened country.</p> <p>It\u2019s frightening enough that, with few exceptions, he surrounds himself with fawning acolytes who massage his ego with an obsequiousness that would bring shame in North Korea.

Florida <a href=\"https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/vote-by-mail/\">allows people</a> to vote by mail regardless of whether they are in the state or not. Trump also falsely said that \u201cyou get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody\u2019s living room, signing ballots all over the place\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado\">Colorado</a>, one of the states that uses all vote-by-mail, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">has a Republican U</a><a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">senator</a>.</p> <p>Republican officials in other states are also pushing voters to cast ballots by mail.

He later claimed he was referring to the potential for fraud.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio\">Ohio</a>, Republicans who control the legislature approved a plan to go to an all-mail election on 28 April after the governor cancelled in-person voting in March.</p>",

One of the very pleasing elements of the payments that the minister for government services has outlined is that when those payments have come through for Indigenous communities, there has been a very large amount of food in those communities, and that is fantastic, we were so pleased.</p> \n   <p>And I want to thank everybody involved, including the member for Barton, for the messaging that was going into Indigenous communities about how those payments might be used in those circumstances. </p> \n   <p>This was a tremendous result, obviously that has led to some supply shortages going into those communities and I know the minister for Indigenous Australians is working directly with the executive chair of the Covid commission, <strong>Neville Power</strong>,<strong> </strong>to make sure those supply lines of those food stocks going back into those communities is being refreshed as we speak. </p> \n   <p>That is one of the key tasks of the coordination commission \u2013 a group of very successful, very practical problem-solving people from the private sector, who are able to work through logistics issues, food supply chain issues, working out of the ministry of home affairs, <strong>Paul Gibson</strong> is the deputy secretary there, also leading a team working on the supply chain issues, not getting just supplies of food to remote Indigenous communities but also rural communities, regional communities, so we are not just restocking shopping centres and supermarkets in the cities but across the country. Another key issue they are working on is not just supplying the big supermarkets and big shopping centres but corner stores \u2013 we want people to stay home and we don\u2019t want them going too far for what they need. In Indigenous communities they have no choice.</p> \n   <p>I want to commend the chief minister Gunner for the great job he is doing in the Northern Territory in securing these communities, but getting through to them is an important task and I can assure the member that the Covid commission working together with the minister for Indigenous affairs is working with the premiers of the states to make sure supply lines are replenished and support will be in place for those communities.</p> \n   <p>Of all the issues we discussed at national cabinet, our biggest concern of all the vulnerable communities in Australia is Indigenous communities. Recently I spoke to prime minister Trudeau and it is a similar issue in Canada for the remote Indigenous communities in Canada. We are employing very similar measures, we had a good discussion about that, to protect, insulate but maintain supply of support to those communities, not just food but essential services whether it be health, or indeed protection for people in those communities.

We expect the government debt burden to weaken materially as a result.</p> \n  <p><strong>We have revised our outlook on Australia to negative from stable to reflect a substantial deterioration of its fiscal headroom at the AAA rating level.</strong> At the same time, we are affirming our AAA/A-1+ long- and short-term local and foreign currency ratings.<br></p> \n  <p>Our ratings on Australia benefit from the country\u2019s strong institutional settings, its wealthy economy, and monetary policy flexibility. <strong>The country\u2019s high external and household indebtedness as well as its vulnerability to weak commodity export demand moderate these strengths.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Rating Action</strong><br></p> \n  <p>On April 8, 2020, S&amp;P Global Ratings revised the outlook on its long-term ratings on <a href=\"https://app.ratings.spglobal.com/x0T0040u28f0gFM0erhwlSg\">Australia</a> to negative from stable.

With household indebtedness at elevated levels, this could delay the process of repairing the government balance sheet beyond what we expect currently. Government indebtedness and interest costs will remain at elevated levels.</p> \n  <p><strong>Upside scenario</strong></p> \n  <p>The outlook could revert to stable if the general government fiscal balance improves in line with our expectations as the economy recovers or if Australia\u2019s external position improves. Stronger fiscal and external positions would provide the sovereign with a buffer to absorb another potential economic or financial shock.</p> \n  <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p> \n  <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has dealt Australia a severe economic and fiscal shock. We expect the Australian economy to plunge into recession for the first time in almost 30 years, causing a substantial deterioration of the government\u2019s fiscal headroom at the AAA rating level. The large budget deficits that we project in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are likely temporary and do not represent a structural weakening of fiscal performance.

  "<p>In this unprecedented moment in American history, we need an unprecedented legislative response. President Trump is incapable of providing leadership, and instead continues to mislead the public and act out of political self-interest. So it is Congress that must lead, and it must do so now.</p> <p>With anxiety growing, everyone in our country needs to know that, in the midst of this horrific pandemic and economic meltdown, their government is doing everything possible to keep them healthy and financially secure.</p> <p>In other words, we need to build upon and expand the recent stimulus package with new and bolder emergency legislation which must be passed as soon as possible. Here are a few core principles that must be included in that legislation.</p> <p>First, Congress must explicitly authorize that the Defense Production Act is fully utilized to demand that the private sector start delivering the equipment and products that our medical personnel desperately need in order to treat their patients. We cannot rely on Trump to do it.</p> <p>Recent reporting has revealed that the Trump administration did not start ordering crucial equipment like masks until March. It is beyond comprehension that, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, doctors and nurses throughout the country are putting their lives on the line because they lack an adequate supply of surgical masks, gloves and gowns. We must also produce the ventilators as well as the various kinds of testing kits that we need now and will need in the future, as well as the dwindling supply of certain prescription drugs that are essential to treat the virus. States and hospitals should not have to compete against each other. The federal government must take the lead in coordinating efforts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now more than any point in recent history, we are in this together. We must act with love, compassion and urgency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Further, during this crisis, every American must be able to receive all of the healthcare they need regardless of income. Before the pandemic, 87 million people were uninsured or underinsured. That number is rapidly escalating as millions of workers are not only losing their jobs but are also losing their employer-based health insurance.</p> <p>The cost of hospital treatment for the coronavirus amounts to tens of thousands of dollars. Tragically, we have already seen people who have delayed treatment due to concerns about cost. In this pandemic, lack of insurance will lead to more deaths and more Covid-19 transmissions.</p> <p>As long as this pandemic continues, Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for the uninsured and the underinsured. No one in America who is sick, regardless of immigration status, should be afraid to seek the medical treatment they need during this national crisis.</p> <p>Obviously, Congress must not only address the pandemic crisis, it must also act with a fierce sense of urgency to effectively deal with the economic crisis as well.</p> <p>In the last two weeks, a record-breaking 10 million people filed unemployment claims \u2013 more than during the entire 2008 Great Recession. Frighteningly, the St Louis Federal Reserve projects that 47 million more people may become unemployed by the end of June, with unemployment reaching 32%. While such estimates may be a worst-case scenario, the reality of the pandemic has taught us that worst-case scenarios are what we must plan for. For the sake of working families all over this country, we must be prepared for all contingencies.</p> <p>We cannot wait before taking the bold action that is necessary. In my view, it makes a lot more sense to prevent the collapse of our economy than figuring out how we put it back together after it crumbles. Simply stated, that means that every worker must keep receiving his or her paycheck and benefits during the crisis. In the recent emergency relief bill, Congress appropriated over $25bn in grants to the airline companies so that 2 million workers in that industry will continue to receive their full paycheck and benefits through 30 September. And that is exactly what we must do for every worker in America. This is not a radical idea. It is similar to what France, Norway, Denmark, the UK and other countries are doing.</p> <p>Further, as quickly as possible, we must get money into the hands of people by immediately providing a $2,000 monthly emergency payment to every person in the country until the crisis has passed.</p> <p>In addition, we must guarantee paid medical and sick leave to all workers. It has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package. We have got to increase this figure to 100%.</p> <p>Moreover, workers who are on the frontlines of this crisis including those who work in grocery stores, warehouses, paramedics, nurses, pharmacies, domestic workers, postal workers, farm workers, public transit, truck drivers and janitors must receive $500 a week hazard pay, childcare and a safe and secure workplace.</p> <p>Finally, we must put an immediate moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shut-offs, and suspend payments on rent and mortgage loans for primary residences during this crisis.</p> <p>This is a frightening and devastating time for our country, and the world. Never before in our lifetimes have we had to deal with both a public health pandemic and an economic meltdown.</p> <p>The American people deserve and require leadership from Washington that acts aggressively, puts working people first, and provides peace-of-mind to the most vulnerable people in our country. Now more than any point in recent history, we are in this together. We must act with love, compassion and urgency.</p> <p>Historians will look back at this time to see how we dealt with this unprecedented crisis. I hope they will observe that we responded with the courage and boldness that the moment required.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bernie Sanders is US senator from Vermont and a Democratic presidential candidate</p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>Eire salutes the republic</h2> <p><strong>Day of modified rejoicing: two sorts of disapproval and a mass of indifference</strong><br>From our special correspondent<br>18 April 1949</p> <p><em>Dublin, Monday, 1 am<br></em>The first ceremonies to mark the promulgation of the Republic of Ireland Act to-day took place in Dublin at midnight, when a salute of 21 guns and a feu de joie were fired from O\u2019Connell Bridge. The main civil, military, and religious ceremonies are at noon to-day at the Pro-Cathedral and at the General Post Office in Dublin.</p> <p>Dublin is crowded, though not all the visitors are \u201cup for the Republic,\u201d and not more than one in ten is wearing any of the Republican emblems which are being hawked in the streets. Although the crowds were calm throughout the day they became a little more excited towards midnight and collected in thousands round O\u2019Connell Bridge. At 11 45 p.m. it seemed impossible that the guns, riflemen, and band would ever get into position, for the crowd had overflowed rather than forced its way past the police cordon and had occupied all the open space which should have held the ceremonial troops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/20/republic-fight-irish-independence-townshend-review\">The Republic: the Fight for Irish Independence 1918-1923 by Charles Townshend \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A republic is born</strong><br>In spite of this there was a delay of only two minutes in the start of the ceremony. The guns flashed and boomed, firing across O\u2019Connell Bridge in the direction of Liberty Hall, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2016/mar/30/1916-easter-rising-guardian-reports-archive\">in 1916 was shelled by British guns</a> which were not loaded with blank rounds. After the salute riflemen performed their feu de joie, the band played the national anthem, and the crowd began to disperse, waving flags, cheering, and singing. For once a republic had been born without bloodshed \u2013 at least in this case the blood had been shed 33 years ago.</p> <p>At Dun Laoghaire the ceremony was rather more naval than military. A flag was raised at the end of one of the piers and was illuminated by searchlights from craft in the harbour. A naval guard of honour presented arms and the National Anthem was played.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d36c03f57bc77372cfb0a9d51880552a9ffe039a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d36c03f57bc77372cfb0a9d51880552a9ffe039a/0_0_2656_3924/677..jpg\" alt=\"Sean T Kelly, president of Ireland, takes the salute at the parade celebrating Ireland\u2019s status as an independent republic, 1949.\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean T Kelly, president of Ireland, takes the salute at the parade celebrating Ireland\u2019s status as an independent republic, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Irish military genius, which has so often been expended in the service of other nations (especially of England), will have a chance to express itself in the march past the President outside the General Post Office. The parade will be partly mechanised and will include a unit of the small naval service, two battalions of the local defence force, infantry, anti-aircraft gunners, sappers, signallers, field artillery, and a field ambulance. The centrepiece of the ceremony will be the hoisting of the tricolour on the Post Office, where it flew for those few days in 1916 which made the Republic of to-day possible.</p> <p>Although to-day marks an important step in Eire\u2019s national evolution the celebrations are being taken calmly by most people and coldly by some. The public buildings \u2013 except for the Post Office \u2013 are not decorated; the Dublin Corporation thought it inappropriate to spend even the product of a farthing rate on marking an occasion of which so many members disapproved. No flags have appeared on Trinity College, but the tricolour is flying almost everywhere else with the Papal Flag and the banners of the four provinces \u2013 so even Ulster is playing a part.</p> <p>There have been rumours that some young extremists might put up a counter-demonstration to mark disapproval of partition but even this anti-partitionist feeling is not being very loudly proclaimed, and the only anti-British slogans to be seen are chalked up in Irish on the walls. They call for an end to the use of the English language. The celebrations have also incurred the disapproval of those who are less than Unionists but who are still aware of what Eire gained from the slender Commonwealth connection. This feeling is strong but not organised. Between these two wings there are the people, probably the majority, who do not care one way or the other.</p> <p>The atmosphere is, then, not exactly jubilant here, and if it were not for the marching soldiers, the artillery salutes, and the fireworks to-day would pass like any other Bank Holiday and certainly not like a national festival</p> <p><strong>Fianna Fail stands aloof</strong><br>It might have been a different matter if the Fianna Fail party were not withholding its support, and if Mr De Valera were at the saluting base (he is taking no part in the celebrations). But the Coalition Government has not found it easy to work up enthusiasm for a constitutional change which was not part of its mandate from the voters in the last general election, and which, it has been suggested, would hardly have got a majority in the country if it had been put to the test of a referendum; even the 1937 Constitution, which was Republican in everything but name, was not passed by an overwhelming majority, and things have changed in Western Europe since then.</p> <p>But to-day the political differences may sink below the surface for an hour, and the achievement of the 1916 leaders may be remembered in its historic rather than in its party context. They and not the present Government will be in the minds of to-day\u2019s crowds \u2013 at least among the people who have any sense of Ireland\u2019s past and what it was that Pearse, Connolly, MacDonagh, and the others died for.</p> <h2>Truncheons out in Tyrone</h2> <p>18 Apri 1949</p> <p>In the village of Carrickmore, County Tyrone (Northern Ireland), 500 young men who had assembled yesterday for a Gaelic football match were warned by the police that they could not march in procession. In spite of this they went to a field and sang \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Song\u201d and were hoisting the Republican flag when the police dispersed them with truncheons. Several men were injured.</p> <h2>Editorial: The Republic</h2> <p>18 April 1949</p> <p>The new chapter in Irish history begins to-day without interrupting the flow of life more than a birthday or a silver wedding. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/41\">The Republic of Ireland Act</a> and the consequent withdrawal of Eire from the Commonwealth are generally regretted here, but more regretted than resented; one does not have to be very deeply versed in Irish affairs to know something of the inner compulsions which move her statesmen. Though the struggle which made the Republic possible ended nearly thirty years ago and its echoes have died away, to-day\u2019s leaders took their share in it as young men; it was for most of them the great, the formative, experience of their lives; they found themselves moved by irresistible currents of courage and generous idealism.</p> <blockquote> <p>All changed, changed utterly; <br>A terrible beauty is born.</p> </blockquote> <p>Such a struggle generates deeper passions than served to start it, and these have run too deep to be satisfied with an outcome which might have been welcome enough if it had been more easily reached. They have run their course at last. The companions and disciples of Pearse and Connolly may turn now with a clear conscience to the not less pressing social problems of their country, and to its proper place among the free nations of the world. It will be well if they can apply to these the same spirit of selfless service which moved their old leaders at Easter, 1916.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/16/united-ireland-brexit-irish-unification-back-on-agenda\">Talk of a united Ireland is rife. But is it a fantasy?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Dublin takes it calmly: a new beginning?</h2> <p>From Our Special Correspondent<br>19 April 1949</p> <p><em>Dublin, Monday<br></em>A large but apparently rather subdued crowd watched the military parade in Dublin to mark the official birth of the Irish Republic to-day. The only part of the ceremony which seemed to make any emotional impression on the spectators was the hoisting of the tricolour on the General Post Office in O\u2019Connell Street, where thirty-three years ago the Easter rising began. When the flag went up it was greeted with cheers and waving hats and small banners. There was for the moment a touch of the fervency which broke out when the guns were fired at midnight on O\u2019Connell Bridge.</p> <p>But the parade which followed the flag-raising, put on with the utmost military efficiency, seemed to leave the spectators unmoved, though they roused themselves to a few ragged cheers and handclaps when the naval detachment marched past with a decided swagger. This does not mean that Dublin was not enjoying the parade; it seems to be a characteristic of an Irish crowd that although it enjoys the pomp and circumstance of soldiering and watches with an expert eye it will not rise to the occasion by throwing metaphorical caps over imaginary windmills.</p> <p><strong>A brave display</strong><br>Even a regimental sergeant major of the Brigade of Guards could not have found much fault with the turnout and drill of the troops, and he might well have searched for a superlative to describe the smartness of the presidential guard of honour of officer cadets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eac692c12bef0066f64015a3e6f36b122cc331b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac692c12bef0066f64015a3e6f36b122cc331b3/0_0_1672_2048/816..jpg\" alt=\"Ireland\u2019s president Sean O\u2019Kelly reviewing the guard of honour on Easter Sunday, Ireland\u2019s independence day.\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland\u2019s president Sean O\u2019Kelly reviewing the guard of honour on Easter Sunday, Ireland\u2019s independence day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Burrows/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sean-T-OKelly\">President O\u2019Kelly </a>sat on his stand in front of the Post Office surrounded by the Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished guests. who had arrived in a procession of unusually democratic appearance. The top hat, the cocked hat, the trilby and the cloth cap marched together; the shining dress uniform of the soldier (and even of the senior policeman) walked with the academic robe, the municipal gown, and the well-worn lounge suit \u2013 and there were, of course, priests of various orders in black clerical suits or the brown habits and sandals of the friars.</p> <p>There was no single figure to catch the imagination of the crowd, though there was a ripple of applause for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Cosgrave\">Mr Cosgrave</a> and an affectionate cheer for Alderman \u201cAlfie\u201d Byrne, Dublin\u2019s most famous ex-Lord Mayor. The President and Taoiseach were received with due respect, but it was difficult not to think what might have happened if Mr De Valera had changed his mind and turned up at the last minute. It was not so much Hamlet without the Prince as a large and loyal family without any father \u2013 but perhaps it is a virtue of the republican idea that there is no individual on whom the crowd can fix its eyes and swoon.</p> <p>After the ceremonies the Taoiseach held a press conference in the main hail of the post office \u2013 the hall which was the nerve-centre of the Easter rising \u2013 in which he said nothing which has not been said often before on the subject of partition and of the longing (south of the border) for a united Ireland. It was not an occasion for profound statements of policy, but later in the day in a broadcast Mr Costello said what must have been in the minds of many Irishmen to-day:</p> <blockquote> <p>We have put ourselves apart but not cut ourselves adrift from our former association with the great nations of the Commonwealth. We have severed the formal links but have not sundered the intangible bonds that exist between us. We hope for a closer and more harmonious association, based on community of interests and common ideals, than could have ever existed from formal ties.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>This is an edited extract.</em></p> <h2>Atlantic Pact and partition</h2> <p>Chicago, April 18</p> <p>Mr Sean MacBride, Foreign Minister of Eire, said here to-night that if Ireland joined the Atlantic Pact while partitioned she would almost certainly face the threat of a civil war in the event of a crisis.</p> <p>Ireland was in complete agreement with the objects of the Atlantic Pact, but had not joined it because it included a military alliance. This was an insuperable obstacle because some of the Irish counties were occupied by British forces. There were also strategic objections, for only a single central authority, supported by the decisive majority of the population could undertake Ireland\u2019s defence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Click to read.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/48179562/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;display:block;&quot; target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?id=259412722&amp;width=700&amp;height=340&amp;crop=879_280_3489_2015&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1586264980&amp;h=cce304c0fee6f91609a368527065a09e&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;font: 13px helvetica, sans-serif; color: #747474;padding: 4px 0;max-width: 700px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  The Guardian, 19 April 1949.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Click to read.</figcaption> </figure>",

On Tuesday, with the US death toll exceeding 12,000, he unleashed a tirade at the WHO, even though it raised the alarm in January, after which he made statements downplaying it and comparing it to the common flu.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been wrong about a lot of things,\u201d Trump said at the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cAnd they had a lot of information early and they didn\u2019t want to \u2013 they seemed to be very China centric\u201d \u2013 implying that the WHO had toed the line of Beijing\u2019s early efforts to minimise the scale of the outbreak.</p> \n<p>Shaking his head peevishly, he added: \u201cThey called it wrong, they called it wrong. They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know. So we\u2019ll be looking into that very carefully and we\u2019re going to put a hold on money spent<strong> </strong>[sic] to the WHO.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a very powerful hold on it and we\u2019re going to see. It\u2019s a great thing if it works but when they call every shot wrong, it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p> \n<p>But soon after, Trump was asked if the middle of a pandemic was the time to suspend money for the WHO. \u201cNo, maybe not,\u201d he replied, backtracking from his earlier remark. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to do it but we\u2019re going to look at.\u201d</p> \n<p>A reporter interjected: \u201cYou did say that \u2013\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump retorted: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, I said we\u2019re going to look at it. We\u2019re going to investigate it, we\u2019re going to look at it. But we will look at ending funding, yeah, because you know what, they called it wrong, and if you look back over the years even, everything seems to be very biased toward China. That\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> \n<p>The WHO declared Covid-19 a public health emergency on 30 January, nearly a month before Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d, and proclaimed: \u201cOne day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle - it will disappear.\u201d He eventually declared a national emergency on 13 March.</p> \n<p>Trump has long been sceptical about multinational organisations.

Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>Why is Trump touting it?</strong></p> <p>Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p> <p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T22:45:23.093Z\">at 11.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8cff588f08008f0919edd3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T22:37:08.967Z\">11.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump is again touting hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, which has not yet been proven effective against the coronavirus. </p> <p>The repeated a story about a Democratic state lawmaker who credits hydroxychloroquine and Trump for her recovery from Covid-19. \u201cI really think it\u2019s a great thing to try, just based on what I know,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not a doctor.

For three weeks, I had been quarantined in my apartment in DC-- away from everyone, including my family, who has been home in Miami. It has not been an easy journey. There were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return. Thankfully, I never experienced shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or issues with my heart. I treated my symptoms with Tylenol and a lot of rest. I want to share my experience to emphasize the seriousness of this virus and reiterate that you should continue to follow CDC and local health guidelines, including social distancing. I have no idea how, when, or where I was exposed to the virus, despite being extremely careful and constantly washing and sanitizing my hands. On Sunday, after being deemed Coronavirus-free by my doctor, I was able to reunite with my family in Miami. While still a little weak, I feel well. I applied to donate my plasma to help those suffering from #COVID19 infections. If you have also recovered from the virus, I encourage you to sign up to donate\u2014it could save a life. I reiterate my profound gratitude to the nurses, scientists, doctors, first responders, our military, and all the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic. We will always be thankful for their heroism, sacrifice, courage, and dedication.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/repmariodb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart</a> (@repmariodb) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-04-07T18:20:58+00:00\">Apr 7, 2020 at 11:20am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Congressman <strong>Mario Diaz-Balart </strong>said he has reunited with his family in Miami after spending three weeks in Washington as he recovered from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt has not been an easy journey,\u201d the congressman wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cThere were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return.

They show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing loudly by late January, at a time when the president was consistently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">downplaying</a> the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p>The memos, <strong>first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-navarro-deaths-coronavirus-memos-january-da3f08fb-dce1-4f69-89b5-ea048f8382a9.html\">Axios</a></strong>, were written by Navarro on 29 January and 23 February. The first memo, composed on the day Trump set up a White House coronavirus task force, gave a worst-case scenario of the virus killing more than half a million Americans.</p> <p>According to the Times, it said: \u201cThe lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil. This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d</p> <p>The second memo went even further, predicting that a Covid-19 pandemic, left unchecked, could kill 1.2m Americans and infect as many as 100m.</p> <p>This was not the first time Trump and his White House team were warned that the virus had the potential to devastate the US and needed to be dealt with quickly and firmly. Senior scientists, epidemiologists, and health emergency experts in the US and around the world delivered that message clearly early on in the crisis, only for Trump to continue belittling the scale of the threat which he compared falsely to the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/24/trump-again-downplays-coronavirus-by-comparing-it-seasonal-flu-its-not-fair-comparison/\">seasonal flu</a>.</p> <p>But the emergence of the memos from such a senior aide within the White House will make it much more difficult for Trump to claim \u2013 as he has done on <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/30/trump_on_coronavirus_nobody_could_have_predicted_something_like_this.html\">multiple occasions</a> \u2013 that nobody was able to predict the severity of the disease. As the pandemic has swept across the country, the president has come under mounting criticism for having done too little, too late in response, leading to mass shortages of diagnostic testing, protective gear for frontline health workers and ventilators for the very sick.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e8c5ca98f082890417705fa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T11:34:58.917Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning\u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US.
